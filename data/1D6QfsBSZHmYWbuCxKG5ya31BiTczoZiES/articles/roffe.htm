      The application of the principles of one science into another is
      often neglected. Today we have a massive and growing volume of
      experimentally proven information that certainly does not always
      find its every application. In the real world, we can work from
      scientific theory, through experimentation, into an engineered
      result, but just as often we work via reverse engineering, from
      the result back into the origin. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      To view and contemplate the entire known electromagnetic spectrum
      as a whole, and in terms of music and acoustics, or of color
      theory, is not a new concept. It has found expression in the
      “music of the spheres” and other fanciful philosophies. The new
      concept here is to actually delineate the considerable volume of
      information about the vibration rates of all things in their
      various <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; states, and simply see if there is a
      pattern. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




      There is a pattern and a grand one. An apparently never-ending
      symphony on a cosmic scale, arranged in fifty or more octaves,
      literally and constantly forms, maintains, and destroys the
      universe. Various octaves both above and below the fundamental red
      alpha-line vibration of hydrogen are the constants of proton spin
      and precession, mitochondrial vibration, as well as the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Earth’s fundamental resonance, and a
      score of other octaves with applications in every field of the
      sciences. Significant harmonics of these hydrogen octaves
      determine calcium, sodium, and other&nbsp; ion vibration
      frequencies, the fluorescence of metals and more, in a pattern
      related to the periodic table. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




      Today, we have statistical demonstration of at least some of the
      principles of harmonics and multivariant analysis, which are
      identical with those of acoustics and music. The twelve-fold
      division of phenomena into fields or realms is very popular among
      all cultures, because twelve is the most harmonically practical
      way to divide the circle. We have twelve notes in the chromatic
      scale, twelve months and signs, and twelve meridians and twelve
      categories of medicines in the traditional Chinese medical system.
      In the probability theory of multivariant analysis there are
      “some-teen” variables or constants possible, other values being
      determined from that limited number. Likewise we see, almost
      universally, five primary protagonists active within the
      twelve-fold&nbsp; field, and seven, or perhaps sometimes nine,
      total protagonists counting lesser ones. Thus the five or seven
      notes, planets, metals, days, electron levels, or particles. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




      If we take a good look -- and listen -- at the whole of
      manifestation, and apply the principles of acoustics and music,
      and of the color wheel, the grand pattern that emerges is
      self-evident. More than this, a possible explanation of a medium
      of transmission of a universal electrogravitational influence, as
      a plenum far more fundamental than an ether, becomes apparent.
      With this realization a whole new understanding of physics also
      emerges, with awesome possibilities. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;" align="left">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <b>Some Harmonic Resonance Researches</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Albert
      Szent-Gyorgi, the famous Vitamin C researcher, published the
      frequencies of light under which pharmacologically or
      nutritionally active substances fluoresced, in the early 1960s. He
      found&nbsp; that all stimulants fluoresced red, sedatives blue or
      violet, and so forth. The earlier researches of Royal Rife,
      although popularly misconceived today, supported these findings,
      that different&nbsp; substances and organisms have specific color
      or frequency associations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toftness and
      other researchers in the 1970s found that specific points in the
      bodies of plants and animals, and specifically in human patients,
      emitted specific wavelengths of microwaves, for&nbsp; example 69.5
      gigahertz, and that these frequencies changed in specific ways, in
      states of different diseases and injuries. Although the Toftness
      device has been exposed as unscientific, that should not discredit
      the findings regarding microwave frequencies. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In other
      words, every part of every body has a “color” which is in octave
      relationship with the red to violet spectrum. Although not
      literally red or yellow or green, the “color” is in harmonic
      relations to the visible color spectrum just as notes of music are
      in octave or fourth or fifth or other relationship to each other.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Geometric
        Structural Basis of Harmonic Resonance of Cosmos</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By dividing
      the circle of the plane of existence, and the circles of the
      properties of the substances within it, we can arrive at the
      harmonic basis of all phenomena. This is the principle of
      harmonics, expressed in a theoretical system of causality. In this
      theory of causality, there are certain basic principles. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All ellipses
      can be expressed as apparent circles, not only visually but also
      mathematically. Likewise, all spherical trigonometry of three
      dimensions can, in some applications, be further reduced to the
      two dimensions of greatest movement, and even further to only one
      dimension of greatest movement. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
      geometry, taken alone, lends itself to qualitative variation as a
      pure result of form. Further qualitative variables can be
      expressed in a matrix of nine, twelve, or sixteen variables. The
      electron levels, planets, organs, or archetypal characters form
      these kinds of matrices. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The primary
      circle of existence spirals constantly through coordinates of
      space and time, and it contains within itself innumerable
      subharmonic spirals. These spiraling ellipses can be expressed
      mathematically, and reduced to apparent circles, in two dimensions
      or one. This reduction can only be made because, by a considerable
      magnitude, the movement is greatest in only that one dimension. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we reduce
      to one dimension for ease of mathematical application, we have an
      infinite circle in the abstract. The geometry of the system gives
      us several natural zero points derived from the forms of the
      various subharmonic spirals, and where they intersect with the
      primary plane. These zero or reference points determine the
      equinoctial points and the solstitial points of the seasons of the
      year, as well as describe the bonding points of the electron
      levels and electron probability distributions. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Zero
      Reference Points have been observed to have properties of their
      own, relating to what happens in physics with the seasonal changes
      of the year. In the dominant&nbsp; northern hemisphere, spring
      starts the warming cycle, autumn counterbalances by starting the
      cooling cycle, summer receives maximum light and warmth, and
      winter receives the least. All the&nbsp; intermediate points on
      the circle have their own qualitative properties which can be
      expressed mathematically as degrees, and they are the result
      entirely of their geometric angular weather-dependent relationship
      to the four directions established by the Zero Reference Points.
      The twelve most important intermediate points form the
      Multivariant Harmonic Matrix Values or MVHs. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The octave of
      the Color Wheel lends itself very easily and obviously to
      association with the circle of the seasons, as in the chart below.
      Note the visual spectrum in a rainbow is not equal to the
      psychological sense of color. The yellow and blue regions have
      much more space on the rainbow! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 1:
      Frequency of infrared/visible red boundary and its octaves in all
      regions of the electromagnetic spectrum = vernal equinox and first
      point of Triple Warmer meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 2:
      Frequency of red-orange and its octaves = midspring and first
      point of Gall Bladder meridian. Quincunx relation to autumn/green.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 3:
      Frequency of yellow-orange (“peach/pink”) and its octaves = late
      spring and first point of Lung meridian. Quincunx relation to
      winter/sky blue. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 4:
      Frequency of purest lightest yellow (“white”) and its octaves =
      summer solstice and first point of Stomach meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 5:
      Frequency of golden yellow and its octaves = midsummer and first
      point of Heart meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 6:
      Frequency of chartreuse/olive green and its octaves = late summer
      and first point of Small Intestine meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 7:
      Frequency of deeper leaf green and first point of darkening
      (“black”), and its octaves = autumnal equinox and first point of
      Kidney meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 8:
      Frequency of deep aqua and its octaves = midautumn and first point
      of Heart Protector (Sex/Circulation) meridian. Quincunx relation
      to spring/Blood Red. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 9:
      Frequency of blue-green and its octaves = late autumn and first
      point of Liver meridian. Quincunx relation to fiery orange-red. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 10:
      Frequency of pure deep sky or ice blue = winter solstice and first
      point of Large Intestine meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 11:
      Frequency of deep blue violet and its octaves = midwinter and
      first point of Spleen meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 12:
      Frequency of indigo/magenta and its octaves = late winter and
      first point of Bladder meridian. Quincunx relation to
      autumn/green. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus also,
      every point on the ecliptic has a corresponding frequency in
      octave relationship to the visible light spectrum. This reasoning
      can be further extended to include the entire electromagnetic <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; spectrum as well as the auditory
      spectrum, which spans several octaves of sound vibrations. For
      many years I have used a system which gives the F# pentatonic
      scale or “black keys only” scale <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for the fundamental tone scale of the
      planet Earth, corresponding to winter and the North direction. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course,
      objectively speaking, the true nature of things is a chromatic
      untempered scale! That means that every possible note, like a
      slide guitar or a trombone can make, is possible. Further, in <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actuality, the system also must be
      modulated to be applicable to objective reality. The required
      modulation factor, long researched by Heleus and others, will be
      discussed later. Without the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modulation factor, interesting and
      relevant music can be devised, but the objective means to
      manipulate matter for good or ill remains, perhaps
      serendipitously, elusive. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, the
      seasons are in reality Multivariant Harmonic Matrix Values,
      expressions of qualitative values in terms of quantities, as are
      all numbers which can be expressed in a <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; circle or octave. Thus also are the
      electron energy levels, the elements of the periodic table, the
      notes of any musical scale, indeed, the entire electromagnetic
      spectrum. In this book the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multivariant Harmonic Matrix Values are
      expressed as MVH 1 – 12. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every one of
      these systems is circular and each of them has a zero point. For
      the seasons the MVH 1 is the Vernal Equinox. For the elements as
      well as the colors the zero point or MVH 1 is <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hydrogen and the red of the
      Hydrogen-alpha Line. Although we have assumed that the zero point
      or MVH 1 of the musical scale is the note A, and often the note of
      C is used as such by <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musicians, in reality of course a
      “sliding scale” of MVH values is used, as musicians transpose
      keys. In fact, the real Primary Multivariant Harmonic Matrix Value
      in music, the real universal <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fundamental tone, is a slightly sharped B
      note. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although
      other harmonics can be used, the twelvefold system is by far the
      most useful and finds its application in music, the months and the
      periodic table; and this sytem of twelve divisions is far <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from arbitrary. Thus there are eleven
      other MVH values in these octave systems, and within the twelve
      there are also generally around seven MVH values that are most
      active at any given time. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The
        Octave of Visible Light</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to
      the accompanying chart, we see that the frequency response of the
      retina and visual cortex ranges from sensitivity to approximately
      420 nanometers (4200 angstroms) to sensitivity to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; approximately 700 nanometers (7000
      angstroms). The frequency response follows a bell curve with peak
      response at approximately 560 nanometers (5600 angstroms). Thus
      the bell curve <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; covers a sensitivity range of twice 140
      nanometers or 280 nanometers total. This is the “octave” of human
      visual sensitivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The obvious
      question is why is this less than a full octave? One might expect
      that the range would be from 420 to 840. Or to correlate more
      closely with the auditory spectrum, perhaps even <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from 440 – the musical note of A below
      middle C – to 880. One would expect something close to a doubling
      of wavelengths (halving of frequencies), perhaps the other example
      of 350 to 700. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most plausible could be the range of
      385 nanometers to 770. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, the
      musical analogy is impertinent here because the 440 number is
      purely a coincidence. The fact is that the region of 600 to 700
      nanometers is the region of longer wavelength and thus red <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (bordering on infrared), and the region
      of 420 to 500 nanometers is the violet (bordering on ultraviolet)
      region. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we
      must remember that these numbers follow curves of doubling to
      represent octaves! This is a key to understanding, something that
      neither the esotericists nor the physicists have yet <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seemed to fully grasp. In other words, we
      cannot think in terms of linear numbers alone. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From 770
      nanometers down to 560 is 210, then from 560 down to 385 is 175!
      This leaves a discrepancy of 35 nanometers over an octave range.
      An analogous problem is encountered in music <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and in all other fields of knowledge and
      endeavour that use octaves. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is my view
      that Gurdjieff alone explained this problem in his theory of the
      octave or the Heptaparaparshinokh, the Octave or the Seven, in
      interaction with the Triad or Triamazikamno in a field <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of omnipresent Okidanokh. He explained
      that we must understand the universe and the octave in terms of
      one or two “shocks” within each octave accounting for the “extra”
      frequencies. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A
      cosmological system that addresses these problems also provides a
      basis and nexus for reconciliation of the fundamental question(s)
      of unity, duality, trinity (we are getting almost theological <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; here?), and three elements (tridosha),
      four elements, five elements, twelve to seventeen variables, and
      so forth. This leads ultimately to the questions of multivariant
      analysis and number matrix <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; theory, and its applications in the
      analysis of vortices. Everything we are dealing with here is in
      reality a vortex when viewed from the point of view of time! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any theorist
      who fails to reconcile theory with observable phenomena is
      vulnerable to serious criticism. A theoretical framework for
      microcosm/macrocosm relationships that does not address <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this issue is not keeping up with the
      times, so to speak. In other words, if the system is too neat and
      perfect it is probably a purely theoretical system, sounding good
      but in real life not working, or <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps working too approximately. More
      on these “disturbing” inconsistencies later. For now let us assume
      that somewhere “outside” the 700 nanometer point is the frequency
      and wavelength <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponding to the vernal equinox and
      thus the first point of the Triple Warmer meridian, and that
      somewhere “outside” the 420 nanometer point is the frequency and
      wavelength corresponding <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to the last point of the Bladder
      meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please bear
      with me and do not immediately object that Triple Warmer and
      Bladder do not connect sequentially! From the radial pulse
      positions’ perspective they DO connect! Recall that Triple <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Warmer (or Temperature Regulator) radial
      pulse is posited at the highest, most rarified point on the right
      wrist; it is considered a “solid” organ. Also recall that the
      Bladder radial pulse is posited <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at the highest and most rarified point on
      the left wrist, and that it is considered a “hollow” organ. I am
      fully aware that most practitioners and theorists in acupuncture
      and meridian studies will <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adhere to the classic five-element
      “Traditional Chinese Medicine” of the Yellow Emperor and his
      followers. The object of this treatise, however, is to proceed
      from a fresh perspective based on <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; modern physics and physiology of
      harmonics. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will
      correlate whenever possible with Traditional Chinese Medicine
      five-element theory. We will also examine Tibetan, Ayurvedic,
      Cherokee and other element systems with a view toward <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some kind of synthesis. But ultimately we
      will develop a new concept based more upon objectively verifiable
      knowledge developed in the past few decades in the fields of
      physics and <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; physiology. Many TCM practitioners will
      vehemently oppose this and will stridently object that it is mere
      speculation. Only those who have studied multiple systems with a
      view toward a deeper <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; understanding will be able to follow my
      reasoning without reactionary objections. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ultimately,
      any new theoretical system must be evaluated scientifically, and
      perhaps one may recall that the experimental method of controlled
      studies must be applied. Most fields of knowledge <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within medicine of any kind have not met
      this standard, least of all traditional medicine systems, but
      perhaps there can be developed a basis for such a truly objective
      evaluation. I am at this point <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only suggesting a framework for such
      experimental observations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also please
      bear with me for now when I state that each octave is inversible
      within itself, and that each perfect fourth and fifth is also a
      potential octave within itself. This gives us a framework for <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; possibly understanding the “internal
      signs” of harmonic astrology, and the interrelationships of the
      various meridian points, in relation to music. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it not a
      supreme irony that in so many ways the art of music, and the
      science of acoustics, are more scientific and objectively
      verifiable than medicine or many other fields in the sciences? <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, music is more undeniably
      emotional than any other medium; we do not know exactly “why”
      minor keys sound sad or plaintive, why certain musical pieces
      sound courageous or sexual <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or humorous, but we all do agree that
      they do. We agree about these things more than we do about almost
      any other field of human endeavour! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let us return
      to the 560 nanometer point, the middle point of the bell curve of
      human visual sensitivity to light, the point of maximum
      sensitivity. Soon we will look at other usable reference points, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usable numerical constants, in the
      electromagnetic spectrum, in the auditory spectrum as well, and in
      the other spectra or theoretical spectra of the universe,
      including that of gravity. We will <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; examine the spectra of the stars, as well
      as the spectra of the reflected/emitted light from the planets and
      moons. We will examine the frequencies of the nerve systems of
      humans and other <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; animals, as well as the frequencies
      emitted by living organisms of various kinds, with special
      attention to pathogens as well as beneficial organisms. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will look
      at the frequencies of the various elements, the metals and other
      groups, and of the various chemical compounds, inorganic and
      organic, that are significant to living organisms, with <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special attention to various types of
      toxins as well as the compounds essential to nutrition. We will
      examine the frequencies of the Northern Lights and other
      frequencies of the Earth itself. So <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; many have been looking so long for a
      “Unified Field Theory,” for a truly new paradigm, that the
      necessity for the numbers to speak for themselves has been
      forgotten! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall our
      opening references to the research of Dr Albert Szent-Gyorgi. He
      found that bioactive compounds fluoresced under specific
      wavelengths of light. Stimulants universally responded to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; various red wavelengths. Sedatives
      responded to various blue or violet colors. Further, each compound
      had its own color response. Nutritive substances were in the
      yellow region, that which <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; corresponds to the main spectrum of our
      Sun and the main spectrum of our visual systems’ sensitivity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is useful
      to refer here also to the various books of New Zealander Bruce
      Cathey, “Harmonic 695” and other works. He claimed to have
      discovered interesting fundamental frequencies in the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; field of the Earth itself while he was a
      pilot who had observed unusual aerospace phenomena. Although his
      conclusions are difficult to follow, the basic theoretical
      foundation we are laying is well <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elaborated by him. All this is the realm
      of the controversial HAARP technology, although I rather doubt
      that the HAARP researchers have as yet elaborated the
      electromagnetic spectrum <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adequately to understand the broader
      picture. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If we take
      the 560 nanometer point of brilliant yellow-white light as a
      constant, we can apply the octave principle and arrive at a
      complete tabulation of octaves in harmonic relation to that <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency. Thus: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17.5&nbsp;
      nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 35 <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 140 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 280 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 560&nbsp; nanometers approximate midpoint
      of visible light <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1120 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2240 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4480 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8960 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17920 <br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 71680 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 143360 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 286720 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 573440&nbsp; nanometers </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so forth
      “ad infinitum.” Here we go “up” only ten orders of wavelength and
      “down” only five. It will be necessary for us later to adjust
      these scales of octave correspondences, and to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; account for the “shocks” and where to
      place them, as well as adapt these octaves to other observable
      constants and to the “wheel of time” and of the seasons, and to
      the meridians. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      mathematics for the octaves of 400 (violet) and 700 (red)
      nanometer visual sensitivity boundaries is easier to picture: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.5 ---
      21.875 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25 --- 43.75 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 50 --- 87.5 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 --- 175 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 200 --- 350 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 400 nanometers --- 700 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 800 --- 1400 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1600 --- 2800 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3200 --- 5600 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6400 --- 11200 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12800 --- 22400 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 25600 --- 44800 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 51200 --- 89600 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 102400 --- 179200 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 204800 --- 358400 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 409600 --- 716800 </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reader
      will probably notice the numerical correspondences of the 700
      series with the 560 series. Perhaps this is a basis for some kind
      of inner logic within the system. However, for now, let <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; us regard all these numbers as arbitrary
      until we further establish our constants. When we have established
      a complete field of all the relevant constants then we can test
      our numbers in the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; laboratory, with the spectroscope and the
      oscilloscope, and then we can test our numbers clinically. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>The
        Harmony of the Human Body</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For
      twentyfive years this practitioner has been developing and
      practicing an integrated system of twelvefold meric chiropractic
      spinal, cranial and extremity articulation corrections correlated
      with <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; traditional Chinese medicine, Tibetan
      medicine, Native American traditional medicine and Ayur Veda with
      a view towards finding the underlying common principle. The human
      body is the same <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in all these systems, and yet there is
      relatively little held in common by them. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not find
      myself in agreement with all that is presented in the field of
      light therapy, but the body of clinical evidence suggests that
      there is definitely some basis for further research. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we can
      begin to rectify the harmonic correspondences of the seasonal
      twelvefold division of the ecliptic macrocosm that we call the
      astrological signs, and correlate these signs with the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; microcosm of the cell and the body of
      living creatures, based on basic sciences research into the
      fundamental frequencies of light and preferential absorption of
      wavelengths into the meridians. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember that
      the seasons of the year are rooted fundamentally in cycles of
      differing degrees and angles of warmth and light. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that the
      actual size of living cells corresponds exactly with the
      wavelengths of visible light, in other words, living cells
      themselves range from 350 to 700 nanometers in diameter. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recall the
      apparent coincidence of the one-decimal point difference of the
      700 (red) nanometer series with the 560 (brilliant
      yellow-white-green) nanometer series. Taking this together with
      the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fact that many people can actually see
      further into the ultraviolet spectrum than others, measurably as
      far as 350 nanometers, we have established a basis for using the
      octave of 350 to 700 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nanometers as being the most usable
      octave to correlate with the meridians and the seasons. This gives
      us a scale of correspondences that is very usable though
      acknowledgably remains clinically <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as yet unproven. However, it is far more
      useful than the various arbitrary frequencies used in “radionics”
      which serious clinicians consider scientifically unfounded.
      Perhaps future clinical <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; researches will prove these
      correspondences. The frequencies of light found to be clinically
      efficacious by various light therapists can be clinically
      correlated. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we now
      have the following twelvefold scale of wavelengths: </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 1. Vernal
      Equinox --- Triple Warmer --- approx.700 to approx. 671 nanometers
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 2. Midspring --- Gall Bladder ---
      approx. 671 to approx. 642 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 3. Late Spring --- Lung --- approx.
      642 to approx. 613 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 4. Summer Solstice --- Stomach ---
      approx. 612 to approx. 583 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 5. Midsummer --- Heart --- approx.
      583 to approx. 554 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 6. Late Summer --- Small Intestine
      --- approx. 554 to approx. 525 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 7. Autumnal Equinox --- Kidney ---
      approx. 525 to approx. 496 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 8. Midautumn --- Heart Protector ---
      approx. 496 to approx. 467 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 9. Late Autumn --- Liver --- approx.
      467 to approx. 438 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 10. Winter Solstice --- Large
      Intestine --- approx. 438 to approx. 409 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 11. Midwinter --- Spleen --- approx.
      409 to approx. 380 nanometers <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MVH 12. Late Winter --- Bladder ---
      approx. 380 to approx. 350 nanometers </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This
      researcher would also be so bold and iconoclastic as to suggest
      that perhaps the entry and exit points of the meridians should be
      re-evaluated. When you look at the emerging pattern you <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will understand the reasons for this
      suggestion. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fundamental
Frequencies






        of the Earth and the Sun</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will now
      attempt to find the correlative basis for a number of significant
      octave relationships based on the terrestrial Schumann Resonance
      and the solar hydrogen-alpha fundamental <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Schumann
      Resonance consists of a “chord” of subaudible infrasound extreme
      low frequencies of the Earth itself resonating with the uppermost
      atmosphere. Its fundamental tone or tonic note <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oscillates slightly around the frequency
      of 7.8 Hertz (cycles per second). It also has overtones that
      oscillate around the frequencies of 14, 21, 26, 33, 39, and 45
      cycles per second. Although <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; these are seven “notes,” they do not
      really form an octave, but are rather ranged in from five to seven
      cycles per second steps. These frequencies can be correlated with
      the auditory spectrum <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the visible light spectrum. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      fundamental tone of 7.8 Hertz is reported to be in harmonic with
      the alpha brain wave frequency, thus should theoretically appear
      at some significant point in our meridian frequency wheel. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The octaves
      of 7.8 Hertz are 15.6, 31.2, 62.4, 124.8, 249.6, 499.2, 998.4,
      1996.8, 3993.6, and so on up through auditory sound and then into
      the electromagnetic spectrum. The frequencies <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of 246.9, 493.8, 987.6 and so forth are
      the note B in the even-tempered scale of music, thus the Schumann
      resonance is an ever so slightly sharped “B” note. Remember that B
      is correlated <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tentatively with the Lung meridian in our
      cosmology. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The frequency
      of 14 has octaves of 28, 56, 112, 224, 448, 896, 1792, 3584, 7168,
      and so forth. The frequencies of 220, 440, 880 and so forth are
      the musical note A, thus the first Schumann <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overtone is a slightly sharped “A” note.
      This tentatively correlates with the Temperature Regulator or
      Triple Warmer meridian and the vernal equinox. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second
      Schumann overtone of 21 has octaves of 42, 84, 168, 336, 672,
      1344, 2688, 5376, 10752, and so forth. The note of E is 329.6 and
      659.2 and the octaves thereof, and the note of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F is 349.2 and 698.4 and the octaves
      thereof. Note therefore that the second Schumann overtone is close
      to a third of the way up between E and F in the musical scale. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third
      Schumann overtone of 26 has octaves of 52, 104, 208, 416, 832,
      1664, 3328, 6656, 13312 and so forth. This is very close to G#,
      actually a very slightly flatted G sharp, because G <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sharp is 415.3, 830.6 and their octaves.
      This correlates tentatively with the Bladder meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fourth
      Schumann overtone is 33 and has octaves of 66, 132, 264, 528,
      1056, 2112, 4224, 8448, 16896, and so forth. This is only slightly
      sharper than the note C, 261.6 and 523.2 and <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; octaves, and thus tentatively correlates
      closely with the Stomach meridian and the summer solstice. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fifth
      Schumann overtone is 39 and has the octaves of 78, 156, 312, 624,
      1248, 2496, 4992, 9984, 19968, and so on. The note D# is 311.1 and
      622.2 and their octaves, thus there is a <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; close correlation between autumn and the
      Kidney meridian. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth or
      highest generally reported Schumann overtone is 45 Hertz which has
      the octaves of 90, 180, 360, 720, 1440, 2880, 5760, 11520, 23040,
      and so forth. This is about halfway <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; between the musical notes of F and F# in
      the musical scale, which have the frequencies of 349.2, 698.4 etc.
      and 370, 740 etc. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To summarize,
      we have the following Schumann “notes” and their tentative
      correlations with the meridians. We say tentative because we do
      not yet know if there is any objective basis for <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; correlating the seasons with the musical
      notes as we have done in our system. Nor, except for the clinical
      observations which have not yet been fully analyzed statistically,
      do we yet know <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; absolutely that there is a basis for
      correlating the seasons with the meridians. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.8 Hertz
      (249.6, 499.2) --- B natural (246.9, 493.8) difference = 2.7,5.4
      --- Lung --- Midspring <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14 Hertz (224, 448)&nbsp; --- A (220,
      440) difference = 4,8 --- Triple Warmer Vernal Equinox <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21 Hertz (336, 672) --- E “sharp” (E is
      329.6, 659.2) d = 6.4, 12.8 --- (Heart Protector/Liver – Midautumn
      / Late Autumn) <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26 Hertz (416, 832) --- G sharp (415.3,
      830.6) d = .7,1.4 --- Bladder Late Winter <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 33 Hertz (264, 528) --- C (261.6, 523.2)
      d = 2.4, 4.8 --- Stomach Summer Solstice <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 39 Hertz (312, 624) --- D sharp (311.1,
      622.2) d = .9, 1.8 --- Kidney&nbsp; Autumnal Equinox <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 45 Hertz (360, 720) --- F “double sharp”
      (F is 349.2 and 698.4, F# is 370 and 740) d = 10.8 or 10 ---
      (Liver/Large Intestine – Late Autumn / Winter Solstice) </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, we have
      a pentatonic scale of B, C, D#, G# and A, with the intermediate
      notes of E “halfsharp” and F “doublesharp.” This scale, although
      perhaps not comfortable to classically trained <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musicians and certainly not playable on
      the piano keyboard, might be a little more accessible to serious
      students of blues halfsharps, doublesharps and halfflats. It is
      even more accessible to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; students of the raga, of Northern Indian
      classical music, which uses many of these kinds of notes in its
      scales, and which also uses a tonic or fundamental around the note
      of B in the western <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; scale. This is the “raga of the Earth” in
      literal physics of vibrations. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The red
      hydrogen-alpha line is the most easily referenced of several
      solar/stellar emission frequencies in the visible light
      spectrum.&nbsp; There are also calcium, potassium and other
      visible light <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emissions. When we bring the high
      frequency of visible light down the octaves we can correlate it
      with notes of the auditory spectrum. The red hydrogen-alpha line
      has a wavelength of 656.3 <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nanometers, a deep red not too far from
      the approximate 700 nanometer boundary of visible red and
      infrared, or our tentative Vernal Equinox and first point of
      Triple Warmer. This wavelength is <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the same as .0000006563 meters. By
      doubling the wavelength we halve the frequency. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 21st
      octave of the hydrogen-alpha wavelength is approximately .6912
      meters, which is a frequency of 490 Hertz. Going back to our
      musical scale, 490 Hertz is a very slightly flatted B <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; natural note, and when we remember that
      we approximated our wavelengths for mathematical convenience, we
      note that this note is really even closer to natural B! Thus,
      surely beyond <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coincidence, the hydogen-alpha wavelength
      correlates very closely with the fundamental Schumann tonic
      frequency! Thus also the deep red of the hydrogen-alpha line
      establishes the note of B, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rather than A, as being the best starting
      point of the Vernal Equinox and the Triple Warmer meridian. Or
      should we leave it with the point of Late Spring and the Lung
      meridian? For now, let us <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; consider both arrangements as being
      potentially valuable. Both arrangements are of tremendous use in
      elaborating the unfolding cosmology of this “glass bead game.” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Fundamentals
of






        Universal Harmonic Resonance</b> </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every kind of
      energy, and every form of matter, vibrates at a specific signature
      complex of frequencies. Each organizational level of energy/matter
      interaction in the scalar potential matrix, from <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; particle to person to planet, adds
      specific frequencies to the signature chord. The signature chord
      can be modulated, within certain limits, according to variables of
      temperature or pressure, or <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other likewise vibratory effects, but
      normally remains in relative tuning. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some
      organizational levels of matter as known are particle, atom,
      molecule, crystal, organelle, cell, tissue, organ, and organism.
      There are other organizational levels. A particle has the simplest
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vibration, its spin and its precession,
      normally absolutely constant factors. The scalar potential matrix
      has certain constants or standing waves, which define spin and
      precession of particles, as <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; well as of planets. The constants of spin
      and precession determine the constants of inertia and gravitation.
      Mass is a specific numeric harmonic relationship to the
      spin/precession constant, and to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Schumann/hydrogen octave axis. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gravitation
      is assumed to be an attractive force by most people... even
      physicists. But today, many consider it to be a push rather than a
      pull, a centripetal force resultant from the sum total of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immense omnipresent centrifugal energy
      potential of the big bang. A massive object would shield the
      omnipresent centrifugal radiation from below, and thus there would
      always be a pressing <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; down from above. This downward pressure
      would, however, depend on the particle spin and precession of the
      object remaining in constant harmonic resonance with the
      omnipresent centrifugal <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; radiation, of which the hydrogen-alpha
      frequency is a primary manifestation. The omnipresent centrifugal
      radiation, the big bang, in over forty levels of octaves and
      harmonics, thus creates the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; localized centripetal constant known as
      gravity. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atoms and
      ions have their own characteristic vibratory rates, variable with
      temperature. Each cell has its own vibration rate which is related
      to its size and its color, the rates of its organelles, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; especially its mitochondria and nucleus,
      of the various ions and molecules, and of course always the
      fundamental frequencies of particle spin and precession. Thus a
      living organism has nine main <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; levels of vibration from particle to
      person, the individual human, or other higher organism, being able
      to generate another tenth level, and possibly beyond. This tenth
      level constitutes the individual <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; signature of a person. All the other nine
      levels in every person are virtually the same, a normal human
      species signature, although varying in health and disease. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Heretofore, the vital signs of a patient have been temperature,
      pulse, respiration rate, and blood pressure, all rates of
      vibration. Vital signs are normally in harmonic relation to each
      other, and to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Schumann/hydrogen fundamental. Now we
      know that there is a whole spectrum of vital signs of normal
      activity of organs, tissues, cells and organelles, in turn
      dependent on a spectrum of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; normal vibrations of crystals and
      colloids, molecules, atoms and particles. Some of these
      frequencies are known, many of them are conjectured about, but
      most of these frequencies are not <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; clearly established. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particle:
      frequencies of spin and precession. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Atom or Ion: frequency related to atomic
      weight, which is induced in the scalar constant by the sum total
      effect of the constituent particles and their geometry/color. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Molecule: frequency of molecular weight
      and geometry/color. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crystal or Colloid: frequency of
      crystalline or colloidal matrix geometry. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Organelle: frequency of primary chemical
      reaction(s) of organelle and color. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cell: frequency of size, geometry and
      color. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tissue, Organ, Organism: frequencies
      related to size, color and geometry as well as <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sum total of predominant frequencies
      of all the first six constituent levels. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The universe,
      the bang,&nbsp; would be a huge discordant chaos, were it not that
      most of these key vibrations are in harmonic relationship to each
      other. Indeed, as we shall examine, the most <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; important ones are in octaves, within two
      percent of accuracy. The majority of significant resonant
      frequencies in the next section, which fall into twelve or
      thirteen functional groups, are in octave <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; relationship to the Schumann Resonance
      and the Hydrogen-alpha Line, with numerous other interesting
      resonances as well. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the
      octaves above the Schumann Fundamental Resonance and below the
      Hydrogen-alpha Wavelength, as well as their harmonics, exhibit
      special resonance properties pertaining to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gravitation, cohesion of masses, ion
      resonance, proton precession, and zero point scalar technology. At
      the same time, these octaves and harmonics exhibit the same
      resonant properties at <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; various levels with human brain waves,
      cells of all organisms, mitochondria, and the physical body form.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some of the
      octaves are unremarkable at this stage of research, but may have
      hidden properties. The first octave above the Schumann
      Fundamental, the 25th suboctave of hydrogen, is less <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remarkable or has hidden properties. The
      second and third octaves are heard as deep and subaudible bass.
      The fourth, fifth, and sixth octaves (22nd, 21st, and 20th
      suboctaves of hydrogen) are <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ordinary audible sound octaves, of most
      music and voices. The audible but high frequency seventh octave
      (19th suboctave), the tenth and eleventh octaves (16th and 15th
      suboctaves), and the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; thirteenth through the twentieth octaves
      (13th through 6th suboctaves) each include resonant frequencies of
      numerous organisms in the Rife system. Most of these, with a few
      exceptions to be <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; noted, are not arranged in any octave or
      obvious harmonic pattern. There is either no harmonic pattern to
      most of these Rife frequencies, or their patterns will be
      discovered in the future. The <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22nd octave (4th suboctave) also is
      reported to affect microbial growth, as well as humans when in
      contact with an electrical ground. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Schumann
      Fundamental itself, and its second, third, sixth, eighth, ninth,
      twelfth, twenty-first, twenty-third, twenty-fourth and
      twenty-fifth octaves all exhibit remarkable resonance properties.
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are identical with the
      twenty-sixth, twenty-fourth, twenty-third, twentieth, eighteenth,
      seventeenth, fourteenth, fifth, third, second and first suboctaves
      of the Hydrogen-alpha frequency <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; equivalent. This pattern is itself a
      larger scale harmonic pattern as well. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout
      much of the complete spectrum, the previously mentioned two
      percent of deviation from an exact octave doubling is noted. The
      Schumann rate, actually a non-steady rather variable <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tone, is usually around two percent sharp
      to the lower octave of the absolutely constant Hydrogen-alpha
      Line. What causes this two percent variation? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps more
      interesting yet is that there are other areas of the spectrum,
      certain bandwidths, where all the key harmonic relationships line
      up nicely, only if we can shift the frequencies by two <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; percent. Again two percent! It is as if
      the entire universe is an immense, and immensely detailed,
      clockwork but everything is exactly two percent off! Actually, in
      some regions of bandwidth it is <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exactly one and one half percent. Why?
      Following are the twelve key harmonic relationships according to a
      hierarchy of octaves from the Schumann Resonance up through the
      Hydrogen <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suboctaves. Frequencies are listed in
      Hertz (cycles per second). In some entries the corresponding
      wavelength is given in meters or another equivalent. Most entries
      also give the corresponding <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; musical note, or Multivariant Harmonic
      (MVH) equivalent by extension of the octaves. </p>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7-8 Hz --- optimal human brain wave
      healing frequency </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most
      immediately significant resonant relationship is that of human
      brain waves with the Earth itself and its ionosphere. Although
      waking activity causes brain waves to become more rapid, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and thus resonate more with the higher
      overtones of the Schumann Resonance, the state of meditation
      gradually brings the brain waves down in tune with the Schumann
      Resonance fundamental <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; itself. This is actually a range of
      vibration only two octaves below normal human hearing sensitivity.
      This state of attunement thus puts the person into octave
      resonance not only with the Schumann <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fundamental subsonic vibration of the
      Earth, but also with the fundamental photonic vibration of the Sun
      and all other stars, the Hydrogen-alpha red light frequency, which
      is about forty octaves <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; higher. For some reason the Earth’s
      fundamental tone, although variable in pitch, is usually a bit
      “sharp” or higher in pitch compared to the lower octave of the
      Solar Hydrogen-alpha wavelength. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is large enough to be a significant
      difference; it would certainly be an audible pitch difference if
      it were in the audible range. It probably makes a difference in
      meditation if the brain waves are <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; attuned to the slower solar lower octave
      brain waves at around 7.65625 cycles per second. Experienced
      meditators know that unusual things can occur when this happens,
      although usually it just <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; means one has fallen asleep, and one’s
      brain waves “fall” well below seven cycles. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meditators
      also know that it is more difficult to train the brain to “sing on
      pitch” below the alpha frequency than it is above it in the beta
      range. Experienced meditators also report complete <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dissolution of consciousness and/or
      apparent reflexive increase of neuronal firing of brainwave
      frequencies back up into alpha or beta range when efforts to slow
      the brain toward seven cycles or <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below are made. The brain definitely
      usually avoids the seven cycle frequency range. The reported
      dissolution or de-aggregation of matter at seven cycles is
      reported from other harmonics <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; researchers but has not been
      independently confirmed. The Earth frequently vibrates at this
      ultralow frequency but not for sustained periods nor at any great
      amplitude. Similarly, the human brain <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cell membranes may vibrate at this
      frequency but usually only briefly as one is falling asleep. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout
      the octaves, there exists a discrepancy between the octaves of the
      high Hydrogen-alpha frequency and the low Schumann frequency. The
      difference at this level is 0.17375 Hertz, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the Schumann frequency slightly
      higher, but of course is proportionally greater in the higher
      frequency realms. This discrepancy is approximately two percent of
      the Hydrogen-alpha <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frequency, an error well within
      statistical significance. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The human
      brain waves and the Earth’s stronger harmonic overtones extend
      upward in frequency perhaps two octaves, almost up into audible
      sound. That is why it is almost true that one can <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear oneself think, or hear the music of
      the spheres. We certainly do hear the highest overtones which
      reach into audible range although they are very attenuated, very
      faint. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between these
      ranges of the subsonic and the audible are the resonance
      frequencies of ions, for example sodium at 33.33 Hertz, and
      calcium at 38.7 Hertz (cycles per second). Remarkably, the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sodium frequency is almost exactly the
      same as the fourth Schumann overtone, and the calcium ion vibrates
      at almost exactly the same tone as the fifth Schumann overtone.
      33.33 is also an <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; octave of early midspring if we accept
      the Hydrogen-alpha frequency as corresponding to the Vernal
      Equinox, and sodium and sulphate are considered to be the
      corresponding ions. Just as <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; elegantly, 38.7 is an octave of the
      Summer Solstice, and calcium and fluoride/chloride are considered
      to be the relevant ions. It will be interesting to see if
      resonance frequencies of the other ions <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; similarly match their attributes. If so,
      we would then expect the potassium ion to vibrate at a frequency
      within the ranges defined by the octaves of the Vertnal Equinox,
      Late Spring or Late <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summer. Magnesium would be within an
      octave of Midsummer, and we know that at least when in the ring of
      the chlorophyll molecule, doing its role in photosynthesis, it
      does indeed vibrate in <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resonance with visible light at peak
      frequencies in the yellow-white or “gold” part of the spectrum. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this

      century gravitational harmonics and acoustics researcher John
      Keely used another triad of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; notes to produce legendary but
      unduplicated levitation and transportation effects witnessed by
      the US Army. </p>

      the triad were dissonant notes very close to D sharp at 622.2
      cycles per second, which is almost exactly the same note as the
      fourth octave of the fifth Schumann overtone, an <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; octave of the fifth note in the
      hydrogen-alpha scale. The third note used by Keely was a high 12
      kilohertz. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; T. Henry
      Moray developed a type of motor that would run on the zero point
      energy he was able to extract from the ambient scalar environment
      with his devices based on harmonic principles of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; high voltage omnipresent electricity
      utilization.&nbsp; The motor would operate without any apparent
      generation of heat of friction at over 500 revolutions per second,
      indicating a natural omnipresent <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ambient electricity harmonic of that
      frequency. 500 revolutions per second is an exact octave of the
      Schumann Resonance and the Hydrogen-alpha Resonance as well! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The latest
      controversy is the research of Yevgeniy Podkletnov, who claims to
      have produced apparent levitation effects over a rapidly spinning
      superconductor disc, again rotating at the high <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; speed of over 500 rotations per second,
      in the same range as the Moray and Keely frequencies. Some
      researchers claim to have duplicated the Podkletnov effect yet
      others are unconvinced. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One wonders if the inability of some
      other researchers to duplicate the effect has something to do with
      the exact speed of the spinning disc to create a resonance effect,
      in harmonic with the Earth <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Sun. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also noted

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sixth
      octave of the fourth Schumann overtone is approximately one
      chromatic step higher in pitch than the eighth octave of the
      Schumann fundamental. The inventor of the Dotto Ring <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bioelectric detector claims to have
      detected a universal cellular frequency range of around 2 KHz,
      exactly at just that eighth octave. Slightly sharp of that at 2025
      cps is the frequency of proton <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precession, one of the most fundamentally
      important and ubiquitous resonant frequencies in the universe.
      Many theorists think that proton precession is related to inertia
      and gravitation, and that if <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it were to be possible to alter proton
      precession one could alter inertia and gravity itself. It is
      thought that by altering proton precession it could be possible to
      achieve reactionless propulsion. It is <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; also claimed that water behaves unusually
      at this resonance, displaying anomalous inertial behavior. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Royal Rife
      found that the mortal oscillation rates of what he believed to be
      cancer viruses were at much higher frequencies, but researchers
      who worked with him in the 1950s including Dr. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stafford arrived at lower frequencies,
      some of which were at this same pitch. These were presumably
      fundamentals of the higher harmonics, such as 2008 cps for the
      sarcoma virus and 2127 and <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2128 cps for the carcinoma virus. The
      latter frequencies were close to the sixth octave of the fourth
      Schumann overtone. Rife and his followers also found a number of
      mortal oscillation rates for <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a variety of pathogenic microorganisms
      ranging up into the megahertz frequencies, but only some of these
      “MOR”s seem to follow an apparent harmonic pattern. See the tables

      developed a technology that, like Rife’s, showed well-documented
      results with cancer and trypanosomiasis and other aspects of
      microbial control systems. Priore used an even <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; more complex system than Rife to generate
      his frequencies, modulating pulsed 9.4 gigahertz UHF waves with AM
      frequencies flanking the 21st octave of the Schumann Resonance,
      also known <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as the fifth Hydrogen-alpha sound
      suboctave. One of his frequencies is very close to two of Rife’s
      cancer treatment frequencies. Also, the two Priore “notes” are
      just that, the equivalent of one <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “half-step note” apart from each other in
      an even-tempered twelve-tone scale, the equivalent of very high B
      and C notes. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
      difference between the lower of the two Priore frequencies and the
      hydrogen-alpha suboctave is 256,320 Hertz, which is less than a
      two percent error. However, the higher of the two <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Priore frequencies differs by 1,543,680
      Hertz and this is almost ten percent of error. There is 1.8
      megahertz difference between the two Priore frequencies. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could Priore
      have been simply approximating the octave of the hydrogen-alpha or
      Schumann frequencies, empirically shooting in the dark? The
      Schumann octaves continue at 7987.2 Hertz <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; being the tenth octave, 15974.4 the
      eleventh, 31948.8 the twelfth, 63897.6 the thirteenth, 127795.2
      the fourteenth, 255590.4 the fifteenth, 511180.8 the sixteenth,

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2044723.2 the eighteenth, 4089446.4 the
      nineteenth, 8178892.8 the twentieth, and 16357785.6 Hertz the
      twentyfirst octave. The difference between the Hydrogen-alpha and
      the Schumann <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; octaves here is 301,465.6 Hertz which is,
      as expected, within two percent of error. Priore’s first frequency
      is about two percent lower in frequency than the Hydrogen-alpha
      octave and the <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schumann frequency as always, is about
      two percent higher. 16.7 megahertz is the median value between the
      two Priore therapeutic frequencies, this midpoint frequency being
      only slightly higher <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; than the twenty-first Schumann octave,
      almost exactly within two percent of error! </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is
      the two percent error range statistically significant, we see that
      exactly this margin of error appears repeatedly, which is in
      itself statistically significant! It is as if the entire spectrum
      of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Schumann and of most other values needs
      to be downshifted two percent in order to be in octave resonance
      with the hydrogen-alpha values. This could be a form of distortion
      imposed <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; universally upon all the standing waves
      of reality by the spin/precession constants. Interestingly, two
      percent of a circle is a little over seven degrees, 7.2 to be
      exact, which can be considered to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be a reasonable “orb of influence”. We
      also see within each octave a possible necessity of a downward
      shift of vibration rates of absorption and emission spectra for
      metals, of mitochondrial <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity, mortal oscillation rates for
      microbes, and various rates in the human energy field. It is as if
      a consistently slight downshift would bring almost the entire
      spectrum in perfect harmony. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would also
      bring the principles of seasonal thermodynamics into virtually
      universal correlation within two percent of error. This would tend
      to prove the aspects dealt with in these researches, to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be more scientific (statistically
      accurate) than many of the less exact sciences! Actually, is it
      not rather that this is the missing link that has the potential to
      make the inexact sciences exact? </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This question
      of the downward shift, or perhaps in the light of the earlier
      discussion of Gurdjieff’s concepts of universal octaves and
      multiple levels of hydrogens, the upward shock, is crucial. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were there not the two percent shift or
      upward shock, there might not be any gravitation or inertia, or
      even time, at all! This two percent constant could be a crucial
      expression of the very fabric <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of creation, or it could simply be an
      inexactitude in measurement. However, these measurements were in
      fact quite exact and gathered quite independently. The two percent
      constant deviation, <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like the universal Schumann/hydrogen
      metaoctave, is literally the breath of the Creator, Omnipresent
      and Omnipotent. Nothing would exist without its keynote signature
      vibration, which is always <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; some harmonic of this Holy Spirit
      metaoctave. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All things
      resonate at the Particle Spin and Precession Level, which is
      within 1.5% accuracy of the eighth Schumann octave. Most
      substances also resonate at a complex chord of the constituent <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; atom and molecule frequencies, and often
      at various crystal and colloid frequencies as well. Ions or atoms
      resonate in the second octave and also in the three octaves of
      infrared, visible light and <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ultraviolet. Thus the qualities of all
      substances are determined by these and possibly other vibration
      rates. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change these
      rates and you transmute the substance. Change the vibration
      wavelengths of lead from 405.8, 368.3, and 364.0 nanometers
      (interestingly, within the Winter Solstice and Midwinter <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; octaves!) to 312.3, 274.8, 267.6 and
      242.8 nanometers, and you have gold. (As we shall see, gold
      resonates at the1/2, 4/5 and 6/7 cusps but primarily in the octave
      of 5 or Midsummer.) In <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most cases the color of a substance is
      clearly consistent with its twelvefold seasonal color wheel
      octaves. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living things
      resonate at all these frequencies in varying amplitudes depending
      on their constituent ion and molecule concentrations, which in
      turn also affect the colloidal states that are crucial to <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life. Resonance of life also occurs at
      levels of organelles, the mitochondrial resonances at the ninth
      and twelfth octaves of the Schumann/hydrogen frequency being of
      particular importance. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specific resonances of cells are reported
      to occur throughout the 12th through 19th octaves, and nuclei and
      viruses resonate at 19th through 21st octaves. Specific tissues
      and organs have <br>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, these resonances also are the ranges used by VHF
      television and FM radio. The potential biological effects of this
      need to be researched further. We definitely know that it is not <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; safe to live or work near a broadcast
      tower! Such broadcasts may adversely affect health or subtle
      aspects of human psychology. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As noted,
      nothing would exist without its keynote signature vibration, which
      is always some harmonic of this Holy Spirit metaoctave. Thus the
      human species shows all the aforementioned <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; resonances shared with all substances and
      with all living things, and its own particular physical signature
      resonance near the 23rd octave, and unique brain wave signature
      resonance near the first <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two Schumann octaves. In addition to
      this, each individual person resonates not only at all these
      frequencies shared with all other humans, but also in the 24th and
      25th octaves where are found <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the unique signature resonances of
      individuals as researched by Nrunori and Cazzamalli. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus one can
      readily understand the sheer volume of information required to
      describe all the frequencies involved in a human being, not to
      mention the fact that we probably even now as yet <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; know only a fraction of them. One would
      have to list the frequencies of spin, of precession, of several
      dozen atoms/ions at proper amplitudes, of many hundreds of organic
      molecules and colloids <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at proper amplitudes, as well as of
      tissue types and organs and the various geometries of the physical
      form, and of the brain waves and signature resonances unique to
      the individual. Then <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perhaps one could truly call someone
      without needing a phone number. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere
      around 750,000 gigahertz, or approximately 420 nanometers, there
      is a gap or special zone in the violet portion of the visible
      spectrum. This seems to be a sort of octave shock or <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; adjustment bandwidth. Below this
      frequency range, including most of visible light and all of
      infrared, we can see a partial pattern of correlation of octaves
      with absorption and emission spectra of <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; metals, if the wavelength values are
      increased proportionately by approximately 20 nanometers in a sort
      of red shift. This is approximately three percent of this
      particular octave’s frequency <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interval. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The apparent
      pattern is that at some octaves or bandwidths, a two to three
      percent downshift (or seven to ten degrees of arc) is required in
      order to match the frequencies with their appropriate&nbsp;
      multivariant expressed qualities, whereas at other frequency
      ranges or octaves this downshift should not be applied. Whether an
      unequal distortion effect due to the spin/precession constants of
      inertia and gravitation, or to unequal resonance patterns of
      space/time bending post big bang, or both, or unknown causes,
      there definitely seems to be a pattern of alternation of zones
      of&nbsp; downshift with zones of surprisingly exact
      correspondence. Much of this question, as well as the question of
      the values for calcium, magnesium and potassium that do not follow
      expected patterns so well as the values for the metals proper do,
      will be doubtless elucidated with complete internal sign harmonics

    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Schumann
      Terrestrial Resonance is the more objective of the audible sound
      frequencies, but not as constant as the Solar Hydrogen Alpha Line,
      i.e., it varies or oscillates around the lower subaudible octaves
      of the stated frequencies. The other audible sound even-tempered
      scale frequencies are quite arbitrary, and are merely for
      convenience, as they correlate closely with the&nbsp; notes used
      in the Western even-tempered musical scale, and are thus easier to
      produce with a synthesizer or other musical instrument if
      calibrated with an oscilloscope or other precision device. <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A precision oscilloclast may be the best
      choice ultimately. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may
      certainly well be that harmonics other than the dwadasamsa or the
      twelvefold are significant, and can be used to refine further the
      system in the future. For now the dwadasamsa seems to be the most
      significant. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the near
      future the values for biologically significant microwave and other
      frequencies (“Harmonic 695” for example) will also be determined,
      and these may possibly be of greater therapeutic value. The
      question then becomes, “What is the most therapeutically effective
      way to deliver these frequencies, or rather perhaps to restore
      their natural presence in the organism?” </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It may well
      be that the best eventual use of these frequencies will be to
      simply monitor their presence or absence, and thus check the
      efficacy of chiropractic adjustments, acupuncture or other
      meridian stimuli, and dietary and pharmacological ministrations,
      as well as to rapidly monitor a range of biological functions, in
      a kind of “Star Trek” method of biological systems
      monitoring,&nbsp; much as one would check the tuning of a musical
      instrument. There are many more potential applications of this
      multivariant harmonic analysis system in chemistry, physics, and
      other sciences and <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; technologies.<br>
