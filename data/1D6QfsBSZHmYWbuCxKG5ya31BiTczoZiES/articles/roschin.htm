      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have experimentally
          studied the physical effects in a system based on rotating
          permanent magnets. It is demonstrated that a magnetic system
          made of rare-earth magnets (REMs) is capable of converting
          various forms of energy, provided that a certain critical
          operating regime is set.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator comprises an
          immobile stator and a rotor moving around the stator and
          carrying fixed magnetic rollers. The magnetic system of the
          working body of the generator has a diameter of about 1 m. The
          stator and magnetic rollers were manufactured from separate
          magnetized segments made of REMs with a residual magnetization
          of 0.85 T, a coercive force of [Hc] ~ 600 kA/m and a specific
          magnetic energy of [W] ~ 150 J/m<sup>3</sup>. The stator
          incorporated REMs with a total weight of 110 kg and the
          rollers contained 115 kg of the same REM material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On attaining the critical
          regime (550 rpm), the rotor exhibited a sharp increase in the
          rotation speed; this was accompanied by a slow-down in the
          rate of the current weight variation. The system weight
          variations depend both on the power consumed by the active
          load and on the polarization voltage applied. For a maximum
          output power (7 kw) a change in the total platform weight
          reached 35% of the initial value in the immobile state (350
          kg). The platform weight could be controlled by applying a
          high-voltage signal to the cellular ring electrodes situated
          10 mm above the external roller surface. The effect of the
          system weight variation is reversible with respect to the
          direction of rotor motion and exhibits hysteresis within 50-60
          rpm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Besides the phenomena
          described above, a number of other interesting effects were
          observed in the system studied. In particular, the generation
          operation in the dark is accompanied by a corona discharge
          with a pink-blue light emission and by the production of
          ozone.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One more effect, which was
          never reported previously, is the appearance of vertical
          "magnetic walls" around the generator. The measurements
          revealed zones of increased magnetic field strength on the
          order of 0.05 T arranged coaxially relative to the system
          center. The layers of increased magnetic field strength are
          propagating with virtually no attenuation to a distance of 15
          meters from the converter center and then rapidly decayed at
          the boundary of this 15 meter area. Each layer zone is 5-8 cm
          thick and exhibits sharp boundaries; the layers are spaced by
          50-60 cm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another interesting
          phenomenon consists in an anomalous temperature drop in the
          immediate vicinity of the generator. At a general room
          temperature level in the laboratory (+22 +/- 2° C), the
          temperature at the generator surface was 6-8° C lower. Similar
          temperature variations were detected in the vertical "magnetic
          walls". The same pattern was observed at a height of 5 meters
          above the setup in a second-floor room above the laboratory
          (despite the steel-reinforced concrete blocks separating the
          rooms).</font> </p>
