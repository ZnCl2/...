        <p align="left">When Anthony Gallucio talks about the “little
          black box” and what he claims is its amazing contribution to
          the field of energy his description bridges the gap between
          Thomas Edison and television’s Mission Impossible. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio, a lawyer and former Cambridge School
          Committee member, says he and his partner, Fred A. Baldinelli
          of 135 Atherton St., Milton, are developing what he describes
          as a dual relay charger capable of creating AC power from a
          12-volt battery. </p>
        <p align="left">Both Gallucio and Baldinelli, the inventor,
          cl;aim that the device, iunlike anything on today’s market,
          can power an automobile or provide 1000 to 1500 volts ---
          enough to illuminate a house. </p>
        <p align="left">Essentially it is a battery charger that has AC
          power”, Gallucio explains. “You can use it any place you use
          electricity”. </p>
        <p align="left">“The device is solid state”, Gallucio says. “It
          has not moving parts. No chemicals, no batteries or fuel
          cells. The materials and parts are readily available and the
          output can be varied by changing the size of the device”. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio describes the present model of
          Baldinaelli’s invention as about the same size as an
          automobile battery. He says the Ford Motor Company and
          Raytheon Company have expressed interest in the device. </p>
        <p align="left">Investigators in the office of Attorney General
          Robert H. Quinn also are interested in the invention and
          reportedly are prepared to present information to a Suffolk
          County grand jury next week. </p>
        <p align="left">State detectives assigned to the Criminal
          Division reportedly have investigated the Gallucio-Baldinelli
          venture as a result of claims made by persons who said they
          invested in the invention. </p>
        <p align="left">While Gallucio declined to say how much has been
          invested, investigators reportedly have estimated the figure
          at $100,000 or more. </p>
        <p align="left">They reportedly have been told that a Medford
          man invested $23,000, a Wakefield man $100,000 and a
          Springfield businessman $120,000. </p>
        <p align="left">But the big question involves the source of
          energy. Nobody seems ot know what it is. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio says he doesn’t know. </p>
        <p align="left">He lives at 86 Buckingham St., Cambridge, is
          counsel for the State Dept. of Labor and Industries and was
          secretary to the late John F. Kennedy when JFK was a
          congressman. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio says his partner, Baldinelli, whom he
          describes as “a genius, an electronic genius”, isn’t sure of
          the source of energy either. </p>
        <p align="left">“I can’t tell you”, Gallucio says. “We don’t
          know the source of energy. Mr. Baldinelli doesn’t know either.
          He’s a raw inventor. He doesn’t know how it happens. He
          doesn’t [… missing line of text]… </p>
        <p align="left">“He knows what you have to put together. He
          knows it happens”, Gallucio says of his partner. </p>
        <p align="left">But he is quick to point out that even if they
          did know the source of energy they wouldn’t say because they
          consider the invention so valuable. </p>
        <p align="left">In fact, Gallucio says, Baldinelli has been
          developing a self-destruct mechanism for the device so that it
          would ruin itself if anyone tried to open it for inspection
          during testing by engineers. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio says the self-destruct model should be
          completed by tomorrow. </p>
        <p align="left">The Harvard graduate says he became interested
          in Baldinelli’s inventions about 11 years ago when he
          represented Baldinelli as a lawyer. </p>
        <p align="left">Baldinelli’s device developed through his
          attempt to improve the automobile alternator, according to
          Gallucio. </p>
        <p align="left">Recently he equipped a Volkswagen with the
          device and it powered the vehicle without depleting the
          battery in a test which Gallucio says was witnessed by Ford
          engineers. </p>
        <p align="left">Baldinelli, who says he also invented a burglar
          alarm that fits in a doorknob, claims to have illuminated his
          home with power from his device on the night of the great
          Blackout. </p>
        <p align="left">The lights in his home drew so much attention in
          the darkened neighborhood, Baldinelli says, he decided to
          extinguish three spotlights which illuminated his backyard. </p>
        <p align="left">When the lights of the Northeast went out a few
          years ago, Baldinelli says, he merely plugged his invention
          into a wall socket and his lights went back on. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio says he used the device to feed
          electricity to a building daily for several months. </p>
        <p align="left">Getting sufficient money for research and
          attempting to sell the invention to such firms as Ford and
          Raytheon has been a struggle, according to Gallucio. </p>
        <p align="left">He says none of his friends who invested has
          been dissatisfied with the progress of development but he was
          told that some individuals who purchased an interest in the
          device from another person complained to the attorney
          general’s office. </p>
        <p align="left">Baldinelli, who says his primary experience in
          electronics dates employment in an auto radio shop, holds a
          patent on the device. </p>
        <p align="left">Baldinelli has discovered what engineers have
          described as “a very extraordinary thing”, according to
          Gallucio. </p>
        <p align="left">“What stuns the engineers is that it looks like
          there is no power depletion in the battery”, Gallucio says.
          “The engineers go crazy. They don’t believe it. They say it
          can’t happen”. </p>
        <p align="left">“They say you can’t do this (draw power from a
          battery without depleting it) and here he (Baldinelli) is
          doing it. They said we couldn’t fly to the moon. We flew
          there”. </p>
        <p align="left">When the Volkswagen was used in a test, Gallucio
          says, Ford’s engineers placed meters on the battery and
          noticed no power depletion. </p>
        <p align="left">Gallucio is apprehensive about the effect the
          attorney general’s investigation may have on his venture with
          Baldinelli. </p>
        <p align="left">But someday, he says, the invention will be
          recognized. </p>
        <p align="left">“Someday”, he says, “they’ll pin a medal on me
          and the inventor will get a Nobel Prize”. <br>
