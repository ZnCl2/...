      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>Tissue in warm blooded animals which is damaged and/or infected
        is treated by administering a therapeutically effective amount
        of a novel catalyst or synergist. The treatment is effective in
        relieving stress and/or shock. In a further variant warm blooded
        animals having damaged and/or infected tissue are treated with a
        composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of at
        least one antibiotic and the catalyst or synergist. Novel
        therapeutic compositions are provided which contain at least one
        antibiotic and an effective amount of the catalyst or synergist.
        The catalyst or synergist is prepared by steps including
        admixing a water soluble alkali metal silicate with an aqueous
        medium containing carefully controlled amounts of dissolved
        water soluble substances which are sources of calcium ion and
        magnesium ion, reacting the same to produce an aqueous colloidal
        suspension of the reaction product, admixing a micelle forming
        surfactant with the aqueous medium, and agitating the aqueous
        medium containing the colloidal particles and surfactant to form
        micelles containing the colloidal particles. </p>

      <p><b>Description:</b> </p>
      <p><b>Background of the Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>This invention broadly relates to the treatment of warm blooded
        animals with a therapeutically effective amount of a novel
        catalyst or synergist. In a further variant, the invention
        relates to the therapeutic treatment of warm blooded animals
        with antibiotics in the presence of a catalyst or synergist. The
        invention further relates to novel therapeutic compositions
        which are useful in practicing the method of the invention. </p>
      <p>A wide variety of pharmacologically active substances have been
        proposed heretofore for use in treating diseased and/or damaged
        tissue in warm blooded animals. However, the pharmacological
        formulations available heretofore generally have not had a
        combination of desirable properties including pronounced
        antibacterial and/or antifungal activity, an ability to promote
        the curing of infections and/or the rebuilding of damaged
        tissue, an ability to markedly reduce stress and/or shock, a
        nonpoisonous nature and capable of being administered as often
        as desired without harmful effect. Further, entirely
        satisfactory pharmacological formulations for the open wound
        healing of infected and/or damaged tissue including cuts, sores,
        burns, sprains, bruises, skin irritations and infections have
        not been available heretofore. A pharmacological formulation
        capable of acting as a catalyst or synergist when administered
        in combination with one or more antibiotics also has not been
        available heretofore. </p>
      <p>The present invention provides a catalyst or synergist which
        has the aforementioned desirable properties when used alone in
        the therapeutic treatment of warm blooded animals. In addition
        thereto, it may also be used in the treatment of warm blooded
        animals with antibiotics to increase the effectiveness thereof
        by a synergistic action. Thus, the novel catalyst or synergist
        of the invention has a combination of unusual and unexpected
        properties which have not been possessed heretofore by
        pharmalogical formulations in present use. </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel
        method of therapeutically treating damaged and/or infected
        tissue in warm blooded animals. </p>
      <p>It is a further object to provide a novel method of relieving
        stress and shock in warm blooded animals. </p>
      <p>It is a further object to provide a novel method of markedly
        increasing the therapeutic effectiveness of an antibiotic
        administered to a warm blooded animal. </p>
      <p>It is a further object to provide a novel method of treating a
        warm blooded animal which employs a composition containing a
        therapeutically effective amount of an antibiotic and a catalyst
        or synergist. </p>
      <p>It is a further object to provide novel therapeutic
        compositions which are useful in practicing the invention. </p>
      <p>Still other objects and advantages of the invention will be
        apparent to those skilled in the art upon reference to the
        following detailed description and the specific examples which
        are for purposes of illustration only. </p>
      <p><b>Detailed Description of the Invention Including Preferred
          Variants Thereof ~</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with one important variant of the present
        invention, warm blooded animals having damaged and/or infected
        tissue are therapeutically treated by administering an effective
        amount of a novel catalyst or synergist. In accordance with a
        second variant of the invention, warm blooded animals having
        damaged and/or infected tissue are treated with a synergistic
        combination containing a therapeutically effective amount of at
        least one antibiotic and the novel catalyst or synergist of the
        invention. In accordance with a third variant of the invention,
        synergistic compositions are provided which contain a
        therapeutically effective amount of at least one antibiotic and
        the novel catalyst or synergist of the invention. Each of these
        three variants will be described in detail hereinafter. Also,
        the novel catalyst or synergist, which will hereinafter be
        referred to as a catalyst for the purpose of simplifying the
        discussion, will be described more fully hereinafter. </p>
      <p>In practicing the aforementioned first variant of the
        invention, the catalyst may be administered by topical
        application of a liquid suspension of the catalyst or in dry
        form, or by parenteral injection of a liquid suspension of the
        catalyst, or orally in liquid or solid form. Preferably, the
        catalyst is in the form of an aqueous suspension as it may be
        easily administered by topical application to the infected or
        damaged area, or by parenteral injection, or orally such as in
        drinking water or food. The catalyst need be administered only
        in catalytic amounts. For example, 0.0000-0.1% or less of the
        catalyst based upon body weight may be administered orally or by
        parenternal injection. In instances where a composition
        containing the catalyst is applied then it may contain, for
        example, about 0.000001-1% of the catalyst or less. While
        aqueous suspensions of the catalyst are usually preferred, other
        liquid pharmaceutically acceptable carriers may be used.
        Additionally, a dry catalyst may be administered in some
        instance with good results such as when it is administered
        orally in the form of powder, tablets or capsuls. The catalyst
        is harmless in reasonable amounts such as up to 1% of body
        weight and it may be administered as often as is desired without
        harmful effect. However, usually one to three applications or
        doses per day are adequate and additional applications are not
        beneficial. </p>
      <p>The aqueous catalyst suspension is especially effective in open
        wound healing and in treating cuts, open sores, burns, foot rot,
        pink eye, splints, saddle gall, skin irritations and infections,
        and the like in domestic animals such as dogs, cats, cattle,
        sheep, horses and poultry. The presence of a catalytically
        effective amount of the catalyst promotes the rate of healing of
        damaged tissue very markedly and there is a much faster
        recovery. The aqueous catalyst suspension also exhibits very
        powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties and thus it is
        useful in fighting infections in general of the types commonly
        contacted by domestic animals. In addition thereto, the catalyst
        has a pronounced soothing effect and it is capable of relieving
        stress and/or shock. The catalyst may be used for this purpose
        alone in instances where controlling stress and/or shock is an
        important factor in the successful treatment of a warm blooded
        animal. </p>
      <p>In instances where the aqueous catalyst suspension is applied
        topically, then often it is preferred that an ultraviolet light
        absorber be added. An example of one presently preferred
        ultraviolet light absorber is Gentian Violet. Following topical
        application of the catalyst suspension, the ultraviolet light
        absorber is thought to absorb ultraviolet light at the site of
        the damaged or infected tissue and thereby aid in promoting the
        rapid repair and healing thereof, and/or to control infections.
      </p>
      <p>The catalyst is very effective in preventing, controlling or
        therapeutically treating infections of the digestive tract of
        domestic animals such as, respiratory infections in general such
        as pneumonia, and diseases commonly contacted by poultry. It is
        usually preferred that the catalyst be administered daily in
        drinking water and/or in feed and especially when preventing or
        controling infections. Parenternal injection may also be useful
        in some instances. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the aforementioned second variant of the
        invention, one or more antibiotics may be administered to a warm
        blooded animal in combination with a catalytic amount of the
        catalyst. The specific antibiotic to be administered in a given
        instance, the amount, and the method of administering the same
        may be in accordance with prior art practice. However, usually
        much smaller quantities of the antibiotic are needed to produce
        comparable results. Often only one-third to two-thirds as much
        of the antibiotic as is normally required need be administered.
      </p>
      <p>The catalyst may be administered along with the antibiotic or
        separately therefrom. The methods of administering the
        synergistic combination of the antibiotic and the catalyst may
        be as given hereinbefore for the catalyst alone. The quantity of
        the catalyst to be administered also may be as aforementioned,
        but is understood that the dosage may vary widely in view of the
        catalyst being harmless and the fact that only a catalytic
        amount of the catalyst need be present. </p>
      <p>Surprisingly, the synergistic combination of the antibiotic and
        the catalyst often is useful in treating infections where the
        antibiotic alone or the catalyst alone is of little therapeutic
        value. For example, the synergistic combination of the
        antibiotic and catalyst is highly effective in treating foot rot
        in cattle and sheep whereas treatment with either component
        alone will not result in a permanent cure. </p>
      <p>The synergistic combination of the antibiotic and the catalyst
        may be used in treating all of the diseases treated heretofore
        with antibiotics alone. Examples of antibiotics which may be
        used in practicing the invention are as follows: </p>
      <p>amicetin, erythromycin, pactamycin, aureomycin, furacin,
        penicillin, aureotracin, gentamicin, polymyxin, bacitracin,
        grisonomycin, protomycin, bleomycin, halomicin, spiramycin,
        carbomycin, libanomycin, streptomycin, coumermycin, lincomycin,
        streptothicin, cephalasporins, melanomycin, telomycin,
        chalcomycin, methicillin, tetracycline, chlorotetracycline,
        mitomalcin, tetramycin, chromomycin, moenomycin, thioaurin,
        condicidin, novobiocin, zygomycin, cycloserine, neomycin,
        endomycin, oligomycin. </p>
      <p>The preparation of antibiotics such as those aforementioned
        and/or the use thereof in the treatment of infections in warm
        blooded animals is disclosed in numerous publications, including
        the following U.S. Pat. Nos.: </p>

      <p>The teachings of the above United States patents are
        incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>The present invention also provides novel therapeutic
        compositions containing a synergistic combination of one or more
        antibiotics and the catalyst. A pharmaceutically acceptable
        carrier may be present when desired. Such synergistic
        compositions may be administered to a warm blooded animal in
        accordance with prior art practice for the antibiotic alone and
        the treatment may be continued until the infection is cleared up
        and/or the tissue is healed. </p>
      <p>The reasons for the unusual and unexpected therapeutic
        properties of the catalyst when used alone are not fully
        understood at the present time. However, it is thought that the
        catalyst promotes or synergizes beneficial reactions between the
        infected and/or damaged tissue and body fluids, air and/or water
        or components thereof in contact with the tissue, and thereby
        provides an environment which is beneficial in controlling
        infections in infected tissue and/or promoting the healing of
        damaged tissue. When the catalyst is used in combination with an
        antibiotic, it acts as a synergist and increases the
        effectiveness of a given dose of the antibiotic, and allows less
        antibiotic to be used for a given degree of effectiveness. In a
        number of instances, the synergistic combination is capable of
        providing a cure for diseases such as cancer eye for the first
        time. </p>
      <p>The novel catalyst or synergist of the invention is described
        in greater detail hereinafter. </p>
      <p><b>Preparation of the Catalyst ~</b> </p>
      <p>The catalyst used in practicing the present invention may be
        prepared as described below. In the presently preferred process
        for preparing an aqueous suspension of the catalyst, a water
        soluble alkali metal silicate is admixed and reacted with an
        aqueous solution of a water soluble dissolved substance which is
        a source of calcium ion and a water soluble dissolved substance
        which is a source of magnesium ion to produce a finely divided
        or colloidal suspension of the reaction product. The aqueous
        solution contains the dissolved substances initially in amounts
        to provide between about 1<sup>10 -4</sup> and 1 <sup>10-1</sup>
        mole per liter each of calcium ion and magnesium ion, preferably
        between about 1 <sup>10-3</sup> and 1<sup>10-2</sup> mole per
        liter, and for still better results between 1 <sup>10-3</sup>
        and 6<sup>10-3</sup> mole per liter. The dissolved substances
        should also be present in amounts to provide a molar ratio of
        calcium ion to magnesium ion between about 2.0:1.0 and 1.0:2.0,
        and preferably about 1.5:1.0 and 1.0:1.5. For best results, the
        aqueous medium should contain the dissolved substances in
        amounts to provide between about 2.5<sup>10-3</sup> and 3.0 <sup>10-3</sup>
        mole per liter each of calcium ion and magnesium ion, and the
        molar ratio of calcium ion to magnesium ion should be about
        1.0:1.0, e.g., 2.9<sup>10-3</sup> mole per liter of calcium ion
        and 2.7<sup>10-3</sup> mole per liter of magnesium ion. The
        alkali metal silicate should have an alkali metal oxide to
        silicon dioxide ratio between about 0.9:1.0 and less than
        2.0:1.0, and preferably between about 0.9:1.0 and 1.2:1.0. The
        alkali metal silicate should be admixed with the aqueous medium
        in an amount of about 0.05-2 moles per liter, preferably about
        0.1-1 mole per liter, and for still better results about 0.2-0.5
        mole per liter. For best results, the alkali metal silicate
        should be an alkali metal meta-silicate having an alkali metal
        oxide to silicon dioxide ratio of about 1:1, and it should be
        admixed with the aqueous medium in an amount to provide about
        0.2-0.3 mole per liter, e.g., about 0.25 mole per liter. </p>
      <p>Examples of sources of calcium ion and magnesium ion for use in
        preparing the aqueous solution include mineral acid salts such
        as the halides, sulfates, bisulfates, nitrites, and nitrates of
        calcium and magnesium. The chlorides are usually the preferred
        halides, and both calcium and magnesium chloride are soluble and
        may be used. Magnesium sulfate and bisulfate are soluble and
        often are the preferred sources of magnesium ion. Calcium
        sulfate is only slightly soluble in water and usually is not a
        preferred source of calcium ion, but calcium bisulfate is
        somewhat more soluble. While calcium and magnesium nitrite or
        nitrate are soluble in water and may be used, these substances
        are not preferred in most instances. The sources of calcium ion
        and magnesium ion are dissolved in the aqueous medium in amounts
        to provide calcium ion and magnesium ion within the above
        ranges. Complete ionization is assumed when calculating the
        quantities to be dissolved and any desired order of addition is
        satisfactory. For example, the source of calcium ion may be
        added to the aqueous medium before, during or after the source
        of magnesium ion. </p>
      <p>The alkali metal silicate to be admixed with the aqueous medium
        is preferably a water soluble sodium or potassium silicate
        having an alkali metal oxide (M<sub>2</sub> O) to silicon
        dioxide (SiO<sub>2</sub>) mole ratio between about 0.9:1.0 and
        less than 2.0:1.0, and preferably between about 0.9:1.0 and
        1.2:1.0. The best results are usually obtained with an alkali
        metal mestasilicate having an alkali metal oxide to silicon
        dioxide ratio of about 1:1. Hydrated alkali metal silicates
        dissolve faster and should be used for best results when the
        alkali metal silicate is added in solid form. In instances where
        an anhydrous alkali metal silicate is used, it may be desirable
        to dissolve it in water and then add the solution to the aqueous
        medium. Sodium metasilicate is preferred and usually a hydrated
        sodium metasilicate such as the pentahydrate gives the best
        results. </p>
      <p>Carbonate ion and/or bicarbonate ion should not be present in
        the aqueous medium in substantial concentrations as the calcium
        ion and magnesium ion are precipitated in the form of their
        respective carbonates. The free carbonate ion and/or bicarbonate
        ion concentrations in the aqueous medium should not exceed about
        10 parts per million by weight based upon the combined weight of
        the water and the ingredients added thereto and for this reason,
        the alkali metal silicates should be substantially free of
        carbonate ion and bicarbonate ion. A small amount of preciptated
        calcium carbonate and/or magnesium carbonate may be present in
        the aqueous medium provided additional calcium ion and magnesium
        ion are available to meet the above defined concentrations. </p>
      <p>Distilled water and/or deionized water are usually preferred
        over a natural or untreated water when preparing the aqueous
        medium. In instances where water is used which contains
        substantial initial concentrations of alkaline earth metal ions,
        then this should be taken into consideration in calculating the
        amounts of the sources of calcium ion and magnesium ion which
        are necessary to arrive at the final concentrations previously
        discussed. </p>
      <p>An electrolyte which aids in the preparation of colloidal
        suspensions may be present in the aqueous medium at the time of
        admixing the alkali metal silicate therewith. Examples of
        electrolytes include those used in preparing prior art colloidal
        suspensions such as the alkali metal halides, sulfates and
        bisulfates. Sodium chloride, sodium sulfate and sodium bisulfate
        are usually preferred. The electrolyte should be added in small
        amounts such as, for example, about 0.00001-0.1 mole per liter,
        but often larger or smaller amounts may be present. </p>
      <p>The conditions under which the alkali metal silicate is admixed
        with the aqueous medium and reacted with the sources of calcium
        ion and magnesium ion are not critical provided the reaction
        mixture is maintained in the liquid phase. The reaction
        temperature may be, for example, between the freezing point and
        boiling point of water under the existing pressure conditions.
        At atmospheric pressure, the temperature is usually about
        10.degree.-90.degree.C and often a more convenient temperature
        is about 20.degree.-50.degree.C. In many instances, ambient or
        normal room temperature is satisfactory. </p>
      <p>The degree of agitation is not critical, and mild to vigorous
        agitation may be employed during addition of the alkali metal
        silicate. For the best results, the aqueous medium should be
        agitated sufficiently to assure rapid and uniform admixing of
        the alkali metal silicate. After completing the addition of the
        alkali metal silicate, when desired the agitation may be
        continued for a sufficient period of time to assure complete
        reaction and aging of the resulting colloidal suspension, such
        as for approximately 1-5 minutes to 1 hour or longer. </p>
      <p>Upon admixing the alkali metal silicate with the aqueous
        medium, it takes on a turbid appearance but in most instances no
        significant amount of visible precipitate is formed. The
        colloidal suspension of the reaction product thus produced
        should be strongly basic and may have a pH value of, for
        example, approximately 10-14 and preferably about 11-13, and for
        best results about 12. In view of this, the initial pH value of
        the aqueous medium containing the dissolved sources of calcium
        ion and magnesium ion is of importance and should be about 6-9
        and preferably about 7-8. When necessary, it is possible to
        adjust the pH value of the aqueous medium to the foregoing
        levels either before during or after addition of the alkali
        metal silicate by adding bases such as sodium or potassium
        hydroxide, or mineral acids such as sulfuric or hydrochloric
        acid. </p>
      <p>The colloidal suspension may be stored for several weeks or
        longer while awaiting the further treatment described
        hereinafter. In instances where the colloidal suspension is to
        be stored over a substantial period of time, the pH value should
        be maintained at the above described level and the storage
        vessel is preferably a tightly capped polyethylene bottle or
        other inert plastic container which prevents the contents from
        absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>The colloidal suspension of the reaction product is not
        suitable for use as a catalyst as prepared and it should be
        agitated sufficiently in the presence of a micelle-forming
        surfactant to form catalyst-containing micelles. The degree of
        agitation, the length of the agitation period, and the amount of
        the micelle-forming surfactant that is present in the colloidal
        suspension are controlled at levels favorable to the formation
        of micelles. For example, the surfactant may be present in an
        amount of about 0.001-0.1 mole per liter and preferably about
        0.03-0.07 mole per liter for most surfactants. Smaller or larger
        amounts may be effective with some surfactants such as 0.0001
        mole per liter or less, or 0.2 mole per liter or more. About
        0.05 mole per liter often gives the best results with many
        surfactants. </p>
      <p>The minimum period of agitation and the minimum degree of
        agitation that are required for micelle formation varies
        somewhat with temperature and the type and amount of surfactant.
        As is well understood in this art, gradually increasing these
        variants in the presence of an effective amount of the
        micelle-forming surfactant will result in micelle formation when
        the proper levels are reached. As a general rule, longer periods
        of agitation and/or more vigorous agitation are required to form
        micelles at lower temperatures approaching the freezing point of
        the colloidal suspension than at higher temperatures approaching
        the boiling point. In instances where the aqueous suspension has
        a temperature of approximately 50.degree.-90.degree.C., then
        mild agitation over a period of about 10-60 minutes is
        satisfactory. Often longer or shorter periods of mild to
        vigorous agitation may be employed such as from about 1-5
        minutes to several hours at temperatures varying, respectively,
        between the boiling point and the freezing point. When desired,
        the agitation may be continued long after the
        catalyst-containing micelles are formed as continued agitation
        does not seem to have an adverse affect. </p>
      <p>As a general rule, the micelle-forming surfactants known in the
        prior art may be used in practicing the present invention.
        Micelle-forming surfactants used in the emulsion polymerization
        of monomeric organic compounds are disclosed in the text S<i>ynthetic






          Rubber</i>, by G. S. Whitby, et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons
        Incorporated, New York (1954), and surface active agents in
        general are disclosed on pages 418-424 of the text <i>Organic
          Chemistry</i>, Fieser and Fieser, 2nd Edition, Reinhold
        Publishing Corporation, New York, N.Y. (1950), the disclosures
        of which are incorporated herein by reference. Examples of
        surfactants disclosed in the above texts include the alkali
        metal soaps of long chain fatty acids, and especially the sodium
        and potassium soaps of fatty acids containing about 14-25 carbon
        atoms and preferably about 16-18 carbon atoms, and the sodium
        and potassium soaps of the rosin acids, abietic acid and the
        derivatives thereof. Other micelle-forming surfactants include
        fatsand oils such as corn oil, cotton seed oil, castor oil, soy
        bean oil and safflower oil which have been fully or partially
        saponified with alkali metal bases to produce mixtures including
        saponified long chain fatty acids, the mono- or di-glycerides
        thereof, and glycerin. </p>
      <p>Examples of synthetic micelle-forming surfactants include the
        sulfonates of long chain alcohols prepared by hydrogenation of
        naturally ocurring fats and oils of the above types and
        especially sulfonated long chain alcohols containing about 10-20
        and preferably about 12-14 carbon atoms, the alkali metal salts
        of the monosulfonates of monoglycerides such as sodium glyceryl
        monolaurate sulfonate, the sulfonates of succinic acid esters
        such as dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate and the alkylaryl alkali
        metal sulfonates. Specific examples of presently preferred
        micelle-forming surfactants include sodium and potassium
        sulforicinoleate, tetrahydronaphthalene sulfonate,
        octahydroanthracene sulfonic acid, butyl naphthalene sulfonic
        acid, sodium xylene sulfonate, alkyl benzene sulfonic acid and
        potassium benzene sulfonate. </p>
      <p>Sulfated long chain hydroxycarboxylic acids containing about
        14-25 carbon atoms and preferably about 16-18 carbon atoms, and
        sulfated fats and oils containing hydroxycarboxylic acids of
        this type produce exceptionally good micelle-forming
        surfactants. At least 25% of the hydroxyl groups and preferably
        at least 50% should be sulfated, and up to 95-100% may be
        sulfated. It is usually preferred that the sulfated oils and/or
        long chain hydroxycarboxylic acids be neutralized with an alkali
        metal base, and that the corresponding alkali metal salts be
        added to the colloidal suspension in the form of an aqueous
        solution. The aqueous solution may contain at least 25% of water
        and preferably at least 35-40% by weight. Much larger
        percentages of water may be present when desired such as 75-80%
        or more by weight. </p>
      <p>A very active catalyst is produced when using sulfated castor
        oil as the micelle-forming surfactant (Turkey Red oil.) Sulfated
        castor oil which has been purified sufficiently to be of U.S.P.
        or medicinal grade produces an exceptionally active catalyst.
        For the best results, the castor oil is reacted with about an
        equal weight of concentrated sulfuric acid(e.g., 20% by weight)
        at a temperature of approximately 25.degree.-30.degree.C. The
        mixture may be reacted for about 2 hours with stirring and is
        then neutralized with sodium hydroxide solution. The reaction
        mixture separates into three layers, i.e., an upper layer which
        is a water solution, an intermediate or oily layer, and a white
        curdy precipitate. The intermediate oily layer is separated from
        the upper and lower layers, and may be added to the colloidal
        suspension as the micelle-forming surfactant, in an amount, for
        example, of 0.001-0.1 mole per liter, and preferably about 0.005
        mole per liter. </p>
      <p>The activity of the catalyst may be increased very markedly by
        cooling the aqueous catalyst suspension to a temperature
        approaching the freezing point such as about 0-10.degree.C., and
        then warming over one or more cycles. For best results, the
        aqueous catalyst suspension should be frozen and thawed over one
        or more cycles. The reason for the increased catalytic activity
        is not fully understood at the present time but cooling and then
        warming the aqueous catalyst suspension seems to increase the
        concentration of the catalyst-containing micelles and/or
        increases the catalytic activity thereof. </p>
      <p>The aqueous suspension of the catalyst contains a relatively
        small percentage by weight of the active catalyst as produced.
        When desired, it may be concentrated by evaporating a portion of
        the water to produce a concentrated liquid catalyst suspension
        which may be stored and used more conveniently. It is also
        possible to prepare a dry catalyst concentrate by evaporating
        substantially all of the water. The preferred method of
        producing the dry catalyst concentrate is by flash evaporation
        using a technique analogous to that employed in preparing
        powdered milk. The catalyst concentrates produced upon partial
        or complete evaporation of the water content of the initially
        prepared aqueous suspension may be reconstituted by addition of
        water with little or no loss of catalytic activity. Preferably,
        the water is added to the dry catalyst concentrate under
        sufficiently vigorous conditions of agitation to assure that the
        catalyst micelles are resuspended and uniformly distributed. </p>
      <p>The aqueous catalyst suspension may be used as produced in
        practicing the invention, but preferably it is diluted with
        approximately 100-10,000 parts by weight of water and then used.
        For better results, the catalyst suspension should be diluted
        with about 250-2,000 parts by weight of water before use, and
        for best results it should be diluted with about 500-1,000 parts
        by weight of water before use. The surface active agent may be
        added thereto when desired as previously discussed.
        Alternatively the dry catalyst or liquid catalyst concentrate
        may be admixed with water and/or the surface active agent to
        provide an effective catalyst concentration in the quantities
        previously discussed. The weight of the catalyst is calculated
        on a dry solids basis, i.e., the weight of the catalyst
        ingredients in the aqueous suspension as produced after removal
        of the water. </p>
      <p>The invention is further illustrated by the following specific
        examples. </p>
      <p><b>Example I ~</b> </p>
      <p>This example illustrates one presently preferred process for
        preparing the novel catalyst used in practicing the invention. </p>
      <p>Anhydrous calcium chloride in an amount of 0.66 gram and
        magnesium sulfate heptahydrate in an amount of 1.32 grams were
        dissolved in two liters of deionized water with stirring and
        warming until solution was complete. Then 95 grams of sodium
        silicate pentahydrate having a molecular ratio of sodium oxide
        to silicon dioxide of 1:1 were added to the solution with
        stirring and continued warming to produce a white colloidal
        suspension of the reaction product. </p>
      <p>After setting for 10 minutes, the colloidal suspension was
        heated to 80.degree.C. and sulfated castor oil in an amount of
        50 grams was added with stirring. The average molecular weight
        of the sulfated castor oil was 940 and it contained 50% of
        water. The turbidity lessened somewhat as the colloidal
        suspension was heated at 80.degree.-90.degree.C. for 1 hour with
        vigorous stirring to produce catalyst micelles. The aqueous
        suspension of catalyst micelles thus prepared had a viscosity
        similar to that of water and it was used as the catalyst in
        certain Examples as noted hereinafter. </p>
      <p>A dry or solid catalyst concentrate was prepared in a further
        run by evaporating water from the initially prepared aqueous
        catalyst suspension. The resulting dry catalyst concentrate was
        resuspended in water and there was no substantial loss of
        catalytic activity. In still other runs, the catalytic activity
        of the aqueous suspension of catalyst as initially prepared, the
        diluted aqueous suspension of catalyst, and the reconstituted
        aqueous catalyst suspension was enhanced by freezing and
        thawing. </p>
      <p><b>Example II ~</b> </p>
      <p>This example illustrates the preparation of additional catalyst
        suspensions. </p>
      <p>Five suspensions of the catalyst were prepared from the same
        ingredients as used in Example I and following the general
        procedure of Example I. The ratios of ingredients were varied as
        follows: </p>

      <p>The catalyst suspensions prepared by the above five runs were
        used in certain examples as noted hereinafter. </p>
      <p><b>Example III ~</b> </p>
      <p>This example illustrates the use of a catalyst suspension
        prepared in accordance with Example I in general veterinary
        practice to relieve stress and shock and to promote healing of
        infected and/or damaged tissue in domestic animals. </p>
      <p>In a first series of tests, a veterinarian engaged in general
        practice treated a large number of dogs, cats, horses and cows
        with an aqueous catalyst suspension containing one volume of the
        catalyst suspension as prepared in accordance with Example I
        diluted with 1,000 volumes of water. No additional ingredients
        were added to the diluted aqueous catalyst suspension. The
        catalyst suspension was applied one to three times per day by
        spraying it on infected and/or damaged tissue including open
        sores, cuts, burns, sprains and following surgery. No further
        treatment was given with the exception of cleansing the infected
        or damaged area where necessary so as to allow the catalyst
        suspension to be topically applied. The rate of healing was
        observed closely. In instances where an amimal was intially
        under stress and/or shock, it was observed that both stress and
        shock were relieved and the animal was calmed following the
        application of the catalyst suspension without administering
        drugs. This also applied to subsequent applications of the
        catalyst suspension. Additionally, the infected and/or damaged
        tissue healed at a much more rapid rate than in a control group
        of animals where conventional veterinary practice was followed.
      </p>
      <p>In a second series of tests, 0.001% of Gentian Violet was added
        to the above described diluted catalyst suspension. The results
        were as reported above for the first series of runs insofar as
        relieving stress and shock are concerned. However, the catalyst
        suspension containing the Gentian Violet, which is a ultra
        violet light absorber, was even more effective in promoting
        healing of open wounds than the catalyst suspension when used
        alone. </p>
      <p><b>Example IV ~</b> </p>
      <p>This example illustrates the use of a diluted catalyst
        suspension prepared in accordance with Example I and diluted
        with 1,000 volumes of water in the treatment of calves to
        promote the healing of open wounds and/or to relieve stress and
        shock. </p>
      <p>In the first experiment, the catalyst suspension was used to
        relieve stress and shock at the time of weaning dairy calves. It
        is the usual custom to feed dairy calves only for the first 3
        days on the mother's milk and thereafter on a milk substitute.
        The shock to the calf is severe when deprived of the mother's
        milk and prior experience has shown that approximately 20% of
        the calves weaned according to the conventional practice do not
        survive. </p>
      <p>Over 100 dairy calves were weaned after 3 days and thereafter
        were given a milk substitute. Four liquid ounces of the diluted
        catalyst suspension were added to each 4 pints of the milk
        substitute over the first 24 hours following weaning. Further
        treatment with the catalyst suspension is not necessary unless
        the calf becomes sick. The catalyst suspension is effective in
        relieving stress and shock over a period of several days
        following the initial 24 hour period and apparently it is
        retained to some extent in the digestive tract for a
        sufficiently long period of time to accomplish the intended
        purpose. No calves were lost in this experiment due to the
        stress and shock accompanying weaning. </p>
      <p>In a second experiment, beef cattle calves were weaned after 5
        months. The catalyst suspension was added to their drinking
        water over the first day following weaning in a ratio of
        one-half ounce of the concentrated catalyst suspension as
        prepared in accordance with Example I to 20 gallons of water.
        The resulting drinking water contained approximately 1 volume of
        the catalyst suspension as prepared in accordance with Example I
        for each 2500 volumes of water. The 24 treatment was effective
        over a period of 3 weeks and no problems due from stress, shock,
        or disease were observed and no calves were lost. After that
        time, several calves contacted a disease commonly referred to as
        "dust pneumonia." The treatment of the drinking water with the
        catalyst suspension was resumed as before and the symptons of
        dust pneumonia were relieved without loss of calves. In each
        instance, stress and shock were relieved and the catalyst
        suspension was also effective as a therapeutic agent. </p>
      <p>In a further experiment, calves to be branded and dehorned were
        separated into two groups. The first group was used as a control
        group, and the usual ranch practice was followed subsequent to
        branding and dehorning. The control group of calves had unhealed
        wounds resulting from the branding and dehorning for up to 6
        weeks. </p>
      <p>The second group of calves were branded and dehorned following
        the same practice as used on the first group with the exception
        of spraying the open wounds from one to three times per day with
        a diluted catalyst suspension prepared by diluting the catalyst
        suspension of Example I with 1,000 volumes of water. After each
        application of the diluted catalyst suspension, the treated
        calves were calm and stress and shock resulting from the
        branding and dehorning were relieved markedly. The calves also
        did not seem to be in pain. After a week of this treatment, the
        wounds resulting from the branding and dehorning were healed
        without loss of calves. </p>
      <p><b>Example V ~</b> </p>
      <p>This example illustrates the synergistic effect of the catalyst
        suspension of the invention on antibiotics when used in the
        treatment of cancer eye in cattle. Previous attempts to cure
        cancer eye with antibiotics alone were not successful. The
        catalyst suspension used in this Example was prepared by
        diluting the catalyst suspension as prepared in Example I with
        1,000 volumes of water. </p>
      <p>In the first experiment, a cow infected with cancer eye in an
        advanced stage was injected with 5 cc of *COMBIOTIC, admixed
        with 5 cc of the diluted catalyst suspension. The infected eye,
        which had a bulbous mass 3-6 inches in diameter thereover, was
        then sprayed with the diluted catalyst suspension. The cow was
        in a nervous agitated state prior to the treatment and was not
        eating. Following the treatment, the cow was released from the
        chute in which she was treated and immediately started eating
        from a food supply that was provided. The cow was clearly under
        much less stress than prior to the treatment. After 10 days of
        spraying every other day with the diluted catalyst suspension,
        the bulbous mass had disappeared and there was no outward sign
        of infection. </p>
      <p>*Combiotic is a trademark for a mixture of biotics including
        penicillin and dihydrostreptomycin </p>
      <p>In a second experiment, 11 cows were obtained which were
        infected with cancer eye in advanced stages. The 11 cows were
        injected with 5 cc of COMBIOTIC admixed with 5 cc of the diluted
        catalyst suspension and the infected eyes were sprayed once with
        the diluted catalyst suspension. The cows were then fed 10
        pounds per day of a commercial feed consisting of rolled oats
        and corn containing 20 pounds per ton of *TERRAMIX ABD-25. One
        quart per ton of the concentrated catalyst suspension as
        prepared by Example I in 10 gallons of water was sprinkled over
        the dry commercial feed and admixed therein. The cows were
        observed over a 10 day feeding period and the absence of stress
        and the gradual disappearance of the visible symptons of cancer
        eye were noted. </p>
      <p>*Terramix ABD-25 is a commercial antibiotic sold by Charles
        Pfizer, Incorporated which contains vitamins A, B and D and
        Oxytetracycline (Terramycin), a broad spectrum antibiotic. </p>
      <p>At the end of the test program, two cows were returned to the
        herd as the cure seemed to be complete to the veterinarian in
        charge. The other 10 cows were slaughtered under the supervision
        of a veterinarian who was the U.S. Department of Agriculture
        inspector in charge of the slaughter house. Four of the 10 cows
        were declared free of cancer eye and were passed for human
        consumption. The other six cows were rejected thereby indicating
        a 50% cure rate. </p>
      <p>Prior to this experiment, there was no known effective cure for
        cancer eye and the 50% cure rate was considered to be
        remarkable. It was also believed that if the cancer eye
        infections had been treated at an early stage rather than at the
        advanced state of this experiment, the cure would have been
        complete in all 12 animals. </p>
      <p><b>Example VI ~</b> </p>
      <p>This example illustrates the use of a synergistic combination
        of antibiotics and the catalyst of the invention in treating
        foot rot in cattle and sheep. The catalyst suspension used in
        this example was prepared by diluting the catalyst suspension as
        prepared in accordance with Example I with 1,000 volumes of
        water. </p>
      <p>In the first experiment, sheep infected with foot rot in an
        advanced stage were sprayed over the infected foot areas with
        the diluted catalyst suspension. This procedure gave relief from
        1 to 2 weeks and then the infection returned. Thus, the catalyst
        suspension alone could not effect a permanent cure although
        there was temporary improvement. </p>
      <p>In a second experiment, the sheep were injected with 2 cc of
        COMBIOTIC admixed with 2 cc of the diluted catalyst suspension
        and the infected foot areas were sprayed with the diluted
        catalyst suspension. This treatment resulted in a complete cure
        as the foot rot infection did not return. </p>
      <p>In a further experiment, a 1700 pound Hereford bull having foot
        rot in an advanced stage in one foot with secondary infection in
        the leg and thigh thereabove was injected with a mixture of 5 cc
        of COMBIOTIC admixed with 5 cc of the diluted catalyst
        suspension. The infected foot and leg were then sprayed with the
        diluted catalyst suspension. By the next day, the swelling in
        the leg and thigh was gone and the infected foot was greatly
        improved. The treatment was continued for 10 days and by that
        time the bull was able to walk without difficulty. The cure was
        considered to be complete. </p>
      <p><b>Example VII ~</b> </p>
      <p>The test procedures of Examples III-VII are repeated with the
        exception of using the catalyst suspensions prepared by the
        procedure of Example II. Comparable results to those reported in
        Examples III-VII are obtained with the Example II catalysts. </p>
