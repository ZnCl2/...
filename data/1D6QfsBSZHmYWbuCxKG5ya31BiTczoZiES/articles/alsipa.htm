        <p>Paper from clay, a remarkable new product for household,
          industrial, and war use, has just been developed at the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While various kinds of
          it may be applied in familiar ways -- as in transparent
          wrapping sheets and milk containers -- the "mineral paper" is
          far more than a substitute for wood pulp or linen paper. </p>
        <p>In printing, its ultrafine texture imparts new clarity and
          detail to half-tone illustrations. Waterproof and
          nonabsorbent, it gives a much higher gloss than common paper.
          Unaffected by age, it may be employed for permanent records. </p>
        <p>Its fibers can be made into filter cloth invaluable to
          chemical industries, because of its resistance to corrosive
          acids and alkalies. A flexible sheet form can be wrapped
          around electric cables for insulation. </p>
        <p>For mica, a strategic war material used in electric parts of
          autos, planes, and radios, the United States depends almost
          entirely on imports from abroad. Since the new clay paper has
          the same chemical composition and electrical insulating
          qualities, stiff sheets of it should make an admirable
          substitute. </p>
        <p>Called alsifilm, the new paper takes its name from the first
          letters of aluminum and silica. These are the constituents of
          Wyoming bentonite, a type of clay that serves as raw material
          for light-brown "mineral paper". Another kind of bentonite,
          from California, yields white paper. </p>
        <p>Ground to fine powder, the clay is suspended in water while
          grit and foreign matter settle out. Evaporated to a jellylike
          mass, the residue then is chemically treated according to the
          desired use. Ultramicroscopic mineral fibers mat together
          during the process, as fibers of ordinary paper do. <br>

          <p><b>Ernst A. Hauser</b></p>

        <p>This invention relates to flexible, coherent, self-supporting
          solid bodies such as films, filaments, coatings and the like
          formed of colloidal, crystalline inorganic hydrous oxides
          which contain structural water and are capable of swelling
          when brought into contact with water to form plastic
          hydro-gels and exhibit base exchange properties, and to the
          process of making such bodies. </p>
        <p>It is known that certain organic materials are capable of
          forming coherent, self-supporting flexible films or sheets
          upon being deposited in a thin layer from a solution or
          suspension by evaporation of the solvent or vehicle. Typical
          examples are rubber, cellulose derivatives and resins. The
          formation of such films may be explained by the theory that
          the film-forming materials are composed of large, long-chain
          molecules which felt together when the diluting vehicle is
          removed. </p>
        <p>Now I have found that a somewhat similar result may be
          obtained with certain inorganic materials such as highly
          hydrated colloidal clays, e.g., bentonite. It is of course
          known that a film or thin layer of finely divided inorganic
          materials may be deposited on solid surfaces. For example, a
          suspension of chalk in water may be deposited as a film on a
          solid surface and dried, resulting in a coating of the chalk
          on the solid surface. If a sufficiently thick deposit is
          produced it may be removed as a self-supporting rigid cake,
          but so far as I am aware no one heretofore has produced
          self-supporting coherent flexible films of inorganic materials
          without an organic binder. </p>
        <p>The ability of inorganic materials to form self-supporting
          coherent flexible films apparently depends upon their ability
          to form gels due to the presence of strongly hydrated
          colloidal matter. I have found that when a sol 9water
          dispersion) of such a colloidal strongly hydrated inorganic
          material, such as a water suspension of a highly hydrated
          colloidal bentonite, is deposited as a thin coating on a solid
          surface and dried, the resulting film may be removed from the
          surface and is coherent, self-supporting and flexible and may
          have sufficient strength to permit its use for a variety of
          purposes. </p>
        <p>Ultramicroscopic investigation has shown that during the
          evaporation of the vehicle of such as inorganic sol it passes
          through the gel stage, with the particles still in random
          arrangement (after the Brownian motion has ceased) and
          finally, as the particles are forced closer and closer
          together by the removal of the vehicle, they line up and
          produce relatively long filaments or fibers and fiber bundles
          which interweave and interfelt to form a coherent film. Under
          magnification some of the films have somewhat the appearance
          of a woven fabric. This formation of fibers probably is due to
          the fact that when colloidal particles of an isometric shape
          and possessing a sufficient polarity are brought sufficiently
          close together by removal of the suspending medium they attach
          to each other to form the fibers or fibrous crystals which
          have been observed. X-ray analysis of the film shows only part
          of the lines characteristic of the x-ray diffraction powder
          diagram of the material, e.g., montmorillonite, of which the
          film is formed and whereas a picture obtained by exposing the
          film edgewise shows an x-ray diffraction pattern which also
          lacks certain lines found in the powder diagram of the
          material, the two film diagrams when superimposed or combined
          give a complete pattern which matches the powder pattern of
          the material. This observed characteristic of the films is
          believed to be capable of serving to identify films in
          accordance with the invention. </p>
        <p>In order to form such films, the particles of solid material
          which are capable of being hydrated and of swelling in water
          preferably are of colloidal dimensions. In general the smaller
          are the individual particles and the more nearly monodisperse
          the system the stronger and more flexible and less brittle
          will be the film produced although useful films may be made
          from materials with the particles in the upper range of
          colloidal dimensions and with somewhat polydisperse systems,
          containing, for example, particles ranging in size from 0.1 to
          0.5 micron. By colloidal dimensions I mean particle sizes less
          than 1 micron. The particles within a given batch of material
          will of course vary in size but it is preferred that the bulk
          of the particles shall be of a particle size of the order of
          0.01 to 0.1 micron. </p>
        <p>A suitable method for the preparation of the films is as
          follows: </p>
        <p>Bentonite (a hydrous aluminum or magnesium or aluminum
          magnesium silicate) of commercial grade which may have been
          partially purified to free it of coarse grained impurities in
          any suitable manner such as air sifting is suspended in water
          and allowed to settle for several days and the liquid is
          decanted from the deposited sludge. A suspension containing 1
          to 2% of solids is suitable for this purpose. This sludge
          consists largely of particles of greater than colloidal size,
          and consists mainly of quartz, calcium carbonate, feldspar and
          the like. The decanted suspension which may be taken off in
          fractions at different levels is then subjected to the action
          of a super-centrifuge, for example a centrifuge having a
          cylindrical tube about 2 inches in diameter operated at about
          25,000 revolutions per minute. The suspension is flowed in at
          the bottom and out at the top resulting in a deposition of
          heavier or coarser particles on the wall of the tube near the
          bottom and smaller particles near the top of the tube. The
          overflow contains still smaller particles and may be subjected
          to further centrifuging for the recovery thereof. The deposit
          on the wall of the tube may be separated into two or more
          fractions according to the particle size or distance from the
          bottom of the tube, resuspended in water and centrifuged
          again. By this procedure one may obtain a substantially
          monodisperse sol of any desired average particle size. The
          particle size range within the fraction should be relatively
          small, e.g., not more than about 10 millimicrons in a product
          having an average particle size of up to say 100 millimicrons.
          The larger the average particle size of particle the greater
          may be the actual difference in particle size but the relative
          difference in particle size, i.e., the ratio of the difference
          to the average particle size should be small, e.g., not more
          than about one-fourth of the average particle size. </p>
        <p>The suspension passed through the centrifuge should be quite
          dilute. In general the finer the average size of the particles
          in suspension the more dilute should be the suspension. A
          concentration of 0.5% to 1% is suitable for the crude
          suspension obtained by stationary settling of a suspension of
          bentonite containing particles of all sizes up to about 1
          micron. </p>
        <p>Films of the resulting refined material may be produced in a
          variety of ways. For instance the suspension may be deposited
          as a film or layer on a suitable removable liner within the
          centrifuge cylinder, the liner and film removed, laid flat and
          dried and the films stripped off of the liner. Foils of
          aluminum, copper, brass, etc., are suitable for the liner or
          one may use other materials with or without a coating such as
          paraffin to prevent adhesion of the film. </p>
        <p>Similar films may be formed by flowing a dilute suspension or
          sol, e.g., 1 or 2% on a suitable surface, such as glass, and
          allowing to dry and stripping of the resulting film.
          Continuous films and filament may be produced in the ways
          commonly employed with other film and filament forming
          materials. For example, a drying cylinder may be revolved in
          contact with the suspension. It is also possible to employ the
          material in such a concentration that it is more or less
          gelatinous or pasty by spreading it in substantially uniform
          thickness on a suitable surface. It will be apparent that
          films of any desired thickness may be produced and that by
          selecting the average size of the particles in suspension,
          films of different grades as to strength, flexibility, degree
          of transparency, etc., may be produced. Films made from
          suspensions of large particle size tend to lack flexibility or
          to be brittle. Certain impurities in the suspension tend to
          interfere with the formation of fibrous structure and produce
          weak spots in the resulting films. </p>
        <p>Films made from bentonite after being dried in the air at
          atmospheric temperatures contain a considerable amount of
          water, e.g., 8% and are capable of swelling in water. This is
          particularly true of the natural clays which contain alkali
          metal. The clays in which the alkali metal has been replaced
          by hydrogen, e.g., the hydrogen clays lose this property of
          swelling in water upon being air-dried. After the non-hydrogen
          clay films have been heated to 110°C or higher they are
          dehydrated and also lose proportionally this property of
          swelling in water. After slow dehydration the films may be
          heated to white heat without being destroyed. Such heating
          yields a product which is very similar in appearance and in
          dielectric properties to mica. A useful product of this
          character may be made by heating the film to about 300°C and
          simultaneously subjecting it to heavy pressure, say 1000
          pounds per square inch. If several of the films, before being
          dehydrated are laid together and then subjected to heating and
          heavy pressure a product resembling mica is produced. </p>
        <p>Before being dehydrated by heating, the films, as stated
          above, swell in water but they are resistant to oils, acid,
          alkalies and other strong electrolytes and may be heated to
          white heat without being destroyed. Depending on the purity of
          the clay, the size of the particles and the thickness of the
          film it may vary from being substantially opaque through all
          degrees of transparency to substantial transparency. </p>
        <p>The utility of the films has not been fully investigated but
          certain uses are evident, e.g., as a substitute for paper
          where resistance to the action of certain corrosive chemicals
          is required and as an insulating flexible sheet material in
          place of mica, synthetic resins, and impregnated paper or
          fabric. As stated above a plurality of sheets subjected to
          high pressure and temperature strongly resembles mica in
          appearance and dielectric properties. The films are
          non-flammable, may be written or printed upon and are capable
          of withstanding high temperatures. A useful product may be
          made by coating or impregnating a plurality of the films with
          a solution or melt of a heat hardenable synthetic resin,
          superposing the so treated films and heating and pressing them
          to form a laminated structure having high dielectric
          properties. </p>
        <p>The film may be deposited on a surface such as that of a
          corrrodable metal, e.g., iron to serve as a base or priming
          coat for anti-corrosion paint. </p>
        <p>I have successfully used a sol of bentonite having an average
          particle size of about 14 millimicrons and produced excellent
          flexible, self-supporting translucent film having a thickness
          of about one-thousandth o an inch. I have given that particle
          size range as from 10 millimicrons to 1 micron but as stated I
          prefer the smaller particles. A more practical range of
          particle size is from 0.05 to 0.1 micron. </p>
        <p>In the above-described process I have referred only to the
          preparation of suspensi9onss or sols suitable for the
          production of film, by centrifuging. It is, however, possible
          to produce such a suspension of bentonite by settling. Thus by
          settling a suspension of bentonite in water for a week or more
          and then drawing off only the top-most layer of liquid I may
          obtain directly a sol which is capable of producing a
          self-supporting film. </p>
        <p>The suspensions used for the production of film vary
          considerably in concentration. I have found pure clay
          suspensions of a concentration as low as 1.5% to be capable of
          forming a gel. On the other hand, I have produced gels capable
          of being spread to a film containing as high as 10% of solids.
        </p>
        <p>It will be apparent that a great variety of specific
          procedures may be employed for refining the bentonite to the
          desired particle size and up to the desired particle size
          range within a given suspension. It is also apparent that a
          variety of methods may be used for forming the suspension into
          films. </p>
        <p>In the foregoing I have referred particularly to bentonite as
          a specific example of materials capable of forming films.
          Within the genus of swellable, readily hydratable colloidal
          anisometric (polar) inorganic materials are other materials
          such as halloycite, gibbsite, and vanadium pentoxide. Lime and
          silica gel may be expected to produce films. The absorption of
          water by the particles apparently is not analogous to the
          absorption of water by a sponge nor is it a chemical
          combination. Rather, it appears to be an absorption of water
          into a molecular structure. Montmorillonite, the basic
          constituent of bentonite, has been found to give excellent
          results. By the term "self-supporting" in the description of
          the coherent, self-supporting, flexible solid body, I mean
          bodies which in the absence of any physical support and in
          sizes of say up to 1 foot, maximum dimension, are capable of
          being handled, e.g., picked up between thumb and forefinger
          without tearing or breaking. </p>
        <p>I claim: </p>
        <p>1. A coherent, self-supporting, flexible solid body, the
          continuous structure at least of which consists of a colloidal
          crystalline, inorganic hydrous oxide which contains structural

          <p>Ernst A. Hauser</p>
        </center>
        <p>In my application Serial No. 212,398, filed June 7, 1938, I
          have described the production of flexible, coherent,
          self-supporting solid bodies such as films, filaments and the
          like from natural crystalline inorganic hydrous oxides
          containing structural water and capable of swelling when
          brought into contact with water to form plastic hydro-gels and
          exhibiting base exchange properties such as hydrous aluminum
          and magnesium silicates, e.g., bentonite. According to said
          application the material is refined by suspending it in water
          and centrifuging or settling to separate gritty material,
          probably consisting of quartz, and coarse particles
          substantially exceeding colloidal size so as to produce a
          product consisting principally of particles of the
          substantially pure material of colloidal dimensions. It is
          further indicated in said application to be desirable to
          produce a suspension of the smaller particle sizes such as
          0.01 to 0.5 microns in which the particles are nearly of the
          same size, i.e., substantially monodisperse. </p>
        <p>I have now found that it is possible to produce
          self-supporting films, filaments and the like from sols and
          gels which although of colloidal dimensions are not
          substantially monodisperse. According to my present
          experience, self-supporting films, filaments, etc., can be
          made from any sol or gel of the specified materials of any
          polydisperse or monodisperse character so long as the
          particles are of colloidal dimensions. By the term
          "self-supporting" in the description of the coherent,
          self-supporting, flexible, solid bodies, I mean bodies which
          in the absence of any physical support and in sizes of say up
          to 1 foot maximum dimension, are capable of being handled,
          e.g., picked up between thumb and finger, without tearing or
          breaking. </p>
        <p>The hydrous oxide may be found in the natural state in
          sufficient purity that no refining is necessary. Such material
          may be simply suspended in water and used directly. In the
          case of a magnesium silicate bentonite which is commercially
          available and contains practically no particles over 1 micron
          in diameter, it may be suspended in water, allowed to settle
          for a short time to remove any coarse particles, concentrated
          to a gel and used. The refining of the hydrous oxide may of
          course be carried out in any suitable way such as by the use
          of any suitable suspending liquid other than water or by wind
          sifting and the refined material then suspended in water to
          swell the particles and form the gel. </p>
        <p>It will be further understood that whether the sol or gel is
          used as the film forming material, the gel stage immediately
          precedes the solid state. If the sol is applied to a surface
          as a coating, it passes through the gel state to the solid
          state by drying. The sol is quite dilute and highly fluid and
          will produce only a relatively thin deposit of solid material.
          If a small amount of electrolyte is added to a sol, it will
          form a gel which may be used for the production of films but
          here again the high dilution of the gel or the low
          concentration of solids must be considered. If the addition of
          electrolyte to the sol is carried so far as to cause
          precipitation the resulting suspension is practically useless
          for the production of films. But a gel produced by
          concentration and containing a sufficiently high concentration
          of solids, e.g., 3% or higher or such a gel after slight or
          incipient flocculation without precipitation by the addition
          of electrolyte may be used directly for the production of
          films, filaments, or the like. The air-dried film, filament or
          the like, however prepared, generally contains 6-10% of water.
        </p>
        <p>In bentonite, the essential ingredient appears to be the
          mineral montmorillonite which constitutes 75% or more of
          bentonites which are found to be suitable for the production
          of films, filaments, and the like. </p>
        <p>Films, filaments, coatings, etc., may be made by customary
          means, e.g., by extrusion, spraying, electro-deposition, or
          spreading. The films, etc., may be formed on a suitable
          surface and removed therefrom and may be dried and baked and
          heated to high temperatures and/or subjected to pressure to
          produce certain effects. The films, etc., produced as
          described in said application are, as stated therein,
          self-supporting and capable of being handled and used for many
          purposes but they are relatively fragile and moreover unless
          they have been heated to about 600°C or higher are not
          entirely water resistant and such heating tends to render them
          quite brittle. </p>
        <p>In a companion application Serial No. 257,248, filed February
          18, 1939, I have described and claimed the production of
          various articles such as films, coatings, filaments, etc., of
          the type generally regarded as being obtainable by suitable
          manipulation of liquid or plastic, i.e., flowable or moldable
          composition, consisting of or comprising an ingredient capable
          of solidifying and acting as a binder, from mixtures of the
          natural crystalline inorganic hydrous oxide capable of forming
          plastic hydro-gels with other materials such as finely divided
          organic fibrous materials, e.g., paper pulp, jute, silk,
          cotton, synthetic fibers and the like, inorganic fibrous
          materials, e.g., asbestos, rock wool, glass wool and the like,
          powdered and flake materials, e.g., ground mica and metal
          flakes or powders, e.g., aluminum and copper powders, also
          dyes and pigments such as titanium dioxide, lithopone, carbon
          black, etc., and water emulsions of materials such as
          asphaltum, nitrocellulose and waxes. </p>
        <p>An object of the present invention is to render all such
          films, filaments, etc, whether formed of the substantially
          pure hydrous oxide or of mixtures thereof with other finely
          divided materials, more water resistant and to improve their
          softness, flexibility and crease resistance. </p>
        <p>For the purpose of illustration bentonite will be referred to
          hereinafter as an example of a suitable hydrous oxide and the
          invention will be described more particularly with reference
          to the production of films. </p>
        <p>For rendering the films water resistant either the formed
          film after air drying or drying up to a temperature of about
          120°C may be treated with suitable agents to be described
          below or said agents may be added to and mixed with the sol or
          gel prior to the formation of the film. At 432°C the film is
          dehydrated but is still capable of regaining water very slowly
          and theoretically at least is still capable of responding to
          the action of the treating agents. By water resistant I mean
          that the film is rendered capable of being soaked or even
          boiled in water for a long period of time, say one hour or
          more, without any apparent change in the physical character of
          the film such as swelling or disintegration. </p>
        <p>The amount of treating agent required is small. When applying
          the treating agent to the formed (air dried) film the optimum
          conditions for treatment must be determined in each instance
          depending on the thickness and other physical characteristics
          of the film, the concentration and temperature of the treating
          agent and the effect desired. For example in treating
          air-dried bentonite films 2-3 mils in thickness with a
          saturated solution of lead acetate, a plurality of films were
          immersed in the solution at room temperature and samples were
          withdrawn every 2 or 3 minutes, dried at room conditions for
          several hours and then placed in boiling water to test the
          effect of the treatment. By this procedure it was found that
          30-45 minutes was required to produce the maximum effect.
          Samples treated for a somewhat shorter time were water
          resistant in that they did not swell when boiled in water but
          they were quite fragile and some of them disintegrated in the
          boiling water. This test indicates that the lead acetate
          treatment produces the double effect of rendering the films
          water resistant and stronger. </p>
        <p>A similar test with saturated lead acetate solution at 55°C
          showing that 20-25 minutes treatment was sufficient. In
          general the treatment time varies inversely with the
          temperature of the treating agent. Also in general the more
          concentrated the treating agent the shorter is the treating
          time and of course the thinner the film the shorter is the
          treating time. Only a very small quantity of the treating
          agent is consumed in the treatment. </p>
        <p>When the treating agent is added to the gel before the film
          if formed, tests with lead acetate have shown that quantities
          of the order of 10% are sufficient to give satisfactory
          results. </p>
        <p>The electrical properties of the films, which are an
          important consideration, since the electrical properties of
          the films indicate a valuable use of them, are greatly
          improved by the treatment. As has been indicated above, the
          treatment which renders the films waterproof, when properly
          applied, also serves to improve their tensile strength. </p>
        <p>In addition to rendering the films water resistant, it is
          desirable for certain purposes also to improve their
          flexibility or crease resistance. A film is considered to be
          sufficiently crease resistant for many practical purposes when
          it can be creased once without breaking. The above described
          treatment for rendering films water resistant generally also
          renders the films somewhat more brittle and the treatment to
          be described hereinafter is particularly important for certain
          purposes. </p>
        <p>I have found that while certain chemical treating agents
          serve to improve the water resistance of the films, others
          serve to improve the flexibility of the films. The agents for
          flexibilizing the films may be applied before or after the
          treatment for rendering the films water resistant and in some
          instances, when the two treating agents are compatible, the
          film, after it is formed, may be treated with the two agents
          simultaneously. </p>
        <p>Heating the films before the chemical treatment for rendering
          them water resistant, provided the heating is not so high as
          to render the treatment ineffective, appears to be without
          effect but heating the films after the treatment greatly
          improves the electrical properties of the films. Heating the
          so treated films to only a little above 100°C, say 105°C,
          serves to expel absorbed water from the film which once
          removed does not return upon exposure of the films to the
          atmosphere. The same effect is obtained more slowly by
          extended exposure to normal room temperatures. The air dried
          films before any treatment contain 6-10% moisture depending on
          the conditions under which they are dried. After treatment
          with lead acetate and air-drying they contain about 2.6%
          moisture and after heating at 105V about 0.3% moisture.Boiling
          the films in water after the chemical treatment to render them
          water resistant renders them tougher and stronger. </p>
        <p>As has been indicated both the agents for improving water
          resistance and the agent for flexibilizing the films may be
          applied separately and when compatible may be applied together
          to the film and if done carefully some of the agents for
          improving water resistance may be added to the gel before the
          film is formed. </p>
        <p>A variety of treating agents have been tested and found to be
          suitable. </p>
        <p>Consideration of the character and effects of the treating
          agents which are operable compared to other chemicals which
          are not operable indicates that the molecules or the active
          ions of the treating agents must, in both cases, be of such a
          character as to be able to enter the lattice structure of the
          material or to neutralize the electric surface charge of the
          clay particles. In the case of the agents serving to render
          the films water resistant the action of the agent if it is
          present in the form of a true solution appears to consist of a
          base exchange reaction between the exchangeable cation of the
          silicate and the cation of the treating agent. If it is a
          collolidal dispersion the action appears to be caused by
          electric neutralization of surface charges. In the case of the
          agents which serve to render the films more flexible the
          theory may be advanced that the molecules of the treating
          agent enter the lattice structure of the silicate and serve to
          lubricate it. It appears that the operability of the agents
          for rendering the films water resistant depends upon their
          ability to change the electrokinetic characteristics of the
          silicate. </p>
        <p>The action of the agents which render the films of base
          exchangeable hydrous oxides resistant to water may be further
          explained and the agents further characterized as follows. It
          appears from a comparison of diameters of the cations of
          effective agents which are capable of the base exchange with
          the cations of agents which are capable of base exchange with
          the exchangeable base of the hydrous oxide but are not
          effective that the cations which are effective have a fairly
          definite minimum diameter whereas the non-effective cations
          have a substantially smaller diameter. The minimum effective
          diameter depends upon the structure of the hydrous oxide. In
          the case of montmorillonite, the principal constituent of
          bentonite, the minimum diameter of the cations of effective
          agents appears to be about 2.6 Angstrom units or at least
          about as large as the spacing between the opposite oxygen
          atoms in the haexagonal silicon-oxygen sheet of the unit
          crystal of montmorillonite. Such cations apparently enter the
          films by base exchange and are bound by residual valencies and
          serve to bind adjacent unit sheet-parcels together whereas
          smaller cations, even though they may enter the film by base
          exchange and become fixed in the lattice structure by residual
          valencies fall into the internal structure of the lattice and
          remain free-moving in the space available and do not bind the
          adjacent unit-parcels together. </p>
        <p>I have found both inorganic and organic agents to be
          effective in rendering the films water resistant. Examples of
          operable agents are concentrated solutions of potassium
          hydroxide, mercurous nitrate, calcium, barium, strontium,
          magnesium, manganese, cobalt and lead chlorides (lead chloride
          is effective only in hot solution), magnesium, cobalt and
          copper nitrates, zinc, manganese, nickel and copper sulfates,
          calcium, barium, magnesium, zinc, uranium, copper and lead
          acetates, iron chlorides and thorium nitrates, chromium and
          aluminum sulfates, chromium and iron acetates and colloidal
          iron oxide and aluminum oxide dispersions. Various acids were
          tried and found to be less effective. The results of extensive
          testing of compounds indicates that the anions of the
          compounds used are of secondary importance only and that the
          prime requisites of the operable compounds are that their
          cations shall be capable of base exchange with the
          exchangeable base of the silicate and that the compound shall
          be sufficiently soluble in water, which solubility may be
          increased by heating, are effective. The organic compound
          trimethylbenzyl ammonium hydroxide also was found to be
          effective. Most of these treating agents for rendering the
          films water resistant also tend to render the film more
          brittle which brittleness, however, may be removed by the
          action of the agents to be disclosed hereinafter for
          increasing flexibility. Films treated with colloidal ferric
          oxide or colloidal alumina are rendered water resistant.
          Colloidal ferric oxide or colloidal alumina when added to a
          sol or gel of bentonite in sufficient amounts cause incipient
          flocculation and the film produced from the resulting mixture
          is water resistant. This fact supports my theory that the
          anion of the added agent is of secondary importance so far as
          rendering of the films water insoluble is concerned. It
          indicates that rendering the films insoluble is essentially an
          elctrokinetic phenomenon and that colloids of opposite charge
          to those of the film-forming material generally may serve to
          render the films insoluble in water. In the case of iron oxide
          and alumina it appears that their positively charged colloidal
          nuclei have replaced the adsorbed cation of the bentonite. </p>
        <p>Examples of agents capable of improving the flexibility of
          the films are ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol
          monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, methyl
          acetate, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, butyl acetate,
          cellosolve acetate, methyl cellosolve acetate, ethylene
          glycol, propylene glycol, methyl isobutyl ketone, diisobutyl
          ketone, and butyl carbinol. A consideration of these compounds
          and a comparison thereof with other compounds which are not
          effective leads to the generalization that those organic
          compounds which are at least partially soluble in water and do
          not contain an aromatic ring or a side chain in the middle of
          the molecule are effective. In other words, the solubility and
          the configuration of the molecule of the treating agent appear
          to determine its ability to soften the film. The molecule of
          the treating agent apparently must be free of any group which
          results in steric hindrance and prevents the molecule from
          entering the aluminum silicate lattice. </p>
        <p>A film treated with lead acetate to produce water resistance
          after drying for several days at 105°C was found to have an
          electrical resistance of the order 10<sup>13</sup> ohms per cm<sup>3</sup>
          and a breakdown resistance of 2000-3000 volts per mil. On
          exposure to the atmosphere after the heating to 105°C the
          electrical resistance of the film remained unchanged. </p>
        <p>Films may be softened without being rendered water resistant
          by applying only the above described treatment for the latter
          purpose but the resulting films are water soluble or swellable
          if immersed in pure water. </p>
        <p>Various combinations of the two treatments may be applied.
          The preferred treatment is to first waterproof the film and
          then improve its flexibility but it is possible to reverse the
          order of these steps. </p>
        <p>I claim: </p>
        <p>1. Process which comprises forming a coherent self-supporting
          flexible solid body consisting essentially of a crystalline
          inorganic hydrous oxide containing structural water and
          capable if swelling when brought in contact with water to form
          a plastic hydro-gel and exhibiting base exchange properties
          and rendering said solid body insoluble in water by the action
          of a soluble electrolyte salt containing a cation capable of
          base exchange with said hydrous oxide, the exchanging cation
          being less hydrated than the exchanged cation. </p>
        <p>2. Process as defined in claim 1 in which the electrolyte
          salt is added to the hydrous oxide prior to formation of the

          <p>Ernst A. Hauser</p>
        </center>
        <p>In my application Serial # 212,398, filed June 7, 1938, I
          have described the production of coherent, self-supporting,
          flexible solid bodies such as films, filaments and the like
          from natural crystalline inorganic hydrous oxides containing
          structural water and capable of swelling when brought in
          contact with water to form plastic hydro-gels and exhibiting
          base exchange properties such as hydrous aluminum and
          magnesium silicates, i.e., bentonite. According to said
          application the material is refined by suspending it in water
          and centrifuging or settling to separate gritty material,
          probably consisting principally of quartz, and coarse
          particles substantially exceeding colloidal size so as to
          produce a product consisting principally of particles of the
          substantially pure material of colloidal dimensions. It is
          further indicated in said application to be desirable to
          produce a suspension of the smaller particle sizes such as
          0.01 to 0.5 micron in which the particles are nearly of the
          same size, i.e., substantially monodisperse. </p>
        <p>I have now found that it is possible to produce coherent,
          self-supporting flexible films, filaments and the like from
          sols and gels of such hydrous oxides which although of
          colloidal dimensions are not substantially monodisperse.
          According to my present experience self-supporting films,
          filaments, etc., can be made from any sol or gel of the
          specified materials of any polydisperse or monodisperse
          character so long as the particles are of colloidal
          dimensions. It is further indicated in said application to be
          desirable to produce a suspension of the smaller particle
          sizes such as 0.01 to 0.5 micron in which the particles are
          nearly of the same size, i.e., substantially monodisperse. </p>
        <p>I have now found that it is possible to produce coherent,
          self-supporting, flexible films, filaments and the like from
          sols and gels of such hydrous oxides which although of
          colloidal dimensions are not substantially monodisperse.
          According to my present experience, self-supporting films,
          filaments, etc., can be made from any sol or gel of the
          specified materials of any polydisperse or monodisperse
          character so long as the particles are of colloidal
          dimensions. </p>
        <p>The hydrous oxide may be found in the natural state in
          sufficient purity that no refining is necessary. Such material
          may be simply suspended in water and used directly. In the
          case of a magnesium silicate bentonite which is commercially
          available and contains practically no particles over 1 micron
          in diameter, it may be suspended in water, allowed to settle
          for a short time to remove any coarse particles, concentrated
          to a gel and used. The refining of the hydrous oxide may of
          course be carried out in any suitable way such as by the use
          of any suitable suspending liquid other than water or by wind
          sifting and the refined material then suspended in water to
          swell the particles and form the gel. </p>
        <p>It will be further understood that whether the sol or the gel
          is used as the film forming material the gel stage immediately
          precedes the solid state. If the sol is applied to a surface
          as a coating it passes through the gel state to the solid
          state by drying. The sol is quite dilute and highly fluid and
          will produce only a relatively thin deposit of solid material.
          If a small amount of electrolyte is added to a sol, it will
          form a gel which may be used for the production of films but
          here again the high dilution of the gel or the low
          concentration of solids must be considered. If the addition of
          electrolyte to the sol is carried so far as to cause
          precipitation or flocculation the resulting suspension is
          practically useless for the production of films. But a gel
          produced by concentration and containing a sufficiently high
          concentration of solids, e.g., 3% or higher or such a gel
          after slight or incipient flocculation without precipitation
          by the addition of electrolyte may be used directly for the
          production of films, filaments, and the like. The air-dried
          film, filament, or the like, however prepared, generally
          contains 6-10% of water. </p>
        <p>In bentonite, the essential ingredient appears to be the
          mineral montmorillonite which generally constitutes 75% or
          more of bentonites which are found to be suitable for the
          production of films, filaments, or the like. </p>
        <p>The present invention is more particularly concerned with the
          use of the natural crystalline inorganic hydrous oxides
          capable of forming plastic hydro-gels in combination with
          other materials for the production of various coherent,
          self-supporting and flexible articles such as films, coatings,
          filaments, etc., of the type generally regarded as being
          obtainable by suitable manipulation of liquid or plastic,
          i.e., flowable or moldable, compositions consisting or
          comprising an ingredient capable of solidifying and of acting
          as a matrix. </p>
        <p>In accordance with my present invention, the sol or gel of
          the hydrous oxide may be mixed with a variety of
          water-insoluble solid materials including organic fibrous
          materials such as paper pulp, jute, silk, cotton, synthetic
          fibers, etc., inorganic fibrous materials such as asbestos,
          rock wool, glass wool, etc., powdered or flake materials such
          as ground mica, metal flakes or powders, e.g., aluminum and
          copper powders, dyes and pigments such as titanium dioxide,
          lithopone, carbon black, etc., and with water emulsions of
          plastic water-insoluble materials such as asphaltum,
          nitrocellulose and waxes. In certain instances, the hydrous
          oxide itself may serve as the emulsifying agent, as for
          example, in the case of asphalt and waxes. Fibrous materials
          either individually dispersed or in the form of a more or less
          loosely matted fabric generally serve to strengthen the films,
          filaments, etc., especially with respect to tear resistance. </p>

        <p><b>Description ~</b> </p>
        <p>This invention relates primarily to paper making processes
          that utilise bentonite and to novel fluid bentonite
          concentrates suitable for use in these processes. The
          invention also relates to other processes in which such
          concentrates are useful. </p>
        <p>There are many paper making processes which comprise
          providing a cellulosic suspension at a paper mill, mixing an
          activated bentonite dispersion into the cellulosic suspension
          and draining the suspension to form a wet sheet, which is then
          dried to provide paper (including paper board). In some
          instances the bentonite is added at the thick stock stage (for
          instance for stickies control) and the suspension is diluted
          to a thin stock before drainage, but in other processes the
          bentonite dispersion is added at the thin stock stage. It can
          be added before a polymeric retention aid, but there is
          particular interest in microparticulate processes, wherein the
          cellulosic suspension is subjected to shearing after adding
          the polymeric retention aid, and the bentonite is then added
          to the sheared suspension prior to drainage. </p>
        <p>It is necessary that the bentonite should be in a highly
          swollen, activated, form and in practice this means that it
          should be in the form of a monovalent salt of bentonite such
          as sodium bentonite. Although there are some naturally
          occurring sources of sodium bentonite, most natural bentonites
          are alkaline earth bentonites, generally calcium or magnesium
          bentonites. The normal practice is to activate the alkaline
          earth bentonite by ion exchanging the calcium or magnesium for
          sodium or other alkali metal or ammonium ion. Generally this
          is done by exposing the bentonite to an aqueous solution of
          sodium carbonate, although some other activating materials are
          known, for instance as described in JP-A-64-45754. </p>
        <p>Because of the high viscosifying effect of activated
          bentonite, it is not convenient to transport or handle a
          simple dispersion of activated bentonite in water which has a
          solids content of greater than around 5%. It is not convenient
          to supply such a dilute composition to the mill and so the
          normal way of supplying bentonite to a paper mill is in solid
          form. The mill mixes bentonite powder with water and
          optionally activating chemicals generally to form an activated
          dispersion having a solids content of around 3 to 5% and this
          is then generally diluted to around 0.05 to 1% prior to
          addition to the cellulosic suspension. This necessitates that
          the mill should be equipped with apparatus for handling and
          mixing the powder and the dilute dispersion. </p>
        <p>It is known to make aqueous dispersions of bentonite having a
          higher solids content. The first disclosure of this in
          connection with the production of bentonite for paper making
          is in EP-A-485,124 wherein the bentonite is dispersed at high
          solids, for instance up to 27 to 30%, as a slurry in an
          aqueous solution of sodium chloride or other inorganic
          electrolyte. optionally some sodium polyacrylate can be used.
          The bentonite which is dispersed in this manner is preferably
          a commercial (typically calcium) bentonite containing sodium
          carbonate activator. Thus the activation of the bentonite is
          completed when the slurry is diluted with water to make a
          flowable dilute dispersion. </p>
        <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,538 is another disclosure of making
          concentrated bentonite slurries for paper making, again
          concentrating primarily on the use of sodium chloride or other
          inorganic electrolyte for depressing the viscosity of the
          slurry. In this publication, however, the bentonite is always
          introduced in sodium form. Various electrolytes are
          exemplified. Amongst these, there is an example of forming 25%
          bentonite gel with 2.5 or 5% sodium citrate in water. It is
          shown that these gels have viscosities respectively of 40,000
          and 5,500 cps (Brookfield, 20 rpm) and that they gel on
          standing for 24 hours. The preferred material is said to be
          sodium chloride. </p>
        <p>U.S. Pat. No. 5,391,228 repeats much of the disclosure of
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,266,538 but adds disclosure of a process in
          which calcium bentonite and sodium carbonate are slurried in
          aqueous sodium chloride (i.e., similar to the preferred
          process in EP 485,124). It also mentions the use of sodium
          salts such as sodium chloride or several others (including
          sodium citrate) in combination with a dispersant salt which is
          usually sodium silicate or tetra sodium pyrophosphate or
          sodium polyacrylate (again as suggested in EP 485,124). </p>
        <p>There has been some commercial use of bentonite concentrates
          made in sodium chloride or other inorganic electrolytes but
          this use has demonstrated some practical difficulties. One
          difficulty is that it can be difficult to achieve a dispersion
          which is wholly stable against hard settling, i.e., there is a
          risk that, if any settling does occur, it may create a hard
          precipitate which is difficult to redisperse. However even
          when the concentrated slurry is formulated so as to eliminate
          this problem, it is found necessary to interpose an extra
          activation period during the dilution of the concentrate and
          prior to addition to the cellulosic suspension. Thus, it is
          necessary to dilute the concentrate with water and then allow
          this to mix or stand for a sufficient period to allow activity
          to recover, prior to addition of the diluted dispersion to the
          cellulosic suspension. The reason for this is that the sodium
          chloride or other electrolytes which have been preferred (from
          the point of view of convenience and efficiency of dispersion
          formation) all have the disadvantage that the sodium chloride
          or other electrolyte seems to cause salting out and double
          layer compression in the bentonite structure because of the
          high ionic strength. Thus it is necessary to give prolonged
          mixing with dilution water to allow the bentonite to try to
          recover to as highly an activated condition as is possible. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, however, full recovery of performance does not
          seem to be possible and it is a fact that the performance of
          dilute activated bentonite dispersions made by dilution of a
          concentrated slurry has proved to be inferior to the
          performance of a dilute activated bentonite dispersion made by
          direct dispersion of the corresponding bentonite powder (and
          activator) in water. </p>
        <p>It would be desirable to be able to provide a bentonite
          concentrate which has the advantages of high solids content
          and fluidity and stability with the potential for giving
          activity in use equivalent to the optimum activity which is
          obtainable from the corresponding dry bentonite. In
          particular, it would be desirable to be able to provide paper
          making processes in which the mill can be supplied with a
          concentrate but can then easily and conveniently use that
          concentrate under conditions whereby performance is
          substantially equivalent to the performance previously
          obtainable using the corresponding bentonite supplied to the
          mill in powder form. </p>
        <p>The normal way of providing bentonite (either for supply as
          powder or as a concentrate) comprises digging the bentonite
          out of the ground, wet mulling it with sodium carbonate or
          other activator, drying the mixture, grinding it, air
          classifying it and then supplying the resultant powder either
          direct to the user or to the slurrying facility where it is
          converted into a concentrate. It would be desirable to
          simplify this procedure. </p>
        <p>In one aspect of the invention we make paper by a process
          comprising forming a cellulosic suspension, mixing an
          activated bentonite dispersion into the cellulosic suspension,
          draining the cellulosic suspension to form a wet sheet and
          drying the sheet, and in this process the activated bentonite
          dispersion added to the cellulosic suspension is either a
          stable fluid bentonite concentrate or is a dilute bentonite
          dispersion made by diluting the concentrate with water, and
          the concentrate is a dispersion of 15 to 40% by weight of
          bentonite in water containing citrate in a fluid stabilising
          and activating amount which is such that the concentrate has a
          viscosity (Brookfield, 20 rpm, spindle 4) of below 5,000 cps.
        </p>
        <p>The invention also includes the novel concentrate which is a
          dispersion of 15 to 40% by weight of bentonite in water
          containing citrate in a fluid stabilising and activating
          amount which is such that the concentrate has a viscosity
          (Brookfield, 20 rpm, spindle 4) of below 5,000 cps. </p>
        <p>The concentrate can be made using natural sodium bentonite or
          previously activated bentonite, but is particularly preferred
          that the concentrate should be formed from alkaline earth
          bentonite (in practice calcium and/or magnesium bentonite) by
          blending the alkaline earth bentonite with water and alkali
          metal or ammonium citrate (in practice sodium citrate) as
          activator and stabiliser. Thus by this technique it is
          possible simultaneously to activate the bentonite and convert
          it into a stable concentrate. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, another aspect of the invention comprises
          blending alkaline earth bentonite with water and sodium
          citrate (or other alkali metal or ammonium citrate) and
          thereby forming a concentrate of 15 to 40% by weight activated
          bentonite in water containing citrate. </p>
        <p>The paper making processes of the invention have several
          advantages compared to known processes of making paper using
          bentonite. In particular, by the invention it is now possible
          to obtain performance in such processes equivalent to that
          which is obtainable using the corresponding bentonite in
          powder form but without the inconvenience of having to handle
          powder. Thus, for the first time, we are now providing a
          bentonite concentrate which, when diluted into the cellulosic
          suspension, gives performance substantially equivalent to the
          corresponding powder and considerably improved compared to the
          corresponding concentrate made using the previously preferred
          activator and stabiliser, namely sodium chloride. </p>
        <p>A further advantage is that the concentrate can be used
          without undergoing a prior dilution activation stage. Thus
          whereas the prior concentrates made using sodium chloride had
          to be diluted in water and then allowed to stand to activate
          or recover their activity, the concentrates of the invention
          can, without significant loss of performance, either be mixed
          direct into the cellulosic suspension (i.e., without any prior
          dilution) or can be converted to a dilute bentonite dispersion
          by diluting the concentrate substantially immediately before
          mixing the dilute bentonite dispersion with the cellulosic
          suspension. For instance the concentrate can be diluted in
          line as it is being fed towards or into the cellulosic
          suspension, without any significant holding stage between the
          dilution and the addition of the diluted dispersion to the
          cellulosic suspension. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, in preferred processes the undiluted concentrate
          is mixed into the cellulosic suspension or the concentrate is
          diluted with water to form a dilute bentonite dispersion which
          is then mixed substantially immediately with the cellulosic
          suspension. If there is predilution, preferably the diluted
          bentonite dispersion is mixed into the cellulosic suspension
          in less than 5 minutes and often less than 2 minutes from the
          start of dilution. If there is predilution, the dilution is
          preferably in line and does not involve any significant
          holding tank or stage prior to addition to the cellulosic
          suspension. This is in contrast to the preferred concentrates
          that are described in EP 485,124 and U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,266,538
          and 5,391,228 as being used in paper making, since all such
          concentrates would necessarily have involved a considerable
          holding stage in an attempt at recovering activity, and the
          recovered activity would still have been inferior to the
          activity of the corresponding powder or the activity of the
          bentonite in the invention. </p>
        <p>For instance, in paper making, performance can be indicated
          by a simple test such as drainage time. The dry weight of
          bentonite required to give a particular drainage time in a
          particular test using the slurries of the invention is usually
          no more than, and often is about the same as, when the same
          bentonite had been activated from powder using sodium
          carbonate in conventional manner, whereas the dosage of
          bentonite required to give the same performance when the
          bentonite is provided as a slurry in aqueous sodium chloride
          is often at least 25% or 30% more, frequently at least 60%
          more, and often double. Thus the use of slurries in accordance
          with the invention can result in a saving of at least 25% and
          often at least 50% in the amount of bentonite that is required
          to give any particular performance result, compared to
          slurries made using sodium chloride. </p>
        <p>Another advantage of the invention arises in paper making
          processes and other environments where the performance of
          conventional activated bentonites (eg obtained by activation
          from powder using sodium carbonate in conventional manner) is
          depressed by the pH or the osmotic pressure of hardness salts.
          Thus conventional bentonites tend to be less effective when
          the cellulosic suspension has pH below about 6.5, for instance
          in the range 4.2 to 5.5, than when the suspension has a higher
          pH, for instance 7 to 7.5. Surprisingly the activated
          bentonites obtained in the invention can perform very well in
          such suspensions without any significant loss of activity.
          Thus the use of the slurries in acidic suspensions can give a
          large improvement in the paper making process compared to the
          use of known bentonites. </p>
        <p>Conventional activated bentonites also may have inferior
          performance when the cellulosic suspension is made using
          relatively hard water, for instance having a hardness above
          10.degree. dH and typically in the range 15.degree.dH to
          50.degree.dH. Improved performance is obtained using the
          bentonites obtained in the invention in such hard waters. This
          improvement may be manifested by improved drainage rates or by
          reducing scale deposition or both. </p>
        <p>A further advantage of the compositions made by activation of
          alkaline-earth bentonite with sodium citrate is that they can
          have lower pH (neutral or near neutral) than prevails when
          activation is by sodium carbonate. </p>
        <p>The amounts of citrate and bentonite in the slurry will be
          inter-related in that greater amounts of citrate will be
          required with greater amounts of bentonite than with lesser
          amounts of bentonite. The amount must be sufficient that the
          concentrate is a stable fluid and, when the bentonite is being
          activated in the concentrate, that full activation of the
          bentonite by ion exchange occurs. The amount (calculated as
          sodium citrate) is usually in the range 1% to 100% based on
          the dry weight of bentonite. Often it is at least 10% and
          preferably at least 16%, for instance at least 20%. Often it
          is below 60%, and frequently not more than 40%. </p>
        <p>When the bentonite is introduced as alkaline earth bentonite,
          it is preferred that sodium citrate is substantially the only
          activating material in the suspension. Thus if small amounts
          of other activators (for instance sodium carbonate) are
          present, preferably their effect on activation is minor
          relative to the effect of the sodium citrate. Preferably the
          sodium citrate is the only activator. </p>
        <p>Similarly, it is generally preferred that citrate is
          substantially the only dispersion stabiliser in the
          concentrate. If other materials are present, preferably their
          effect is minor compared to that of the citrate. Preferably
          the citrate is the only dispersion stabiliser. </p>
        <p>By saying that the citrate is substantially the only
          activator and/or dispersion stabiliser, we intend to allow for
          minor amounts of other components, for instance in a weight
          amount of not more than 20% and preferably not more than 10%
          by weight of the citrate. However larger amounts can be used
          provided they do not detract from the performance of the
          citrate. </p>
        <p>The amount of bentonite in the concentrate should be at least
          15% by weight (dry weight bentonite based on the total weight
          of the concentrated dispersion) since it tends to be
          uneconomic to provide a concentrate having lower bentonite
          content. It is not usually more than about 35%, and often not
          more than 30%, since it becomes more difficult to provide a
          concentrate of good quality bentonite wherein the concentrate
          has good fluid stability when the amount of bentonite is very
          high. However when the bentonite is of rather poor quality,
          i.e., having rather low swelling potential, then amounts of
          bentonite above 35%, and in some instances even up to 50%, may
          be appropriate. </p>
        <p>In practice the amount of bentonite is usually at least 20%
          and often up to 28, 30 or 35% by weight. </p>
        <p>The bentonite can be introduced in sodium form, as a result
          of being a naturally occurring sodium bentonite, or it can be
          introduced as activated bentonite formed by previously
          activating alkaline earth metal bentonite with sodium
          carbonate or other activator, in which event some residual
          sodium carbonate may be carried into the concentrate. When the
          bentonite is introduced in sodium form, the citrate can be
          added in any convenient form, for instance as citric acid or
          as alkali metal or ammonium citrate, for instance potassium,
          sodium or ammonium citrate. Generally it is preferred to use
          sodium citrate or, in some instances, citric acid together
          with sufficient sodium hydroxide to form sodium citrate. When
          the bentonite is introduced as alkaline earth metal bentonite,
          then it is preferred for the citrate to be introduced as
          sodium citrate. </p>
        <p>The amount of citrate which is required to form a stable
          suspension will depend upon the nature of the bentonite and
          the nature of its ionic form. There is some evidence
          indicating that if the bentonite is introduced in sodium form
          then larger amounts of citrate may be required than when the
          bentonite is introduced in calcium or magnesium form (i.e.,
          larger amounts may be required to give equivalent fluidity).
          Also, the amount which is required will vary according to the
          grade of bentonite and so it is necessary to conduct tests to
          determine the optimum for any particular grade and chemical
          type of bentonite. The nature of the water may also influence
          the amount of citrate. </p>
        <p>If the amount of citrate is inadequate then the concentrated
          dispersion will have too high a viscosity when initially
          manufactured and/or will not be a stable fluid and/or will be
          unacceptably thixotropic and/or will form an unacceptable gel
          on standing. If the amount is too high then the dispersion may
          become thinner than is desirable and may even become an
          unstable thin dispersion. </p>
        <p>By routine experimentation it is possible to select an amount
          of citrate, for any particular bentonite and water quality,
          that is necessary to give a fluid stable dispersion having the
          desired viscosity. By saying that the dispersion is a fluid
          stable dispersion we mean that it does not settle to give a
          hard, unredispersible, precipitate and does not gel to give an
          unacceptable gel, and preferably remains as a fluid which is
          homogeneous or which can easily be made homogeneous by simple
          stirring. In practice, the compositions of the invention can
          easily be formulated such that a small amount of supernatent
          may accumulate on storage but the composition otherwise
          appears homogeneous. The quoted viscosity is preferably
          maintained throughout storage and, in any event the suspension
          should have the quoted viscosity 48 hours after initial
          manufacture. </p>
        <p>Generally the viscosity is below 4000 cps and it can be below
          2000 cps. It is usually undesirable for the voiscosity to be
          too low and so should be above 100 cps and generally it is
          above 500 cps, often above 1000 cps. All viscosity values are
          measured at room temperature. The suspension can be
          thixotropic provided it is easily possible to cause it to flow
          when required. The suspension must be easily miscible with
          water, by simple stirring. </p>
        <p>The amount of citrate, measured as sodium citrate, is usually
          at least 3% and most usually at least 5% by weight (based on
          the total weight of the dispersion). When the bentonite is
          introduced as an alkaline earth bentonite, amounts of 3% or 4%
          can be adequate, but at least 5% or 6% is usually preferred.
          When the bentonite is introduced as sodium bentonite, amounts
          of at least 6% are generally preferred. Irrespective of
          whether the bentonite is sodium, calcium or magnesium, the
          amount can be as much as 20% but usually is less than 15% by
          weight, with preferably not more than 12%. Amounts of 6 to 10%
          are often suitable. </p>
        <p>It will be appreciated that slurries which have been made by
          activating alkaline earth metal bentonite with sodium citrate
          can be identified by virtue of the fact that the aqueous
          medium will contain calcium or magnesium citrate, deriving
          from the ion exchange of the sodium of the sodium citrate with
          the calcium or magnesium of the alkaline earth bentonite. </p>
        <p>The bentonite can be any of the anionic swelling clays that
          are conventionally referred to as bentonites. These are
          usually smectites or montmorillonites, the latter being
          preferred. Suitable smectite or montmorillonite clays include
          Wyoming bentonite and Fullers Earth and various clays
          including those known by the chemical terms hectorite or
          bentonite. </p>
        <p>The stability of the concentrates of the invention should be
          such that they maintain fluidity (often thixotropic fluidity)
          for at least a week and preferably several weeks or months,
          and in particular such that they do not provide a hard
          sediment (which is difficult to redisperse) during normal
          storage or transport. </p>
        <p>The concentrate can be used in any paper making process where
          an activated bentonite dispersion is added to the cellulosic
          stock. For instance it can be used in processes where the
          bentonite dispersion is added as a pitch dispersant, generally
          at the thick stock stage (e.g., when the cellulosic suspension
          contains more than 2% cellulose). </p>
        <p>The invention is preferably applied to processes in which the
          bentonite is incorporated as part of the retention system,
          either to prepare the cellulosic fibres for retention by a
          polymer or as part of a microparticulate retention system. </p>
        <p>One paper-making process to which the invention can be
          applied is a process in which bentonite is added to a
          cellulosic suspension, typically in an amount of 0.02 to 2%
          dry weight, and a polymeric retention aid is added
          subsequently, generally after the last point of high shear
          (for instance in the head box immediately prior to drainage).
          The polymer can be non-ionic, anionic or cationic. The
          cellulosic suspension can be made from relatively pure pulp or
          from pulp having a relatively high cationic demand. </p>
        <p>Processes of this type that are of particular value are those
          in which the pulp has a relatively high cationic demand and
          the polymer is substantially non-ionic or anionic and the
          paper product is preferably newsprint or fluting medium.
          Processes of this type in which the total filler content is
          relatively low are described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,305,781 and
          EP-A-17353 to which reference should be made for further
          details of suitable non-ionic or low ionic polymers and
          suitable cellulosic suspensions and which is hereby
          incorporated by reference. More highly ionic or cationic
          polymers can also be used. These processes are of particular
          value when the cellulosic suspension contains de-inked waste.
          Suitable polymers and fillers (when the pulp is filled) are
          also described in EP-A-608986 and AU-A-63977/86. </p>
        <p>It is particularly preferred to apply the invention to
          microparticulate paper making processes, namely processes in
          which polymeric retention aid is added to the cellulosic
          suspension, the suspension is subjected to shearing, and the
          bentonite is then added after the shearing, and often after
          the last point of high shear for instance at the headbox,
          prior to drainage. The polymer can be anionic or non-ionic but
          is often cationic. It can be a natural material such as
          cationic starch but is preferably a synthetic polymer. </p>
        <p>The shearing can be due merely to turbulence along a duct but
          preferably it is caused by passage through a centriscreen or
          other cleaning device or a fan pump or a mixing pump or other
          device for deliberately applying shear. Preferred processes
          include those commercialised by the applicants under the trade
          mark Hydrocol and are described in, for instance, EP-B-235,893
          and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,753,710, 4,913,775 and 4,969,976 and
          EP-B-335,575, all of which are hereby incorporated by
          reference. The optimum amount of polymeric retentin aid can be
          determined by routine experimentation and will depend upon the
          nature of the cellulosic suspension and, inter alia, on
          whether or not low molecular weight high charge density
          cationic polymer and/or cationic starch and/or other dry
          strength resin has been incorporated in the suspension, all as
          described inthe aforementioned patents. </p>
        <p>The polymeric retention aids which are used are usually water
          soluble, or substantially water soluble polymers of
          ethylenically unsaturated monomers and usually have molecular
          weight above 500,000 (measured by gel permeation
          chromatography) or usually intrinsic viscosity (measured by
          suspended level viscometer in 1N sodium chloride buffered to
          pH 7 at 25.degree. C.) of at least 4 dl/g. </p>
        <p>Suitable polymers are described in the aforementioned
          patents. </p>
        <p>The amount of the bentonite which is used in all these
          processes can be within the conventional ranges which are
          described in the aforementioned patents. As mentioned above,
          the bentonite can be added into the cellulosic suspension
          either while it is still in the form of the concentrate or
          simultaneously with or soon after dilution with water. This
          dilution can be to, for instance, a solids content in the
          range 3 to 8% or it can be dilution to a solids content of
          below 3%, for instance down to 0.1% or even less in some
          instances. </p>
        <p>The invention also includes processes in which the novel
          concentrate is used for other purposes. For instance it can be
          used in pulp dewatering, paper sludge dewatering, liquid solid
          separation processes, effluent clarification, inky waste water
          clarification all in paper-related industries, and it can be
          used in other industries. For instance it can be a convenient
          way of formulating a bentonite slurry which is to be pumped
          for eventual use in any of the known ways of using bentonite
          in other industries. It can be used as a convenient way of
          introducing bentonite into iron ore pelletisation processes
          where the bentonite is being used in conventional manner as a
          binder. </p>
        <p>The invention also includes a process of making an activated
          bentonite slurry comprising quarrying raw alkaline earth
          bentonite and mixing the quarried material with water and
          sodium citrate and thereby forming a coarse slurry containing
          at least 10% bentonite and filtering, classifying or cleaning
          the slurry. The filtering can be any process designed to
          remove physically large or dense material not suitable for the
          final process. The size of the filter classification will be
          selected so that the resultant bentonite particles that are
          preferably within the size range which is conventional for
          activating bentonite for the ultimate intended use. The filter
          may be, for instance, a cyclonic cleaning device or other
          classifying device or cleaning device. </p>
        <p>Having removed the waste material by filtration, the
          resultant slurry can then be dried in conventional manner to
          make powdered activated bentonite or it can be supplied to a
          user as a concentrated dispersion in accordance with the
          invention. If this is required, then naturally the amount of
          bentonite which is slurried into the water and sodium citrate
          should be sufficient to give a concentrated dispersion in
          accordance with the invention. Thus generally the amount of
          bentonite which is slurried into the water and sodium citrate
          is in the range 15 to 40%. The amount of sodium citrate which
          is required for this process must be sufficient to provide for
          activation of the alkaline earth bentonite. If it is not
          necessary for the slurry to be stable then it can be less than
          the amount which is required to give fluid stability to the
          slurry. </p>
        <p>This process of making activated bentonite eliminates many of
          the stages associated with conventional production of
          activated bentonite. Thus it is now possible to eliminate the
          conventional stages of wet mulling, drying and grinding and
          air classifying and, instead, they can be replaced by the
          simple on-line or batch process of slurrying the bentonite
          into aqueous sodium citrate and filtering (including
          classifying and cleaning). </p>
        <p>Similarly, other concentrates, such as concentrates made
          using any of fluid stabilisers mentioned in EP 485,124, can be
          made by the same general technique modified by the use of the
          stabilisers of EP 485,124 in place of the sodium citrate.
          Similarly, other materials mentioned in U.S. Pat. Nos.
          5,266,538 or 5,391,228 can be used in place of the sodium
          citrate. However all these modified processes would have the
          disadvantage that the final product does not have the
          advantages which are described above in connection with the
          products made using citrate. </p>
        <p>The following are examples. </p>
        <p>Example 1 (Comparative) </p>
        <p>Dispersion A is made by slurrying 5 parts calcium bentonite
          in 95 parts water. </p>
        <p>Dispersion B is made by the conventional activating procedure
          of slurrying a mixture of 4.7 parts calcium bentonite, 0.3
          parts sodium carbonate and 95 parts water to give a 5%
          composition of sodium bentonite, which is then usually further
          diluted with water prior to use. </p>
        <p>Dispersion C is made by slurrying 23.5 g calcium bentonite
          and 1.5 g sodium carbonate (thus providing 25 g sodium
          bentonite) with 3 g sodium chloride and 72 g water. This 25%
          slurry then has to be activated in water, typically after
          dilution to about 5%, prior to use. </p>
        <p>Accordingly, the processes using dispersion B are typical of
          those conducted using conventional powdered bentonite which
          has to be activated before use, and processes using dispersion
          C are typical of those using sodium chloride slurries as in
          the prior art discussed above. </p>
        <p>Example 2 </p>
        <p>25 parts by weight calcium bentonite, 6 parts by weight
          sodium citrate and 69 parts by weight water are thoroughly
          mixed together to form a fluid suspension. This is labelled
          dispersion D. After standing for 48 hours, it had a Brookfield
          viscosity, measured at 20 rpm of 575 cP. </p>
        <p>When the process was repeated using 10 parts sodium citrate
          and 65 parts water, to make dispersion E, the viscosity after
          48 hours was 737 cP. </p>
        <p>Dispersion F was formed in similar manner using 9 parts
          sodium citrate, 66 parts water and 25 parts of a sodium
          bentonite made by premixing 23.5 parts calcium bentonite and
          1.5 parts sodium carbonate. </p>
        <p>Dispersion G was made using 25 parts calcium bentonite, 9
          parts sodium citrate and 66 parts water. </p>
        <p>Example 3 </p>
        <p>In this example various of the dispersions given above are
          utilised in a laboratory simulation of processes such as those
          described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,753,710. A suitable thinstock
          (usually 0.5% bleached Kraft Furnish) is provided, an
          appropriate dosage (usually 500 g per ton) of a high molecular
          weight (typically intrinsic viscosity 6 dl/g) cationic
          polyacrylamide (usually 40% by weight dimethylaminomethyl
          acrylate quarternised with methyl chloride and 60% by weight
          acrylamide) is added, the suspension is sheared for 60 seconds
          at 1,500 rpm, the required dosage of bentonite dispersion is
          added, the mixture is subjected to gentle mixing and the
          Schopper Riegler drainage time is recorded for 700 ml to drain
          from 1,000 ml of the treated suspension, using a baffled Britt
          jar. </p>
        <p>Each of the following tables represents a different set of
          experiments. In each set of experiments, the amounts in the
          column headed "Bentonite" always indicate the dosage of
          bentonite expressed in dry weight grams per ton paper and the
          figures in the columns headed by letters B to G show the
          drainage time using the shown amount of bentonite introduced,
          respectively, as dispersions B to G. In each instance, for the
          purposes of this test, the best results are obtained with the
          lowest drainage time, especially when this is obtained at a
          low dose of bentonite. <br>

        <p>This clearly demonstrates the fact that the sodium citrate
          slurry concentrate of the inventive gives, at all dosages, a
          performance which is dramatically better than the performance
          attainable with the sodium chloride slurry of the prior art. </p>
        <p>Example 4 </p>
        <p>This example demonstrates that it is unimportant in the
          invention whether or not the bentonite concentrate is diluted
          before addition to the cellulosic suspension, whereas this
          makes a critical difference with the prior art concentrates. </p>
        <p>Thus, when a 25% slurry in aqueous sodium chloride is diluted
          first to 5% and then to 0.25%, the drainage time in a test
          using 2000 g/t bentonite is about 75 seconds compared to 30
          seconds for the corresponding bentonite powder. When the
          dilution is direct from 25% to 0.25%, the drainage time is
          even worse. </p>
        <p>When a 25% slurry in sodium citrate is used, the drainage
          time at 2000 g/t is about 30, irrespective of the system of
          dilution. </p>

          the only activator in the concentrate. </p>
        <p>7. A process according to claim 1 in which citrate is the
          only dispersion stabiliser in the concentrate. </p>
        <p>8. A process according to claim 1 in which the amount of
          bentonite is 20 to 35% by weight of the concentrate. </p>
        <p>9. A process according to claim 1 in which the amount of
          citrate, measured as sodium citrate, is 3 to 20% by weight of
          the concentrate. </p>
        <p>10. A process according to claim in which the amount of
          citrate, measured as sodium citrate, is at least 6% by weight
          based on the weight of the concentrate. </p>
        <p>11. A concentrate which is a stable, fluid, bentonite
          dispersion of 15 to 40% by weight bentonite in water
          containing citrate in a fluid stabilising and activating
          amount which is such that the concentrate has a viscosity
          (Brookfield, 20 rpm, spindle 4) of below 2000 cps. </p>
        <p>12. A concentrate according to claim 11 which has been made
          by blending alkaline earth bentonite with water and sodium
          citrate as activator and stabiliser. </p>
        <p>13. A concentrate according to claim 12 in which sodium
          citrate is the only activator in the concentrate. </p>
        <p>14. A concentrate according to claim 11 in which citrate is
          the only dispersion stabiliser in the concentrate. </p>
        <p>15. A concentrate according to claim 11 in which the amount
          of bentonite is 20 to 35% by weight of the concentrate. </p>
        <p>16. A concentrate according to claim 11 in which the amount
          of citrate, measured as sodium citrate, is 5 to 20% based on
          the weight of the concentrate. </p>
        <p>17. A concentrate according to claim 11 in which the amount
          of citrate, measured as sodium citrate, is at least 6% based
          on the weight of the concentrate. </p>
        <p>18. A method of making concentrate according to claim 11
          comprising blending alkaline earth bentonite with water and
          sodium citrate. </p>
        <p>19. A method of making a concentrate that is a stable, fluid,
          bentonite dispersion of 15 to 40% by weight bentonite in water
          containing citrate in a fluid stabilizing and activating
          amount which is such that the concentrate has a viscosity
          (Brookfield, 20 rpm, spindle 4) of below 2000 cps comprising
          mixing more than 15% by weight raw quarried alkaline earth
          bentonite with water and alkali metal or ammonium citrate,
          filtering the slurry and thereby providing the concentrate. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract ~</b> AMP (2-amino, 2-methyl, 1-propanol) or a
          related amino hydroxy compound is used with a sodium condensed
          phosphate dispersant in the preparation of stable aqueous
          suspensions of acidic, acid-treated montmorillonite clay
          pigment particles. The suspensions are used in the manufacture
          of carbonless copying paper.<br>
