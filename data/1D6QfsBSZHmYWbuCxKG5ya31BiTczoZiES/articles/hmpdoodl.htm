      <p><br>
        Here's a song about that plant <br>
        you're not supposed to inhale, <br>
        'cause it could get your body tossed <br>
        into some boring jail. </p>
      <p>Which could pretty much block your view <br>
        of the beauties of the world, <br>
        making it harder though not impossible <br>
        to get your wings unfurled. </p>
      <p>Hemp served Man since ancient times, <br>
        though it's gone out of favor. <br>
        But America's in such a fix <br>
        now only hemp can save her. </p>
      <p>Food and fuel and shelter and medicine <br>
        when we really need 'em; <br>
        once again the mighty hemp <br>
        could help us gain our freedom. </p>
      <p>The world's first paper was made from hemp, <br>
        so literacy could spread. <br>
        Now wise old guys could tell us lies, <br>
        even when they're dead. </p>
      <p>Of course they could also share some truths, <br>
        if they happened to know any. <br>
        The point is when they printed their books on hemp, <br>
        no one told 'em not to grow any. </p>
      <p>Our ancestors barely made it here <br>
        on ships with canvas sails, <br>
        rollin' and bouncin' and heavin' and barfin' <br>
        and greatly amusing the whales. </p>
      <p>Canvas means cannabis and that means hemp, <br>
        the first cloth to cross the ocean. <br>
        Salt rots the other fibers halfway over <br>
        and halts your forward motion. </p>
      <p>That's right folks, without that hemp <br>
        we never could have come here. <br>
        Now there's some who want to eradicate <br>
        the species from here. </p>
      <p>The DEA can yank it up, <br>
        yank it up right handy, <br>
        but when the famine strikes our land, <br>
        they'll eat hemp seeds like candy. </p>
      <p>Oh you can bet when the big drought hits, <br>
        any narc'll turn to a hemp farmer. <br>
        If your kids were starving <br>
        wouldn't you let down your armor? </p>
      <p>Hemp has roots that reach way down <br>
        to raise the deepest waters, <br>
        to grow the seeds that you will need <br>
        to feed your sons and daughters. </p>
      <p>Before petroleum took over <br>
        hemp seed oil was its main competition. <br>
        Then petro-chemical and timber barons <br>
        arranged for its prohibition. </p>
      <p>To this day legalizing hemp's what <br>
        oil barons fear the most. <br>
        If people grow their own fuel in their back yards, <br>
        the energy monopoly's toast. </p>
      <p>So don't send your kids to fight for oil; <br>
        there are better choices. <br>
        Hemp seed oil could run your cars <br>
        if you all raise your voices. </p>
      <p>And hemp seed has nearly all the nutrients <br>
        human bodies need, <br>
        much better than those over-used soybeans <br>
        meant for cattle feed. </p>
      <p>Fresh hemp seeds are tasty and healthy <br>
        and help you to keep your grin on, <br>
        while soybeans, unless you spice the daylights out of 'em, <br>
        taste like the dirt they rode in on. </p>
      <p>For thousands of years humans ate hemp seeds, <br>
        more protein than any other crop. <br>
        The single worst special interest legislation of all time <br>
        ordered everybody to stop. </p>
      <p>Greed unbound, on the flimsiest ground, <br>
        to create resource monopolies, <br>
        asked real polite if it'd be alright <br>
        if they banned our most useful crop, please? </p>
      <p>Well no, actually, what they did was re-label <br>
        hemp as marijuana, <br>
        exploiting racist fears and guaranteeing tears, <br>
        and lots of homeless flora and fauna. </p>
      <p>Hemp still makes better paper and building material <br>
        stronger than lumber. <br>
        But hemp prohibition left us grinding up our trees <br>
        and seriously reducing their number. </p>
      <p>The first people who lived here warned us: <br>
        Don't cut down the big trees. <br>
        They're what holds the land to the sky, <br>
        safe above the seas. </p>
      <p>They also make the air we breathe; <br>
        too bad we did not listen. <br>
        Folks will be turning several shades of blue <br>
        when they notice what is missin'. </p>
      <p>Where did you think that oxygen <br>
        you're fond of breathing comes from? <br>
        When you can't pay your oxygen bill, <br>
        well good luck trying to bum some. </p>
      <p>Half an eco-system does not work; <br>
        don't even try it. <br>
        If too many big trees get cut down, <br>
        things could get rather quiet. </p>
      <p>Takes a mighty big blind spot to look up at a <br>
        thousand year-old being, <br>
        if the money you can get for chopping up its body <br>
        is the only thing you're seeing. </p>
      <p>Keep killing those who make your oxygen, <br>
        eventually you'll strangle. <br>
        Oh say can you see that slender thread <br>
        from which your lives now dangle? </p>
      <p>Now it may seem like we've wandered quite a way <br>
        from the original point. <br>
        But there's a whole lot more to hemp <br>
        than "Hey let's smoke a joint". </p>
      <p>Everything the kids need is getting scarcer; <br>
        instead they're getting stuck with the debt. <br>
        No wonder they've been forming gangs <br>
        and acting slightly upset. </p>
      <p>So if you don't want your children thinking <br>
        that you totally blew it, <br>
        better let them grow that hemp; <br>
        it just might see them through it. </p>
      <p>We can still get back in Mother Nature's good graces <br>
        just when it looked like we'd lost her, <br>
        but we'll need leaders who don't prefer <br>
        a cranio-rectal posture. </p>
      <p>Washington, Jefferson, Franklin and <br>
        some other founding fathers <br>
        smoked their hemp and dreamed up a nation <br>
        freer than many others. </p>
      <p>We fought for independence when <br>
        King George the third decreed, <br>
        the colonies must buy from England <br>
        everything they need. </p>
      <p>Well that didn't go over too well, <br>
        so we had us a boycott. <br>
        We stopped buying British clothes, <br>
        made our own from hemp, then we fought. </p>
      <p>Hemp provided our ropes and sails, <br>
        and the cloth for Old Glory; <br>
        lamp oil and tents, America's hemp <br>
        was a vital part of her story. </p>
      <p>Nowadays visionary leaders are scarce; <br>
        it's all about greed and combat. <br>
        There's more imagination apparent <br>
        in your average wombat. </p>
      <p>So if you people want to legalize hemp, <br>
        you'll have to stand up and mention it, <br>
        though the men with the energy monopoly machine <br>
        probly won't appreciate a wrench in it. </p>
      <p>TV experts claim marijuana <br>
        will give your brain a frying, <br>
        but a lethal dose has never been found, <br>
        though not for lack of trying. </p>
      <p>Neuro-scientists have found <br>
        receptors in our brains, <br>
        specially shaped for THC, <br>
        to loosen our thought chains. </p>
      <p>Silicon Valley innovators, <br>
        most of them were stoners. <br>
        Wall Street saw what they'd invented <br>
        and got giant boners. </p>
      <p>Okay that was utterly tasteless <br>
        and we're really sorry. <br>
        Blame it on that hemp we used to smoke <br>
        like there was no tomorry. </p>
      <p>Cannabis must be made free <br>
        for once and for all time. <br>
        It's time to be rid of bad laws <br>
        That make the plant a crime.<br>
