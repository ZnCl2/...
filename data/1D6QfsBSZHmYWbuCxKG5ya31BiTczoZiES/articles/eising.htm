        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A middle-aged
            man walked into a New York surgeon's office for examination
            of a wound, a few months ago. For a whole year following an
            operation, the wound had failed to heal. Repeated treatments
            by practically every method known to medical science had
            failed. This time, the surgeon's manner after examination
            conveyed no optimism.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The most he
            could do, he said, was to send the patient back to the
            hospital for an attempt at a cure by another operation.
            "Except --- there's just a chance&nbsp; ---" His eyes,
            glancing idly about the room, happened to fall upon a test
            tube hanging on a curtain.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He unhooked
            the test tube, and emptied its jelly-like contents into a
            surgical syringe. Despite difficulties in handling, the warm
            jelly was applied to the wound and covered with gauze.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Five days
            later the man returned. "Doctor", he said, "I think my wound
            has closed". It had. By some apparent miracle, a test tube
            of ordinary petroleum jelly, taken on the vaguest chance
            from in front of an ultraviolet lamp where the surgeon had
            been using its natural fluorescence to test the strength of
            the rays, had succeeded where the best remedies known to
            medicine had failed.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was thus
            that Dr Eugene H. Eising, New York surgeon, discovered an
            entirely new kind of healing agent. This irradiated
            petrolatum, or rayed petroleum jelly, has strange
            attributes. Its action combines a general healing effect and
            a positive germ-killing quality, the latter effect differing
            from standard antiseptics in being a prolonged, rather than
            an instantaneous, action. Strangest of all, the
            preparation's curative power seems to depend upon an
            invisible mystery ray that comes from the jelly, a
            phenomenon demonstrated by the ray's ability to fog a
            photographic plate in total darkness.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Even though
            the working of the mysterious jelly is not fully understood,
            it is considered of great importance to the public. A large
            manufacturer of pharmaceutical preparations is compounding
            it already under the name of "radolatum" --- short for
            irradiated petrolatum --- and at this writing it is
            available to physicians. Now plans are being made to
            introduce it to the general public, and drug stores may have
            it on their shelves by the time this appears in print.
            Radolatum eventually may become a standard remedy in every
            household medicine cabinet. Tests in some of the country's
            foremost clinics show its amazing versatility and
            effectiveness in treating such everyday ailments as burns,
            scalds, boils, and sunburn, in addition to more serious
            surgical cases.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If such
            everyday wonders as X-ray tubes and ultra-violet lamps still
            impress the layman, what is one to say of Dr Eising's
            preparation and its mystery rays? Or of a newly-announced
            process that physicians may soon be using to fight cancer,
            in which ultraviolet rays are generated deep inside the
            human body? Or again, of strange invisible rays for which no
            use has yet been found, such as come from the wings of
            butterflies and print their image upon a photographic plate?
            Here are vivid examples that, so far, we have only scratched
            the surface of a whole mysterious range of radiations, and
            that new wonders may follow their harnessing.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a start in
            learning of the latest ray discoveries, I went to Dr
            Eising's laboratory to obtain the first-hand story of his
            mystery rays.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In a
            curtained-off corner of his laboratory stands a large
            ultraviolet lamp used for treating patients. With such a
            lamp, Dr Eising explained, it is customary to use an
            indicator showing the strength of the rays. Such indicators
            usually consist of a small transparent capsule enclosing
            chemicals that, under ultraviolet radiation, glow with
            brilliant blue or green light. Sometimes the capsules break
            and must be replaced. Dr Eising discovered that a test tube
            of ordinary petroleum jelly --- which fluoresces with a blue
            glow under the rays --- made a satisfactory indicator, when
            hung on a curtain near the lamp.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was this
            tube of jelly that Dr Eising took from the curtain, where it
            had hung before the lamp for hours, to treat his difficult
            patient. Whatever lucky inspiration moved him to do it, he
            realized he had made an important discovery when the same
            preparation worked with signal success upon other patients.
            Then he began to search for the explanation of its amazing
            healing power.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At first, he
            thought it might be due to vitamins, formed in the
            petrolatum by the ultraviolet rays of the lamp. He discarded
            this theory when he found that ordinary petrolatum,
            artificially impregnated with vitamins, had no such powers.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"After
            fumbling around for a while", Dr Eising says,&nbsp; "it
            occurred to me to place some of my irradiated petrolatum
            with a photographic plate in a light-tight box". He cut a
            design in a cardboard stencil, placed the stencil between a
            photographic plate and a dish of the rayed jelly in a
            darkroom, and then left the combination overnight in a box
            from which all light was excluded. When he removed and
            developed the plate, the result was startling. The plate
            bore a perfect image of the stencil, as plainly as if
            printed upon the sensitive emulsion by a powerful lamp.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Ordinary
            petroleum jelly, not irradiated, has no such power. By
            exposing different batches of jelly to his lamp under
            variously colored glass and testing them, Dr Eising tried to
            identify the light that gave petroleum jelly its remarkable
            power. The new type of light is present in normal sunlight,
            but is available in more concentrated form in artificial
            lamps.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Evidently
            exposure to this light gave petroleum jelly the power of
            emitting some mysterious, invisible ray that affects a
            photographic plate in total darkness. New tests showed that
            the curative power of the jelly and the emission of the
            mystery ray seem to go hand in hand. Inescapable was the
            inference that the ray is partly or wholly responsible for
            the healing result. What could be the nature of the ray?</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Could it be
            that the jelly re-emitted ultraviolet rays after exposure?
            If so, the rays should behave light like rays, and pass
            readily through transparent pieces of quartz and film. Dr
            Eising found the rays actually did pass through a protective
            layer of celluloid film and affect one of his plates, but in
            the crucial test they failed to penetrate thin plates of
            transparent quartz. Moreover, he found he could keep the
            mysterious emanation from affecting a plate by blowing a
            gentle stream of air between jelly and plate during
            exposure. Conversely, when he led the emanation from a flask
            of warmed, irradiated jelly through a glass tube to a plate,
            it left a dense black smudge on the developed plate. These
            tests suggest that the emanation may partake both of the
            nature of a radiation and a vapor.</font> </p>

        </div>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This
            invention relates to therapeutic agents, and includes among
            its object the provision of (a) therapeutic agents
            characterized by a high degree of activity in promoting the
            healing of damaged and/or infected tissue, (b) a method
            whereby such therapeutic agents may be prepared from certain
            inert substances, and (c) a method of promoting the healing
            of damaged and/or infected tissue.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the
            practice of this invention, unrefined petroleum products ---
            especially petrolatum and liquid petrolatum --- are
            therapeutically activated by exposure to ultraviolet
            irradiation. As employed herein, "unrefined petroleum
            products" means petroleum products containing one or more
            natural "impurities", i.e., substances other than
            hydrocarbons; and "petrolatum" and "liquid petrolatum" mean
            petrolatum and liquid petrolatum respectively, unrefined in
            the same sense. It is to the presence of these "impurities"
            (the chemical identity of which has not been determined)
            that the unrefined petroleum products owe their
            activability. Since it generally accompanies such
            "impurities", fluorescence of the unradiated petroleum
            products may ordinarily be regarded as an index of activity.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At first,
            activity increases more or less directly as the amount of
            irradiation, but after a while a maximum is reached and
            further irradiation causes a gradual diminution and then a
            complete loss of activity; and ultimately the product
            becomes a tissue irritant if radiation is protracted until
            it is sufficient --- in duration and intensity --- to bring
            about the defluorescence of fluorescent petroleum oils.
            Irradiation must therefore be discontinued short of the
            final stages mentioned.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Though
            fluorescence has occurred repeatedly in association with the
            property of activability in unirradiated petroleum products
            and of activity in irradiated petroleum products, there is
            no evidence that this correlation or concomitance is a
            necessary condition; on the contrary, it is believed that
            the fluorescence on the one hand, and the activability and
            activity on the other, are mutually independent and
            disassociable phenomena, so that it may be possible to
            eliminate the fluorescence without qualitatively or
            quantitatively affecting either the activability or the
            activity. In short, the exhibition of fluorescence may be
            considered a convenient or temporary, but not an absolute or
            permanent criterion.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By such
            irradiation, unrefined petroleum products are transformed
            into therapeutic agents capable, on being applied to the
            affected parts, of exercising a remarkable bactericidal and
            curative action.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus
            petrolatum --- hitherto known in medicine only as a
            demulcant and air-excluding substance and merely used as a
            bland protective dressing and as a substitute for fats in
            ointments --- is without appreciable beneficial effect on
            chronic sores and the like; but irradiation in accordance
            with this invention endows it with the extraordinary
            potentialities referred to, whereby it destroys pathogenic
            microorganisms and accelerates cell proliferation,
            granulation, and other normal processes, making possible the
            rapid cure of sluggish wounds, ulcers, and other traumata,
            notably those of a bacterial character.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For the
            purposes of the invention, the most effective portion of the
            ultraviolet zone is that of the wavelengths ranging between
            2950 and 3800 Angstrom units, the greatest intensity being
            found in the "cyanogen band", centering about the 3660
            Angstrom units line. Any of the common ultraviolet
            irradiation means may be employed, as quartz mercury vapor,
            or preferably, carbon-arc, lamps.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As an
            example, a 3/8-inch layer of petrolatum in an open dish
            about 20 inches from an enclosed carbon arc acquires the
            maximum therapeutic potency on irradiation for between 40
            and 60 minutes. An additional hour or so of irradiation
            gives rise to a perceptible decrease in healing efficacy; if
            irradiation is continued for about six hours more, there is
            a total destruction of activity; and on prolonging the
            period of irradiation to about fifteen hours (sufficient to
            bring about defluorescence) the therapeutic properties are
            replaced by irritant properties. In each instance the
            optimal period of irradiation will of course depend on such
            factors as the nature of the particular petrolatum product
            treated, the kind and degree of radiant energy employed, and
            the distance of the product from the energy source.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therapeutic
            agents prepared in accordance with this invention render an
            infected wound sterile after a few applications, and
            thereafter keep it so. They rapidly diminish the bacterial
            count in the exudates, causing a cessation of the purulent
            exudates and disappearance of the greenish-gray sloughs
            after two or three application, which transformation under
            other treatment would take five to six weeks, and in the
            case of abdominal wounds, would leave the patient with a
            weak abdominal wall. Healthy granulation and complete
            closing of the wound result in a much shorter time. The
            utility of these therapeutic agent has been demonstrated in
            such diverse conditions as suppurations of the cellular
            tissues, joint cavities, drainage in appendical abscesses,
            fistulae in ano, affection of the respiratory tract,
            infectious inflammations of the mucous membranes, empyema
            sinuses, infectious and mycotic cutaneous disorders, chronic
            bone sinuses following osteomyelitis, and varicose,
            diabetic, and decubital ulcers. Treatment may be achieved in
            any of numerous modes: for instance, as in the case of
            surgical wounds, by flooding the affected area with
            activated petrolatum liquefied by warming; or by directly
            filling the post-operative nasal sinuses with liquefied
            activated petrolatum, or, as in bronchiectasis, introducing
            it, by means of bronchoscope, directly into lung abscesses.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More
            specifically, in extensive suppurations of the abdominal
            wall following laparatomy, the entire wound is flooded with
            liquefied activated petrolatum, and covered with gauze; and
            a like application is made on the next day or after a
            two-day interval. Within twenty-four hours the discharge is
            greatly diminished; and after the second or third
            application the wound is free from purulent exudates, and
            sloughing fasciae and necrosed fat have disappeared and
            granulation has begun. After two or three, or occasionally
            four, applications, the wound is sufficiently clean and free
            from discharge to allow of closure with deep silkworm
            sutures.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Again, in
            teno-vaginitis, flooding the open tendon-sheath at the time
            of the operation with liquefied activated petrolatum, is
            signally successful. No extension of the infection occurs,
            as otherwise so frequently happens in these cases; purulent
            exudates is not seen at the next dressing, and the
            temperature drops to normal and healing rapidly follows.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further, in
            sinuses and fistulous tracts such as persist after
            appendectomy and cholecystectomy, healing often occurs
            within two days after the first injection.</font> </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Still
            further, in chronic osteomyelitis, after thorough
            saucerization the bony trough is flooded with liquefied
            activated petrolatum and a dry dressing applied. Repetition
            of this treatment cures many otherwise intractable cases.</font>
        </p>
        <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experimentation
            has demonstrated that the curative powers conferred by the
            method of this invention are unrelated to vitamin D,
            photosynthesized in ergosterol-containing material; on the
            one hand, activated petrolatum exercises no antirachitic
            effect on rats; and on the other neither viosterol nor
            viosterol mixed with unactivated petrolatum, when applied to
            wounds in the same manner as activated petrolatum, displays
            any of the latter's characteristic healing efficacy.</font>
