Products







                of Ethylene and Acetylene Formed through the Agency of
                the Silent Electric Discharge"</font></font></b></center>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Berthelot has shown that a
            silent electric discharge acting upon saturated or
            unsaturated hydrocarbons will split off hydrogen in varying
            quantities from the molecule and, instead of polymerization
            products, condensation products will result. The author
            reports the work upon ethylene and acetylene under these
            conditions. The pure dry gases were introduced into a
            synthesizer, an ozonizer with manometer attachment. In the
            case of ethylene the condensation product is soluble in
            ethanol and diethyl ether and gives a molecular weight of
            420. This corresponds to a formula approaching C<sub>30</sub>H<sub>54</sub>.
            The action of bromine and nitric acid upon this product led
            to its classification with cyclic compounds. The acetylene
            product is extremely insoluble and hence no molecular weight
            determination could be directly obtained. The compound is
            similar in chemical properties to the preceding one, and is
            undoubtedly of ring structure<b>. The deficiency in
              percentage of carbon in these compounds is worthy of note</b>.
            An explanation for the same is given by the author in the
            following abstract (<i>Monatsh.</i> 29: 1-4).</font> </p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;"><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The
Mysterious







            Deficiency of Carbon in the Condensation Products from
            Ethylene"</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pure dry ethylene and
            acetylene were in turn brought under the influence of silent
            electric discharge, and the condensation product in each
            case analyzed. The purest chemical reagents were employed in
            these combustions. <b>From several determinations the
              percentage of carbon and hydrogen taken together fell
              below the theoretical 100%; in the case of the ethylene
              product a 7% and in that of the acetylene product a 22%
              deficiency was noted.</b> This loss in the amount of
            hydrogen and carbon required by the formulae of hydrocarbons
            has been accounted for by Berthelot in the possibility of
            absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere. The author has
            excluded this possibility by working with dry gases and
            preserving the products in hermetically sealed tubes
            immediately upon their formulation. It is also stated that
            condensed ethylene loses no carbon on exposure to air and
            that condensed ethylene is hardly affected by many weeks’
            standing. The analysis of the products from sealed tubes and
            those exposed for some time to the air were in agreement
            with each other. The possible intake of oxygen during the
            removal from the tubes is practically nil, owing to the
            rather insoluble nature of the compounds and the absence of
            any change in their appearance. <b>These facts present us
              with a scientific riddle, a chemical anomaly, which the
              author believes can be explained only through experimental
              error or through the transmutation of elements. As great
              care and precision were taken in all of the
              determinations, the author is more convinced of the latter
              possibility, especially since these condensation products,
              notably that of ethylene, possess strong radioactive
              properties</b>. These products, therefore, may be
            considered, not as simple hydrocarbons, but as compounds of
            these with known or unknown elements here brought into
            existence through the action of the silent electric
            discharge upon gaseous ethylene or acetylene.</font></p>
