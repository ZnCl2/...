        <p><font size="+1">is a loose term which refers to methods of
            birth control that are considered "natural"; though what is
            considered "natural" varies widely. Generally, natural birth
            control does not involve hormonal contraception, nor
            synthetic chemicals including synthetic spermicide. Other
            methods may also be excluded, depending on how the term
            "natural" is defined. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Some definitions of "natural" are more
            lenient and include barrier contraception used without
            synthetic spermicide, and occasionally the copper IUD, which
            contains no hormones. Some definitions exclude the use of
            devices, but include the use of herbs, natural substances,
            and behavioral methods. Natural family planning is the most
            exclusive in its definition of what is "natural". </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Naturally occurring substances are chemicals,
            but some distinguish them from synthetic substances and
            consider them "natural". Herbs and substances may be
            ingested, to interfere with ovulation or implantation. Some
            are used to encourage menstruation... </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Other substances are inserted vaginally, for
            use as natural spermicides. Examples of these include lemon
            juice,[1] wild yam,[2] Queen Anne's Lace (wild carrot),[3]
            and neem[4]). A website called Sister Zeus describes many of
            these methods in detail. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">...Silphium, was an herbal morning-after
            pill, readily available to our ancestors a hundred
            generations ago. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">In the seventh century BC, Greek colonists
            established the city of Cyrene on the Libyan coast. Shortly
            after their arrival, wrote the Greek botanist Theophrastus
            (ca. 370-288 BC), they discovered silphium -- the plant that
            would make them rich and the city famous. A member of the
            genus Feula, (commonly known as giant fennel), a large group
            of plants with deeply divided leaves and yellow flowers, the
            pungent sap from silphium's stems and roots was used in
            cough syrups. It also gave food a rich distinctive taste
            when used as an additive. Of far greater importance was its
            value as a birth control agent. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Contemporary medical authorities were
            universal in their praise for silphium's value as a
            contraceptive. The Roman physician Soranus, antiquity's
            foremost gynecologist, wrote that women should drink the
            juice from an amount of silphium about the size of a chick
            pea, with water, once a month since "it not only prevents
            conception but also destroys anything existing." The
            herbalist and pharmacist, Dioscorides, author of Materia
            Medica, recommended silphium for contraceptive and abortive
            purposes. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">...Another member of the Ferula species,
            asafoetida, which gives Worcestershire sauce its distinctive
            aroma, was also widely used (though considered less
            effective) since it was cheaper and more abundant. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Besides silphium and asafoetida, other plants
            were recognized as having both contraceptive and
            abortificant properties by ancient women. Hippocrates "the
            father of medicine" stated the seeds of Queen Anne's Lace,
            or wild carrot, when taken orally both prevented and
            terminated pregnancy and recommended their use. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Herbal Contraceptives in Ancient Literature </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Other plants used in classical times as
            contraceptives included pennyroyal, artemisia, myrrh and
            rue. In Aristophanes' 421 BC comedy The Peace, Hermes
            provides Trigaius with a female companion. Trigaius wonders
            if the woman might become pregnant. "Not if you add a dose
            of pennyroyal," advises Hermes. Hippocrates also mentions
            the value of pennyroyal as a birth control agent though
            cautions that it is toxic and has to be taken in precisely
            calculated amounts. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Galen (AD 129-199), the foremost physician in
            the Roman world, and Dioscorides also recommended the use of
            pomegranate for birth control. The seeds were typically used
            as a pessary, (vaginal suppository), though one contemporary
            medical text documents use of pomegranate seed being taken
            orally as a post-coital contraceptive. The best known
            literary reference to the pomegranate's contraceptive power
            is the Greek myth of Persephone and Hades. Persephone had
            eaten six pomegranate kernels while in the underworld and
            for that many months the land was infertile during the fall
            and winter... </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Silphium cannot be tested but experiments
            using crude extracts of asafoetida in rats, showed that it
            inhibited implantation of fertilized ova at rates up to 50
            percent. Extracts of asafoetida's close relatives were
            nearly 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy when
            given within three days of mating. In 1986 it was shown that
            compounds in Queen Anne's Lace blocked the production of
            progesterone, necessary for preparation of the uterus for a
            fertilized ovum. Women in rural North Carolina and
            Rajasthan, India both use the seeds to prevent pregnancy.
            Pennyroyal contains a substance, pulegone, that terminates
            pregnancies in both humans and animals. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">"Our Experience at the Women's Health Center
          </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">We have obtained between 60 and 80 percent
            effectiveness among women who suspected an undesired
            pregnancy. Clearly this figure does not tell us much because
            we do not know how many of these women were in fact
            pregnant. The women always used two herbs at one time (most
            often using either pennyroyal or mugwort, plus one other
            herb). The best association has been shown to be pennyroyal
            - blue cohosh. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">These herbs seem to be very effective for
            small delays in menstrual bleeding.&nbsp; Their
            effectiveness drops noticably after the 6th day of delay,
            but still can be useful as long as an inability to confirm
            the pregnancy makes abortion impossible. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">It might be mentioned that these herbs seem
            ineffective for periods delyaed after going off the Pill,
            and only slightly effective with irregular cycles. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">According to the research and experience of a
            collective of women in Santa Fe, New Mexico, a better result
            is obtained with cotton root bark than with
            pennyroyal.&nbsp; We have therefore integrated this 6th herb
            into our practice. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">It is important to note that the earlier the
            herbs are taken [as tea infusions], the more effective they
            are. There is just one limitation: that the cycle be at its
            end.&nbsp; Herbs are not effective just after ovulation
            because it is not possible to loosen mucus which is not yet
            'mature'. You can therefore begin to drink infusions the day
            before the period would normally begin, the same day, or up
            until the 10th day thereafter. The percentage of success is
            very good (60-80 percent) the first 6 days. If you begin
            drinking the infusions only after the 6th day overdue,
            however, the percentage of effectiveness falls to 20
            percent. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">For this reason, after our years of
            experience, we rarely propose infusions after the 6th day
            overdue.&nbsp; On the other hand, for those who are among
            the 20 percent, it is worth it! The development of early
            pregnancy tests, however, will probably change our practice
            and permit a more precise study. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">What are the possible side effects?
            Essentially, contractions whose strength increases in
            proportion to the length of delay. Sometimes nausea or a
            light dizziness may result. It is recommended to eat lightly
            during these days. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Practically speaking --- We always prescribe
            two associated herbs:&nbsp; cotton root bark&nbsp; or&nbsp;
            pennyroyal&nbsp; or&nbsp; mugwort&nbsp; to be used
            with&nbsp; parsley&nbsp; or&nbsp; blue cohosh&nbsp; or&nbsp;
            black cohosh. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>

            separately, per cup liquid - in infusion for the leaves
            (mugwort and pennyroyal), and in decoction for the roots
            (the others) - drink one cup of each of the 2 herbs three
            timesa day. This means 6 cups to drink each day for a
            maximum of 6 days. (more information below) </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">BE CAREFUL: do not overdose. Do not continue
            treatment more than six days. Do not begin after the 10th
            overdue day. The better informed women are, the earlier they
            will begin.&nbsp; It is not necessary to continue taking the
            herbs once the period has truly begun." </font></p>

              Abortion in the West</font> </p>
          <p>by </p>
          <p>John M. Riddle</p>
        </center>
        <p>Editorial Reviews --- <i>Library Journal</i> </p>
        <p>Even in ancient times, people limited the size of their
          families. Since the major responsibilities of pregnancy,
          birth, and child rearing fell on women, they found methods for
          controlling fertility and aborting unwanted children, and they
          have passed down this knowledge as an oral tradition that
          survives worldwide. Using early manuscripts of medical and
          botanical texts and the proceedings of court cases, historian
          Riddle examines the use of plants as contraceptives, offering
          a fascinating view of the early knowledge of reproduction and
          attempts to regulate it. As formal medical training evolved
          and the Roman Catholic Church gained power, these preparations
          were forbidden, and women offering or using them were tried as
          witches. The information remained available in disguised form,
          and, in many parts of the world, Queen Anne's Lace,
          Pennyroyal, and other botanicals are still used to "regulate
          menses." More scholarly than Shirley Green's The Curious
          History of Contraception (LJ 8/72), this work is recommended
          for academic and large public libraries. </p>
        <p>Product Description </p>
        <p>In Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the
          Renaissance, John Riddle showed, through extraordinary
          scholarly sleuthing, that women from ancient Egyptian times to
          the fifteenth century had relied on an extensive pharmacopoeia
          of herbal abortifacients and contraceptives to regulate
          fertility. In Eve's Herbs, Riddle explores a new question: If
          women once had access to effective means of birth control, why
          was this knowledge lost to them in modern times? </p>
        <p>Beginning with the testimony of a young woman brought before
          the Inquisition in France in 1320, Riddle asks what women knew
          about regulating fertility with herbs and shows how the new
          intellectual, religious, and legal climate of the early modern
          period tended to cast suspicion on women who employed "secret
          knowledge" to terminate or prevent pregnancy. Knowledge of the
          menstrual-regulating qualities of rue, pennyroyal, and other
          herbs was widespread through succeeding centuries among
          herbalists, apothecaries, doctors, and laywomen themselves,
          even as theologians and legal scholars began advancing the
          idea that the fetus was fully human from the moment of
          conception. </p>
        <p>Drawing on previously unavailable material, Riddle reaches a
          startling conclusion: while it did not persist in a form that
          was available to most women, ancient knowledge about herbs was
          not lost in modern times but survived in coded form.
          Persecuted as "witchcraft" in centuries past and prosecuted as
          a crime in our own time, the control of fertility by "Eve's
          herbs" has been practiced by Western women since ancient
          times. </p>

            try at home without supervision from a knowledgeable herb
            person. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Current and reliable information on herbal
            birth control is rare. In the Western tradition much
            information on birth control as well as safe birthing
            techniques was destroyed during the European Witch hunts
            circa 1450-1700. Having such knowledge was proof positive
            that you were a witch. Other historical information is often
            incomplete, with only a local common name, or no exact
            dosages. Researchers often discard supportive techniques
            such as fasting or ritual as mere superstition. Current
            studies tend to be anecdotal rather than strictly lab
            controlled data. This does not mean they are not of value,
            but again pertinent info may be missing. Such as was the
            woman pregnant in the first place? Anecdotal info can give
            us ideas on where to start and what the possibilities are.
            They have also shown us that herbal abortives are not
            themselves without side effects, often severe. All herbal
            info on abortives should be thoroughly researched before
            use. Some herbalists feel that herbal abortions are more
            dangerous than clinical abortions. Abortive herbs are toxic
            and do have side effects. They are not safer because they
            are natural. Clinical abortions are certainly more
            effective. Most importantly an herbal abortion should never
            be undertaken unless a women is willing to follow up with a
            clinical abortion if the herbs fail. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Effectiveness </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Varying success rates have been claimed for
            herbal birth control. Estimates vary from 20%-80%. It is
            important to remember that most of these rates are based on
            the incidence of successfully bringing on a delayed period,
            not in aborting a definite pregnancy. Since many herbs seem
            to work the best close to the time of the first missed
            menstrual period, many women have not had a pregnancy test
            at the time they took herbal abortives. Studies on the
            success rate of herbal abortives in non-confirmed
            pregnancies is quite high (70%-80%). Success rates with
            confirmed pregnancies is substantially lower, 20% or less.
            Also there's not as much research on herbal abortives with
            confirmed pregnancy. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Specifics </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Rina Nissim, founder of the Dispensaire des
            Femmes in Switzerland claims a success rate of 60%-80% in
            women who believed they were pregnant (non-tested). Their
            method involved the use of at least two herbs at a time.
            Generally one emmenagogue (bleeding stimulator) with an
            oxytocic (uterine contraction stimulator) for no more than
            six days starting as soon as a woman's period is late. They
            have found that starting the herbal regimen later than six
            days overdue drops the success rate to 20%. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">In a survey I conducted (appendix A) with a
            small group of women there appeared to be a high success
            rate (about 75%). However only one of the women had a
            positive pregnancy test, so actual success rates were
            certainly much lower. My experience with women where there
            has been more complete information, such as positive
            pregnancy tests and follow up leads me to guess at a
            realistic success rate of 20% at this time. In a highly
            quoted New Mexico study, Cotton root bark had a very high
            success rate, with a fairly low toxicity. However it appears
            that very few of the women were actually pregnant based on
            blood tests and screening. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Less info is available on prevention of
            pregnancy with herbs. In an informal study (appendix B) by
            Robin Bennett with Wild Carrot Seed used on a semi- regular
            basis as an implantation preventer she had a 98% success
            rate with few side effects. There is also a much quoted
            seven year study involving one hundred women in Alaska that
            also claimed high success rates for wild carrot seed. But no
            one seems to have any specifics on it. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Safety </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">In general many herbal abortives are mildly
            poisonous to potentially fatal in large doses. </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> Almost all women report at least one of the
            following side effects: </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Increased bleeding </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Dizziness and nausea
            sometimes extreme enough to cause fear. </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Visual disturbances </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Sweats or chills </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Diarrhea </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Less commonly reported side effects: </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Incomplete abortion </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Irregular cycles for 1-3
            months </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">The above can also occur in clinical
            abortions. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Kidney irritation </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Breast Lumps (Tansy) </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Almost all women reported heavier bleeding
            and clotting than normal and felt that this was an
            indication of an aborted pregnancy. While this is indeed a
            sign of aborted pregnancy it's also common with use of
            emmenagogues. Common sense would indicate that when using
            emmenagogues there would be the chance of hemorrhage, but it
            appears to be a not very common side effect compared to the
            other effects. Most side effects appear to be of short
            duration. I do know of one case where a women experienced
            severe long term endocrine imbalance after using herbal
            abortives. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Serious side effects </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">The most serious side effects seem to occur
            when women use herbal abortives, remain pregnant and attempt
            to carry to term. There is a high enough rate of reported
            instances to call for extreme caution. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Incomplete or low
            implantation of the placenta </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (reported
            frequently by many practitioners) </font><br>
          <font size="+1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Premature detachment of
            the placenta before or during birth </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Consequences of these side effects can be
            severe and potentially fatal. Severe hemorrhage can and does
            occur under these circumstances. In one case a women lost
            1/3 of her blood volume before bleeding could be stopped.
            Treatment consists of total bed rest and staying close to a
            hospital. The risks to both mother and fetus are extreme. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * A few isolated reports
            of toxaemia possibly related to herbal abortives. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">One final very subjective note: </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Clinic workers who see many clinical
            abortions note that women who used herbal abortives on their
            current pregnancy seem to have darker, thicker blood with
            more clotting. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Use of herbal abortives as a labor
            facilitator </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">A few of the herbs that are used as herbal
            abortives maybe safely used in the last trimester of
            pregnancy under specific conditions to help facilitate
            healthy labor. While safe if properly used they should not
            be used unless a problem exists and only with the help of a
            practitioner. </font><br>

            midwives to facilitate softening of the cervix and is often
            used as a labor adjunct in the case of rigid os or as a
            preparatory agent before trying to induce labor with
            stronger herbs. It occasionally will start labor on it's
            own. As an abortive there is not a lot of current use info
            on effectiveness and side effects. Trillium root should only
            be harvested from garden grown plants as it is rare in the
            wild due to habitat destruction by logging and urban growth.

        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">The above is by no means an exhaustive list,
            many mild emmenagogues are listed as abortives in literature
            both scientific and folkloric: Marjoram, Oregano, Beet,
            Celery, Papaya fruit, Peppermint, Valerian, etc. While they
            may help facilitate onset of a slow period, such as the type
            where there's cramping and pelvic heaviness but bleeding has
            not yet commenced, it's doubtful they would act as
            abortives. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Dosages mentioned above may be on the
            conservative side in many cases. However, since the serious
            side effects show up at higher doses it's best to be
            cautious. I've seen better results with tea than with
            tincture and with mixing 2 -3 herbs together in a blend.
            Herbal abortives effects may be enhanced by a day of
            fasting, working with ritual, and massage of the uterine
            acupressure points along the ankles several times a day for
            at least ten minutes at a time. Again the success rate is
            very low for actual pregnancies. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Ideally if a woman wished to use herbal
            abortives I would recommend finding a clinic that does early
            pregnancy testing of the type that can detect pregnancy
            within a few days of conception, preferably one that can see
            women on a walk in basis so you don't have to wait for an
            appointment. Then if you are not pregnant you can use a mild
            emmenagogue such as marjoram, without stressing your body.
            Since early testing is not 100% accurate and if you are
            fairly sure you are pregnant, you may wish to use one of the
            less toxic abortives such as Vitamin C. Since most of the
            abortives are so hard on the body they should only be used
            in cases of confirmed pregnancy. Why put your liver thru
            more stress than it already gets in today's world? </font></p>

            became pregnant when she used the seeds for only three days
            around ovulation instead of the recommended 7-8. She had a
            clinical abortion. Two other women suspected they were
            pregnant and used herbal emmenagogues to bring on their
            period. One of these women was using the seeds daily. The
            other women was using them for 7-8 days surrounding
            ovulation. One of the women discontinued seed use in order
            to become pregnant and did. There were some mild side

            to cause uterine rejection of a conceptus is any more
            "natural" then an a D&amp;C. Herbs can be potent and

            may be used for especially when the only alternative is

            plain daft - how late is she, how old is she, what is her
            general health, nutritional status, psychological state,

        <p><font size="+1">ADRIANE FUGH-BERMAN, M.D., REPLIES: I
            wouldn't recommend it. Modern contraceptives are more
            effective and have been extensively tested for safety. By
            the way, the birth control pill was derived from an herb.
            Its progestin comes from a chemical isolated from the
            inedible Mexican wild yam (Dioscorea villosa). However, this
            plant is used traditionally for stomach problems, not
            contraception. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Some people have used herbs to prevent
            conception, like the seeds of Queen Anne's lace (Daucus
            carota). But there's no clinical evidence of their efficacy
            and I wouldn't recommend taking your chances. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">Several so-called contraceptive herbs are
            actually abortifacients and can be dangerous. These
            potentially deadly herbs work by poisoning the woman, who,
            being larger than the fetus, may survive the toxicity while
            the fetus does not. A recent review published in the Journal
            of Toxicology and Clinical Toxicology reported 57 cases of
            poisonings, including two deaths, due to plants used to
            attempt abortion between 1990 and 1997. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">An indigenous contraceptive herbal
            formulation consisting of a mixture of Lepidagathis
            longifolia, Palaquium sp and Phyllagathis rotundifolia is
            being used by the Temuan Aborigins of Malaysia. Although the
            previous studies demonstrated that this contraceptive herbal
            formulation causes anovulatory estrous cycle, altered
            circulating hormone levels and fetal resorption in rats, but
            the effects of this formulation on the gonadotrphs of the
            pituitary gland are yet to be evaluated. The present study
            was designed to observe the morphometric changes of the
            gonadotrophs and the plasma concentrations of follicle
            stimulating hormone and leutinizing hormone. Thirty five
            Sprague-Dawley adult female rats were randomly divided into
            5 groups. Experimental animals were given a combined herbal
            extract or individual herbal extract at a dose of 540
            mg/kg/day subcutaneously for 7 days. Immunostained
            gonadotrophs were studied by using image analyzer. FSH and
            LH serum concentrations were determined using RIA. The FSH
            and LH concentrations were low in animals that received
            combined herbal extract (p&lt;0.01). FSH concentration was
            noted to be significantly low in animals that received P.
            rotundifolia (p&lt;0.05). The mean cell area and cell
            density of gonadotrophs of animals that received combined
            herbal extract were significantly low compared to control
            group (p&lt;0.05). It was concluded that the herbal extracts
            do suppress the production of gonaotrophins along with the
            demonstrable suppresive effect on the FSH cells. </font></p>

            Abstract --- PURPOSE:To provide a sialidase inhibitor
            containing at least one kind of compound selected from aloe
            emodin and sennidin and having high activity.
            CONSTITUTION:The objective sialidase inhibitor expected to
            be effective as an antiviral agent, anti-inflammatory agent,
            antibacterial agent and contraceptive is produced by using
            at least one kind of compound selected from aloe emodin and
            sennidin (composed of two kinds of isomers, i.e. sennidin A
            and sennidin B) expressed by formula I and formula II, as
            active component. The compound is an anthraquinone compound
            separated from a herb drug such as aloe DAIO (rhizome of
            Rheum palmatum) and senna by extraction. Sennoside which is
            a glycoside of sennidin is produced in larger amount than
            sennidin by the extraction and separation treatment of the
            above herb drug and the sennoside can be converted to
            sennidin by conventional hydrolysis. </font></p>

          <font size="+1"> Abstract --- To provide a contraceptive feed
            or food for animals to take effective measures to the
            serious damage caused by abandoned kitten, abandoned dog,
            and wild monkey, crow, wild boar, deer and rat, etc., to
            man, etc., and provide a method for the production of the
            feed. SOLUTION: A contraceptive feed is supplied to feral
            cat or dog, or crow and wild boar appearing in an urban
            district to rumble rubbish and attack human being. The
            feeding is effective for inhibiting the egg production and
            delivery and decreasing the number of individuals stepwise
            taking 3 months to several years to achieve harmonious
            coexistence of human and animal. The method to slowly
            decrease the probability of gestation/delivery and give
            little damage on the animal is carried out by mixing a food
            liked by the target animal with one or more herbs such as
            wild pink (Dianthus superbus). </font></p>
