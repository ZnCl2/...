      </b>
      <p>Within very few days after that Pantagruel had taken his leave
        of the good Gargantua, who devoutly prayed for his son's happy
        voyage, he arrived at the seaport, near to Sammalo, accompanied
        with Panurge, Epistemon, Friar John of the Funnels, Abbot of
        Theleme, and others of the royal house, especially with
        Xenomanes the great traveller and thwarter of dangerous ways,
        who was come at the bidding and appointment of Panurge, of whose
        castlewick of Salmigondin he did hold some petty inheritance by
        the tenure of a mesne fee. Pantagruel, being come thither,
        prepared and made ready for launching a fleet of ships, to the
        number of those which Ajax of Salamine had of old equipped in
        convoy of the Grecian soldiery against the Trojan state. He
        likewise picked out for his use so many mariners, pilots,
        sailors, interpreters, artificers, officers, and soldiers, as he
        thought fitting, and therewithal made provision of so much
        victuals of all sorts, artillery, munition of divers kinds,
        clothes, moneys, and other such luggage, stuff, baggage,
        chaffer, and furniture, as he deemed needful for carrying on the
        design of a so tedious, long, and perilous voyage. Amongst other
        things, it was observed how he caused some of his vessels to be
        fraught and loaded with a great quantity of an herb of his
        called Pantagruelion, not only of the green and raw sort of it,
        but of the confected also, and of that which was notably well
        befitted for present use after the fashion of conserves. The
        herb Pantagruelion hath a little root somewhat hard and rough,
        roundish, terminating in an obtuse and very blunt point, and
        having some of its veins, strings, or filaments coloured with
        some spots of white, never fixeth itself into the ground above
        the profoundness almost of a cubit, or foot and a half. From the
        root thereof proceedeth the only stalk, orbicular, cane-like,
        green without, whitish within, and hollow like the stem of
        smyrnium, olus atrum, beans, and gentian, full of long threads,
        straight, easy to be broken, jagged, snipped, nicked, and
        notched a little after the manner of pillars and columns,
        slightly furrowed, chamfered, guttered, and channelled, and full
        of fibres, or hairs like strings, in which consisteth the chief
        value and dignity of the herb, especially in that part thereof
        which is termed mesa, as he would say the mean, and in that
        other, which hath got the denomination of milasea. Its height is
        commonly of five or six foot. Yet sometimes it is of such a tall
        growth as doth surpass the length of a lance, but that is only
        when it meeteth with a sweet, easy, warm, wet, and well-soaked
        soil -- as is the ground of the territory of Olone, and that of
        Rasea, near to Preneste in Sabinia--and that it want not for
        rain enough about the season of the fishers' holidays and the
        estival solstice. There are many trees whose height is by it
        very far exceeded, and you might call it dendromalache by the
        authority of Theophrastus. The plant every year perisheth,--the
        tree neither in the trunk, root, bark, or boughs being durable.
      </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>From the stalk of this Pantagruelian plant there issue forth
        several large and great branches, whose leaves have thrice as
        much length as breadth, always green, roughish, and rugged like
        the orcanet, or Spanish bugloss, hardish, slit round about like
        unto a sickle, or as the saxifragum, betony, and finally ending
        as it were in the points of a Macedonian spear, or of such a
        lancet as surgeons commonly make use of in their phlebotomizing
        tiltings. The figure and shape of the leaves thereof is not much
        different from that of those of the ash-tree, or of agrimony;
        the herb itself being so like the Eupatorian plant that many
        skilful herbalists have called it the Domestic Eupator, and the
        Eupator the Wild Pantagruelion. These leaves are in equal and
        parallel distances spread around the stalk by the number in
        every rank either of five or seven, nature having so highly
        favoured and cherished this plant that she hath richly adorned
        it with these two odd, divine, and mysterious numbers. The smell
        thereof is somewhat strong, and not very pleasing to nice,
        tender, and delicate noses. The seed enclosed therein mounteth
        up to the very top of its stalk, and a little above it. </p>
      <p>This is a numerous herb; for there is no less abundance of it
        than of any other whatsoever. Some of these plants are
        spherical, some rhomboid, and some of an oblong shape, and all
        of those either black, bright-coloured, or tawny, rude to the
        touch, and mantled with a quickly-blasted-away coat, yet such a
        one as is of a delicious taste and savour to all shrill and
        sweetly-singing birds, such as linnets, goldfinches, larks,
        canary birds, yellow- hammers, and others of that airy chirping
        choir; but it would quite extinguish the natural heat and
        procreative virtue of the semence of any man who would eat much
        and often of it. And although that of old amongst the Greeks
        there was certain kinds of fritters and pancakes, buns and
        tarts, made thereof, which commonly for a liquorish daintiness
        were presented on the table after supper to delight the palate
        and make the wine relish the better; yet is it of a difficult
        concoction, and offensive to the stomach. For it engendereth bad
        and unwholesome blood, and with its exorbitant heat woundeth
        them with grievous, hurtful, smart, and noisome vapours. And, as
        in divers plants and trees there are two sexes, male and female,
        which is perceptible in laurels, palms, cypresses, oaks, holms,
        the daffodil, mandrake, fern, the agaric, mushroom, birthwort,
        turpentine, pennyroyal, peony, rose of the mount, and many other
        such like, even so in this herb there is a male which beareth no
        flower at all, yet it is very copious of and abundant in seed.
        There is likewise in it a female, which hath great store and
        plenty of whitish flowers, serviceable to little or no purpose,
        nor doth it carry in it seed of any worth at all, at least
        comparable to that of the male. It hath also a larger leaf, and
        much softer than that of the male, nor doth it altogether grow
        to so great a height. This Pantagruelion is to be sown at the
        first coming of the swallows, and is to be plucked out of the
        ground when the grasshoppers begin to be a little hoarse. </p>

          <p><b><font size="+1">How the Famous Pantagruelion Ought to Be
                Prepared and Wrought.</font></b></p>
        </center>
      </b>
      <p>The herb Pantagruelion, in September, under the autumnal
        equinox, is dressed and prepared several ways, according to the
        various fancies of the people and diversity of the climates
        wherein it groweth. The first instruction which Pantagruel gave
        concerning it was to divest and despoil the stalk and stem
        thereof of all its flowers and seeds, to macerate and mortify it
        in pond, pool, or lake water, which is to be made run a little
        for five days together if the season be dry and the water hot,
        or for full nine or twelve days if the weather be cloudish and
        the water cold. Then must it be parched before the sun till it
        be drained of its moisture. After this it is in the shadow,
        where the sun shines not, to be peeled and its rind pulled off.
        Then are the fibres and strings thereof to be parted, wherein,
        as we have already said, consisteth its prime virtue, price, and
        efficacy, and severed from the woody part thereof, which is
        unprofitable, and serveth hardly to any other use than to make a
        clear and glistering blaze, to kindle the fire, and for the
        play, pastime, and disport of little children, to blow up hogs'
        bladders and make them rattle. Many times some use is made
        thereof by tippling sweet-lipped bibbers, who out of it frame
        quills and pipes, through which they with their
        liquor-attractive breath suck up the new dainty wine from the
        bung of the barrel. Some modern Pantagruelists, to shun and
        avoid that manual labour which such a separating and partitional
        work would of necessity require, employ certain cataractic
        instruments, composed and formed after the same manner that the
        froward, pettish, and angry Juno did hold the fingers of both
        her hands interwovenly clenched together when she would have
        hindered the childbirth delivery of Alcmena at the nativity of
        Hercules; and athwart those cataracts they break and bruise to
        very trash the woody parcels, thereby to preserve the better the
        fibres, which are the precious and excellent parts. In and with
        this sole operation do these acquiesce and are contented, who,
        contrary to the received opinion of the whole earth, and in a
        manner paradoxical to all philosophers, gain their livelihoods
        backwards, and by recoiling. But those that love to hold it at a
        higher rate, and prize it according to its value, for their own
        greater profit do the very same which is told us of the
        recreation of the three fatal sister Parcae, or of the nocturnal
        exercise of the noble Circe, or yet of the excuse which Penelope
        made to her fond wooing youngsters and effeminate courtiers
        during the long absence of her husband Ulysses. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>By these means is this herb put into a way to display its
        inestimable virtues, whereof I will discover a part; for to
        relate all is a thing impossible to do. I have already
        interpreted and exposed before you the denomination thereof. I
        find that plants have their names given and bestowed upon them
        after several ways. Some got the name of him who first found
        them out, knew them, sowed them, improved them by culture,
        qualified them to tractability, and appropriated them to the
        uses and subserviences they were fit for, as the Mercuriale from
        Mercury; Panacea from Panace, the daughter of Aesculapius;
        Armois from Artemis, who is Diana; Eupatoria from the king
        Eupator; Telephion from Telephus; Euphorbium from Euphorbus,
        King Juba's physician; Clymenos from Clymenus; Alcibiadium from
        Alcibiades; Gentiane from Gentius, King of Sclavonia, and so
        forth, through a great many other herbs or plants. Truly, in
        ancient times this prerogative of imposing the inventor's name
        upon an herb found out by him was held in a so great account and
        estimation, that, as a controversy arose betwixt Neptune and
        Pallas from which of them two that land should receive its
        denomination which had been equally found out by them both
        together -- though thereafter it was called and had the
        appellation of Athens, from Athene, which is Minerva -- just so
        would Lynceus, King of Scythia, have treacherously slain the
        young Triptolemus, whom Ceres had sent to show unto mankind the
        invention of corn, which until then had been utterly unknown, to
        the end that, after the murder of the messenger, whose death he
        made account to have kept secret, he might, by imposing, with
        the less suspicion of false dealing, his own name upon the said
        found out seed, acquire unto himself an immortal honour and
        glory for having been the inventor of a grain so profitable and
        necessary to and for the use of human life. For the wickedness
        of which treasonable attempt he was by Ceres transformed into
        that wild beast which by some is called a lynx and by others an
        ounce. Such also was the ambition of others upon the like
        occasion, as appeareth by that very sharp wars and of a long
        continuance have been made of old betwixt some residentiary
        kings in Cappadocia upon this only debate, of whose name a
        certain herb should have the appellation; by reason of which
        difference, so troublesome and expensive to them all, it was by
        them called Polemonion, and by us for the same cause termed
        Make-bate. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Other herbs and plants there are which retain the names of the
        countries from whence they were transported, as the Median
        apples from Media, where they first grew; Punic apples from
        Punicia, that is to say, Carthage; Ligusticum, which we call
        lovage, from Liguria, the coast of Genoa; Rhubarb from a flood
        in Barbary, as Ammianus attesteth, called Ru; Santonica from a
        region of that name; Fenugreek from Greece; Gastanes from a
        country so called; Persicaria from Persia; Sabine from a
        territory of that appellation; Staechas from the Staechad
        Islands; Spica Celtica from the land of the Celtic Gauls, and so
        throughout a great many other, which were tedious to enumerate.
        Some others, again, have obtained their denominations by way of
        antiphrasis, or contrariety; as Absinth, because it is contrary
        to (Greek), for it is bitter to the taste in drinking;
        Holosteon, as if it were all bones, whilst, on the contrary,
        there is no frailer, tenderer, nor brittler herb in the whole
        production of nature than it. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>There are some other sorts of herbs which have got their names
        from their virtues and operations, as Aristolochia, because it
        helpeth women in childbirth; Lichen, for that it cureth the
        disease of that name; Mallow, because it mollifieth;
        Callithricum, because it maketh the hair of a bright colour;
        Alyssum, Ephemerum, Bechium, Nasturtium, Aneban (Henbane), and
        so forth through many more. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Other some there are which have obtained their names from the
        admirable qualities that are found to be in them, as
        Heliotropium, which is the marigold, because it followeth the
        sun, so that at the sun rising it displayeth and spreads itself
        out, at his ascending it mounteth, at his declining it waneth,
        and when he is set it is close shut; Adianton, because, although
        it grow near unto watery places, and albeit you should let it
        lie in water a long time, it will nevertheless retain no
        moisture nor humidity; Hierachia, Eringium, and so throughout a
        great many more. There are also a great many herbs and plants
        which have retained the very same names of the men and women who
        have been metamorphosed and transformed in them, as from Daphne
        the laurel is called also Daphne; Myrrh from Myrrha, the
        daughter of Cinarus; Pythis from Pythis; Cinara, which is the
        artichoke, from one of that name; Narcissus, with Saffron,
        Smilax, and divers others. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Many herbs likewise have got their names of those things which
        they seem to have some resemblance to; as Hippuris, because it
        hath the likeness of a horse's tail; Alopecuris, because it
        representeth in similitude the tail of a fox; Psyllion, from a
        flea which it resembleth; Delphinium, for that it is like a
        dolphin fish; Bugloss is so called because it is an herb like an
        ox's tongue; Iris, so called because in its flowers it hath some
        resemblance of the rainbow; Myosota, because it is like the ear
        of a mouse; Coronopus, for that it is of the likeness of a
        crow's foot. A great many other such there are, which here to
        recite were needless. Furthermore, as there are herbs and plants
        which have had their names from those of men, so by a reciprocal
        denomination have the surnames of many families taken their
        origin from them, as the Fabii, a fabis, beans; the Pisons, a
        pisis, peas; the Lentuli from lentils; the Cicerons; a
        ciceribus, vel ciceris, a sort of pulse called chickpease, and
        so forth. In some plants and herbs the resemblance or likeness
        hath been taken from a higher mark or object, as when we say
        Venus' navel, Venus' hair, Venus' tub, Jupiter's beard,
        Jupiter's eye, Mars' blood, the Hermodactyl or Mercury's
        fingers, which are all of them names of herbs, as there are a
        great many more of the like appellation. Others, again, have
        received their denomination from their forms, such as the
        Trefoil, because it is three-leaved; Pentaphylon, for having
        five leaves; Serpolet, because it creepeth along the ground;
        Helxine, Petast, Myrobalon, which the Arabians called Been, as
        if you would say an acorn, for it hath a kind of resemblance
        thereto, and withal is very oily. </p>

        </center>
      </b>
      <p>By such-like means of attaining to a denomination -- the
        fabulous ways being only from thence excepted, for the Lord
        forbid that we should make use of any fables in this a so
        veritable history--is this herb called Pantagruelion, for
        Pantagruel was the inventor thereof. I do not say of the plant
        itself, but of a certain use which it serves for, exceeding
        odious and hateful to thieves and robbers, unto whom it is more
        contrarious and hurtful than the strangle-weed and chokefitch is
        to the flax, the cats- tail to the brakes, the sheave-grass to
        the mowers of hay, the fitches to the chickney-pease, the darnel
        to barley, the hatchet-fitch to the lentil pulse, the antramium
        to the beans, tares to wheat, ivy to walls, the water-lily to
        lecherous monks, the birchen rod to the scholars of the college
        of Navarre in Paris, colewort to the vine-tree, garlic to the
        loadstone, onions to the sight, fern-seed to women with child,
        willow-grain to vicious nuns, the yew-tree shade to those that
        sleep under it, wolfsbane to wolves and libbards, and smell of
        fig-tree to mad bulls, hemlock to goslings, purslane to the
        teeth, or oil to trees. For we have seen many of those rogues,
        by virtue and right application of this herb, finish their lives
        short and long, after the manner of Phyllis, Queen of Thracia,
        of Bonosus, Emperor of Rome, of Amata, King Latinus's wife, of
        Iphis, Autolycus, Lycambe, Arachne, Paedra, Leda, Achius, King
        of Lydia, and many thousands more, who were chiefly angry and
        vexed at this disaster therein, that, without being otherwise
        sick or evil-disposed in their bodies, by a touch only of the
        Pantagruelion they came on a sudden to have the passage
        obstructed, and their pipes, through which were wont to bolt so
        many jolly sayings and to enter so many luscious morsels,
        stopped, more cleverly than ever could have done the squinancy.
      </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Others have been heard most woefully to lament, at the very
        instant when Atropos was about to cut the thread of their life,
        that Pantagruel held them by the gorge. But, well-a-day, it was
        not Pantagruel; he never was an executioner. It was the
        Pantagruelion, manufactured and fashioned into an halter; and
        serving in the place and office of a cravat. In that, verily,
        they solecized and spoke improperly, unless you would excuse
        them by a trope, which alloweth us to posit the inventor in the
        place of the thing invented, as when Ceres is taken for bread,
        and Bacchus put instead of wine. I swear to you here, by the
        good and frolic words which are to issue out of that wine-bottle
        which is a-cooling below in the copper vessel full of fountain
        water, that the noble Pantagruel never snatched any man by the
        throat, unless it was such a one as was altogether careless and
        neglective of those obviating remedies which were preventive of
        the thirst to come. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>It is also termed Pantagruelion by a similitude. For
        Pantagruel, at the very first minute of his birth, was no less
        tall than this herb is long whereof I speak unto you, his
        measure having been then taken the more easy that he was born in
        the season of the great drought, when they were busiest in the
        gathering of the said herb, to wit, at that time when Icarus's
        dog, with his fiery bawling and barking at the sun, maketh the
        whole world Troglodytic, and enforceth people everywhere to hide
        themselves in dens and subterranean caves. It is likewise called
        Pantagruelion because of the notable and singular qualities,
        virtues, and properties thereof. For as Pantagruel hath been the
        idea, pattern, prototype, and exemplary of all jovial perfection
        and accomplishment -- in the truth whereof I believe there is
        none of you gentlemen drinkers that putteth any question -- so
        in this Pantagruelion have I found so much efficacy and energy,
        so much completeness and excellency, so much exquisiteness and
        rarity, and so many admirable effects and operations of a
        transcendent nature, that if worth and virtue thereof had been
        known when those trees, by the relation of the prophet, made
        election of a wooden king to rule and govern over them, it
        without all doubt would have carried away from all the rest the
        plurality of votes and suffrages. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Shall I yet say more? If Oxylus, the son of Orius, had begotten
        this plant upon his sister Hamadryas, he had taken more delight
        in the value and perfection of it alone than in all his eight
        children, so highly renowned by our ablest mythologians that
        they have sedulously recommended their names to the
        never-failing tuition of an eternal remembrance. The eldest
        child was a daughter, whose name was Vine; the next born was a
        boy, and his name was Fig-tree; the third was called
        Walnut-tree; the fourth Oak; the fifth Sorbapple-tree; the sixth
        Ash; the seventh Poplar, and the last had the name of Elm, who
        was the greatest surgeon in his time. I shall forbear to tell
        you how the juice or sap thereof, being poured and distilled
        within the ears, killeth every kind of vermin that by any manner
        of putrefaction cometh to be bred and engendered there, and
        destroyeth also any whatsoever other animal that shall have
        entered in thereat. If, likewise, you put a little of the said
        juice within a pail or bucket full of water, you shall see the
        water instantly turn and grow thick therewith as if it were
        milk-curds, whereof the virtue is so great that the water thus
        curded is a present remedy for horses subject to the colic, and
        such as strike at their own flanks. The root thereof well boiled
        mollifieth the joints, softeneth the hardness of shrunk-in
        sinews, is every way comfortable to the nerves, and good against
        all cramps and convulsions, as likewise all cold and knotty
        gouts. If you would speedily heal a burning, whether occasioned
        by water or fire, apply thereto a little raw Pantagruelion, that
        is to say, take it so as it cometh out of the ground, without
        bestowing any other preparation or composition upon it; but have
        a special care to change it for some fresher in lieu thereof as
        soon as you shall find it waxing dry upon the sore. </p>
      <p>Without this herb kitchens would be detested, the tables of
        dining-rooms abhorred, although there were great plenty and
        variety of most dainty and sumptuous dishes of meat set down
        upon them, and the choicest beds also, how richly soever adorned
        with gold, silver, amber, ivory, porphyry, and the mixture of
        most precious metals, would without it yield no delight or
        pleasure to the reposers in them. Without it millers could
        neither carry wheat, nor any other kind of corn to the mill, nor
        would they be able to bring back from thence flour, or any other
        sort of meal whatsoever. Without it, how could the papers and
        writs of lawyers' clients be brought to the bar? Solemn is the
        mortar, lime, or plaster brought to the workhouse without it.
        Without it, how should the water be got out of a draw-well? In
        what case would tabellions, notaries, copists, makers of
        counterpanes, writers, clerks, secretaries, scriveners, and
        such-like persons be without it? Were it not for it, what would
        become of the toll- rates and rent-rolls? Would not the noble
        art of printing perish without it? Whereof could the chassis or
        paper-windows be made? How should the bells be rung? The altars
        of Isis are adorned therewith, the Pastophorian priests are
        therewith clad and accoutred, and whole human nature covered and
        wrapped therein at its first position and production in and into
        this world. All the lanific trees of Seres, the bumbast and
        cotton bushes in the territories near the Persian Sea and Gulf
        of Bengala, the Arabian swans, together with the plants of
        Malta, do not all the them clothe, attire, and apparel so many
        persons as this one herb alone. Soldiers are nowadays much
        better sheltered under it than they were in former times, when
        they lay in tents covered with skins. It overshadows the
        theatres and amphitheatres from the heat of a scorching sun. It
        begirdeth and encompasseth forests, chases, parks, copses, and
        groves, for the pleasure of hunters. It descendeth into the salt
        and fresh of both sea and river- waters for the profit of
        fishers. By it are boots of all sizes, buskins, gamashes,
        brodkins, gambadoes, shoes, pumps, slippers, and every cobbled
        ware wrought and made steadable for the use of man. By it the
        butt and rover-bows are strung, the crossbows bended, and the
        slings made fixed. And, as if it were an herb every whit as holy
        as the vervain, and reverenced by ghosts, spirits, hobgoblins,
        fiends, and phantoms, the bodies of deceased men are never
        buried without it. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>I will proceed yet further. By the means of this fine herb the
        invisible substances are visibly stopped, arrested, taken,
        detained, and prisoner- like committed to their receptive gaols.
        Heavy and ponderous weights are by it heaved, lifted up, turned,
        veered, drawn, carried, and every way moved quickly, nimbly, and
        easily, to the great profit and emolument of humankind. When I
        perpend with myself these and such-like marvellous effects of
        this wonderful herb, it seemeth strange unto me how the
        invention of so useful a practice did escape through so many
        by-past ages the knowledge of the ancient philosophers,
        considering the inestimable utility which from thence proceeded,
        and the immense labour which without it they did undergo in
        their pristine elucubrations. By virtue thereof, through the
        retention of some aerial gusts, are the huge rambarges, mighty
        galleons, the large floats, the Chiliander, the Myriander ships
        launched from their stations and set a-going at the pleasure and
        arbitrament of their rulers, conders, and steersmen. By the help
        thereof those remote nations whom nature seemed so unwilling to
        have discovered to us, and so desirous to have kept them still
        in abscondito and hidden from us, that the ways through which
        their countries were to be reached unto were not only totally
        unknown, but judged also to be altogether impermeable and
        inaccessible, are now arrived to us, and we to them. </p>
      <p>Those voyages outreached flights of birds and far surpassed the
        scope of feathered fowls, how swift soever they had been on the
        wing, and notwithstanding that advantage which they have of us
        in swimming through the air. Taproban hath seen the heaths of
        Lapland, and both the Javas and Riphaean mountains; wide distant
        Phebol shall see Theleme, and the Islanders drink of the flood
        Euphrates. By it the chill-mouthed Boreas hath surveyed the
        parched mansions of the torrid Auster, and Eurus visited the
        regions which Zephyrus hath under his command; yea, in such sort
        have interviews been made by the assistance of this sacred herb,
        that, maugre longitudes and latitudes, and all the variations of
        the zones, the Periaecian people, and Antoecian, Amphiscian,
        Heteroscian, and Periscian had oft rendered and received mutual
        visits to and from other, upon all the climates. These strange
        exploits bred such astonishment to the celestial intelligences,
        to all the marine and terrestrial gods, that they were on a
        sudden all afraid. From which amazement, when they saw how, by
        means of this blest Pantagruelion, the Arctic people looked upon
        the Antarctic, scoured the Atlantic Ocean, passed the tropics,
        pushed through the torrid zone, measured all the zodiac, sported
        under the equinoctial, having both poles level with their
        horizon, they judged it high time to call a council for their
        own safety and preservation. </p>
      <p>The Olympic gods, being all and each of them affrighted at the
        sight of such achievements, said: Pantagruel hath shapen work
        enough for us, and put us more to a plunge and nearer our wits'
        end by this sole herb of his than did of old the Aloidae by
        overturning mountains. He very speedily is to be married, and
        shall have many children by his wife. It lies not in our power
        to oppose this destiny; for it hath passed through the hands and
        spindles of the Fatal Sisters, necessity's inexorable daughters.
        Who knows but by his sons may be found out an herb of such
        another virtue and prodigious energy, as that by the aid
        thereof, in using it aright according to their father's skill,
        they may contrive a way for humankind to pierce into the high
        aerian clouds, get up unto the springhead of the hail, take an
        inspection of the snowy sources, and shut and open as they
        please the sluices from whence proceed the floodgates of the
        rain; then, prosecuting their aethereal voyage, they may step in
        unto the lightning workhouse and shop, where all the
        thunderbolts are forged, where, seizing on the magazine of
        heaven and storehouse of our warlike fire-munition, they may
        discharge a bouncing peal or two of thundering ordnance for joy
        of their arrival to these new supernal places, and, charging
        those tonitrual guns afresh, turn the whole force of that
        artillery against ourselves wherein we most confided. Then is it
        like they will set forward to invade the territories of the
        Moon, whence, passing through both Mercury and Venus, the Sun
        will serve them for a torch, to show the way from Mars to
        Jupiter and Saturn. We shall not then be able to resist the
        impetuosity of their intrusion, nor put a stoppage to their
        entering in at all, whatever regions, domiciles, or mansions of
        the spangled firmament they shall have any mind to see, to stay
        in, to travel through for their recreation. All the celestial
        signs together, with the constellations of the fixed stars, will
        jointly be at their devotion then. Some will take up their
        lodging at the Ram, some at the Bull, and others at the Twins;
        some at the Crab, some at the Lion Inn, and others at the sign
        of the Virgin; some at the Balance, others at the Scorpion, and
        others will be quartered at the Archer; some will be harboured
        at the Goat, some at the Water-pourer's sign, some at the
        Fishes; some will lie at the Crown, some at the Harp, some at
        the Golden Eagle and the Dolphin; some at the Flying Horse, some
        at the Ship, some at the great, some at the little Bear; and so
        throughout the glistening hostelries of the whole twinkling
        asteristic welkin. There will be sojourners come from the earth,
        who, longing after the taste of the sweet cream, of their own
        skimming off, from the best milk of all the dairy of the Galaxy,
        will set themselves at table down with us, drink of our nectar
        and ambrosia, and take to their own beds at night for wives and
        concubines our fairest goddesses, the only means whereby they
        can be deified. A junto hereupon being convocated, the better to
        consult upon the manner of obviating a so dreadful danger, Jove,
        sitting in his presidential throne, asked the votes of all the
        other gods, which, after a profound deliberation amongst
        themselves on all contingencies, they freely gave at last, and
        then resolved unanimously to withstand the shocks of all
        whatsoever sublunary assaults. </p>

        </center>
      </b>
      <p>I&nbsp; have already related to you great and admirable things;
        but, if you might be induced to adventure upon the hazard of
        believing some other divinity of this sacred Pantagruelion, I
        very willingly would tell it you. Believe it, if you will, or
        otherwise, believe it not, I care not which of them you do, they
        are both alike to me. It shall be sufficient for my purpose to
        have told you the truth, and the truth I will tell you. But to
        enter in thereat, because it is of a knaggy, difficult, and
        rugged access, this is the question which I ask of you. If I had
        put within this bottle two pints, the one of wine and the other
        of water, thoroughly and exactly mingled together, how would you
        unmix them? After what manner would you go about to sever them,
        and separate the one liquor from the other, in such sort that
        you render me the water apart, free from the wine, and the wine
        also pure, without the intermixture of one drop of water, and
        both of them in the same measure, quantity, and taste that I had
        embottled them? Or, to state the question otherwise. If your
        carmen and mariners, entrusted for the provision of your houses
        with the bringing of a certain considerable number of tuns,
        puncheons, pipes, barrels, and hogsheads of Graves wine, or of
        the wine of Orleans, Beaune, and Mireveaux, should drink out the
        half, and afterwards with water fill up the other empty halves
        of the vessels as full as before, as the Limosins use to do in
        their carriages by wains and carts of the wines of Argenton and
        Sangaultier; after that, how would you part the water from the
        wine, and purify them both in such a case? I understand you well
        enough. Your meaning is, that I must do it with an ivy funnel.
        That is written, it is true, and the verity thereof explored by
        a thousand experiments; you have learned to do this feat before,
        I see it. But those that have never known it, nor at any time
        have seen the like, would hardly believe that it were possible.
        Let us nevertheless proceed. </p>
      <p>But put the case, we were now living in the age of Sylla,
        Marius, Caesar, and other such Roman emperors, or that we were
        in the time of our ancient Druids, whose custom was to burn and
        calcine the dead bodies of their parents and lords, and that you
        had a mind to drink the ashes or cinders of your wives or
        fathers in the infused liquor of some good white-wine, as
        Artemisia drunk the dust and ashes of her husband Mausolus; or
        otherwise, that you did determine to have them reserved in some
        fine urn or reliquary pot; how would you save the ashes apart,
        and separate them from those other cinders and ashes into which
        the fuel of the funeral and bustuary fire hath been converted?
        Answer, if you can. By my figgins, I believe it will trouble you
        so to do. </p>
      <p>Well, I will despatch, and tell you that, if you take of this
        celestial Pantagruelion so much as is needful to cover the body
        of the defunct, and after that you shall have enwrapped and
        bound therein as hard and closely as you can the corpse of the
        said deceased persons, and sewed up the folding-sheet with
        thread of the same stuff, throw it into the fire, how great or
        ardent soever it be it matters not a straw, the fire through
        this Pantagruelion will burn the body and reduce to ashes the
        bones thereof, and the Pantagruelion shall be not only not
        consumed nor burnt, but also shall neither lose one atom of the
        ashes enclosed within it, nor receive one atom of the huge
        bustuary heap of ashes resulting from the blazing conflagration
        of things combustible laid round about it, but shall at last,
        when taken out of the fire, be fairer, whiter, and much cleaner
        than when you did put it in at first. Therefore it is called
        Asbeston, which is as much to say as incombustible. Great plenty
        is to be found thereof in Carpasia, as likewise in the climate
        Dia Sienes, at very easy rates. O how rare and admirable a thing
        it is, that the fire which devoureth, consumeth, and destroyeth
        all such things else, should cleanse, purge, and whiten this
        sole Pantagruelion Carpasian Asbeston! If you mistrust the
        verity of this relation, and demand for further confirmation of
        my assertion a visible sign, as the Jews and such incredulous
        infidels use to do, take a fresh egg, and orbicularly, or rather
        ovally, enfold it within this divine Pantagruelion. When it is
        so wrapped up, put it in the hot embers of a fire, how great or
        ardent soever it be, and having left it there as long as you
        will, you shall at last, at your taking it out of the fire, find
        the egg roasted hard, and as it were burnt, without any
        alteration, change, mutation, or so much as a calefaction of the
        sacred Pantagruelion. For less than a million of pounds
        sterling, modified, taken down, and amoderated to the twelfth
        part of one fourpence halfpenny farthing, you are able to put it
        to a trial and make proof thereof. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>Do not think to overmatch me here, by paragoning with it in the
        way of a more eminent comparison the Salamander. That is a fib;
        for, albeit a little ordinary fire, such as is used in
        dining-rooms and chambers, gladden, cheer up, exhilarate, and
        quicken it, yet may I warrantably enough assure that in the
        flaming fire of a furnace it will, like any other animated
        creature, be quickly suffocated, choked, consumed, and
        destroyed. We have seen the experiment thereof, and Galen many
        ages ago hath clearly demonstrated and confirmed it, Lib. 3, <i>De





          temperamentis</i>, and Dioscorides maintaineth the same
        doctrine, Lib. 2. Do not here instance in competition with this
        sacred herb the feather alum or the wooden tower of Pyraeus,
        which Lucius Sylla was never able to get burnt; for that
        Archelaus, governor of the town for Mithridates, King of Pontus,
        had plastered it all over on the outside with the said alum. Nor
        would I have you to compare therewith the herb which Alexander
        Cornelius called Eonem, and said that it had some resemblance
        with that oak which bears the mistletoe, and that it could
        neither be consumed nor receive any manner of prejudice by fire
        nor by water, no more than the mistletoe, of which was built,
        said he, the so renowned ship Argos. Search where you please for
        those that will believe it. I in that point desire to be
        excused. Neither would I wish you to parallel therewith --
        although I cannot deny but that it is of a very marvellous
        nature--that sort of tree which groweth alongst the mountains of
        Brianson and Ambrun, which produceth out of his root the good
        agaric. From its body it yieldeth unto us a so excellent rosin,
        that Galen hath been bold to equal it to the turpentine. Upon
        the delicate leaves thereof it retaineth for our use that sweet
        heavenly honey which is called the manna, and, although it be of
        a gummy, oily, fat, and greasy substance, it is,
        notwithstanding, unconsumable by any fire. It is in Greek and
        Latin called Larix. The Alpinese name is Melze. The Antenorides
        and Venetians term it Larege; which gave occasion to that castle
        in Piedmont to receive the denomination of Larignum, by putting
        Julius Caesar to a stand at his return from amongst the Gauls. </p>
      <p>Julius Caesar commanded all the yeomen, boors, hinds, and other
        inhabitants in, near unto, and about the Alps and Piedmont, to
        bring all manner of victuals and provision for an army to those
        places which on the military road he had appointed to receive
        them for the use of his marching soldiery. To which ordinance
        all of them were obedient, save only those as were within the
        garrison of Larignum, who, trusting in the natural strength of
        the place, would not pay their contribution. The emperor,
        purposing to chastise them for their refusal, caused his whole
        army to march straight towards that castle, before the gate
        whereof was erected a tower built of huge big spars and rafters
        of the larch-tree, fast bound together with pins and pegs of the
        same wood, and interchangeably laid on one another, after the
        fashion of a pile or stack of timber, set up in the fabric
        thereof to such an apt and convenient height that from the
        parapet above the portcullis they thought with stones and levers
        to beat off and drive away such as should approach thereto. </p>
      <b> </b>
      <p>When Caesar had understood that the chief defence of those
        within the castle did consist in stones and clubs, and that it
        was not an easy matter to sling, hurl, dart, throw, or cast them
        so far as to hinder the approaches, he forthwith commanded his
        men to throw great store of bavins, faggots, and fascines round
        about the castle, and when they had made the heap of a competent
        height, to put them all in a fair fire; which was thereupon
        incontinently done. The fire put amidst the faggots was so great
        and so high that it covered the whole castle, that they might
        well imagine the tower would thereby be altogether burnt to
        dust, and demolished. Nevertheless, contrary to all their hopes
        and expectations, when the flame ceased, and that the faggots
        were quite burnt and consumed, the tower appeared as whole,
        sound, and entire as ever. Caesar, after a serious consideration
        had thereof, commanded a compass to be taken without the
        distance of a stone cast from the castle round about it there,
        with ditches and entrenchments to form a blockade; which when
        the Larignans understood, they rendered themselves upon terms.
        And then by a relation from them it was that Caesar learned the
        admirable nature and virtue of this wood, which of itself
        produceth neither fire, flame, nor coal, and would, therefore,
        in regard of that rare quality of incombustibility, have been
        admitted into this rank and degree of a true Pantagruelional
        plant; and that so much the rather, for that Pantagruel directed
        that all the gates, doors, angiports, windows, gutters,
        fretticed and embowed ceilings, cans, and other whatsoever
