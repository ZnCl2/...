      </center>
      <p>Occasionally, physicists have postulated the existence of a
        fifth force in addition to the four known fundamental forces.
        The force is generally believed to have roughly the strength of
        gravity (i.e. it is much weaker than electromagnetism or the
        nuclear forces) and to have a range of anywhere from less than a
        millimeter to cosmological scales. </p>
      <p>The idea is difficult to test, because gravity is such a weak
        force: the gravitational interaction between two objects is only
        significant when one is very heavy. Therefore, it takes very
        precise equipment to measure gravitational interactions between
        objects that are small compared to the Earth. Nonetheless, in
        the late 1980s a fifth force, operating on municipal scales
        (i.e. with a range of about 100 meters), was reported by
        researchers (Fischbach et al.) who were reanalyzing results of
        Loránd Eötvös from earlier in the century. The force was
        believed to be linked with hypercharge. Over a number of years,
        other experiments have failed to duplicate this result, and
        physicists now believe that there is no evidence for a fifth
        force. </p>
      <p><b>Theory and Experiment</b> </p>
      <p>There are at least three kinds of searches that can be
        undertaken, which depend on the kind of force being considered,
        and its range. </p>
      <p>One way is to search for a fifth force with tests of the strong
        equivalence principle: this is one of the most powerful tests of
        Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity. Alternative
        theories of gravity, such as Brans-Dicke theory, have a fifth
        force — possibly with infinite range. This is because
        gravitational interactions, in theories other than general
        relativity, have degrees of freedom other than the "metric,"
        which dictates the curvature of space, and different kinds of
        degrees of freedom produce different effects. For example, a
        scalar field cannot produce the bending of light rays. The fifth
        force would manifest itself in an effect on solar system orbits,
        called the Nordtvedt effect. This is tested with Lunar Laser
        Ranging Experiment and very long baseline interferometry. </p>
      <p>Another kind of fifth force, which arises in Kaluza-Klein
        theory, where the universe has extra dimensions, or in
        supergravity or string theory is the Yukawa force, which is
        transmitted by a light scalar field (i.e. a scalar field with a
        long Compton wavelength, which determines the range). This has
        prompted a lot of recent interest, as a theory of supersymmetric
        large extra dimensions — dimensions with size slightly less than
        a millimeter — has prompted an experimental effort to test
        gravity on these very small scales. This requires extremely
        sensitive experiments which search for a deviation from the
        inverse square law of gravity over a range of distances.
        Essentially, they are looking for signs that the Yukawa
        interaction is kicking in at a certain length. </p>
      <p>Australian researchers, attempting to measure the gravitational
        constant deep in a mine shaft, found a discrepancy between the
        predicted and measured value, with the measured value being two
        percent too small. They concluded that the results may be
        explained by a repulsive fifth force with a range from a few
        centimetres to a kilometre. Similar experiments have been
        carried out onboard a submarine (USS Dolphin (AGSS-555)) while
        deeply submerged. </p>
      <p>The above experiments search for a fifth force that is, like
        gravity, independent of the composition of an object, so all
        objects experience the force in proportion to their masses.
        Forces that depend on the composition of an object can be very
        sensitively tested by torsion balance experiments of a type
        invented by Loránd Eötvös. Such forces may depend, for example,
        on the ratio of protons to neutrons in an atomic nucleus, or the
        relative amount of different kinds of binding energy in a
        nucleus (see the semi-empirical mass formula). Searches have
        been done from very short ranges, to municipal scales, to the
        scale of the Earth, the sun, and dark matter at the center of
        the galaxy. </p>
      <p><b>Other Interactions</b> </p>
      <p>A few physicists think that Einstein's theory of gravity will
        have to be modified, not at small scales, but at large
        distances, or, equivalently, small accelerations. They point out
        that dark matter, dark energy and even the Pioneer anomaly are
        unexplained by the Standard Model of particle physics and
        suggest that some modification of gravity, possibly arising from
        Modified Newtonian Dynamics or the holographic principle. This
        is fundamentally different from conventional ideas of a fifth
        force, as it grows stronger relative to gravity at longer
        distances. Most physicists, however, think that dark matter and
        dark energy are not ad hoc, but are supported by a large number
        of complementary observations and described by a very simple
        model. </p>

      <p>Physicists at Purdue University believe they have discovered a
        fifth elementary force of nature. This postulated force, named
        hypercharge, may oppose the force of gravity. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ephraim Fischbach and his colleagues have reinterpreted the
        results of the experiments of Roland von Eotv"os, a Hungarian
        scientist of the early 20th century. Eotvos' work involved a
        test of the principle of equivalence, an Einsteinian postulate
        stating that gravity affects objects independently of their
        composition. Eotv"os found a small but systematic error in his
        calculations and declared a null experiment. </p>
      <p>The principle of equivalence is one of the fundamental
        assumptions of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. Even the
        verification of hypercharge is unlikely to seriously affect the
        principle, according to Peter Saulsan, a principle research
        scientist for the MIT Department of Physics. </p>
      <p>Fischbach declared in the Jan. 6 issue of Physical Review
        Letters that Eotvos' error is systematic enough to prove the
        existence of an ephemeral force opposed to that of gravity. </p>
      <p>Saulson said that Fischbach had found an "astoundingly good"
        correlation between the degree of the error and the baryon
        number of the tested materials. The baryon number of a material
        is equal to the total number of protons and neutrons in its
        nucleus. </p>
      <p>The extremely localized effect of the hypercharge force would
        not significantly damage the theory of relativity, Saulsan said.
      </p>
      <p>The principal differences between hypercharge and gravity
        appear to lie in the forces' effective range and strength,
        Saulsan said. </p>
      <p>Unlike gravity, whose effects seem to extend to an infinite
        distance, hypercharge appears to have a finite range of
        approximately 200 meters, he continued. </p>
      <p>Two other elementary forces, the strong and weak nuclear
        forces, also have finite ranges, although the range of these
        forces is more on the order of the diameter of the atomic
        nucleus, Saulsan said. </p>
      <p>Fischbach also quoted the results of more recent experiments
        which seem to support the existence of hypercharge, Saulsan
        said. </p>
      <p>Experiments conducted as far as one kilometer underground by
        Frank D. Stacey of the University of Queensland in Australia
        indicate that the force of gravity varies by as much as
        seven-tenths of one percent at different depths in the earth. </p>
      <p>Other scientists have reported the apparent effects of another
        elementary force in experiments conducted at the Fermi National
        Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, according to a Jan.
        8 article in the New York Times. </p>
      <p>The theory of hypercharge could still face some problems,
        Saulsan claimed. For instance, Eotvos' "systematic trend" of
        error is greater than Stacey's reported gravitometric anomaly by
        a factor of more than 20. </p>
      <p>Reasonable explanations for this disagreement exist, Saulsan
        suggested. He elaborated on the difficulty of Eotvos' original
        experiment, which involved the use of a torsion balance which
        would respond to gravity while taking the rotation of the earth
        into account. </p>
      <p>Interpreting data from a 60-year-old experiment is also rather
        difficult, Saulsan said. In addition, Stacey's work required him
        to estimate the density of the rock above him as he conducted
        his experiments. These estimates could easily have been in
        error, he continued. </p>
      <p>Four elementary forces have already been identified. In order
        from weakest to strongest, they are: gravity, electromagnetic,
        the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force. Scientists
        believe that these forces can explain any phenomenon, including
        the creation of the universe. </p>
      <p>If hypercharge actually does exist, it would be a step away
        from physicists' attempts to mathematically unify the elementary
        forces of nature, Saulsan said. But widespread acceptance of the
        theory would not threaten any physicist's "dearly-cherished
        notions," he added. </p>
      <p>The theory would still be a "first-rate" discovery if verified,
        Saulsan said. </p>

      <p>In the famous anecdote, Galileo Galilei clambered to the top of
        the Leaning Tower of Pisa, simultaneously dropped cannonballs of
        different sizes and found that they all hit the ground at the
        same time. He thus convinced the world -- and in the years to
        come, Sir Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein as well -- that in a
        vacuum all objects, regardless of mass, fall at the same speed.
        Galileo's work went unchallenged until last week, when Purdue
        University Physics Professor Ephraim Fischbach, three of his
        graduate students and S.H. Aronson, a physicist at Brookhaven
        National Laboratory in New York, reported discerning a
        previously unknown force that causes objects of different masses
        to fall at different rates. </p>
      <p>If Fischbach is proved right, his hypothetical force, which he
        calls hypercharge, would be the fifth known basic force. (Four
        forces are known to exist: gravity; electromagnetism; the strong
        force, which binds the atomic nucleus; and the weak force, which
        is responsible for certain types of radioactivity.) Hypercharge,
        Fischbach reports in Physical Review Letters, is an extremely
        weak repulsive force that acts between objects no more than
        about 600 feet apart and varies in strength from element to
        element. It is strongest in iron and weakest in hydrogen. Thus,
        the physicists contend, if an iron ball and, say, a feather were
        released simultaneously in a vacuum, the iron's repulsive
        hypercharge would act more strongly than the feather's to
        counteract the earth's gravity--and the feather would hit first.
      </p>
      <p>The team began looking for evidence of hypercharge after
        perceiving what Fischbach calls "funny results" in two
        contemporary experiments, one involving gravity tests in a deep
        mine, the other the behavior of subatomic particles. "We felt
        the results could be explained with an additional force," says
        Fischbach, "so we went back to the data published by Baron
        Roland von Eötvös in Hungary in 1922 to see if we could find
        evidence." Eötvös had indirectly measured the speeds at which
        objects fall and found small discrepancies, which he attributed
        to limitations in his equipment. Re-examining the data, the team
        decided that the aberrations were caused by hypercharge. But
        other physicists caution that more experiments are necessary
        before a firm conclusion can be reached. Says Harvard
        University's Sheldon Glashow: "The work suggests an interesting
        direction, but by no means should be taken as a real discovery."

      <p>It is shown that Eötvös-type torsion-balance experiments
        performed in the vicinity of a large cliff may be used as
        sensitive tests for the recently postulated existence of a
        medium-range hypercharge force. The residual nonzero effect
        found in the original Eötvös results could be mainly due to
        terrain irregularities and thus be larger than, but still

        <p><b>by</b><b> John G. Cramer</b> </p>
      </center>
      <p>Sometimes physics moves surprisingly fast, sometimes
        dismayingly slowly. In mid-December I wrote my AV column
        (Analog, 7/86) on antigravity, a familiar SF concept. That
        column was based on a 1957 paper by Bondi on negative mass.
        Almost nothing had been published on gravitational repulsion in
        the almost 30 years since the appearance of Bondi's paper. The
        scientific "field" of antigravity research was essentially
        non-existent. </p>
      <p>Then, as soon as my column was safely submitted, hot new
        results on antigravity appeared. The lead article in the January
        6, 1986 issue of Physical Review Letters had the unassuming
        title: "A Reanalysis of the Eötvös Experiment" by E. Fischbach,
        et al. Two days later the New York Times ran an article with the
        headline: "Hints of Fifth Force in Universe Challenge Galileo's
        Findings" describing the importance of Fischbach's work.
        Peculiar experimental results from terrestrial gravity
        measurements and from the behavior of "strange" K-mesons (kaons)
        had been explained by a new theory proposing a "hypercharge"
        force, a new fifth force of nature which is gravity-like but
        which repels rather than attracting nearby masses. This new
        antigravity force is the subject of this AV column. </p>
      <p>The first thread of this story goes back two centuries to Sir
        Isaac Newton. Newton discovered the famous gravitational
        "inverse square-law" relation, F12 = Gm1m2/r2, which proved
        equally useful in predicting the orbit of the Moon and the force
        of gravity at the surface of the Earth. In Newton's equation G
        is a fundamental quantity called the universal gravitational
        constant. Among the physical constants of nature, G stands out
        as being the most uncertain. Fundamental constants (the velocity
        of light, the electron charge) are usually known to a few parts
        per million, but G, with a value of 6.673 × 10-11 m3/kg-s2, is
        known to only about 1 part in 2000. </p>
      <p>In a way, it is surprising that G is so poorly known. The
        orbits of planets in our solar system depend directly on G and
        are both observed and calculated to parts per billion. The
        problem is that to obtain G from these data we must have a
        completely independent knowledge of the masses involved in the
        gravitational attraction. Unfortunately, we have no way,
        independent of orbital dynamics, of measuring the masses of the
        Earth, Moon, Sun, Jupiter, etc. Therefore, our imprecise
        knowledge of G must come from the very weak force of
        gravitational attraction observed in the laboratory between two
        masses, for example two large lead spheres placed close
        together. </p>
      <p>But there is another way of measuring G. The oil industry has
        developed extremely precise devices for measuring g, the
        acceleration due to gravity, both on and beneath the Earth's
        surface. The dependence of the acceleration g on depth can be
        used to determine the gravity constant G. When the densities of
        the rock strata have been well mapped, this determination has an
        accuracy comparable to laboratory measurements of G. One would
        expect both methods to give the same value of the "constant". It
        is a big surprise, therefore, that the geological technique
        gives a value of 6.734 × 10-11 m3/kg-s2 (instead of 6.673 ×
        10-11). It would appear that this "universal constant" has
        significantly different values below the Earth's surface and in
        a surface laboratory. </p>
      <p>The second thread of the story comes from modern particle
        physics. The species of particles called K-mesons or kaons are
        unusual among mesons in having a characteristic called
        hypercharge, a conserved property of certain particles. The
        neutral "matter" kaon is the Ko theoretically a system composed
        of a "down" quark and an "anti-strange" quark, has a hypercharge
        of +1. Its antimatter twin, the Kõ, a strange quark and an
        anti-down quark, has a hypercharge of -1. Both Ko's have the
        same electrical charge (Q=0), the same spin (s=0), and the same
        mass (about half that of a proton). From all external clues
        these two theoretical particles are indistinguishable except in
        their hypercharge, which is not directly observable. </p>
      <p>In this situation where two states of matter cannot be
        distinguished externally, quantum mechanics tells us that a very
        interesting thing happens. The two indistinguishable states are
        "mixed" to make two new states of matter which are
        distinguishable. This mixing produces from the combination
        (Ko-Kõ) the particle KS which decays in about 10-10 seconds (and
        so is called K-short). And it produces from the combination (Ko+
        Kõ) the particle KL which decays 581 times more slowly (and
        therefore is called K-long). The KL particle has been found to
        be very peculiar in its decay into other particles, showing a
        favoritism for one direction of time over another and for matter
        over antimatter. These violations of symmetry principles of
        nature (time-reversal and charge invariance) are not understood
        in any fundamental way. </p>
      <p>But more recently another peculiarity of the kaon system has
        been discovered which is even more of a puzzle. Detailed studies
        of the KL and KS mesons have been made at a number of
        accelerator laboratories under a variety of experimental
        circumstances. When these experiments are reduced to the few
        basic "constants" of the kaon system, for example the KL-KS mass
        difference and the KS half-life, these "constants" are found to
        depend on the velocity of the kaons with respect to the
        laboratory frame of reference. This is not a special relativity
        effect; those are already included in the data analysis. In
        fact, this velocity dependence cannot be readily accounted for
        by any of the four known forces or by any known physical
        effects. </p>
      <p>Prof. Ephriam Fischbach and his colleagues, in the paper
        mentioned above, have sought to explain both of these curious
        results, the variation of G and the velocity dependence of the
        kaon system, with a single theory. They start with the fact that
        kaons, neutrons, and protons all have hypercharge. Perhaps, the
        paper speculates, there is new and very weak force associated
        with hypercharge which is responsible for the anomalies in both
        the gravitational and the kaon measurements. Starting from this
        point, they calculate the properties which such a "fifth" force
        must have to be consistent with these observations. They
        conclude that this new force would be very much like gravity,
        but with four important differences: (1) it depends on
        hypercharge rather than mass; (2) it is a repulsive force, in
        that objects with the same hypercharge are repelled from each
        other; (3) it has a strength only 0.7% that of gravity; and (4)
        it is a "short range" force which cuts off exponentially at
        distances on the order of 200 meters. </p>
      <p>This last point requires some explanation. Two of the four
        known forces of nature, gravity and electromagnetism, are "long
        range" forces which fall off as 1/r2 with the distance from a
        massive or charged object but otherwise extend to infinity. The
        other two known forces, the weak and strong interactions, are
        "short range" and cut off to zero at distances on the order of
        the size of a nucleus. These differences in range are attributed
        to the masses of the "mediating particles" which produce the
        forces. Electromagnetism is mediated by the photon and gravity
        by the graviton, both particles with zero rest-mass which give
        their corresponding forces infinite range. The strong
        interaction is mediated by the gluon and the weak interaction by
        the Z and W particles, all of which have masses on the order of
        that of the proton and give their corresponding forces very
        short ranges. According to the "fifth force" hypothesis, the
        range of the force which would account for the G measurements
        and the kaon anomalies would have to be about 200 meters. This
        corresponds to a very light mediating particle (the
        "hyper-photon") with a mass about 10-14 that of the electron. </p>
      <p>This hypothesis can explain the G difference. Gravitating
        objects within a few hundred meters of each other, for example,
        the lead spheres in a laboratory measurement of G, feel a 0.7%
        repulsion from the hypercharge force which reduces the
        attraction slightly and leads to a slightly low measured value
        for G. The geological measurements of g, however, record the
        gravitational attraction of masses which are typically much more
        distant than a few hundred meters and give a value of G
        unmodified by hypercharge repulsion. </p>
      <p>The hypothesis can also explain the kaon energy dependence. The
        Ko and Kõ, with opposite hypercharges, are mixed in slightly
        different proportions at different velocities because the extra
        hypercharge force from the nearby neutrons and protons of nuclei
        in the laboratory acts oppositely on them. Thus their invariant
        properties become variables. The "true" properties of the kaons,
        according to the hypercharge theory, would be obtained if
        measurements were made in empty space with no hypercharge field
        from nearby matter to modify the Ko+ Kõ mixing. </p>
      <p>Like any theory, this one need testing. And one "test" has
        already been done and seems to agree with the predictions of the
        theory. This test was not a new experiment but a re-analysis of
        the Eötvös Experiment, the famous experimental comparison of
        inertial and gravitational mass performed by a Hungarian count
        in the early decades of this century and published only after
        his death in 1922. Fischbach and his collaborators realized that
        Eötvös should have seen some evidence for the hypercharge force.
        The reason is that the hypercharge of a nucleus depends strictly
        on the number of neutrons and protons in the nucleus, while the
        mass of a nucleus depends also on the binding energy of the
        system. Thus an iron nucleus with large binding energy has a
        larger hypercharge-to-mass ratio than does a hydrogen nucleus.
        To put it another way, a kilogram sphere of water contains fewer
        neutrons and protons and has a smaller hypercharge than a
        kilogram sphere of iron. Therefore the sphere of water should
        fall slightly faster in vacuum than the iron sphere because
        there would be a smaller hypercharge force acting on the water
        than on the iron. The Eötvös experiment should have shown the
        effects of these small modifications of the force of gravity.
        And Fischbach's re-examination of the Eötvös data reveals that
        indeed the predicted effect does seem to be present in the old
        data. </p>
      <p>This new theory has had its first experimental confirmation.
        Much more work in testing for the hypercharge force needs to be
        done, of course, before it can be considered as established.
        This is a "hot" topic and many experimental groups, including
        one in my own laboratory, are swinging into action to do the
        testing. </p>
      <p>But in the nature of this column, let's assume for the moment
        that the hypercharge force is real and consider its science
        fiction implications. First, by damn, we have antigravity! But
        no dancing in the streets just yet, please! For use in the
        "normal" antigravity way in science fiction, the hypercharge
        force does have a few problems: (1) it's too weak, and (2) it
        only works over a few hundred meters of distance. So we need
        some hypercharge "amplifier", some way for getting more
        hypercharge without getting more mass. That might be possible if
        there were massless particles (maybe hyper-photons or
        neutrinos), that had hypercharge without having a proton-size
        mass, but none-such are known. Or perhaps there are
        "hyper-magnetic" effects when a hypercharged object is moved at
        a goodly velocity. </p>
      <p>Anyhow, suppose we can overcome this obstacle and produce
        vehicles using hyper-repulsion. How might they work? Well, first
        of all the range is a problem. At 600 meters above the ground,
        the range effect will cut down the hyper-repulsion to only 5% of
        what it is at the surface. So the vehicle would be most
        effective at distances of 50 meters or less above the surface.
        It would resemble the "floaters" and "grav sleds" which are
        common SF techno-props, but it would not be directly useful in
        space travel or propulsion. </p>
      <p>It's worth considering also that in the process of repelling
        the ground, the hyper-force on our hypothetical floater would
        also tend to repel the passengers. This unpleasant side effect
        might be avoided by placing the repulsion sources for minimum
        effect on the passengers, perhaps at many points which lie on
        the same spherical surface. But passenger-repulsion might also
        be turned into an advantage by using it to reduce or nullify the
        forces of acceleration. With a suitable hyperfield system
        high-performance spacecraft or aircraft might might, by
        balancing inertial forces with hyper-repulsion, be able to
        accelerate at many g's without squashing pilot and passengers.
        Free-fall space habitats might produce simulated gravity with
        hyperfield units mounted in the ceilings, with hyper-repulsion
        pushing the occupants toward the floor. </p>
      <p>Anyhow, stay tuned to this column for further developments on
        the hypercharge force. The definitive tests of the theory will
        be well in progress by the time you read this column. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Was a fifth force felt? </p>
      <p>Physicists have divided all the motions in the universe into
        the domains of four kinds of force: gravity, electromagnetism,
        the weak subatomic force and the strong subatomic force or color
        force. Each of these has its source in a different property of
        material objects --for example, the source of gravity is mass,
        while that of electromagnetic forces is electric charge. Now, a
        fifth force is suggested. </p>
      <p>Such proposals tend to arise from experimental anomalies that
        suggest an unknown force may be acting. In the Jan. 6 PHYSICAL
        REVIEW LETTERS, Ephraim Fischbach (temporarily at the University
        of Washington in Seattle), Daniel Sudarsky, Aaron Szafer and
        Carrick Talmadge of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind.,
        and S. H. Aronson of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton,
        N.Y., propose that a fifth force was operating in a famous
        experiment done in Hungary in 1922 by Roland von Eotvos, D.
        Pekar and E. Fekete. The Eotvos experiment, as it is called,
        tested the law of gravity by measuring the gravitational
        attraction between the earth and various materials, including
        metals, woods and even grease or suet. Fischbach and his
        co-workers suggest that, unbeknownst to Eotvos and colleagues,
        slight differences in the responses of different materials
        indicate that in addition to gravity, a small, repulsive force
        was acting. </p>
      <p>Fischbach and his co-workers relate this suggested force to a
        quality of matter called phpercharge or baryon number. The
        baryon number is related to the number of neutrons and protons,
        and therefore to the chemical composition of a material--thus
        explaining the difference in force for different materials. The
        researchers propose a formal similarity between this hypercharge
        force and electromagnetism. Just as electromagnetic forces are
        carried from object to object by intermediary particles called
        photons, so this hypercharge force would be carried by
        "hyperphotons.' A number of experiments could test for the
        existence of the hypercharge force, including a direct search
        for the hyperphotons themselves. </p>

      <p>Newton's inverse-square law of gravitation has been one of the
        cornerstones of physics ever since it was proposed 300 years
        ago. One of its most well known features is the prediction that
        all objects fall in a gravitational field with the same
        acceleration. This observation, in the form of the Equivalence
        Principle, is a fundamental assumption of Einstein's General
        Relativity Theory. This book traces the history of attempts to
        test the predictions of Newtonian Gravity, and describes in
        detail recent experimental efforts to verify both the
        inverse-square law and the Equivalence Principle. Interest in
        these questions have increased in recent years, as it has become
        recognized that deviations from Newtonian gravity could be a
        signal for a new fundamental force in nature. This is the first
        book devoted entirely to this subject, and will be useful to
        both graduate students and researchers interested in this field.
        This book describes in detail the ideas that underlie searches
        for deviations from the predictions of Newtonian gravity,
        focusing on macroscopic tests, since the question of
        gravitational effects in quantum systems would warrant a
        separate work. A historical development is combined with
        detailed technical discussions of the theoretical ideas and
        experimental results. A comprehensive bibliography with
        approximately 450 entries is provided. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Was Sir Isaac All Wet?</font></b> </p>
        <p><b>By John Langone</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As every physics student learns, there are four known forces of
        nature: gravity, electromagnetism, a "strong" force that binds
        atomic nuclei and a "weak" one that governs certain types of
        radioactive decay. Last week researchers at the Los Alamos
        National Laboratory announced that they may have found the best
        evidence yet for a hypothetical, elusive "fifth force." If
        confirmed, their findings could mean that Sir Isaac Newton's
        famous inverse- square law of gravity* is in danger of losing
        the exalted position it has held for three centuries. "It's like
        saying Mom and apple pie's no good anymore," admits the leader
        of the gravity project, Geophysicist Mark Ander. "You just don't
        do that lightly." </p>
      <p>The physicists reached their conclusion as the result of an
        experiment conducted in Greenland last summer. They lowered a
        supersensitive gravity meter into a mile-deep hole bored in
        glacial ice -- chosen because its density is more uniform than
        that of rock -- and monitored the gravitational pull as the
        meter descended. What occurred was startling: the expected
        increase in gravitational force predicted by Newton was there,
        but it got stronger faster than expected. Either something was
        enhancing the force of gravity or the researchers had come upon
        a heretofore unknown, far more complex working of gravity
        itself. Or, just possibly, they had made a mistake. </p>
      <p>The fifth force, if that is what it is, has been a source of
        debate among physicists since its existence was suggested in
        1981 by Australian mineshaft experiments. Five years later,
        Purdue University Physics Professor Ephraim Fischbach measured a
        weak force he called "hypercharge" and theorized that it caused
        objects of different composition to fall at different rates.
        Since Fischbach's finding, as many as 45 experiments have sprung
        up in search of the mystery force, and so far each has served
        only to confound rather than clarify the issue. </p>
      <p>In some, for example, gravity appears to be enhanced, while in
        others it seems to be counteracted. Moreover, findings from a
        U.S. Air Force gravity study were even interpreted by some
        scientists as evidence of a "sixth force." But if the existence
        of an additional force was proved, scientists would have to
        readjust their calculations of gravitational force. "It's like
        something completely out of left field," notes Los Alamos
        Physicist Terry Goldman. "You don't know quite what to do with
        it." </p>
      <p>Jim Thomas, a physicist at the California Institute of
        Technology, praises the technical precision of Ander's
        experiment, but cautions that measuring gravity in holes is
        inexact at best. He points out, for example, that an aberration
        in the earth's crust might have caused the unusual measurements.
        "What we're really talking about is the possible modification of
        gravity, which is the fourth force," adds Thomas. Even Ander
        stresses that rigorous confirmation is needed before he accepts
        the results of his Greenland experiment. Says he: "You keep
        saying to yourself, 'Gee, I've gotta be wrong -- Newton
        certainly can't be wrong.' " </p>
      <p>FOOTNOTE: *Newton's law holds that gravitational pull increases
        in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between two
        bodies. </p>
