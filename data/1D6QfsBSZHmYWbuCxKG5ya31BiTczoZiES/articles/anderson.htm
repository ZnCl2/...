      <p>He bends over a large sink in the corner of a laboratory while
        a group of prospective investors stands nearby. He is a man of
        prominent girth, over six feet tall, whose countenance has been
        likened to that of W.C. Fields. He tinkers with a foot-long,
        six-inch wide metal cylinder as the group looks on expectantly.
        He could be a performer or a preacher, knowing just what strings
        to pull, priming his audience. He calls himself a scientist,
        though, -- a chemist, engineer, physicist, inventor --- and
        those closest to him say he is a genius, a country boy with a
        rare creativity. But mostly Eugene Anderson is a con man, and a
        big leaguer at that… </p>
      <p>The CRB (Chemical Reactor Block), Anderson says, is the product
        of years of R&amp;D, but more R&amp;D will be needed before they
        will be able to manufacture and sell it… He connects one end of
        a hose to a water faucet, the other end to the hose fitting at
        the base of the cylinder. It has a hole in its side that allows
        water to flow through the apparatus. He removes a small wire
        mesh cage from the top of the cylinder, then holds up a chunk of
        chalky gray metal. This is the CRB. He carefully puts the
        precious substance into the cage… He lowers the cage into the
        cylinder and turns on the water. As water flows through the
        fitting, a popping sound is heard. </p>
      <p>Casually, Anderson strikes a match and moves it over the mouth
        of the cylinder. With a whoosh, a flame appears… </p>
      <p>The beauty of Eugene Anderson’s discovery, the real nut of the
        magical and mysterious CRB material, is that it can supposedly
        dissociate the H and O of water without suing outside energy and
        without being consumed in the process… </p>
      <p>It is probably impossible for the CRB to work. The energy to
        get hydrogen from water has to come from somewhere, and despite
        Anderson’s claims to the contrary, his critics suspect that it
        really comes from the dissolution of the CRB material. In fact,
        Anderson doesn’t seem to have as much of the material at the end
        of his demonstrations as he does at the beginning…. </p>
      <p><b>Explosions In The Garage ~</b> </p>
      <p>Anderson and his uncle [Marion McCoy] saw clearly that the
        basic problem of the CRB was finding a material that would
        produce hydrogen without exploding at the same time. Sodium had
        long been known to liberate hydrogen from water --- but the
        process was also highly combustible. McCoy and Anderson set out
        to moderate the reaction by combining sodium with other
        ingredients commonly thought to be “unfriendly” to it. When they
        finally produced an amalgam, it was Anderson’s job to test it in
        the garage laboratory. </p>
      <p>McCoy had acquired a few 4-cylinder5 war surplus engines, which
        he converted to run on hydrogen. Although Anderson’s working
        journal shows evidence of difficulties (things kept exploding),
        it also shows that the amalgam could produce enough gas to run
        the engines… </p>
      <p>In later years, men would examine Anderson’s notes and ponder
        their authenticity. Knowledgeable observers doubted that
        Anderson could have run the motors as long as he said he did [7
        hours]. But if the notes are authentic, the reactions described
        characterize a material that even in its unperfected state could
        be of tremendous value… </p>
      <p><b>Brain Surgery ~</b> </p>
      <p><b>Heading For The Big Time ~</b> </p>
      <p>A second major demonstration was arranged in the spring of
        1978, this time at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington.
        Anderson brought a chunk of CRB the size of his fist and put it
        in a sink, placing a funnel over it. The gas passed up the
        funnel, and he lit it, producing a faintly blue-tinged flame.
        Most of the scientists at the lab thought Anderson was a phony,
        but Dr Homer Carhart, who was the chief naval representative
        there, was not so quick to dismiss him. Carhart wanted to give
        Anderson a chance, but the portly Texan would not let the navy
        experts analyze the material. He was so secretive he even wiped
        out the sink, lest scrapings of the metal be found and their
        contents analyzed…. </p>
      <p><b>Science &amp; Girls At Le Rififi ~</b> </p>
      <p>[ Demonstrations, negotiations, &amp;c…] </p>
      <p><b>Patent Magic With James J. Ling ~</b> </p>
      <p>Ling was more than mildly disturbed by the developments. By the
        terms of his agreement with Anderson, he had a six-month option
        to put up more development funds. After a few weeks a final
        make-or-break test was arranged at Southwest Research Institute
        in San Antonio. Hydrogen and oxygen were produced, but the
        amount of oxygen, according to the Southwest report, was “far
        below the level one would see if the evolved gases were the
        result of water dissociation”. That meant that the oxygen
        probably came from te CRB material itself instead of from the
        water… </p>
      <p><b>A Fortune In Penny Stocks ~</b> </p>
      <p>[ More demonstrations, negotiations, &amp;C…] </p>
      <p>In May 1981 Anderson called me at the Dallas TV station where I
        work as a reporter, saying he had an invention we might be
        interested in. A photographer and I went to Wills Point, where
        Anderson greeted us cryptically, then began working under the
        hood of a weather-beaten 1970 Chrysler, saying he was installing
        a CRB element. Neither of us knew what he was talking about, but
        we stayed while he continued. The CRB hydrogen generator allowed
        the car to achieve 44 miles per gallon, he explained, while
        reducing pollution and engine wear… </p>
      <p>Anderson led us into his laboratory, where he lit CRB-generated
        gases from a white vertical pipe. “We now have a new energy
        resource that will replace, basically, the fossil fuels”… </p>
      <p>Neither of us suspected that Eugene Anderson was a con man…
        After a day’s reflection and some checking, we put the story on
        the air. </p>
      <p>Calls came in from around the country; news travels fast when
        it involves a potential investment. To our surprise, a call came
        from the Securities and Exchange Commission in Salt Lake City;
        it was investigating Anderson’s companies. In the next few
        months I began to realize the impact of having fallen for
        Anderson’s con. He was using a videotape of the report minus the
        end --- which said the CRB had yet to be proven --- to sell his
        invention. </p>
      <p><b>On To The Pentagon ~</b> </p>
      <p>The CRB case, The SEC v. Horizon Energy Corp… was tried early
        in 1982 in the US district court in Salt Lake City. The SEC took
        more than two years to prepare and bring it to trial, and for
        all that, Eugene Anderson’s lawyer engineered an agreement that
        allowed him to go scot-free before the trial even ended… On the
        way to that judgment, however, the court found that Anderson’s
        tests of the CRB had never lasted long enough to prove what he
        said it would do, that it had never been used in anything except
        automobiles, and then only in short-term tests, and that the
        overall invention did not, as Anderson claimed, dissociate water
        without using an outside source of energy… </p>
      <p>Anderson, through the connections of his Washington associates,
        had been trying for years to interest the Pentagon in the
        military applications of his invention… To his disappointment,
        however, the military did not fund the CRB. But it did buy
        something that came out of his laboratory. </p>
      <p>Over the months and years that Anderson and his associates
        labored behind the storefront in Wills Point, trying to find the
        correct metallic combinations for th CRB, they noticed
        something. Their screen door fell apart. Subjected to the
        exhaust gases from the experiments, the aluminum door simply
        disintegrated. Anderson connected that to a compound he had used
        in the production of the CRB, an additive that removed oxides
        from metals. It became a kind of CRB II, a chemical that had
        far-reaching strategic implications. The deoxidizer would become
        the country boy’s link to the Pentagon. </p>
      <p>The additive, according to Anderson, “affected the isotopic
        relationships of the hydrogen and oxygen in water”. Its effect,
        when applied to metals, was to remove their oxide coating and
        eventually realign their internal molecular relationships, he
        said. Whether his explanation is correct or not, the compound
        can weaken metal without leaving any trace of the destruction on
        the metal’s surface --- or so Anderson led the Pentagon to
        believe. </p>
      <p>The material takes several hours to affect metal, but those
        effects, when complete, are substantial. Dab it on the wings of
        an aluminum aircraft, says Anderson, and the plane might fall
        out of the sky. If poured on parts of a battle tank, the tank
        could be reduced to scrap by a single bullet, he says… </p>
      <p>The Pentagon granted Anderson a top-secret contract in June
        1982. He was paid $250,000 for 100 hours of study and testing of
        CRB II at laboratories in Watertown, MA --- a pittance compared
        to what Anderson thought his idea was worth. He began to tell
        acquaintances that the contract was for $1 million… Though
        Anderson thought he was selling cheap, he entered into the
        contract anyway, hoping that it would lead to ore government
        work. The Pentagon was not at all sure that CRB II was feasible,
        but by making Anderson commit to a contract, the government
        could then legally prevent him from selling to an unfriendly
        country… </p>
      <p>The selling of the Pentagon, Anderson style, is something
        officials do not talk about, under orders from the Secretary of
        Defense. Pentagon insiders describe CRB II as on of “the truly
        nasties”, a development so sinister that if dropped into the
        wrong hands it could, in military hyperbole, change the course
        of world history. Is CRB II going to revolutionize modern
        warfare? Or is the Pentagon trying to cover up an embarrassing
        mistake? </p>
      <p>The Defense Department’s dealings with CRB II fall into a
        pattern similar to Anderson’s previous arrangements. Anderson
        received his initial payment from the government but completed
        only a few days of testing. When he tried to get out of the
        contract by reimbursing the government for that first payment,
        the check bounced… </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a material for and method of
        effecting the decomposition/dissociation of water into hydrogen
        and oxygen. </p>
      <p>The water is reacted with an amalgam of sodium, aluminum and
        mercury to form hydrogen and a metallic hydroxide denoted by the
        formula Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6. The Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6 is
        unstable at the temperature of formation in the presence of a
        catalyst comprising platinum and at least one element selected
        from the group consisting of germanium, antimony, gallium,
        thallium, indium, cadmium, bismuth, lead, zinc and tin and
        breaks down to form metallic sodium and aluminum thereby
        releasing oxygen and hydrogen. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART </p>
      <p>It is well known in the prior art that the alkali metals react
        with water to form hydrogen and the stable alkali metal
        hydroxide. The foregoing reaction is rapid, the heat generated
        intense and explosion of hydrogen ordinarily occurs. The result
        is an unsatisfactory and dangerous method of generating
        hydrogen. It is also well known that alkali metal peroxides may
        be used for the generation of oxygen (see U.S. Pat. No.
        3,574,561). </p>
      <p>Thermochemical cycles comprising metal-metaloid combinations
        for the generation of both hydrogen and oxygen are disclosed in
        U.S. Pat. No. 3,969,495. Closed cycle processes for dissociation
        of water into hydrogen and oxygen are disclosed in U.S. Pat.
        Nos. 3,821,358, 3,928,549 and 4,011,305. Combinations of various
        metals in multistep processes for dissociation of water are,
        therefore, well known; however, the simple and facile manner of
        producing hydrogen and oxygen utilizing an amalgam of alkali
        metal, aluminum and mercury combined with a catalytic alloy
        comprising platinum and at least one element selected from the
        group consisting of germanium, antimony, gallium, thallium,
        indium, cadmium, bismuth, lead, zinc and tin has not been
        appreciated. </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The material I have found to be suitable for the generation of
        hydrogen and oxygen from water without spontaneous combustion of
        the resultant evolved hydrogen and oxygen gases comprises an
        amalgam of (1) an alkali metal such as lithium, sodium,
        potassium, cesium, or combinations thereof, (2) aluminum and (3)
        mercury combined with a catalytic alloy comprising platinum and
        at least one element selected from the group consisting of
        germanium, antimony, gallium, thallium, indium, cadmium,
        bismuth, lead, zinc and tin and with a metal to control the rate
        of dissociation of the water while being non-reactive with the
        amalgam during dissociation. </p>
      <p>The particle size of the sodium and aluminum is such as to
        enable formation of an amalgam and may fall within the range of
        from about 10 to about 100 mesh. Most preferably, the particle
        size of the aluminum should be about 10 mesh. Alkali metal of
        1/4" diameter is suitable. The particle size of either the
        alkali metal or aluminum is not critical since the foregoing
        metals and mercury readily intermix. The smaller the particle
        size, of course, the more rapid the mixing. </p>
      <p>The atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to mercury is from
        about 1:100 to about 100:1 and the atomic weight ratio of alkali
        metal to aluminum is from about 1:100 to about 100:1. Preferably
        the atomic weight ratio ofalkali metal to mercury is from about
        3:1 to about 1:1.5 and the atomic weight ratio of alkali metal
        to aluminum is from about 1:1 to about 3:1. </p>
      <p>The amalgam of alkali metal, aluminum and mercury is combined
        with a catalytically active alloy which is present in a
        catalytically effective amount and, at the conditions of
        hydrogen generation, functions to regenerate amalgam to the
        active metallic state. </p>
      <p>It is essential that the catalyst/alloy contain a platinum
        group metal and specifically platinum. The catalyst/alloy is
        generally comprised of platinum and at least one element
        selected from the group consisting of germanium, antimony,
        gallium, thallium, indium, cadmium, bismuth, lead, zinc and tin.
      </p>
      <p>Preferably the catalyst comprises platinum and at least one
        element selected from the group consisting of germanium,
        antimony, gallium, thallium, indium and cadmium. </p>
      <p>Catalytic activity is further enhanced by the addition of minor
        amounts of zirconium and chromium. </p>
      <p>Lead and/or gold may be incorporated in the catalyst as an
        alloying element to lower the melting point of the alloy. </p>
      <p>The alloy and amalgam may be combined in weight ratios of from
        about 1:1 to about 1:5 and preferably from about 1:2 to about
        1:3. </p>
      <p>Properties of the material which are desirable to control are
        its (i) hardness, (ii) the temperature of the dissociation
        reaction, and (iii) the rate of dissociation. These properties
        are regulated by choosing an extender metal that does not react
        with the amalgam at the point of dissociation in an amount
        effective to control the rate of the dissociation and/or
        temperature of the reaction and combining this extender metal
        with the amalgam and catalytic alloy. Metals that have been
        found which accomplish this result are silver, copper, thallium,
        titanium, magnesium, molybdenum, tungsten, cadmium, nickel,
        rhodium, iron, palladium, cobalt, chromium, tin, iridium, lead,
        gallium, vanadium, gold, antimony, zirconium and bismuth. The
        most preferred extender metal used with the preferred amalgam
        and preferred catalytic alloy is copper. Further, these extender
        metals are effective in controlling the rate of dissociation
        and/or the temperature of the dissociation reaction in amounts
        of from about 0.1 wt. % to about 97.3 wt. % of the total
        combination of amalgam, catalytic alloy and extender metal. </p>
      <p>Although not wishing to be bound by these conclusions, it is
        believed that the extender metal controls these properties by
        coating the amalgam and catalytic alloy to thereby regulate the
        surface area of the amalgam exposed to water contact which
        thereby controls the properties of the material and by varying
        the heat conductance property of the extender metal, the heat
        transferred from the dissociation reaction thereby controls the
        properties of the material. </p>
      <p>Further, although not wishing to be bound by the following
        explanation, it is believed that the water reacts with the
        alkali metal, e.g., sodium, and the aluminum liberating hydrogen
        and forming Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6. The Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6 is
        unstable, and in the presence of the alloy at the conditions of
        Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6 formation, the foregoing composition
        decomposes to form H.sub.2, O.sub.2 and regenerated amalgam. The
        alloy apparently functions to catalyze the decomposition, and
        thereby extends the useful life of the amalgam. The process may
        be depicted as follows: </p>
      <p>2 Na+2 H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.2 NaOH+H.sub.2 </p>
      <p>6 H.sub.2 O+2 AL+6 NaOH.fwdarw.2 Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6 +3
        H.sub.2 ##EQU1## </p>
      <p>The preferred catalytic alloy comprises (1) platinum present in
        an amount of from about 0.7 to about 1.1% by weight, (2) lead
        present in an amount of from about 42.9 to about 71.5% by
        weight, (3) antimony present in amount of from about 25.5 to
        about 42.5% by weight, (4) chromium present in an amount of from
        about 0.7 to about 1.1% by weight, (5) zirconium present in an
        amount of from about 4.1 to about 6.8% by weight and gold
        present in an amount of from about 1.1 to about 1.9% by weight.
      </p>
      <p>A specific example of the alloy comprises about 0.9 wt. %
        platinum, about 57.3 wt. % lead, about 34.0 wt. % antimony,
        about 0.9 wt. % chromium, about 5.4 wt. % zirconium and about
        1.5 wt. % gold. </p>
      <p>The amalgam of sodium, aluminum and mercury is prepared
        utilizing and the well known procedures with the added proviso
        that an inert atmosphere be employed. Amalgamation may be
        facilitated by utilization of an elevated temperature,
        preferably around 200.degree. C..+-.10.degree. C. The amalgam is
        preferably maintained at this elevated temperature for about 10
        minutes where 100 grams are being processed, and the time is
        extended about 1 minute for each additional 100 gram aliquot. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled, generally to room temperature,
        utilizing an inert atmosphere. For this purpose either helium or
        nitrogen are satisfactory. Cooling is preferably effected in a
        desiccator to insure that no water contacts the amalgam. </p>
      <p>As in the preparation of the amalgam and all other steps in the
        method of manufacture of the various compositions of this
        invention, precaution must be taken during preparation to avoid
        the presence of oxygen because it has been observed that oxygen
        operates to poison the resultant material. </p>
      <p>The preparation of the catalytic alloy selected may be in any
        well known manner having in mind the proviso that an inert
        atmosphere be maintained. </p>
      <p>The catalytic alloy, upon solidification, and as a practical
        matter, upon cooling is ground into a powder, preferably a fine
        powder of about 10 mesh or less. Cooling may be effected in a
        dessicator to insure the absence of oxygen and moisture, whose
        presence is deterimental during preparation.
        Grinding/pulverizing may be effected in any well known manner
        including use of a ball, hammer and/or stamp mill. </p>
      <p>The extender metal is utilized in a particulate form of
        comparable sizeto the other components, which size is generally
        from about 10 to about 100 mesh and may be obtained by any
        conventional process. </p>
      <p>The amalgam, catalytic alloy and extender metals are used in an
        alloy form, which means the particles of amalgam, catalytic
        alloy and extender metal are combined to form an admixture and
        alloyed under inert conditions at a temperature above the
        melting point of said admixture. </p>

        mercury is formed in a graphite crucible in an inert atmosphere
        of nitrogen at an elevated temperature of 200.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled to room temperature in a
        dessicator in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter, the
        amalgam is formed into a fine powder of about 10 mesh utilizing
        a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert atmosphere of
        nitrogen. </p>
      <p>It is important to prepare the amalgam in an inert gas
        atmosphere to prevent hydroxide formation. </p>
      <p>Preparation of Catalytic Alloy </p>
      <p>19.0 parts by weight lead, 11.3 parts by weight antimony, 0.3
        parts by weight platinum, 0.5 parts by weight gold, 1.8 parts by
        weight zirconium and 0.3 parts by weight chromium are introduced
        into a graphite crucible which is thereafter placed in an oven
        and heated to melting in an atmosphere of helium to form an
        alloy of said metals. </p>
      <p>The resulting alloy is cooled in a dessicator to about room
        temperature in an inert helium atmosphere. Thereafter the
        amalgam is formed into a fine powder of about 10 mesh or less
        utilizing a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert
        atmosphere of helium. </p>
      <p>The inert atmosphere is used to prevent oxidation of the alloy.

      <p>Formation of Reactor Block Comprising Amalgam, Catalytic Alloy
        and Extender Metal </p>
      <p>The amalgam, catalytic alloy and an extender metal of powdered
        copper of about 10 mesh are admixed in the following
        proportions: </p>
      <p>21.775 parts by weight amalgam. </p>
      <p>5.625 parts by weight alloy. </p>
      <p>72.6 parts by weight extender metal. </p>
      <p>The weighing and blending of the foregoing metallic compounds
        should be done in an inert atmosphere. </p>
      <p>After blending to provide a uniform mixture, the resultant
        mixture is compressed to form a solid mass by application of
        pressure of about 40,000 pounds per square inch in a graphite
        mold conforming to the desired shape of the finished product.
        The compressed mass in a crucible conforming to the shape
        thereof is heated to an elevated temperature of about 10.degree.
        C.above the melting point of the mass and this temperature is
        maintained for about 10.+-.1 minutes. In the oven utilized for

        crucible and its contents are transferred to a desiccator
        wherein an inert atmosphere is maintained. Upon cooling the
        resultant block is ready for use. </p>
      <p>The entire foregoing procedure should be carried out under an
        inert atmosphere such as helium or nitrogen and in the absence
        of contaminants. Oxidation of the metallic components and/or
        hydroxide formation will "poison" the resulting reactor block
        and reduce the activity thereof. Moreover, during the steps of
        the process operated at elevated temperature, the presence of
        any oxygen will cause the mass to ignite. </p>
      <p>The reactor block is contacted with a fine spray of water at
        about room temperature in an atmospheric environment with a
        reaction temperature of about 134.0.degree. C. (273.2.degree.
        F.). The gaseous effluent from said contact comprises hydrogen
        and oxygen and burns when subjected to electrical sparking. The
        volume of gas evolved is dependent on reactor block surface area
        and the volume of water impinging thereon. Generally a 2.5
        square cm surface will react with 0.14 gallons of water per

        10.+-.1 minutes. In the oven utilized for heating, an inert
        atmosphere is maintained. Thereafter the crucible and its

        atmosphere is maintained. Upon cooling the resultant block is
        ready for use. </p>
      <p>The entire foregoing procedure should be carried out under an
        inert atmosphere such as helium or nitrogen and in the absence
        of contaminants. Oxidation of the metallic compounds and/or
        hydroxide formation will "poison" the resultant reactor block

        about room temperature in an atmospheric environment with the
        dissociation reaction temperature being about 413.9.degree. C.
        (747.02.degree. F.). The gaseous effluent from said contact
        comprises hydrogen and oxygen and burns when subjected to

        with 0.21 gallons of water per minute. </p>

        utilizing a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert

      <p><b><i>Description</i></b> </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a metallic amalgam and method of
        combining an alkali metal and aluminum by using mercury as an
        amalgamation medium. </p>
      <p>Recently I discovered a use for an amalgam of alkali metal and
        aluminum with an atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to mercury
        from about 100:1 to about 1:100 and the atomic weight ratio of
        alkali metal to aluminum from about 1:100 to about 100:1.
        Preferably, the amalgam used has an atomic weight ratio of
        alkali metal to mercury from about 3:1 to about 1:1.5 and the
        atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to aluminum from about 1:1
        to about 3:1. </p>
      <p>I further found that although it is well known in the prior art
        to combine alkali metals with mercury into an amalgam, providing
        an amalgam of alkali metal and aluminum either in a direct
        combination using a high temperature phase or in an indirect
        combination by using mercury as an amalgamation medium is not
        known. </p>
      <p>The method I have found which enables production of an amalgam
        of alkali metal and aluminum comprises the steps of making an
        alkali metal amalgam under an inert atmosphere. The surface of
        aluminum is then coated with mercury and the coated aluminum is
        mixed with the alkali metal amalgam and given sufficient time to
        form the amalgam of alkali metal and aluminum. </p>
      <p>It is important to remember that this method is carried out
        under an inert atmosphere, such as helium or argon, so as to
        prohibit the formation of hydroxide contaminants on the surface
        of the alkali metal and oxide contaminants on the surface of the
        alkali metal and aluminum. </p>
      <p>Further, it is important that the surface of the aluminum be
        treated to remove aluminum oxide so as to enable coating the
        aluminum with mercury. This may be accomplished by mechanically
        working the aluminum, such as with a ball mill, or by immersing
        the aluminum in an aqueous mercuric chloride solution,
        preferably a saturated aqueous mercuric chloride solution, so as
        to deposit a coating of mercury over the aluminum, either being
        in particles, sheets or whatever mass form desired. The aluminum
        is then leftin the mercuric chloride solution for a sufficient
        period of time to chemically replace the oxygen in the aluminum
        oxide with mercury. A sufficient quantity of mercury is then
        added to the aqueous mercuric chloride solution to thereby
        immerse the surface treated aluminum in the mercury and rapidly
        displace the mercuric chloride solution to prevent the continued
        contact of water in the solution with the coated aluminum. The
        mercuric chloride solution may then be removed by any of the
        well known methods for liquid removal from the surface of the
        mercury. The atmosphere is then purged to remove any and all
        moisture and oxygen. The coated aluminum and a measured amount
        of mercury are provided so as to make the amalgam described in
        application Ser. Nos. 902,705, 902,708 and 06/068,749, the
        information therein being incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>The mixture may then be allowed to combine in a natural fashion
        or this amalgamation may be facilitated by utilizing an elevated
        temperature, preferably around 200.degree. C..+-.10.degree. C.
        The amalgam is preferably maintained at this elevated
        temperature for about 10 minutes for the first 100 grams being
        processed and the time extended about 1 minute for each
        additional 100 grams thereafter. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is then cooled gradually to room
        temperature under an inert atmosphere. For this purpose, either
        helium or nitrogen are satisfactory and it is desirable that
        cooling be effected in a desiccator to ensure that no water
        contacts the amalgam. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE I </p>
      <p>An amalgam of sodium and aluminum is obtained by withdrawing
        35.1 grams of liquid sodium while maintaining a dry argon
        atmosphere thereover to provide a hydroxide and oxide free
        sodium. This hydroxide and oxide free sodium is then added to
        36.8 grams of mercury at a rate to prevent boiling or
        vaporization of the mercury to thereby make 71.9 grams of sodium
        amalgam. </p>
      <p>13.7 grams of 10 mesh aluminum is then immersed in a saturated
        aqueous mercuric chloride solution for approximately 30 seconds
        to chemically replace the oxide in the aluminum oxide with
        mercury. </p>
      <p>Sufficient mercury is then rapidly added to the aqueous
        mercuric chloride solution so as to displace the aqueous
        mercuric chloride solution and totally immerse the coated
        aluminum. </p>
      <p>The aqueous mercuric chloride is removed from the container
        supporting the coated aluminum and the atmosphere is purged to
        remove any and all moisture and oxygen. </p>
      <p>The coated aluminum and 14.4 grams of mercury are then mixed
        with the 71.9 grams of sodium amalgam and heated at 200.degree.
        C. for 10 minutes to make approximately 100 grams of
        sodium-aluminum amalgam. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE II </p>
      <p>An amalgam of potassium and aluminum is obtained by withdrawing
        31.1 grams of liquid potassium while maintaining a dry argon
        atmosphere thereover to provide a hydroxide and oxide free
        potassium. This hydroxide and oxide free potassium is then added
        to 30.5 grams of mercury at a rate to prevent boiling or
        vaporization of the mercury to thereby make 61.6 grams of
        potassium amalgam. </p>
      <p>19.4 grams of 10 mesh aluminum is then immersed in a saturated
        aqueous mercuric chloride solution for approximately 30 seconds
        to chemically replace the oxide in the aluminum oxide with
        mercury. </p>
      <p>Sufficient mercury is then rapidly added to the aqueous
        mercuric chloride solution so as to displace the solution and
        totally immerse the coated aluminum. </p>
      <p>The aqueous mercuric chloride is removed from the container
        supporting the coated aluminum and the atmosphere is purged to
        remove any and all moisture and oxygen. </p>
      <p>The coated aluminum and 19.0 grams of mercury are then mixed
        with the 61.6 grams of potassium amalgam and heated at
        200.degree. C. for 10 minutes to make approximately 100 grams of
        potassium-mercury amalgam. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE III </p>
      <p>An amalgam of cesium and aluminum is obtained by withdrawing
        32.1 grams of liquid cesium while maintaining a dry argon
        atmosphere thereover to provide a hydroxide and oxide free
        cesium. This hydroxide and oxide free cesium is then added to
        13.9 grams of mercury at a rate to prevent boiling or
        vaporization of the mercury to thereby make 46.0 grams of cesium
        amalgam. </p>
      <p>37.7 grams of 10 mesh aluminum is then immersed in a saturated
        aqueous mercuric chloride solution for approximately 30 seconds
        to chemically replace the oxide in the aluminum oxide with
        mercury. </p>
      <p>Sufficient mercury is then rapidly added to the aqueous
        mercuric chloride solution so as to displace the solution and
        totally immerse the coated aluminum. </p>
      <p>The aqueous mercuric chloride is removed from the container
        supporting the coated aluminum and the atmosphere is purged to
        remove any and all moisture and oxygen. </p>
      <p>The coated aluminum and 16.3 grams of mercury are then mixed
        with the 46.0 grams of cesium amalgam and heated at 200.degree.
        C. for 10 minutes to make approximately 100 grams of
        cesium-mercury amalgam. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a material for and method of
        effecting the decomposition/dissociation of water to form
        hydrogen. The water is reacted with an amalgam of sodium,
        aluminum and mercury to form hydrogen and a metallic hydroxide
        believed to be Na.sub.3 Al(OH).sub.6. </p>
      <p>2. Description of the Prior Art </p>
      <p>It is well known that alkali metals react with water to form
        hydrogen and the stable alkali hydroxide. The foregoing reaction
        is rapid, the heat generated intense and the hydrogen formed
        generally ignites with explosive force. The result is an
        unsatisfactory and dangerous method of generating hydrogen.
        Moreover, the resulting alkali metal hydroxide is very stable
        and regeneration to form the alkali metal is not practical from
        an economic standpoint. </p>
      <p>A simple and facile method of producing hydrogen without
        spontaneous combustion of the resultant evolved hydrogen where
        an alkali metal is used has not heretofore been developed. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In its broadest aspect, the material found as suitable for
        generation of hydrogen from water without spontaneous combustion
        of the resultant evolved hydrogen comprises an amalgam of (1) an
        alkali metal such as lithium, sodium, potassium, cesium or
        combinations thereof, (2) aluminum and (3) mercury. </p>
      <p>The particle size of the sodium and aluminum is such as to
        facilitate formation of an amalgam. The amalgam has been
        prepared utilizing sodium of about 1/4 inch diameter and
        aluminum within the range of about 10 to about100 mesh. The
        particle size of either the alkali metal or the aluminum is not
        critical since the foregoing metals and mercury readily
        intermix. The smaller the particle size, of course, the more
        rapid the mixing. </p>
      <p>The atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to mercury is from
        about 1:100 to about 100:1 and the atomic weight ratio of alkali
        metal to aluminum is from about 1:100 to about 100:1. Preferably
        the atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to mercury is from about
        3:1 to about 1:1.5 and the atomic weight ratio of alkali metal
        to aluminum is from about 1:1 to about 3:1. </p>
      <p>Although not wishing to be bound by the following explanation,
        it is believed that the water reacts with the alkali metal,
        e.g., sodium, and the aluminum liberating hydrogen to form
        Na.sub.3 Al(OH).sub.6. The reaction of the water with the
        amalgam is substantially different from the reaction of the
        alkali metal component of the amalgam with water. The heat
        generated by reaction of equivalent amounts of alkali metal in
        the form of the amalgam is substantially less than where the
        alkali metal along is reacted with water. Accordingly,
        spontaneous combustion of the hydrogen in an oxidizing
        environment as well as the formation of a highly stable sodium
        product is avoided where the amalgam of the invention is
        employed in place of the alkali metal alone. </p>
      <p>The process may be depicted as follows: </p>
      <p>2Na+2H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.2NaOH+H.sub.2 </p>
      <p>6H.sub.2 O+Al+6NaOH.fwdarw.2Na.sub.3 Al(OH).sub.6 +3H.sub.2 </p>
      <p>The amalgam of sodium, aluminum and mercury is prepared
        utilizing any known procedure for amalgamation with the added
        important proviso that an inert atmosphere be maintained during
        amalgamation. Amalgamation may be facilitated by utilization of
        an elevated temperature preferably around 200.degree.
        C..+-.10.degree. C. The amalgam is preferably maintained at this
        elevated temperature for about 10 minutes where 100 grams are
        being processed and the time is extended about a minute for each
        additional 100 gram aliquot. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled, generally to room temperature,
        utilizing an inert atmosphere. For this purpose, either helium
        or nitrogen are satisfactory. Cooling is preferably effected in
        a dessicator to insure that no water contacts the amalgam. </p>
      <p>Upon cooling, the amalgam solidifies and may be contacted with
        water by submersion, by spraying the water thereupon, by
        impinging water in the form of steam thereon or in any other
        manner. Contact of water at a temperature above 0.degree. C.
        produces evolution of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>Examples of suitable amalgams are as follows: </p>
      <p>Aluminum 37.7 weight per cent, sodium 32.1 weight per cent and
        mercury 30.2 weight per cent. </p>
      <p>Aluminum 22.9 weight per cent, sodium 18.4 weight per cent,
        mercury 58.7 weight per cent. </p>
      <p>Aluminum 19.4 weight per cent, sodium 31.1 weight per cent,
        mercury 49.5 weight per cent. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE </p>
      <p>Preparation of Amalgam </p>
      <p>35.144 parts by weight of sodium, 13.749 parts by weight of
        aluminum and 51.107 parts by weight of mercury are formed into
        an amalgam in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen at an elevated
        temperature of 200.degree. C. in a graphite crucible. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled to room temperature in a
        dessicator in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter, the
        amalgam is formed which is a solid but which will liquefy upon
        agitation. </p>
      <p>It is important to note that the amalgam should be prepared in
        an inert gas atmosphere to prevent premature hydroxide
        formation. </p>
      <p>Use of Amalgam </p>
      <p>The amalgam is placed in a suitable container with one surface
        thereof exposed. Water is sprayed upon the exposed surface or
        alternatively the exposed surface may be covered entirely with a
        layer of water. It is necessary that the amalgam be placed
        within a container because in the course of contact of the
        amalgam with water the heat generated during the course of
        hydrogen generation transforms the amalgam to liquid form. The
        amalgam regardless of how it is contacted with water will not
        cause an explosion. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>1. Field of Invention </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a material for and method of
        effecting the decomposition/dissociation of water into hydrogen
        and oxygen. </p>
      <p>The water is reacted with an amalgam of sodium, aluminum and
        mercury to form hydrogen and a metallic hydroxide denoted by the
        formula Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6. The Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6 is
        unstable at the temperature of formation in the presence of a
        catalyst comprising platinum and at least one element selected
        from the group consisting of germanium, antimony, gallium,
        thallium, indium, cadmium, bismuth, lead, zinc and tin and
        breaks down to form metallic sodium and aluminum thereby
        releasing oxygen and hydrogen. </p>
      <p>2. Description of the Prior Art </p>
      <p>It is well known in the prior art that the alkali metals react
        with water to form hydrogen and the stable alkali metal
        hydroxide. The foregoing reaction is rapid, the heat generated
        intense and explosion of hydrogen ordinarily occurs. The result
        is an unsatisfactory and dangerous method of generating
        hydrogen. It is also well know that alkali metal peroxides may
        be used for the generation of oxygen (see U.S. Pat. No.
        3,574,561). </p>
      <p>Thermochemical cycles comprising metal-metaloid combinations
        for the generation of both hydrogen and oxygen are disclosed in
        U.S. Pat. No. 3,969,495. </p>
      <p>Closed cycle processes for dissociation of water into hydrogen
        and oxygen are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,821,358, 3,928,549
        and 4,011,305. Combinations of various metals in multistep
        processes for dissociation of water are, therefore, well known;
        however, the simple and facile manner of producing hydrogen and
        oxygen utilizing an amalgam of alkali metal, aluminum and
        mercury combined with a catalytic alloy comprising platinum and
        at least one element selected from the group consisting of
        germanium, antimony, gallium, thallium, indium, cadmium,
        bismuth, lead, zinc and tin has not been heretofore appreciated.
      </p>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The material I have found to be suitable for the generation of
        hydrogen and oxygen from water without spontaneous combustion of
        the resultant evolved hydrogen and oxygen gases comprises an
        amalgam of (1) an alkali metal suchas lithium, sodium,
        potassium, cesium, or combinations thereof, (2) aluminum and (3)
        mercury combined with a catalytic alloy comprising platinum and
        at least one element selected from the group consisting of
        germanium, antimony, gallium, thallium, indium, cadmium,
        bismuth, lead, zinc and tin. </p>
      <p>The particle size of the sodium and aluminum is such as to
        enable formation of an amalgam and may fall within the range of
        from about 10 to about 100 mesh. Most preferably, the particle
        size of the aluminum should be about 10 mesh. Alkali metal of
        1/4" diameter is suitable. The particle size of either the
        alkali metal or aluminum is not critical since the foregoing
        metals and mercury readily intermix. The smaller the particle
        size, of course, the more rapid the mixing. </p>
      <p>The atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to mercury is from
        about 1:100 to about 100:1 and the atomic weight ratio of alkali
        metal to aluminum is from about 1:100 to about 100:1. Preferably
        the atomic weight ratio of alkali metal to mercury is from about
        3:1 to about 1:1.5 and the atomic weight ratio of alkali metal
        to aluminum is from about 1:1 to about 3:1. </p>
      <p>The amalgam of alkali metal, aluminum and mercury is combined
        with a catalytically active alloy which is present in a
        catalytically effective amount and, at the conditions of
        hydrogen generation, functions to regenerate amalgam to the
        active metallic state. </p>
      <p>It is essential that the catalyst/alloy contain a platinum
        group metal and specifically platinum. The catalyst/alloy is
        generally comprised of platinum and at least one element
        selected from the group consisting of germanium, antimony,
        gallium, thallium, indium, cadmium, bismuth, lead, zinc and tin.
      </p>
      <p>Preferably the catalyst comprises platinum and at least one
        element selected from the group consisting of germanium,
        antimony, gallium, thallium, indium and cadmium. </p>
      <p>Catalytic activity is further enhanced by the addition of minor
        amounts of zirconium and chromium. </p>
      <p>Lead and/or gold may be incorporated in the catalyst as an
        alloying element to lower the melting point of the alloy. </p>
      <p>The alloy and amalgam may be combined in weight ratios of from
        about 1:1 to about 1:5 and preferably from about 1:2 to about
        1:3. </p>
      <p>In combining the alloy and amalgam they may be compounded with
        an extender. The extender functions both to dilute the
        amalgam-catalytic alloy combination and to provide a heat sump
        for heat generated during the dissociation of water by contact
        with the combined amalgam and catalytic alloy. The extender is
        preferably copper; however, admixtures of tin and bismuth or
        gallium may also function as extenders. </p>
      <p>The combination of amalgam and alloy or amalgam, alloy and
        extender is most suitably used in solid block form, hereinafter
        referred to as a reactor block. Where an extender is employed it
        may be present as a major constituent of the reactor block. </p>
      <p>Although not wishing to be bound by the following explanation,
        it is believed that the water reacts with the alkali metal,
        e.g., sodium, and the aluminum liberating hydrogen and forming
        Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6. The Na.sub.3 AL(OH).sub.6 is unstable,
        and in the presence of the alloy at the conditions of Na.sub.3
        AL(OH).sub.6 formation, the foregoing composition decomposes to
        form H.sub.2, O.sub.2 and regenerated amalgam. The alloy
        apparently functions to catalyze the decomposition, and thereby
        extends the useful life of the amalgam. The process may be
        depicted as follows: </p>
      <p>2Na+2H.sub.2 O.fwdarw.2NaOH+H.sub.2 </p>
      <p>6H.sub.2 O+2Al+6NaOH.fwdarw.2Na.sub.3 Al(OH).sub.6 +3H.sub.2 </p>
      <p>Na.sub.3 Al(OH).sub.6 catalytic alloy 3Na+Al+3H.sub.2 +3O.sub.2
      </p>
      <p>It is preferred to include chromium as an additional component
        of the alloy. The incorporation of chromium as a conponent of
        the alloy appears to lower the heat of reaction. The chromium is
        generally present in the alloy in an amount measured on a weight
        percent basis of said alloy of from about 0.7% to about 1.1% and
        preferably for about 0.8% to about 0.9%. </p>
      <p>Each of the components of the alloy may be present in amounts
        of from about 0.4% by weight to about 28.5% by weight based on
        the weight of the combined catalytic alloy and amalgam. </p>
      <p>The preferred alloy comprises (1) platinum present in an amount
        of from about 0.7 to about 1.1% by weight, (2) lead present in
        an amount of from about 42.9 to about 71.5% by weight, (3)
        antimony present in an amount of from about 25.5 to about 42.5%
        by weight, (4) chromium present in an amount of from about 0.7
        to about 1.1% by weight, (5) zirconium present in an amount of
        from about 4.1 to about 6.8% by weight and gold present in an
        amount of from about 1.1 to about 1.9% by weight. </p>
      <p>A specific example of the alloy comprises about 0.9 wt. %
        platinum, about 57.3 wt. % lead, about 34.0 wt. % antimony,
        about 0.9 wt. % chromium, about 5.4 wt. % zirconium and about
        1.5 wt. % gold. </p>
      <p>The amalgam of sodium, aluminum and mercury is prepared
        utilizing any of the well known procedures with the added
        proviso that an inert atmosphere be employed. Amalgamation may
        be facilitated by utilization of an elevated temperature,
        preferably around 200.degree. C..+-.10.degree. C. The amalgam is
        preferably maintained at this elevated temperature for about 10
        minutes where 100 grams are being processed, and the time is
        extended about 1 minute for each additional 100 gram aliquot. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled, generally to room temperature,
        utilizing an inert atmosphere. For this purpose either helium or
        nitrogen are satisfactory. Cooling is preferably effected in a
        desiccator to insure that no water contacts the amalgam. </p>
      <p>As in the preparation of the amalgam and all other steps in the
        method of manufacture of the various compositions of this
        invention, precaution must be taken during preparation to avoid
        the presence of oxygen because it has been observed that oxygen
        operates to poison the resultant material. </p>
      <p>The preparation of the alloy selected may be in any well known
        manner having in mind the proviso that an inert atmosphere be
        maintained. </p>
      <p>The alloy, upon solidification, and as a practical matter, upon
        cooling is ground into a powder, preferably a fine powder of
        about 10 mesh or less. Cooling may be effected in a dessicator
        to insure the absence of oxygen and moisture, whose presence is
        detrimental during preparation. Grinding/pulverizing may be
        effected in any well known manner including use of a ball,
        hammer and/or stamp mill. </p>
      <p>The objective in combining the alloy and amalgam is to
        intimately admix the two respective components. The specific
        manner of catalysis is not know, but generally catalysis is a
        surface phenomenon and consistent therewith in the instant
        invention it appears that the catalysis is related to both
        particle size and nature as well as uniformity of mixture of the
        amalgam and catalytic alloy. </p>
      <p>The amalgam and catalytic alloy may be used (1) in particulate
        form such as a floating bed, or other intimate dispersion, (2)
        in the form of porous mass which may be formed by compression or
        sintering or (3) as a solid mass by allowing of the amalgam and
        catalytic alloy. By alloying, it is meant that the amalgam and
        catalytic alloy are combined to form an admixture and alloyed
        under inert conditions at a temperature above the melting point
        of said admixture. </p>
      <p>In either of the foregoing forms an extender, such as gallium,
        tin, bismuth or copper, and preferably copper may be utilized.
        The extender functions to vary activity and as a heat sink to
        retain at least a portion of the heat of reaction of sodium
        aluminum hydroxide formation, whereby catalysis of the unstable
        hydroxide to the metal and oxygen and hydrogen is enhanced. </p>
      <p>Admixture of extender with the amalgam and catalytic alloy is
        effected utilizing the extender in a particulate form of
        comparable size to the other components, which size is generally
        from about 10 to about 100 mesh. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE I </p>
      <p>Preparation of Amalgam </p>
      <p>An amalgam comprising 35.144 parts by weight of sodium, 13.749
        parts by weight of aluminum and 51.107 parts by weight of
        mercury is formed in a graphite crucible in an inert atmosphere
        of nitrogen at an elevated temperature of 200.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled to room temperature in a
        dessicator in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter, the
        amalgam is formed into a fine powder of about 10 mesh utilizing
        a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert atmosphere of
        nitrogen. </p>
      <p>It is important to prepare the amalgam in an inert gas
        atmosphere to prevent hydroxide formation. </p>
      <p>Preparation of Catalytic Alloy </p>
      <p>19.0 Parts by weight lead, 11.3 parts by weight antimony, 0.3
        parts by weight platinum, 0.5 parts by weight gold, 1.8 parts by
        weight zirconium and 0.3 parts by weight chromium are introduced
        into a graphite crucible which is thereafter placed in an oven
        and heated to melting in an inert atmosphere of helium to form
        an alloy of said metals. </p>
      <p>The resulting alloy is cooled in a dessicator to about room
        temperature in an inert helium atmosphere. Thereafter the
        amalgam is formed into a fine powder of about 10 mesh or less
        utilizing a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert
        atmosphere of helium. </p>
      <p>The inert atmosphere is used to prevent oxidation of the alloy.
      </p>
      <p>Formation of Intimate Amalgam and Catalytic Alloy Admixture </p>
      <p>Three parts by weight of powdered amalgam is admixed with one
        part by weight powdered alloy in an inert atmosphere to obtain a
        uniform mixture of the amalgam and catalytic alloy. </p>
      <p>The admixture may be utilized by passing steam upwardly
        therethrough whereby steam is dissociated into hydrogen and
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>Formation of Reactor Block Comprising Amalgam and Catalytic
        Alloy </p>
      <p>Three parts by weight of powdered amalgam is admixed with one
        part by weight powdered alloy. The weighing and blending is
        effected in an inert atmosphere. </p>
      <p>After blending to provide a uniform mixture, the resultant
        mixture is compressed to form a solid mass by application of
        pressure of about 40,000 pounds per square inch in a graphite
        mold conforming to the desired shape of the finished product.
        The mold utilized produces a cubical block. </p>
      <p>The resulting block is heated to an elevated temperature of
        about 10.degree. C. above the melting point of the mass and
        maintained at said temperature for about 10.+-.1 minutes. In the
        oven utilized for heating, an inert atmosphere, is maintained.
        Thereafter the mass comprised of amalgam and alloy is
        transferred to a dessicator wherein an inert atmosphere is
        maintained and the mass is allowed to cool. Upon cooling the
        resultant block is ready for use. </p>
      <p>The entire foregoing procedure should be carried out in an
        inert atmosphere such as helium or nitrogen and in the absence
        of contaminants. Oxidation of the metallic components and/or
        hydroxide formation will "poison" the resulting reactor block
        and reduce the activity thereof. Moreover, during the steps of
        the process operated at elevated temperature, the presence of
        any oxygen will cause the mass to ignite. </p>
      <p>Formation of Reactor Block Comprising Amalgam, Catalytic Alloy
        and Extender </p>
      <p>The amalgam and alloy prepared above and an extender of
        powdered copper of about 10 mesh are admixed in the following
        proportions: </p>
      <p>21.775 parts by weight amalgam. </p>
      <p>5.625 parts by weight alloy. </p>
      <p>72.6 parts by weight copper (extender). </p>
      <p>The weighing and blending of the foregoing metallic compounds
        should be done in an inert atmosphere. </p>
      <p>After blending to provide a uniform mixture, the resultant
        mixture is compressed to form a solid mass by application of
        pressure of about 40,000 pounds per square inch in a graphite
        mold conforming to the desired shape of the finished product.
        The compressed mass in a crucible conforming to the shape
        thereof is heated to an elevated temperature of about 10.degree.
        C. above the melting point of the mass and this temperature is
        maintained for about 10.+-.1 minutes. In the oven utilized for
        heating, an inert atmosphere is maintained. Thereafter the
        crucible and its contents are transferred to a desiccator
        wherein an inert atmosphere is maintained. Upon cooling the
        resultant block is ready for use. </p>
      <p>The entire foregoing procedure should be carried out under an
        inert atmosphere such as helium or nitrogen and in the absence
        of contaminants. Oxidation of the metallic components and/or
        hydroxide formation will "poison" the resulting reactor block
        and reduce the activity thereof. Moreover, during the steps of
        the process operated at elevated temperature, the presence of
        any oxygen will cause the mass to ignite. </p>
      <p>The reactor blocks are contacted with a fine spray of water at
        about room temperature in an atmospheric environment. The
        gaseous effluent from said contact comprises hydrogen and oxygen
        and burns when subjected to electrical sparking. The volume of
        gas evolved is dependent on reactor block surface area and the
        volume of water impinging thereon. Generally a 2.5 square cm
        surface will react with 0.14 gallons of water per minute. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE II </p>
      <p>Preparation of Amalgam </p>
      <p>An amalgam comprising 37.688 parts by weight of aluminum,
        32.112 parts by weight sodium and 30.2 parts by weight mercury
        is formed in a graphite crucible in an inert atmosphere of
        nitrogen at an elevated temperature of 200.degree. C. </p>
      <p>The resulting amalgam is cooled to room temperature in a
        dessicator in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. Thereafter, the
        amalgam is formed into a fine powder of about 10 mesh utilizing
        a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert atmosphere of
        nitrogen. </p>
      <p>It is important to prepare the amalgam in an inert gas
        atmosphere to prevent hydroxide formation. </p>
      <p>Preparation of Catalytic Alloy </p>
      <p>60.7 Parts by weight lead, 0.8 parts by weight platinum and
        38.5 parts by weight germanium are introduced into a graphite
        crucible which is thereafter placed in an oven and heated to
        melting in an inert atmosphere of helium to form an alloy of
        said metals. </p>
      <p>The resulting alloy is cooled in a dessicator to about room
        temperature in an inert helium atmosphere. Thereafter the
        amalgam is formed into a fine powder of about 10 mesh or less
        utilizing a ball mill. Grinding is effected in an inert
        atmosphere of helium. </p>
      <p>The inert atmosphere is used to prevent oxidation of the alloy.
      </p>
      <p>Formation of Intimate Amalgam and Catalytic Alloy Admixture </p>
      <p>Three parts by weight of powdered amalgam is admixed with one
        part by weight powdered alloy in an inert atmosphere to obtain a
        uniform mixture of the amalgam and catalytic alloy. </p>
      <p>The admixture may be utilized by passing steam upwardly
        therethrough whereby steam is dissociated into hydrogen and
        oxygen. </p>
      <p>Formation of Reactor Block Comprising Amalgam and Catalytic
        Alloy </p>
      <p>Three parts by weight of powdered amalgam is admixed with one

        pressure of about 40,000 pounds per square inch in a graphite
        mold conforming to the desired shape of the finished product.
        The mold utilized produces a cubical block. </p>
      <p>The resulting block is heated to an elevated temperature of
        about 10.degree. C. above the melting point of the mass and
        maintained at said temperature for about 10.+-.1 minutes. In the

        about room temperature in an atmospheric environment. The
        gaseous effluent from said contact comprises hydrogen and oxygen
        and burns when subjected to electrical sparking. The volume of
