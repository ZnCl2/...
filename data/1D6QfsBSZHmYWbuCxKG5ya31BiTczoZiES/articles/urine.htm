          years to regard urine as a mere waste product, the thought of
          using it for its healing powers may seem shocking. Yet urine
          has long played an important role in the holistic medical
          traditions of societies all over the world, and is even
          mentioned in the Ebers Medical Papyri of ancient Egypt. For

          incredible curative powers for ailments ranging from anemia to

          "prepare" the immune system. Urine Therapy includes many case
          histories of people who have successfully treated their
          ailments with urine, along with cogent explanations of why
          urine does what it does, how to ensure that the wastes flushed
          out with your urine aren't taken back in, and why urine may be
          the best tonic available for your immune system. In addition
          to protocols for using urine to treat a wide array of
          diseases, the book offers a program that teaches you
          step-by-step to overcome any initial aversion to urine
          therapy. Still playing an important role in the medical

            and/or rubbed into the skin, it purifies blood and tissues,
            provides useful nutrients and sends the body a signal about
            what is in or out of balance. This last effect is called
            (oral) auto-immunization. This brings us at a last important
            feature of urine. Urine itself is, as said, not a toxic
            waste product. It does contain however minute particles
            connected with possible disease processes in the body. These
            minute particles are mainly antibodies, which upon
            re-ingesting can help the body to react on specific
            pathological situations. Urine therapy has proven helpful in
            a great number of various diseases, ranging from a simple
            cold and a throatache, to tuberculosis and asthma, from
            minor skin problems such as itching, to more serious skin

        </center>
        <p>Urine is not a dirty and toxic substance rejected by the
          body. Urine is a by-product of blood filtration, not waste
          filtration. Medically it is referred to as "plasma
          ultrafiltrate". It is a purified derivative of the blood
          itself, made by the kidneys--whose principal function is not
          excretion but regulation of all the elements and their
          concentrations in the blood. Urine can be compared to
          leftovers from a meal, and this metaphor may help us
          understand why our bodies excrete elements that are valuable
          to our health and well-being. </p>
        <p>Nutrient-filled blood passes through the liver where toxins
          are removed to be excreted as solid waste. Eventually, this
          purified "clean" blood undergoes a filtering process in the
          kidneys, where excess water, salts, vitamins, minerals,
          enzymes, antibodies, urea, uric acid and other elements not
          usable at that time by the body are collected in the form of a
          purified, sterile, watery solution that is urine. The function
          of the kidneys is to keep the various elements in the blood
          balanced. The important elements in the blood are not filtered
          out because they are toxic and harmful to the body, but simply
          because the body does not need a particular concentration of
          an element at that specific point in time. It is this very
          regulating process of the kidneys that allows us to eat and
          drink more than our bodies need at any one time. </p>
        <p>Urine is considered to be an invaluable source of nourishment
          and healing that perhaps has been too controversial or not
          financially rewarding enough for it to be talked about and
          encouraged as a potent medicine. One's own urine, a living
          food, contains elements that are specific to one's body alone.
          The body is constantly producing a huge variety of antibodies,
          hormones, enzymes and other natural chemicals to regulate and
          control its functions and combat imbalances that one may not
          be aware of. -- </p>
        <p>Clinical studies have proved that the thousands of critical
          body chemicals and nutrients that end up in urine reflect the
          individual body's functions. When re-utilised, these chemicals
          and nutrients act as natural vaccines, antibacterial,
          antiviral and anticarcinogenic agents as well as hormone
          balancers and allergy relievers. The information that urine
          contains therefore cannot be duplicated or derived from any
          other source. Just as nature produces no two people who are
          exactly the same, there are no two urine samples in the world
          that contain exactly the same components. </p>
        <p>"Don't take this therapy lightly. Multiple sclerosis,
          colitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, hepatitis,
          hyperactivity, pancreatic insufficiency, psoriasis, eczema,
          diabetes, herpes, mononucleosis, adrenal failure, allergies
          and so many other ailments have been relieved through use of
          this therapy. After you overcome your initial gag response (I
          know I had one), you will realize that something big is going
          on, and if you are searching for health, this is an area to
          investigate. There are numerous reports and double blind
          studies which go back to the turn of the century supporting
          the efficacy of using urine for health." </p>
        <p>Urine therapy can be a very effective healing modality.
          Sometimes when all else fails, urine therapy will turn a
          person around. </p>
        <p>Ms. Christy was sick. Very sick. For a very long time. Pelvic
          inflammatory disease, ulcerative colitis, Chron's disease,
          chronic fatigue syndrome, Hashimoto's disease, mononucleosis.
          She had severe kidney infections, two miscarriages, chronic
          cystitis, severe candida, endometriosis, adrenal
          insufficiency, serious chronic ear and sinus infections, food
          and chemical allergies. And that wasn't the half of it. She
          had every conceivable medical test, her share of surgery, and
          drugs - plenty of them. Then she tried all forms of
          alternative therapy. Homeopathy, herbs, mega-vitamins and
          liv-cell treatments in Mexico. After traditional medicine
          failed to work, she and her husband spent over $100,000 trying
          to get her well with alternative approaches. Nothing worked. </p>
        <p>And then one day, her husband brought home a little book that
          told of how individuals had been cured of even the worst
          diseases with a seemingly strange and little-known natural
          therapy. Soon afterwards, she began the therapy herself. From
          the first day she began, she received almost instantaneous
          relief from her incurable constipation and fluid retention.
          Within a week, her severe abdominal and pelvic pain was gone.
          The chronic cystitis and yeast infections (internal and
          external) soon disappeared and her food allergies, exhaustion,
          and digestive problems all began to heal. After a few more
          months, her colds, flu, sore throats and on again off again
          viral symptoms disappeared. Her hair which had fallen out by
          the handfuls after her fifth surgery became thick and
          lustrous. Her weight normalized, and her energy and strength
          came back. After nearly 30 years of non-stop illness, Martha
          Christy was whole again. </p>
        <p>What was this therapy that she had discovered? What was this
          therapy that has helped seriously ill patients gain complete
          remissions from their afflictions? What was it that she
          actually did? Well, here it is. She orally and medicinally
          re-consumed her own urine... </p>
        <p>The middle stream of fresh, warm, morning urine is the most
          potent, and drinking it mixed with freshly squeezed orange
          juice is probably the fastest way to accomplish this task,
          although it is best not to mix urine with other foods or
          drinks or to take it within an hour before or after eating. </p>
        <p>Oral drops of fresh urine can be placed directly under the
          tongue. Urine therapists suggest their patients start with 5
          drops of fresh morning urine on the first day, increase to 5
          or 10 drops on the second day, and take 10 drops on the
          morning of the third day and the same amount that evening
          before going to bed. Once patients feel comfortable with this
          therapy, they can gradually increase the amount as they see
          fit to obtain the results required for their body's condition.
          Over time, they can learn to adjust the amount that is needed
          by observing their reactions to the therapy; their dosage may
          become as much as one full cup at a time! </p>
        <p>Self-urine may be used as eye drops and ear drops, in foot
          baths and even as effective enemas. Nose drops can help loosen
          mucus and clear up blocked nasal passages. Gargling with it is
          helpful for a sore throat, and inhaling it relieves sinus and
          respiratory congestion. Taken internally, it has a laxative
          and diuretic effect, as it cleanses the digestive tract. </p>
        <p>Dr John Armstrong (author of The Water of Life) emphasises
          the need to massage with urine. He insists that cures work
          faster and more effectively in those who are bathed, massaged,
          rubbed and soaked in their own urine. He highly recommends it
          for more serious illnesses, since urine is absorbed through
          the skin and the hormonal and protein-based contents are
          slowly reabsorbed into the system, bypassing digestive juices
          that otherwise may have neutralised their potency. In this
          way, it also works as an excellent cosmetic for moisturising
          and healing skin blemishes, burns and scar tissue. However,
          for this usage, it is preferable to use urine that is 4 - 8
          days old. The smell of ammonia in the old urine is not toxic
          but actually beneficial if used topically only, and not taken
          internally. </p>

        <p>Cancer cells release various antigens, some of which appear
          in the urine. Oral auto-urotherapy is suggested as a new
          treatment modality for cancer patients. It will provide the
          intestinal lymphatic system the many tumor antigens against
          which antibodies may be produced. These antibodies may be

            work?</font> </p>
        <p><font color="#000000">"Urine therapy has been practised for
            thousands of years and has merely fallen a bit into
            obscurity in the last century. However, urine therapy may
            seem to be unorthodox and perhaps revolutionary, it does not
            introduce anything new or original. It has been known
            throughout the centuries both in the West and in the East.
            Dr. Evagelos Danopouolos of Greece reported that urea found
            in urine has anti-cancerous properties. The urea seems to
            disrupt the ability of cancer cells to group together and
            kills them by upsetting some of their normal metabolic
            activities. Urine therapy has been used to treat cancers of
            the skin, cervix, lungs, eyes, breast, and liver. The first
            question that probably comes to mind is whether urine is not
            a toxic substance and how a toxic waste product could ever
            be of any benefit for your health. Well, urine is NOT a
            toxic waste product and this has been scientifically proven.
            95% of urine is water, 2.5% consists of urea and the
            remaining 2.5% is a mixture of minerals, salt, hormones and
            enzymes. Toxic substances are being removed from the body
            through the liver and intestines, through the skin and
            through the outbreath...</font> </p>
        <p>Subcutaneous urine injections was practiced in 1912 by Duncan
          (1) from New York under the name of auto-pyotherapy for
          urinary infections, and in 1919 by Wildbolz (1) from Bern for
          diagnostic purposes. Cimino (2) from Palermo reported in 1927
          on the use of auto uro-therapy for urinary infections.
          Rabinowitch (3) in 1931 described this auto-urine therapy for
          gonarthritis. Jausion et al. (4) used this kind of therapy in
          1933 for desensitization and endocrinological problems. They
          treated with auto urotherapy injections patients who suffered
          from migraine, pruritus, asthma, urticaria, eczema, psoriasis,
          etc. Day (5)in 1936 treated patients with acute and subacute
          glomerulonephritis by injection of an autogenous urinary
          extract. Sandweiss, Saltzstein and Farbman (6) reported in
          1938 that an extract from urine of pregnant women has a
          prophylactic and therapeutic effect on experimental ulcers in
          dogs. Shortly thereafter the same group noted that an extract
          from urine of normal women has a similar beneficial effect
          (7). In 1926 Seiffert first described the construction of
          ileal loop conduits for urinary diversion (8). Bricker in the
          1950s popularized the use of the ileal loop as a means of
          supravesical urinary diversion following exenteration for
          pelvic malignancy in adults (9). Ureterosigmoidostomy as a
          means of urinary diversion was used widely from 1920 to 1955.
          It was this type of implant which Hammer first reported in
          1929 associated with tumor (10). </p>

        <p>"Very briefly, here are two ways to do urine therapy. This is
          in no way a complete discussion of how to use the therapy, but
          simply an introduction. </p>
        <p>1) Use your own urine in a homeopathic fashion. </p>
        <p>First, collect midstream urine in a clean cup or container.
          This should be a clean catch, meaning the genital area
          (important for women in particular) has been cleaned
          beforehand. To 1/6 ounce of distilled water in a sterile
          bottle, add one drop of fresh urine. Cap and shake 50 times.
          Take one drop of this mix and add to another 1/6 ounce of
          distilled water and shake 50 times. Take one drop of this mix
          and add to 1/6 oz. of 80 to 90 proof vodka which acts as a
          preservative. </p>
        <p>Place three drops under the tongue hourly until there is
          obvious improvement or temporary exacerbation of symptoms. As
          improvement progresses, lengthen the interval between
          treatments. After 3 days, suspend treatment to avoid pushing
          the immune system. Treatment is resumed if progress remains
          static or relapse occurs. </p>
        <p>2) Begin with oral drops then increase dosage as needed. </p>
        <p>Use fresh urine drops direct. For some cases, sub-lingual
          drops work well. <br>
          (Should always use fresh urine immediately upon collection.
          You should not boil or dilute the urine in any way. You must
          use it in its natural form) </p>
        <p>Start by taking 1-5 drops of morning urine on the first day.
          On the second day, take 5-10 drops in the morning. On the
          third day, take 5-10 drops in the morning, and the same amount
          in the evening before you go to bed. </p>
        <p>Once you feel accustomed to the therapy, gradually increase
          the amount as needed for obtaining results for your condition.
          As you use the therapy, you will learn to adjust the amount
          you need by observing your reactions to the therapy. It may be
          that you'll work up to actually drinking an ounce or two at a
          time." </p>

        <p>"This strange behavior, called "urine therapy," or
          "auto-immune therapy," or "intrinsic medicine," or simply
          "UT," and also known in India as "amaroli" (the practise
          itself) and "Shivambu" (urine, the "water of Shiva"), has a
          well-documented, proven record of its power to heal an amazing
          variety of ills, with no negative or harmful effects.&nbsp;
          Urine is a divine nectar, with supernatural qualities. After
          all, as the Bible says, "the life (or life-force) of the flesh
          is in the blood," and as urine comes from the blood, it
          contains that "life-force." Imbibed fresh and warm, it is a
          living food, and a nourishing drink, that is also cleansing,
          as well as medicinal. Urine is anti-bacterial, anti-fungal,
          and anti-viral. It is used in cases of AIDS (only AIDS
          anti-bodies in urine); cancer; fatigue; anemia; all sorts of
          urinary diseases, for weight-loss, colds and flu, candida,
          diabetes, digestive problems, jaundice, etc. It is
          medically-proven against polio, rabies, and tuberculosis. The
          list of diseases for which it is effective is very long, and
          around 175 known diseases are said to respond to this kind of
          therapy... Urine therapy is truly a "panacea" (i.e., a
          "cure-all" or "universal remedy")... </p>

        <p>An explanation of the practice of Amaroli, Shivambu, or
          Auto-Urine Therapy follows. This practice comes from Yoga and
          is the use of one's own urine as food, medicine, restorative,
          transforming agent and&nbsp; immune system booster. It is
          sometimes called 'Your Own Doctor'. Amaroli is very simple to
          do and increases the power of the immune system, strengthens
          the Aura and improves skin health. Spiritual aspirants will
          find that the mind is less inclined to behave like a monkey,
          spiritual energy is kept high, and progress towards samadhi is
          smoother. The effects are magnified if the practitioner has a
          Yoga practice and an Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle. </p>

        <p>How common is the use of urine? It is used in the manufacture
          of hormones, diuretics, and cancer fighting drugs. As urea, it
          is one of the primary ingredients in many face and skin
          creams---just read the labels---because it is one of the best
          moisturizers available. As a medicine, it can be used as an
          extract, injected, topically and in oral applications.
          Scientific research on urine therapy started at the turn of
          the last century and continued until shortly after World War
          II, when drug companies realized there was more money to be
          made in urine extracts than in promoting its self-healing
          properties. </p>
        <p>Dr. Williams states that urine is probably the most specific
          customized medicine you will ever have available. He refers to
          the remarkable story of <i>Martha Christy</i>, who for years
          suffered a long list of chronic ailments untreatable by
          conventional medicine. She reluctantly agreed to try urine
          therapy and experienced almost immediate relief. She went on
          to document not only her story but those of many others in her
          book " Christy cites numerous medical and scientific studies
          that have been conducted on urine, as well as testimonials
          from numerous converts, and provides a good resource for
          understanding the benefits and supporting evidence for using
          urine therapy. Home Cure also offers a source book for
          physicians. </p>
        <p>For me the most compelling argument for trying urine therapy
          was its benefit in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. </p>

        <p>In the light of this information we should look again at the
          very first quotation in this essay. The main theme so far is
          that repulsive urine as medicine, which is the last of the
          four requisites for bhikkhus, is considered to be the absolute
          minimum of medicine that a bhikkhu will need through out his
          life. The Pali term<i> Putimuttabhesajja </i>is a compounded
          term made out of at least three pali roots; <i>puti, mutta </i>and<i>
            bhesajja. </i>As we’ve already seen this word has been
          translated as: 1.) Decomposing urine as medicine. Or as: 2.)
          Fermented urine as support. The word <i>puti</i>literally
          means either decomposing or fermented, sometimes translated as
          rancid or putrefied. <i>Muttam </i>means urine, sometimes
          translated as cows’ urine, and occasionally as ammonia. <i>Bhesajjam





          </i>means medicine. In the Vinaya Pitaka, whether with the
          consultation of its Commentary or not, there is little chance
          to find out what kind of urine is meant because neither the
          Vinaya nor its Commentary adds any further light on the
          subject. In the Sutta Pitaka, on the other hand, especially in
          MN. Sutta No 46 and its relevant Commentary and
          Sub-commentary, there’s enough evidence to suggest a more
          pragmatic meaning than that commonly accepted today. <b>"</b>Itwould
not






          be agreeable to sight, smell or taste" suggests that the
          adjective <i>puti</i>does not mean any decomposition,
          fermentation or putrefaction but that urine is naturally
          disagreeable to sight, smell or taste – a statement most
          people would agree with. The original recommendation may not
          have meant any decomposition, fermentation or putrefaction at
          all, as the translators’ has interpreted it so far. Nor do the
          scriptures in any way indicate that it was <i>cow’s</i> urine
          that the Buddha originally referred to. The Sub-commentary
          says: "As urine pass out from the genital it is warm due to
          the body heat". There is not a word or clue justifying the
          assumption that cows’ urine is meant. The interpretation I
          prefer, on the other hand, is quite in line with the
          Commentary and the Sub-commentary to the above mentioned Sutta
          and with the contemporary idea of using one’s own urine. </p>

                :&nbsp; Properties and Efficacy of Auto-Urine Therapy</font></font></b></center>
        <p>It is difficult to convince a majority of people that
          drinking ones own urine can cure a number of disorders. </p>
        <p>The reason is that modern medical science has hammered it
          into our heads that urine is liquid containing useless and
          even harmful substances that have been rejected by the body.
          Traditional cultural influence has also nurtured a kind of
          disgust for urine in our minds. </p>
        <p>Before discussing the effects of urine on our bodies and our
          disorders, let us first consider the composition of urine. </p>
        <p>Normally a human passes from 750-1500 milliliters of urine in
          a day. The requirements of water increase after consumption of
          fried or highly spiced foods. This will result in an increase
          in the total quantity of urine. On the other hand, in summer a
          large proportion of body water is lost through perspiration,
          thus decreasing the amount of urine. More urine is passed
          during the colder periods of the year than during the hotter
          parts. </p>
        <p>Generally urine is clear like pure water, or there may a
          tinge of yellow in it. When the quantity of urine decreases,
          due to hot weather or for any other reason, the concentration
          of substances in the urine increases, in which case it will
          probably be of a deeper yellow or orange color. The urine of a
          person suffering from jaundice is generally as yellow as
          turmeric, and that of a feverish person has a reddish tinge.
          Disorders of the kidneys or the urinary tract may cause urine
          to become turbid and red in color. </p>
        <p>The urine of a healthy person is a little salty in taste. If
          the urine is of a more intense yellow color, it may be a
          little saltier in taste. If there is a reddish tinge in the
          urine, it may have a slightly bitter taste. Variations in the
          intake of solids and liquids as well as variations in the
          weather cause corresponding variations in the color and taste
          of urine. </p>
        <p>The following are the average quantities of the various
          substances listed below, in 100 milliliters of urine as
          reported in 'Introduction to Biochemistry' by Dr. Pharon: </p>
        <p><i>Substance // Milligrams</i> </p>
        <p>1] Urea nitrogen // 682.00 <br>
          2] Urea // 1459.00 <br>
          3] Creatinin nitrogen // 36.00 <br>
          4] Creatinin // 97.20 <br>
          5] Uric acid nitrogen // 12.30 <br>
          6] Uric acid --- 36.90 <br>
          7] Amino nitrogen // 9.70 <br>
          8] Ammonia nitrogen // 57.00 <br>
          9] Sodium // 212.00 <br>
          10] Potassium // 137.00 <br>
          11] Calcium // 19.50 <br>
          12] Magnesium // 11.30 <br>
          13] Chloride314.00 <br>
          14] Total sulphate // 91.00 <br>
          15] Inorganic sulphate // 83.00 <br>
          16] Inorganic phosphate // 127.00 <br>
          17] N/10 acid // 27.80 </p>
        <p>Some other important constituents of Shivambu are as follows:
          Enzymes, Amylase (diastase), Lactic dehydrogenate (L. D. H.),
          Leucine amino-peptidase (L. A. P.), Urokinase.Hormones,
          Catechol amines, Hydroxy-steroids, 17-Catosteroids,
          Erythropoietine, Adenylate cyclase, Prostaglandins, Sex
          hormones... Copper, Urobilinogen. <br>
          As a knowledgeable qualified doctor has pointed out, there is
          a strong possibility of there being several other beneficial
          substances not yet know to science, in addition to the above
          substances, present in urine. <br>
          Urokinase, an enzyme present in urine, prevents the formation
          of blood clots in the blood vessels, and is even capable of
          dissolving clots already formed. When such blood clots
          obstruct the flow of blood in the blood vessels of the heart a
          heart attack may be precipitated. Dr. Mezel of the Edgewater
          Hospital of Chicago, IL USA, injects urokinase into the bodies
          of victims of heart attacks thus aborting the attack and
          saving the life of the patient. <br>
          Dr. Salaria, an eminent surgeon of Ahmedabad, Gugjarat, India,
          too makes it a practice to give an injection of the patients
          own urine before undertaking surgery so as to forestall any
          risk of overburdening or harming the heart during or after the
          operation. <br>
          The hormone erythropoietine, one of the substances usually
          present in urine, stimulates the bone marrow to increase the
          rate of production of erythrocytes (red blood corpuscles).
          This is the reason why a patient of anemia derives substantial
          benefit from auto-urine therapy. </p>
        <p>Another hormone present in urine, adenylate cyclase,
          co-ordinates the actions of all hormones in the body through
          the production of a substance known as cyclic A. M. P.. </p>
        <p>Prostaglandin is a hormone that is essential for the
          contraction of the muscles of the uterus. Many scientists are
          of the opinion that this hormone can act as a contraceptive. </p>
        <p>Urine contains sex hormones, insulin and growth hormones as
          well. </p>
        <p>The Nobel Laureate Albert Sczent Georgyi has carried out a
          number of experiments testing the effect of methyl glyoxal, a
          constituent of urine, on cancer patients, and has had
          considerable success in several cases. </p>
        <p>In addition to the above, one must not lose sight of the high
          probability of the presence of urine in many substances which
          are as yet unknown to science. </p>
        <p>All the beneficial substances are present in urine in very
          finely divided and highly potentised forms. As a result they
          are quickly absorbed from the stomach and the intestines
          within a short time following the imbibing of urine. And
          despite the extremely small quantities in which they are
          present in the urine, they have been found to be of great
          benefits to the body. </p>
        <p>Dr. Dharmadhikari of Pune in Maharashtra state, India, has
          tried auto urine therapy on more than 200 patients, and has
          carried out scientific investigations related to this therapy.
          Here are the conclusions he has arrived at as a result of
          these researches: </p>
        <p>The body begins to absorb more oxygen from the atmosphere
          after the commencement of auto-urine therapy, and the
          metabolic reactions are speeded up. The results of a large
          number of experiments support this conclusion. </p>
        <p>The commencement of auto-urine therapy is invariably followed
          by a slow but definite increase in the number of red blood
          corpuscles in and the hemoglobin content of the blood. </p>
        <p>Dr. Dharmadhikari believes that these changes in body
          functions play a very important part in curing disorders. In
          the book 'Yoga' published by the Bihar School of Yoga,
          Monghyr, a knowledgeable and learned doctor has ascribed the
          efficacy of urine to the following reasons: </p>
        <p>Urine supplements the essential nutrients and makes up the
          deficiency of any nutrient in the body. </p>
        <p>Urine contains highly active enzymes, that have a salutary
          effect on al the physiological reaction taking place in the
          body. </p>
        <p>Urine contains valuable salts necessary for the body. (The
          well-known and widely prevalent 'Biochemic' therapeutic system
          uses just twelve salts to cure any and every disease). </p>
        <p>The hormones contained in urine are of great benefit to the
          body. </p>
        <p>Urine possesses bactericidal properties. It therefore
          destroys the disease-causing bacteria in the body, especially
          those infesting the digestive tract. </p>
        <p>The substances present in the urine augment and sharpen the
          body's natural powers of resistance to disease. </p>
        <p>The substance called 'urea' present in urine is a diuretic
          and increases the efficiency of the kidneys. </p>
        <p>Urine is a tonic that strengthens the body, and an 'elixir'
          the confers longevity. </p>
        <p>Ayurveda and other ancient works on medicinal science have
          accorded their approval to the drinking of urine as a
          therapeutic measure. Ayurveda regards urine as an effective
          antidote against the harmful confluence of excesses of the
          three humours. </p>
        <p>It is believed by some researchers that urine acts like a
          vaccine, promoting the generation of antibodies that fight and
          over the agencies that cause disorders, thus resisting and
          curing diseases. </p>
        <p>The sum and substance of the above discussion is that urine
          has an undoubtedly salutary effect on the body, but that the
          details of exactly how it acts in the body have not yet been
          worked out sufficiently clearly to command universal agreement
          among the experts. </p>
        <p>How far would it be proper to recommend or adopt a remedy,
          the mode of action of which has not yet been completely
          understood? The answer to this objection is simple and
          straightforward. To this day the mode of action of a number of
          drugs and therapeutic procedures such as aspirin, acupuncture,
          electric shock treatment, etc., has not been worked out
          satisfactorily. But this in no way reduces their efficacy. The
          doctor knows well what effects aspirin will produce in the
          body after being ingested orally, and accordingly prescribes
          aspirin (which in fact the world consumption of aspirin
          exceeds the consumption of any other drug!) for the patient as
          and when necessary. Knowledge of its mode of action is not
          essential for the doctor. In the same way, innumerable
          experiments have established the actual effect of auto-urine
          on the body. It has always been found to have favorable
          effects, not a single case of an untoward effect having been
          recorded so far. </p>
        <p>There is a mass of documentary evidence establishing the fact
          that imbibing of ones own urine has been and is being restored
          to by criminal elements to obviate physical damage and to
          augment their powers of endurance of pain inflicted by
          beatings; by mountaineer's to maintain their vigor and to
          fight adverse atmospheric conditions; and by numerous monks
          and ascetics to develop the capacity to complete their
          penance's successfully. </p>
        <p>Briefly, it is nothing more than a conjecture that urine is a
          useless fluid that has been rejected by the body; no instances
          of urine having a seriously, or even mildly, harmful effect on
          the body have been recorded. A renowned heart specialist of
          Bombay, India once issued an appeal through a newspaper to
          members of the public, inviting them to write to him about
          their experience of auto-urine therapy, especially about cases
          of adverse effects. His purpose was to demonstrate that
          drinking urine is harmful. Soon there was a deluge of hundreds
          of letters in response to his appeal; but there was not a
          single letter among them that reported any adverse effects. </p>

          <p><b>SHIVAMBU CHIKITSA OR MANAV MOOTRA: URINE FASTING IN
              BRIEF</b> </p>
          <p><b>Dr. Jhani Picasso</b></p>
        </center>
        <p>Salt content and Nitrogen content are the two most
          significant variables in urine. When there is too much of
          either, I usually pour some of my urine out, especially when
          there is too much salt. If I am fasting, with no further
          intake of salt, I might drink it a little more salty. And if
          there is no more Nitrogen (protein or feed grade synthetic
          urea) intake, I would recycle it all. The only other variable
          is how much water is in your body, which would determine how
          often you urinate. My personal rule is, if I am urinating more
          than once an hour, it puts a burden on the kidneys. One should
          then either stop the intake of fluids (preferably), or pour
          off some of the urine or sweat it out with heat. That solves
          the problem of the three variables of urine: Percentage of
          salt, Nitrogen, and water. </p>
        <p>Early in the fast, it is OK to pour off some urine, so that
          you won't be recycling any undesirable chemicals, which are
          practically unavoidable in the modern diet. As the fast
          progresses, one eventually should recycle every drop. Like
          Jesus said: "It is not what goes into a man which defiles him
          so much as what comes out of him". And in the Nag Hammadi
          Gospels: "Of all the Father hath given me, I let nothing
          escape". In the early stages, it is good to take daily enemas,
          which will later be unnecessary. In the very late stages of
          fasting, it is OK to take such nutrients which are pure,
          liquid, or concentrated. </p>
        <p>These supplements are from the three food groups:
          carbohydrates, protein, and oils (fats). Carbohydrates can be
          blackstrap molasses, raw honey, or fruit juices (preferably
          raw). Proteins are all powders, except for milk, such as
          powdered Chlorella, Spirulina, Blue-Green Algae, Soy, Brewers
          Yeast, and powdered milk. Oils are Wheat Germ, Flax, Butter,
          or Cod Liver Oil. These rules apply also to Tantrics,
          performing a "Double Hermetic Seal" between the two. Jai Shiva

          <p><b>SHIVAMBU CHIKITSA SADHANA: URINE THERAPY METHODOLOGY</b></p>
        </center>
        <p>I advocate the use of products which are organic and have no
          chemical additives, and Colloidal Silver as an
          antiviral-antibiotic. If you are pissing a little fluid out,
          you can have more leeway, but if you are recycling all, you
          should be careful what goes in. I recommend things which are
          preferably raw, concentrated nutrition, and the more liquified
          the nourishment, the better. Avoid solids, and give your
          Alimentary Canal a chance to clean itself out, at first with
          enemas, followed by the proverbial loose stools, which go with
          Urine Fasting. </p>
        <p>Think of the three food groups: carbs, fats (oils), and
          protein. Any solids should be in the form of powders, so they
          will emulsify in liquid. For oils, use: wheat germ oil, flax
          seed oil or powder, cod liver oil, coconut oil, and butter.
          For carbohydrates, use: fruit juices (preferably raw,
          organic), blackstrap molasses, and raw honey. For protein, use
          milk, buttermilk, kefir, yogurt, blue-green algae, chlorella,
          spirulina plankton, and milk powder. Urine Fasting is still
          considered best with only distilled water, but those who are
          on a permanent Urine Fast or Tantra Sadhana, should take the
          above supplements. </p>
        <p>My teacher believed one could become a Breatharian, and live
          on water and urine only. Perhaps it would be easier to be
          Breatharian if practicing the Tantric form of Urine Therapy.
          My guru taught Rasa Tantra. For him, Urine Therapy (drinking
          only one's own) was only an experiment, since this was in 1971
          - before anyone in the U.S. knew anything about Urine Therapy,
          the "revival" of which began in England with J.W. Armstrong,
          and gained wide popularity in India, which published dozens of
          documents about it. America and the rest of the world are
          still trying to catch up. I recommend using Feed Grade
          Synthetic Urea, mixed with water, as a topical body rub on the
          skin. If the skin is too dry, add a little glycerin. Best
          wishes for good progress. Sai Ram </p>

        </center>
        <p><b>Internal Technique</b> </p>
        <p>Urine is taken as a food and spiritual sadhana. It enhances
          the immune response, is a skin tonic and increases the supply
          of Prana and Ojas. Urine passed at any time of the day may be
          drunk but the best urine is the mid-stream urine passed just
          after getting up in the morning. </p>
        <p>1. Collect the Urine you pass after rising each morning,
          rejecting a little at the beginning and the end. The amount,
          colour and taste will vary according to your diet and
          lifestyle. It should be clear and golden and taste like straw
          if your diet is good, although some foods colour and flavour
          it. </p>
        <p>2. Immediately drink it.&nbsp; You may then take a little
          water to follow. Do not eat for at least half an hour after
          drinking. </p>
        <p>3. Starting... You may start by taking a small amount (as
          little as a few drops in some warm water) then increasing the
          amount gradually. </p>
        <p>4. Constitution... determines the effects that Amaroli has on
          you. Vata types get great benefit from the practice, Pitta
          types can get excellent results also, but Kapha types may not
          notice as much. Those in the change-over periods of teenage
          and menopause years will benefit greatly. Those older than 40
          years will also benefit greatly </p>
        <p><b>Side Effects...</b> </p>
        <p>1.&nbsp; Amaroli mobilises toxins within the body and the
          improved immune system then attacks them. This can cause
          various symptoms such as inflammation, fever, eruptions etc.
          If you are ill and/or on drugs, caution is advised. Start with
          a few drops in water and work up to the full practice over
          months. Stop if side effects are unpleasant. These side
          effects will cease when the immune system has destroyed the
          toxins. </p>
        <p>2. If your urine is unusual for some reason... for example
          you may have become dehydrated, eaten too much salt, eaten
          cooked or bad food, or eaten too much bitter food, then take
          care. This urine may cause the digestive system to empty
          itself. So if your urine is an unusual colour or tastes very
          salty or bitter, then either cease the practise until it has
          returned to normal or dilute a small amount with water and
          drink that instead. </p>
        <p><b>External Technique</b> </p>
        <p>Urine is used as a cleaner, skin tonic and to treat
          infections, wounds, and skin diseases. The whole body can be
          massaged or just part. Do not use soaps, shampoos etc. when
          doing urine massage. They are un-necessary, toxic , and urine
          has a cleansing effect by itself. After washing, almond or
          apricot oil may be applied to dry skins for extra protection.
        </p>
        <p>Three strategies for external use... </p>
        <p>1. Use fresh urine for skin treatment... This is best not
          left on for too long. The <i>Damar Tantra</i> says that fresh
          urine will cause muscle wasting if left on the skin. Use for
          disinfecting wounds, and treating skin disorders. It can be
          used for a short massage and then should be washed off
          immediately with warm water. </p>
        <p>2.&nbsp; Use aged urine for cleaning... Collect, place in a
          dark bottle, stopper and keep for at least four days in a
          cool, dark place. This has a strong odour and contains
          ammonia. It is an excellent cleaner and also a disinfectant.
          Ancient peoples used this for washing clothes and
          bodies.&nbsp; Do not use this for massage, use only for
          washing yourself. Rinse off with water immediately as it is
          mildly caustic. </p>
        <p>3. Use boiled urine for massage... Collect your urine, and
          then boil in a stainless steel pot until reduced to 25% of
          original volume. This is light and fine and excellent for
          massage. It can be left on for as long as you like. </p>
