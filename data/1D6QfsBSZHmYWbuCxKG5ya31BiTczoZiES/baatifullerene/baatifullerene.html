        <b>Tarek Baati,<i> et al.</i></b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>Countless studies showed that [60]fullerene (C(60)) and
      derivatives could have many potential biomedical applications.
      However, while several independent research groups showed that
      C(60) has no acute or sub-acute toxicity in various experimental
      models, more than 25 years after its discovery the in vivo fate
      and the chronic effects of this fullerene remain unknown. If the
      potential of C(60) and derivatives in the biomedical field have to
      be fulfilled these issues must be addressed. Here we show that
      oral administration of C(60) dissolved in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml) at
      reiterated doses (1.7 mg/kg of body weight) to rats not only does
      not entail chronic toxicity but it almost doubles their lifespan.
      The effects of C(60)-olive oil solutions in an experimental model
      of CCl(4) intoxication in rat strongly suggest that the effect on
      lifespan is mainly due to the attenuation of age-associated
      increases in oxidative stress. Pharmacokinetic studies show that
      dissolved C(60) is absorbed by the gastro-intestinal tract and
      eliminated in a few tens of hours. These results of importance in
      the fields of medicine and toxicology should open the way for the
      many possible -and waited for- biomedical applications of C(60)
      including cancer therapy, neurodegenerative disorders, and ageing.<br>

      <b>Our Process</b><b><br>
      </b>We are the only company known to strictly follow the original
      Baati / Paris method of Carbon 60 olive oil preparation. We start
      with 99.9+ % purified, research grade, solvent-free Carbon 60. We
      use 5 grams of our Carbon 60 per liter of olive oil. This is more
      than 6 times the amount of Carbon 60 that can possibly saturate
      the solution. This is very important, as not all of the Carbon 60
      being mixed with olive oil will dissolve in a two week mixing
      time.<br>
      <br>
      Many of our competitors cut corners by using an industrial grade
      Carbon 60 (containing dangerous solvents), and/or simply putting
      in 0.8 or 0.9 grams of Carbon 60 per liter of olive oil, which
      always results in an inferior product. Our own in-house
      experiments have shown that you cannot achieve a fully saturated
      0.8 grams per liter (0.8 mg per ml) solution if you do not start
      with the entire 5 grams per liter mix ratio described in the Baati
      process. Some companies are even boiling their olive oil to try to
      dissolve the carbon faster. This destroys the polyphenols in the
      olive oil, and results in a damaged, black oil.<br>
      <br>
      After extensively researching olive oil quality we found that
      small batch extra virgin olive oil is notoriously inconsistent in
      quality. It is our determination that the best, most consistent
      quality olive oil available is Kirkland brand Organic Extra Virgin
      Olive Oil, which is what we have been using for several years.<br>
      <br>
      We mix our 5 grams of Carbon 60 per liter of olive oil for 2 weeks
      using specialized equipment that ensures full suspension of Carbon
      60 particles during the entire mixing operation. The mixing occurs
      in complete darkness, in temperature controlled conditions, to
      avoid Carbon 60 degradation from light or heat.<br>
      <br>
      Our fully saturated Carbon 60 solution is then centrifuged at
      5,000 g for one hour to remove the undissolved Carbon 60 .<br>
      <br>
      This clarified, fully saturated Carbon 60 solution is then sterile
      filtered through a 0.22 micron filter.<br>
      <br>
      We then bottle our solution in amber glass bottles, and package
      for delivery to you. Our packaging is designed to be extremely
      robust to prevent breakage, and conforms to international
      standards for shipping liquids in glass containers. We have not
      experienced a single broken bottle delivery since adopting our
      current shipping system in 2013.<br>
      <br>
      We are the only company proven to consistently provide a fully
      saturated, 0.8 mg per ml Carbon 60 olive oil solution. Don’t
      settle for the slightly less expensive, vastly inferior products
      available from our competitors. Insist on fully saturated Carbon
      60 olive oil solution from the only company that has been doing it
      right from the beginning!<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>[0002] 1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention concerns [60]fullerene and stable
      biocompatible compositions comprising [60]fullerene dissolved in a
      carrier. The present invention also relates to a method for
      increasing the expected lifespan (longevity) of a mammal, which
      comprises a step of administering [60]fullerene or a composition
      comprising a therapeutically effective amount of [60]fullerene.
      The present invention further concerns a method for preserving a
      mammal to damages caused by free radicals using said [60]fullerene
      or said composition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of Related Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Free radicals, such as oxygen radicals and other reactive
      oxygen/nitrogen/chlorine species (hydroxyl, nitric oxide
      radicals), are constantly formed in vivo. Some of these molecules
      are physiologically useful, but they can also result in
      pathological oxidative stress to cells and tissues. Endogenous
      defences include both antioxidants and repairing systems. However,
      excess production of free radicals, their production in
      inappropriate relative amounts or deficiencies in endogenous
      defences can have deleterious effects. Free radicals can cause
      oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, bio molecules, rises in the
      concentration of intracellular calcium, as well as activation of
      proteases, nucleases and protein kinases. Considerable evidence
      supports the view that oxidative damage involving free radicals
      occurs in most, if not all, human diseases. Oxidative stress is
      now recognized as an important contributor to the development of
      many human diseases including liver fibrosis,
      ischemia-reperfusion, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative disease
      and age-related cancer as well as to process of ageing. Thus
      antioxidants and systems that can protect against oxidative stress
      are needed to maintain health. A large body of scientific evidence
      supports that oxidative stress is directly responsible for aging
      (Aging Cell. 2009, 8(3):258-69) and an array of neuropathology
      conditions (Nutrition 2010, 26:595-603. Neurochem Res. 2007,
      32:757-73). The free radical theory of aging proposes that the
      organism is unable to repair all of them and that, with time,
      unrepaired damages accumulate and put the organism at risk: in
      other words, free radicals provoke aging and death (FEBS Letters
      2009, 498: 183-186. J. Neurochem. 2009, 108:1251-65). Antioxidants
      are the substances able to react with free radicals and to protect
      the body from the damage caused by these molecules (Ital J
      Biochem. 2006, 55:263-282). In particular, consumption in excess
      of some foods which are rich sources of antioxidants is considered
      to promote good health and longevity. It is now believed that the
      maintenance of redox balance within the body can forestall aging
      and promote good health and longevity.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Due to its 30 carbon double bonds, [60]fullerene
      (Buckminsterfullerene, Ceo) is a powerful free radical scavenger
      which characterize it as a radical sponge (Science 1991, 254, 1
      83-1185). Biological applications of fullerenes and derivatives,
      in particular as antioxidants, have been extensively reviewed
      (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996, 4: 767-779. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2003, 38:
      913-923. Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy, 2005, 59: 351-358).
      Ceo is only soluble in a limited number of organic solvents, such
      as toluene, benzene, chloronaphtalene and dichlorobenzene.
      Availability of biocompatible aqueous solutions of Ceo and its
      derivatives that are insoluble in water have been major obstacles
      to toxicity and in vivo studies of this new family of compounds.
      Biological properties of water-insoluble fullerenes are still
      misunderstood and to our knowledge there are no certified
      toxicology data about them. Most of the fullerenes studied until
      now are water-soluble derivatives, since study of water-insoluble
      fullerenes, such as pristine Ceo, in biological medium proves
      difficult. It is a common practice to derivatize the fullerene
      core with substituants such as OH, COOH, NH2 to increase
      hydrophilicity (Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1996, 4: 767-779. Eur. J. Med.
      Chem. 2003, 38: 913-923. Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy, 2005,
      59: 351-358). Water-soluble Ceo derivatives have been found to
      retain in vitro the free radical scavenger properties of their
      parent fullerene molecule, allowing these properties to be
      exploited in biological systems. Many patents already exist for a
      broad range of biomedical applications and other commercial
      applications of water-soluble fullerenes, including anticancer and
      anti-HIV therapies, drugs for neurodegenerative diseases, drug
      delivery systems, and preparations that retard aging. In
      particular, a group of hydrophilic Ceo derivatives,
      carboxyfullerenes, were proposed to increase metazoan's lifespan
      (U.S. Patent Application 2003/0162837). However, water-soluble
      fullerenes are difficult to synthesize and to purify. Besides, in
      contrast to pristine Ceo, which is non-toxic, some C6o-derivatives
      can be highly toxic (Adv Exp Med Biol, 2007, 620, 168-80).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Pristine C6o has been shown to be more effective as an
      antioxidant than certain carboxyfullerenes in Wang, I. et al., J.
      Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4614-4620. However, Ceo has not been employed
      as an active ingredient to develop an in vivo treating method in
      this publication. Aqueous suspensions of Ceo are well known in the
      art. They are stable for long periods and can be delivered to
      cells. A study of 14C-labeled C-60 reported that it is possible to
      form suspensions of C6o in water that are stable for long periods
      (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 4517-4518). However, the authors
      failed to detect the fullerene inside the cells and these
      suspensions containing very low concentrations of fullerene
      (typically 0.1 mg per ml) were inadequate to perform in vivo
      studies, especially toxicity studies. and metabolic fate
      investigations ((J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994, 116, 4517-4518). Other
      vectorisation methods include the formation of inclusion complexes
      with cyclodextrins, calixarenes, tween-20, micelles, liposomes,
      and vesicles; however the Ceo concentrations reached by such
      methods are still very low (1 mg/mL at most) and inadequate to
      perform in vivo toxicity studies. Further, these methods present
      another drawback because they generally necessitate a preliminary
      dissolution step of the fullerene in an organic solvent. Other
      studies proposed the use of Ceo nanoparticles suspended in aqueous
      media to form a colloidal solution so-called nC60, however such
      solutions prpved to be highly toxic because they contain
      impurities linked to the oxidation byproducts of the solvents used
      during their preparation (Adv Exp Med Biol, 2007, 620, 168-80.
      Journal of Nanoscience Letters 2011, 1: 62-63). Another method,
      disclosed in J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 3186-3188 uses
      polyvinyl-pyrrolidone to solubilize C6o; however this vehicle can
      react with fullerene and the formed complex may cause harmful
      effects on mice embryos.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Moussa et al. described in Fullerene Science &amp;
      Technology 1995, 3, 333-342 that partially micronized Ceo
      particles can be incorporated into living human phagocyte cells.
      C6o was directly suspended in the culture media and did not
      exhibit acute toxicity. Moussa et al. also described in Fullerene
      Science &amp; Technology 1996, 4, 21-29 that micronized particles
      of water-insoluble fullerenes may be administered to mice on the
      form of a biocompatible aqueous suspension comprising a surfactant
      (tween 80) and a suspending agent (carboxym ethyl cellulose) which
      stabilizes the suspension. The authors disclosed that C6o is
      non-toxic, can cross cellular membranes and accumulates in liver
      and spleen (Fullerene Science &amp; Technology 1996, 4:21-29). The
      same group headed by F. Moussa have already used Micronized Ceo
      suspensions as free radical scavenger in vivo (Nano Letters 2005,
      5: 2578-2585). However, the effective doses were very high (i.e.
      &gt;1 g/kg of body-weight) and intra peritoneal (i. p.)
      administration was the only route of administration for such
      suspensions. The authors also disclosed that Ceo can solubilize in
      vivo inside lipid droplets (Nano Letters 2005, 5: 2578-2585). This
      result has been confirmed in vitro by other authors whom studied
      Oßo solubility in vegetable oils (Fullerenes, Nanotubes, and
      Carbon Nanostructures, 2007, 15: 311-314. Fullerenes, Nanotubes,
      and Carbon Nanostructures, 2007, 15: 331-339). Stable
      biocompatible compositions comprising water insoluble fullerenes
      dispersed and/or dissolved in a carrier selected from the group
      consisting of fats and oils in an amount ranging from 0.2 to 10%
      by weight relative to the total weight of the composition,
      preferably from 0.1 to 2% by weight, were already proposed by N
      Gharbi and F Moussa for preventing damages caused by free radicals
      (2005/International Application No, PCT/EP2005/004963). However,
      in such compositions the water-insoluble fullerene is not fully
      dissolved and their oral absorption was unknown. Further, large
      aggregates of the administered fullerene can be filtered by liver
      and spleen and confined in their reticulo-endothelial system (RES)
      thus altering the diffusion and biodistribution of Ceo in the
      whole body. Thus, the in vivo use of water-insoluble fullerenes as
      free radical scavengers through delivery thanks to a non-aqueous
      carrier is still not satisfactory.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The inventors of the instant invention have now discovered
      a surprising use of [60]fullerene as agent that promotes an
      increases in the overall length of the expected lifespan of
      mammals.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Compositions comprising [60]fullerene and their use for
      preventing damages caused to metazons by free radicals are
      disclosed in TN Patent No.TN 2011/327 issued Jun. 30, 2011 to
      Moussa et al. which is incorporated herein by reference in its
      entirety.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] It is in view of the above problems that the present
      invention was developed. The main objective of the invention is to
      provide a process or method for extending the longevity of a
      mammal, which comprises a step of administering to said mammal a
      composition comprising an effective amount of [60]fullerene, which
      avoids the drawbacks of the prior art processes, and in
      particular: 1—avoids the use of charge transfer complexes,
      2—avoids the use of organic solvents, and 3—avoids in situ
      aggregation of the administered fullerene. It has now been
      discovered by the inventors that the compositions comprising
      [a]fullerene dissolved in a suitable carrier selected from the
      group consisting of oils and fats proved suitable to achieve the
      aforementioned objectives. In particular, not only they allow
      [60]fullerene to be administered orally or intramuscularly or
      intra peritoneally to prolong the longevity of mammals but they
      are at least several times more active than previous compositions.
      Thus, a first embodiment of the instant invention comprises a
      stable biocompatible composition comprising (a) a carrier selected
      from the group consisting of fats and oils; and (b) [60]fullerene,
      wherein [60]fullerene is almost dissolved in said carrier. The
      embodiment is further drawn to compositions, in which
      [60]fullerene is dissolved in the carrier. Another embodiment of
      the instant invention is a method to prolong the longevity of
      mammals, which comprises a step of administering to said mammal a
      stable biocompatible composition comprising an effective amount of
      [60]fullerene dissolved in a carrier selected from the group
      consisting of fats and oils. In a preferred embodiment, the
      invention is drawn to a method of prolonging the longevity of
      mammals, which comprises a step of adding to food or any
      nutritional composition a stable composition comprising an
      effective amount of [60]fullerene dispersed in a carrier selected
      from the group consisting of fats and oils.<br>

      </b>[0018] Free radicals are constantly formed in vivo. Some of
      these molecules are physiologically useful, but they can also
      result in pathological oxidative stress to cells and tissues.
      Endogenous defences include both antioxidants and repairing
      systems. However, excess production of free radicals, their
      production in inappropriate relative amounts or deficiencies in
      endogenous defences can have deleterious effects. Free radicals
      can cause oxidative damage to lipids, DNA, bio molecules, rises in
      the concentration of intracellular calcium, as well as activation
      of proteases, nucleases and protein kinases. Considerable evidence
      supports the view that oxidative damage involving free radicals
      occurs in most, if not all, human diseases. Oxidative stress is
      now recognized as an important contributor to the development of
      many human diseases including liver fibrosis,
      ischemia-reperfusion, atherosclerosis, several neurological
      disorders and age-related cancer as well as to process of ageing.
      Thus antioxidants and systems that can protect against oxidative
      stress are needed to maintain health and prolong the expected
      lifespan in metazoans. This has led to attempts to develop
      additional antioxidants to supplement the antioxidant defences of
      cells as potential therapeutic agents. Diet-derived antioxidants
      and a number of small molecules that can scavenge free radicals as
      well as super oxide dismutase-mimetics and chelators of transition
      metal ions were proposed as potential therapeutic agents against
      oxidative stress. Compositions according to the invention
      comprising [60]fullerene have been found to exhibit highly
      efficient antioxidant properties in vivo. The fullerene core, i.e.
      the fullerene skeleton without lateral substituants, used in the
      practice of this invention comprise clustered carbon structures
      generally spherical in shape and having a carbon content of 60
      carbon atoms. Typically, [60]fullerene according to the invention
      is present in an amount ranging from 0.01 to 0.0.08% by weight
      relative to the total weight of the composition, preferably 0.08%
      by weight. [60]fullerene is preferably dissolved in the carrier,
      i.e. the composition can be filtered through a 0.2 pm filter. The
      stable, biocompatible compositions according to the invention
      comprise a carrier selected from the group consisting of fats and
      oils; and [60]fullerene, wherein said fullerene is mostly
      dissolved in said carrier. The carrier used in the present
      invention is a pharmaceutically acceptable and biocompatible
      carrier, selected from the group consisting of fats and oils. The
      fat or oil may be any natural or synthetic fat or oil suitable for
      administration to a mammal. They are not particularly restricted
      inasmuch as they are components which can be used in
      pharmaceutical preparations or in foods. Oils and fats can be
      hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated. They are used at a solid,
      a semisolid, or a liquid state. Vegetable and animal fats and oils
      are preferred, vegetable fats and oils are most preferred. Oils
      and fats include, without limitation fatty acid esters, fatty
      acids, fatty alcohols and fatty alcohol esters. Synthetic lipids
      can also be used. Fatty acids, as defined herein, are intended to
      mean aliphatic monocarboxylic acids having a chain of 4 to 40
      carbon atoms, which may be branched or unbranched, saturated or
      unsaturated, cyclic or acyclic. Fatty acids may be natural or
      synthetic, polyunsaturated, mono-unsaturated or saturated. Natural

      alkali metal salts (sodium salts, potassium salts, etc.), alkaline
      earth metal salts (calcium, magnesium salts etc.)] can also be
      employed. Fatty acid esters are preferably esters of fatty acid as
      defined hereinabove with C-1-C40 aliphatic or aromatic alcohols,
      preferably aliphatic, saturated or unsaturated, straight-chain or
      branched-chain, cyclic or acyclic. Alcohols can be polyols, having
      preferably up to five hydroxyl groups. Examples of fatty acid
      esters include, but are not limited to, triglycerides i.e.
      tri-esters of glycerol with fatty acids cited above, sterids i.e.
      esters of sterols with fatty acids cited above, the group

      include, but are not limited to, butter, cocoa butter, theobroma,
      peanut butter, lard, beef fat, chicken fat, horse fat, lanolin and
      lanolin derivatives. Oils and fats can be polyunsaturated such as
      corn, soybean, safflower oils, or saturated, such as palm, coconut

      Preferred carriers according to the invention are butter, cocoa
      butter, peanut butter, olive oil, soybean oil, cod-liver oil and
      liquid paraffin. As defined above, carriers may be used each alone
      or in a combination of two or more species. [60]fullerene is
      dissolved in the carrier, depending on the nature of the carrier.
      Some carriers are able to dissolve substantial amounts of
      water-insoluble fullerenes (several mg/g of carrier). In one
      embodiment, at least 0.8 mg of fullerene is dissolved per ml of
      the carrier (the carrier being a liquid). As an example, it is
      possible to dissolve a total weight up to 1 mg of C60 per g of
      olive or soybean oil in less than one week. The compositions
      according to the invention may be pharmaceutical compositions
      comprising the fullerene in a therapeutically effective amount.
      Preferably, said fullerene can protect against biologically
      reactive radical species, which means chemicals that are free
      radicals or contribute to the generation of free radicals.
      Generally, the biologically reactive radical species are generated
      from O2 or H2O2. Thus, the invention also concerns a method to
      prolong the longevity of a mammal, which comprises a step of
      administering to said mammal a stable biocompatible composition as
      defined hereinabove. [60]fullerene, when dissolved in the carriers
      of the present invention, can be administered to mammals and this
      compound is well absorbed by said mammals. Generally, the said
      fullerene is administered in an amount of at least 0.1 mg/kg of
      body weight per day. According to the method of the invention, the
      inventive compositions may be administered orally,
      intramuscularly, subcutaneously, intra dermally or intra
      peritoneally, rectally by suppositories or sublingually. For oral
      ingestion by a mammal to be treated, the carrier is preferably an
      edible carrier. In at least one embodiment, said composition is
      administered in a pure form. In another embodiment, it is
      administered in the form of an emulsion in water. In another
      embodiment the fullerene is administered as a labile
      C6o-derivative derivative that can deliver Ceo after
      administration. The compositions of the instant invention can be
      in any liquid or solid conventional pharmaceutical formulation.
      The carrier enables the fullerene to be formulated as tablets,
      pills, dragees, capsules, liposome, pomade, ointment, cream ,
      lotion, emulsions, gels, syrups, slurries and the like. The
      compositions of the present invention are preferably presented for
      oral administration to mammals in unit dosage forms, such as
      tablets, capsules, and oral solutions, containing suitable
      quantities of [60]fullerene. The compositions may be sterilized
      and/or may contain some adjuvants such as preservatives,
      stabilizers, acidity regulators, natural or synthetic flavour,
      anti-foaming agents, viscosity-control agents, emulsifiers, salts
      for varying the osmotic pressure and/or other buffers. In
      addition, compositions may contain other pharmaceutically active
      agents. The level of free radicals and reactive oxygen species in
      mammal cells decreases following treatment as compared to the
      level of reactive oxygen species in a cell that has not been
      contacted with a composition according to the invention. Indeed,
      [60]fullerene according to the invention can act as antioxidant
      and supplement the antioxidant defences of cells. That means they
      inhibit oxidation or inhibit reactions promoted by reactive oxygen
      species. Physiologically relevant reactive oxygen species, which
      contribute to the generation of free radicals, include hydrogen
      peroxide, super oxide anion, and the like. The protective method
      of the invention reduces cell damage and death, and thus generally
      maintains the health of treated mammals. Further, the inventors
      discovered that [60]fullerene administered as biocompatible
      composition as described herein—1) can be absorbed after oral
      administration (FIG. 2);—2) they can react inside the liver with
      vitamin A (retinol) and esters thereof following a
      Diels-Alder-like reaction without any toxic effect (New J Chem,
      1998, 989-992);—3) they are eliminated through the bile ducts
      (Nano Letters 2005, 5 (12): 2578-2585); and—4) despite the large
      amounts administered, no acute or sub-acute toxicity could be
      observed in mice and rats. No behaviour or growth disorder could
      be observed in treated animals either, which can be seen on FIG.
      1. The latter shows growth rate of three groups (n=6) of rats
      which received weekly per os 1 ml of olive oil containing 0.8 mg
      of Ceo or 1 ml of olive oil only or 1 ml of water only. The in
      vivo new properties of [60]fullerene are due to fullerenes
      themselves and/or to the fullerene-retinol and fullerene-retinyl
      ester adducts formed after administration inside the liver. Also
      disclosed herein is a method for preparing a composition according
      to the present invention, comprising a carrier and particles of
      [60]fullerene. Said method comprises the steps of:—(a) Charging a
      milling vessel with the fullerene, the carrier and balls, said
      milling vessel and balls being made out of any biocompatible metal
      or polymer;—(b) Agitating the mixture resulting from step (a)
      until a homogeneous dissolution is obtained; and—(c) Sterilizing
      the composition resulting from step (b) by filtration. Direct
      mechanical milling in the carrier presents the advantages to
      accelerate the dissolution. Said method comprises the steps
      of:—(a) Charging a milling vessel with the fullerene, the fat or
      oil and balls, said milling vessel and balls being made out of any
      biocompatible metal or polymer;—(b) Agitating the mixture
      resulting from step (a) until complete homogenization of the
      solution;—(c) Agitating the composition resulting from step (b)
      until complete dissolution of the fullerene; and—(d) Sterilizing
      by filtration the composition resulting from step (c). Other than
      in the operating examples, or where otherwise indicated, all
      numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions,
      and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be
      understood as being modified in all instances by the term “about.”
      Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical
      parameters set forth in the following specification and attached
      claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired
      properties sought to be obtained by the present disclosure. At the
      very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the
      doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical
      parameter should be construed in light of the number of
      significant digits and ordinary rounding approaches.
      Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting
      forth the broad scope of the disclosure are approximations, the
      numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported
      as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently
      contain certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard
      deviation found in their respective testing measurements. The
      invention is further illustrated by the examples described below.
      These examples are meant to illustrate the i nvention and are not
      to be interpreted as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b>General Considerations</b><b><br>
      </b>[0019] C60 (Purity: 99.98%) was purchased from Term USA (Fort
      Bragg, Calif., USA). Its characterization and its purity were
      assessed by HPLC, UV, C-NMR, and Mass Spectrometry. No impurity
      could be observed. It was used without further purification as
      well as after sublimation. All the other reagents were analytical
      grade and were purchased from Sigma (St Louis, Mo.). Animals
      received human care and the study protocols complied with general
      guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Male Wistar
      rats (Charles River, France) were housed by groups of 3 in
      polypropylene cages at constant temperature (22° C.) and humidity
      (60%) and with a 12 h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard diet ad
      libitum. All rats were allowed to acclimate to this facility for
      at least one week before being used in the experiments. At the end
      of the experiment, body weights were determined and the animals
      were sacrificed under the same conditions by bleeding through the
      thoracic aorta after sodium pentobarbital (1.0 mL/kg of body
      weight) anaesthesia.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Biochemical tests, Cso determinations and statistics were
      processed as previously described in Nano Letters 2005, 5 (12):
      2578-2585.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Direct Dissolution of [60]Fullerene in a Vegetable Oil</b><b><br>
      </b>[0021] In the stainless steel milling vessels of a
      Pulverisette 7 (Fritsch, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) or a similar
      device, add 8 mg of [60]fullerene and 10 mL of olive oil or 10 g
      of butter and 6 stainless steel balls (8 mm of diameter) (the
      milling vessels and the balls can be made out of any biocompatible
      metal or polymer such as stainless steel, tempered chrome steel,
      silicon nitride, corundum, tungsten carbide, agate, oxide of
      zirconium etc). Agitate the mixture during several hours (at 600
      rpm for instance) until complete dissolution. The resulting
      homogenous solution or paste is then ready for use for oral
      administration or by any route of administration after appropriate
      sterilization. Sterilization may be achieved by filtration under
      vacuum (pore size: 0.2 µ?L). The sterilized composition is stable
      for at least 1 month. It is also possible to dissolve
      water-insoluble fullerenes in natural or mineral oils without
      stirring however the dissolution may be time consuming (up to
      several days at room temperature). Therefore, the former protocol
      is preferred. The fullerene concentration in compositions
      according to the invention can be determined by HPLC after
      adequate dilution in mobile phase as described previously (J.
      Chromatogr. B 1997, 696: 153-159).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Pharmacokinetics and Biodistribution of an Oily Solution
        after Oral and Intra-Peritoneal Administration in Rats</b><b><br>
      </b>[0022] Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out with male
      Wistar rats (weighing 200-220 g). Rats were housed in individual
      cages and maintained in an air-conditioned room (22-25° C.) on a
      12 h light/dark cycle with water and food available. The rats were
      acclimated for 7 days and they were fasted overnight but with
      access to water, before treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Under general anesthesia, a catheter was introduced into
      the rat right jugular vein, positioned subcutaneously with the tip
      in the inter-scapular region. The prepared rats were then allowed
      to recover for 24 h, and the blood catheters were flushed with
      0.9% NaCl solution containing 20 I U/ml of heparin to avoid
      possible clot obstruction. Before Ceo administration, the rats
      were fasted overnight but with access to water. The same single
      dose of Ceo (4 mg/kg) was delivered orally, by a gavages needle,
      or intra-peritoneally to two groups of three rats. Blood (0.20 ml)
      was withdrawn via the canular prior to dosing (f=0) and at 15, 30,
      60 min and then at 2, 4, 8, 10, 12, 24 and 48 h post-dosing.
      Antithrombin heparin (20 IU/m1) was added in each blood sample.
      After each blood collection 0.20 ml of sterile 0.9% NaCl solution
      were injected to the animal, to avoid hypovolemia. The rats were
      sacrificed 48 h after eo administration for organ collection
      (livers, spleens, and brains).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] It was now discovered by the inventors that:—1) Soluble Ceo
      is absorbed and eliminated after either intraperitoneal or oral
      administrations. Table 1 represents the main pharmacokinetic
      parameters; 2—the maximal concentrations (Cmax) are reached 4 and
      8 hours after i.p. and oral administrations, respectively ( FIG.
      2); 3—the maximal concentration after i.p. administration
      (1.47±0.15 pg/ml) is higher than that after oral administration
      (0.52±0.16 Mg/ml). Consequently, the area under the curve (AUC) is
      about 5 times larger when Ceo is administered by i.p. route as
      compared to oral route. Although these results do not allow
      determining the bioavailability of Ceo, they clearly show that a
      non-negligible % of the orally administered dose is absorbed as
      compared to the i.p. administered one ( FIGS. 2); and—3) the
      fullerene is well distributed in the whole body, in particular it
      can cross the brain barrier (table 2).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Ceo-Induced Protection of the Liver against Acute Toxicity
        of Carbon Tetrachloride (CCU) in Rats</b><b><br>
      </b>[0025] Carbon tetrachloride is a classical hepatotoxicant that
      causes rapid liver damage progressing from steatosis to
      centrilobular necrosis. CCU intoxication in rodents is an
      important model for elucidation of the mechanism of action of
      hepatotoxic effects such as fatty degeneration, fibrosis,
      hepatocellular death, and carcinogenicity. These effects are
      consistent with the known induced metabolic activation of CCl4 to
      reactive intermediates, including CCl3? and CCl02' free radicals,
      and mobilization of intracellular calcium. Kupffer cells (liver
      resident macrophages) participate in the mechanism of toxicity of
      CCl4 in vivo by release of chemoattractants for neutrophils and a
      series of chemical mediators (cytokines). Both expression and
      synthesis of these cytokines are mainly modulated through
      redox-sensitive reactions. Further, involvement of reactive oxygen
      species and lipid peroxydation products can be demonstrated in
      other fundamental events of hepatic fibrogenosis, like activation
      of hepatic stellate cells (HSC: liver resident nonparenchymal
      cells also referred to as fat-storing or perisinusoidal cells,
      lipocytes and Ito cells). In a previous work, the effects of
      C60-pretreatments on acute carbon tetrachloride intoxication in
      rats, a classical model for studying free-radical-mediated liver
      injury was reported. The results obtained by the authors leaded by
      F Moussa (Nano Letters 2005, 5 (12), 2578-2585) showed that
      aqueous C6o suspensions not only have no acute or subacute
      toxicity in rodents but they also protect their livers in a
      dose-dependent manner against free-radical damage. The most
      effective dose of C6o reported in the latter paper was about 2.5
      g/kg of body-weight and was administered intra-peritoneally and
      the better protection was obtained at day 14 after administration.
      It was now discovered by the inventors that the fullerene is about
      100 times more active it is administered in solution than in
      suspension, and the effect is more rapid (24 hours after
      administration) as compared to the results published previously in
      the same experimental model (Nano Letters 2005, 5: 2578-2585).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Ceo Prolongs the Longevity in Rats without Chronic Toxicity</b><b><br>
      </b>[0026] The rats were housed one per cage and acclimated for 14
      days, before dosing. Three groups of 10 rats (10 months old,
      weighing 495±31 g) were administered daily for one week, then
      weekly until the end of the second month and then every two weeks
      until the end of the 7th month, by gavages with 1 ml of water or
      olive oil or Ceo dissolved in olive oil (0.8 mg/ml), respectively.
      The rats were weighed before each dosing. Routine observations
      following official recommendations (EC Commission Directive
      2004/73/EC of 29 Apr. 2004 Adapting to Technical Progress for the
      Twenty-Ninth Time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the
      Approximation of the Laws, Regulations and Administrative
      Provisions Relating to the Classification, Packaging and Labeling
      of Dangerous Substances. O.J. No. L1522004) were made on all
      animals inside and outside the cage once a day throughout the
      study for signs of departure from normal activity, morbidity and
      mortality.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] This experiment was initiated after observing that Ceo is
      absorbed through oral administration. To study the chronic

      always equal to 100% for the rats treated with C6o-dissolved in
      olive oil, 17% for the rats treated with olive oil, and 0% for the

      Fullerene is mixed with organic solvent to achieved homogenous

      appearance of resonance state in system ultrasonic emitter-above
      prepared mixture is found. The mixture is then affected by
      ultrasonic emission at thus found frequency for at least 15 min at
      40-70°C. Ultrasonic emissions with sinusoidal, rectangular,

      from those containing unsaturated carboxylic acid, e.g. oleic,
      linoleic, linolenic, arachidonic acid, or mixture thereof;
      sea-buckthorn oil, cedar oil, linseed oil, olive oil, or mixture
      thereof; cod-liver oil, animal fat, or mixture thereof; citric,
      orange, cypress essential oils, turpentine oil, camphor oil, or
      mixture thereof. ^ EFFECT: simplified fullerene dissolution
      procedure and extended range of nontoxic effective solvents
      compatible with biological structures...<br>
      <br>
      A method is known for the preparation of fullerene solutions in
      solvents, including those tolerant with respect to biological
      structures (see RF patent No. 2198136 IPC 01/01 B 31/02, published
      October 16, 2001), which coincides with the claimed decision on
      the largest number of essential features and adopted for
      prototype.<br>
      <br>
      A known method for the preparation of fullerene solutions
      comprises mixing the starting components by introducing fullerenes
      into a volume of a solvent, which is selected from an unsaturated
      fatty acid or a mixture of such acids, natural oil or natural fat,
      mineral oil, and a mixture of these components is prepared to
      obtain a homogeneous mass, and dissolution on the composition is
      effected by ultrasound and electromagnetic microwave radiation,
      while the parameters of ultrasonic radiation with a frequency of 2
      5-40 kHz and a rectangular waveform with a maximum input power
      density of 50-100 mW / cm3, and electromagnetic microwave
      radiation parameters are selected with a wavelength of 9.4 mm, a
      maximum input power density of up to 1 W / cm3 at a pressure in
      the reaction volume of 50- 74 bar and a temperature in this volume
      of 80-150 ° C and an exposure time of 10 to 30 minutes. As an
      unsaturated fatty acid take oleic acid, and the mixture of acids
      is prepared from oleic and arachidonic acids, as an oil, sea
      buckthorn is used, and the mixture is prepared by adding cedar oil
      to it.<br>
      <br>
      As fat, fish oil is taken, and the mixture is prepared by adding
      animal fat to it. Mineral oil is mixed with synthetic oil before
      introducing fullerenes into this mixture.<br>
      <br>
      The known prototype method allows the preparation of fullerene
      solutions in non-toxic biocompatible solvents that can be used as
      ingredients in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and cosmetic
      compositions.<br>
      <br>
      However, the known method for producing fullerene solutions is
      rather complicated in the implementation, since it requires the
      simultaneous application of ultrasound and electromagnetic
      microwave radiation at high temperature (80-150 ° C).<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention was to develop a method for
      dissolving fullerenes that would simplify the process of
      dissolution of fullerene, and also expand the range of nontoxic
      effective solvents compatible with biological structures for use
      in medicines and therapeutic cosmetic products.<br>
      <br>
      This object is achieved by a method in accordance with the
      invention, comprising mixing the fullerene to obtain a homogeneous
      mass with an organic solvent selected from the group: an
      unsaturated carboxylic acid or a mixture of such acids, an oil
      containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid, or a mixture of such
      oils, natural fat containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid or a
      mixture of such fats, vegetable essential oil or a mixture of such
      oils, finding the resonant frequency of ultrasonic radiation that
      provides the appearance of a resonance state in Istemi: an
      ultrasonic emitter - the volume of said mixture, and then
      subjecting said mixture to ultrasonic radiation frequency found
      for at least 15 minutes at a temperature of 40-70 &amp; deg; C.<br>
      <br>
      You can use ultrasonic radiation with a sinusoidal pulse shape,
      with a rectangular pulse shape, with a sawtooth pulse shape.<br>
      <br>
      As the unsaturated carboxylic acid, an acid selected from the
      group of oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, arachidonic
      acid can be introduced.<br>
      <br>
      As an oil containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid, a mineral oil
      or a synthetic oil can be used, as well as a natural vegetable
      oil.<br>
      <br>
      As a natural vegetable oil containing unsaturated carboxylic acid,
      it is possible to introduce an oil selected from the group: sea
      buckthorn oil, cedar oil, linseed oil, olive oil.<br>
      As natural fat containing unsaturated carboxylic acid, it is
      possible to use fish or animal fat, for example badger fat.<br>
      <br>
      Unsaturated carboxylic acids, which are fullerenes dissolving
      agents, are included in all known vegetable oils, in fish oil and
      in fat of mammals.<br>
      <br>
      As a vegetable essential oil, it is possible to introduce an oil
      selected from the group: orange essential oil, lemon essential
      oil, cypress essential oil, eucalyptus essential oil, camphor oil,
      turpentine turpentine.<br>
      <br>
      Vegetable essential oils have the same property necessary for the
      formation of a suspension - they are hydrophobic substances and
      when dispersed in water they form micelles. At the same time,
      there is no chemical interaction between them and water, which
      causes a change in their chemical structure.<br>
      <br>
      The research conducted by the authors showed that the effect of
      resonant frequency on the fullerene and solvent mixture by
      ultrasonic radiation provides a significant increase in the
      efficiency of the fullerene dissolution process, which makes it
      possible to avoid additional processing of the mixture by
      electromagnetic microwave radiation, and also to lower the
      temperature at which ultrasonic resonance frequency 80-150 ° C to
      40-70 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      The use of natural vegetable essential oil as a solvent also
      allowed to expand the spectrum of nontoxic effective solvents,
      since natural vegetable essential oils are nontoxic and less
      flammable in comparison with conventionally used solvents.<br>
      <br>
      The effect on the mixture of fullerene and solvent by ultrasonic
      radiation of a resonance frequency of less than 15 minutes at a
      temperature of less than 40 ° C leads to a significant decrease in
      the efficiency of the fullerene dissolution process. When the
      extraction process is carried out at a temperature above 70 ° C,
      there is a risk of ignition of the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      The obtained solutions contain fullerenes in an amount up to 65 mg
      / cm3, do not give a precipitate, retain high biological activity
      with prolonged storage (for at least a year) and can be used as
      components of medicines and cosmetics (creams, lotions, shampoos,
      ointments etc.).<br>
      <br>
      The claimed method for extracting fullerenes from
      fullerene-containing soot is explained in the drawings, where<br>

      <br>
      Table 1 shows the solubility of fullerenes in some solvents.<br>
      <br>
      The claimed method is carried out as follows.<br>
      <br>
      Based on the required concentration of fullerene in solution, the
      appropriate amount of fullerene and organic solvent is measured.
      Next, the fullerene is mixed with the organic solvent until a
      homogeneous mass is obtained. Depending on the purpose of the
      fullerene solution, the organic solvent is selected from the
      group: an unsaturated carboxylic acid or a mixture of such acids,
      an oil containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid, or a mixture of
      such oils, natural fat containing an unsaturated carboxylic acid,
      or a mixture of such fats, vegetable essential oil or a mixture
      such oils. Further, a resonant frequency of ultrasonic radiation
      is obtained, which ensures the appearance of a resonance state in
      the system: the ultrasonic radiator is the volume of the prepared
      mixture. Then, the mixture of fullerene and organic solvent is
      exposed to ultrasonic radiation of the resonant frequency found
      for at least 15 minutes at a temperature of 40-70 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting solutions contain fullerene in an amount of up to 54
      mg / ml and perfectly mix in cosmetic and drug compositions with
      the rest of the ingredients, without precipitating and maintaining
      a high level of biological activity. It was found that the
      dispersion and dissolution are not accompanied by the destruction
      of fullerene molecules.<br>
      Below are some results of the study of the solubility of
      fullerenes in organic solvents.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1. The solubility of fullerene C60 in linoleic acid was
      investigated. Linoleic acid (grade OCT) in volume of 20 ml was
      placed in a transparent quartz tube. After that, fullerene C60 was
      added to linoleic acid with a purity of 99.5% in discrete portions
      of 5 mg and thoroughly mixed. After each addition of fullerene was
      added, the mixture was ultrasounded using a submerged cylindrical
      radiator, the frequency of the ultrasound generator being tuned
      such that a resonance was observed in the system being treated,
      the ultrasound emitter. The processing time by ultrasound after
      each addition to the solution of each new portion was 5 minutes,
      the resonance frequency was 28.5 kHz, the temperature was 50 ° C.
      This procedure was repeated until after the introduction of the
      next batch of fullerene and ultrasonic action at the bottom of the
      tube did not appear the precipitate of the non-dissolved
      fullerene. The solution was then centrifuged at 20,000 g (where g
      is gravity acceleration) and then filtered through a membrane
      filter with a pore diameter of 0.2 µm from Sartorius (Germany).<br>
      After filtration, a sample was taken for spectrophotometric
      measurements and a 10 ml sample to determine the specific
      solubility.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 shows the absorption spectrum of C60 fullerene in the
      ultraviolet region, in which characteristic absorption bands with
      maxima near 280 nm and 330 nm are present. The spectrum of the C60
      solution in linoleic acid and in ethanol was measured with respect
      to linoleic acid in ethanol at a dilution of 1: 100 on a
      spectrophotometer Spectroscan II from LKB (Sweden). A 10 ml sample
      was placed in a container of known weight measured on an
      analytical balance of MC210S from Sartorius (Germany) of the first
      accuracy class with a sampling rate of 0.01 mg and then evaporated
      at 235 ° C to a constant weight measured on the same weights,
      after which the specific maximum concentration of the dissolved
      fullerene was determined. For linoleic acid, this value was 34.2
      mg / ml.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2. A procedure similar to that described in Example 1 was
      followed, but as a solvent, flax seed oil was used, and the
      exposure parameters used were: resonant frequency of the
      ultrasonic generator 34.6 kHz, temperature 55 ° C. Centrifugation
      and filtration were carried out as in Example 1. A sample was then
      taken for spectrophotometry and a sample of 10 ml for evaporation
      at a temperature of 250 ° C. The transmission spectrum of the C60
      solution in linseed oil was removed in the infrared region by the
      method of violated total internal reflection (FTIR) on a FTIM 1202
      Fourier spectrophotometer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows the IRR spectrum of the C60 solution in flax oil and
      the differential spectrum obtained by subtracting the spectrum of
      pure linseed oil from the spectrum of the fullerene C60 solution
      in linseed oil. 3, all 4 active absorption bands characteristic of
      the C60 molecule are present in this spectrum, with maxima near
      1430-1449 cm-1, 1170-1180 cm-1, 580 cm-1 and 530 cm-1.
