      <br>
      This squat concrete building was once a chicken coop, but now it's
      part of a farm with an entirely different kind of livestock —
      millions of cockroaches.<br>
      <br>
      Inside, squirming masses of the reddish-brown insects dart between
      sheets of corrugated metal and egg cartons that have been tied
      together to provide the kind of dark hiding places they favor.<br>
      <br>
      Wang Fuming kneels down and pulls out one of the nests.
      Unaccustomed to the light, the roaches scurry about, a few heading
      straight up his arm toward his short-sleeve shirt.<br>
      <br>
      "Nothing to be afraid of," Wang counsels visitors who are
      shrinking back into the hallway, where stray cockroaches cling to
      a ceiling that's perilously close overhead.<br>
      <br>
      Although cockroaches evoke a visceral dread for most people, Wang
      looks at them fondly as his fortune — and his future.<br>
      <br>
      The 43-year-old businessman is the largest cockroach producer in
      China (and thus probably in the world), with six farms populated
      by an estimated 10 million cockroaches. He sells them to producers
      of Asian medicine and to cosmetic companies that value the insects
      as a cheap source of protein as well as for the cellulose-like
      substance on their wings.<br>
      <br>
      The favored breed for this purpose is the Periplaneta americana,
      or American cockroach, a reddish-brown insect that grows to about
      1.6 inches long and, when mature, can fly, as opposed to the
      smaller, darker, wingless German cockroach.<br>
      <br>
      Since Wang got into the business in 2010, the price of dried
      cockroaches has increased tenfold, from about $2 a pound to as
      much as $20, as manufacturers of traditional medicine stockpile
      pulverized cockroach powder.<br>
      <br>
      "I thought about raising pigs, but with traditional farming, the
      profit margins are very low," Wang said. "With cockroaches, you
      can invest 20 yuan and get back 150 yuan," or $3.25 for a return
      of $11.<br>
      <br>
      China has about 100 cockroach farms, and new ones are opening
      almost as fast as the prolific critters breed. But even among
      Chinese, the industry was little known until August, when a
      million cockroaches got out of a farm in neighboring Jiangsu
      province. The Great Escape made headlines around China and beyond,
      evoking biblical images of swarming locusts.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Big moneymaker</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Business is booming at the Shandong Xin Da Ground Beetle Farm.<br>
      <br>
      Only the prospect of all those lost earnings would faze Wang, a
      compact man with a wisp of a mustache and wire-rim glasses who
      looks like a scientist, but has no more than a high school
      education. After graduating, he went to work in a tire factory.<br>
      <br>
      "I felt I would never get anywhere in life at the factory and I
      wanted to start a business," he said.<br>
      <br>
      As a boy he had liked collecting insects, so he started with
      scorpions and beetles, both used in traditional medicine and
      served as a delicacy. One batch of his beetle eggs turned out to
      be contaminated with cockroach eggs.<br>
      <br>
      "I was accidentally raising cockroaches and then I realized they
      were the easiest and most profitable," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The start-up costs are minimal — Wang bought only eggs, a run-down
      abandoned chicken coop and the roofing tile. Notoriously hearty,
      roaches aren't susceptible to the same diseases as farm animals.
      As for feeding them, cockroaches are omnivores, though they favor
      rotten vegetables. Wang feeds his brood with potato and pumpkin
      peelings discarded from nearby restaurants.<br>
      <br>
      Killing them is easy too: Just scoop or vacuum them out of their
      nests and dunk them in a big vat of boiling water. Then they're
      dried in the sun like chile peppers.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps understandably, the cockroach business ("special farming,"
      as it is euphemistically called) is a fairly secretive industry.
      Wang's farm, for instance, operates in an agribusiness industrial
      park under an elevated highway. The sign at the front gate simply
      reads Jinan Hualu Feed Co.<br>
      <br>
      Some companies that use cockroaches don't like to advertise their
      "secret ingredient." And the farmers themselves are wary of
      neighbors who might not like a cockroach farm in their backyard.<br>
      <br>
      "We try to keep a low profile," said Liu Yusheng, head of the
      Shandong Insect Industry Assn., the closest thing there is to a
      trade organization. "The government is tacitly allowing us to do
      what we do, but if there is too much attention, or if cockroach
      farms are going into residential areas, there could be trouble."<br>
      <br>
      Liu worries about the rapid growth of an industry with too many
      inexperienced players and too little oversight. In 2007, a million
      Chinese lost $1.2 billion when a firm promoting ant farming turned
      out to be a Ponzi scheme and went bankrupt.<br>
      <br>
      "This is not like raising regular farm animals or vegetables where
      the Agricultural Ministry knows who is supposed to regulate it.
      Nobody knows who is in charge here," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The low start-up costs make raising cockroaches an appealing
      business for wannabe entrepreneurs, who can buy cockroach eggs and
      complete how-to kits from promoters.<br>
      <br>
      "People laughed at me when I started, but I always thought that
      cockroaches would bring me wealth," said Zou Hui, 40, who quit her
      job at a knitting factory in 2008 after seeing a television
      program about raising cockroaches.<br>
      <br>
      Wang Fuming, at his farm in Jinan, is the largest cockroach
      producer in China (and thus probably in the world), with six farms
      populated by an estimated 10 million cockroaches.<br>
      <br>
      It's not exactly a fortune, but the $10,000 she brings in annually
      selling cockroaches is decent money for her hometown in rural
      Sichuan province, and won her an award last year from local
      government as an "Expert in Getting Wealthy."<br>
      <br>
      "Now I'm teaching four other families," Zou said. "They want to
      get rich like me."<br>
      <br>
      But inexperienced farmers can get into trouble, as Wang Pengsheng
      (no relation to fellow roach farmer Wang) found out after his
      cockroaches staged the Great Escape.<br>
      <br>
      He had opened his farm just six months earlier in a newly
      constructed building that municipal code officials complained was
      too close to protected watershed land. At noon on Aug. 20, while
      workers were out for lunch, a demolition crew knocked down the
      building. The roaches made a run for it.<br>
      <br>
      "They didn't know I had cockroaches in there. They wouldn't have
      demolished the building like that if there were cockroaches that
      would get out," Wang Pengsheng said in a telephone interview.<br>
      <br>
      After discovering the flattened building and homeless roaches
      scurrying among the rubble, he tried to corral the escapees but
      was unsuccessful. He called in local health officials, who helped
      him exterminate the roaches. Wang said he has received about
      $8,000 in compensation from local government and hopes to use the
      money to rebuild his farm elsewhere.<br>
      <br>
      At least five pharmaceutical companies are using cockroaches for
      traditional Chinese medicine. Research is underway in China (and
      South Korea) on the use of pulverized cockroaches for treating
      baldness, AIDS and cancer and as a vitamin supplement. South
      Korea's Jeonnam Province Agricultural Research Institute and
      China's Dali University College of Pharmacy have published papers
      on the anti-carcinogenic properties of the cockroach.<br>
      <br>
      Li Shunan, a 78-year-old professor of traditional medicine from
      the southwestern province of Yunnan who is considered the
      godfather of cockroach research, said he discovered in the 1960s
      that ethnic minorities near the Vietnamese border were using a
      cockroach paste to treat bone tuberculosis.<br>
      <br>
      "Cockroaches are survivors," Li said. "We want to know what makes
      them so strong — why they can even resist nuclear effects."<br>
      <br>
      Liu Yusheng, head of the Shandong Insect Industry Assn. eats fried
      cockroaches. Liu worries about the rapid growth of an industry
      with too many inexperienced players and too little oversight.<br>
      <br>
      Li reels off an impressive, if implausible, list of health claims:
      "I lost my hair years ago. I made a spray of cockroaches, applied
      it on my scalp and it grew back. I've used it as a facial mask and
      people say I haven't changed at all over the years.<br>
      <br>
      "Cockroaches are very tasty too."<br>
      <br>
      Many farmers are hoping to boost demand by promoting cockroaches
      in fish and animal feed and as a delicacy for humans.<br>
      <br>
      Chinese aren't quite as squeamish as most Westerners about insects
      — after all, people here still keep crickets as pets.<br>
      <br>
      In Jinan, Wang Fuming and his wife, who run the farm together,
      seem genuinely fond of their cockroaches and a little hurt that
      others don't feel affection.<br>
      <br>
      "What is disgusting about them?" Li Wanrong, Wang's wife, asked as
      a roach scurried around her black leather pumps. "Look how
      beautiful they are. So shiny!"<br>
      <br>
      Over lunch at a restaurant down the block from his farm, Wang
      placed a plate of fried cockroaches seasoned with salt on the
      table along with more conventional cuisine, and proceeded to
      nibble a few with his chopsticks. He expressed disapproval that
      visiting journalists refused to sample the roaches.<br>
      <br>
      On saying goodbye at the end of the day, he added a final
      rejoinder.<br>
      <br>
      "You will regret your whole life not trying them."<br>

      Healthy portion ... cockroach farms in China are trying to produce
      enough insects to satisfy demand for food markets and
      pharmaceutical companies there.<br>
      <br>
      The correct way to eat a cockroach, at least in this corner of
      northern China, is to fry it not once but twice in a wok of
      smoking hot oil.<br>
      <br>
      "The second time makes the shell crispy and the inside succulent,"
      said 43-year-old Wang Fuming, as he tipped a bowl of freshly
      harvested bugs, one or two of their legs still twitching, into the
      sizzling pan.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Wang is the leading cockroach farmer in Shandong province, with
      more than 22 million of the insects living in a series of
      nondescript, concrete bunkers in the suburbs of Jinan.<br>
      <br>
      After cooking, Mr Wang gently ladled them onto a plate, their
      bodies plumped with the oil and their wings slightly spread,
      before sprinkling a packet of instant noodle powder – pickled
      cabbage flavour – over the dish.<br>
      <br>
      "It would be better if we had some chilli," he apologised.<br>
      <br>
      The cockroach, whose innards resemble cottage cheese, has an
      earthy taste, with a slight twinge of ammonia. But they have
      become popular in China not for their taste, but for their
      medicinal benefits.<br>
      <br>
      "They really are a miracle drug," said Liu Yusheng, a professor at
      the Shandong Agricultural university and the head of Shandong
      province's Insect Association. "They can cure a number of ailments
      and they work much faster than other medicine."<br>
      <br>
      Professor Liu said a cream made from powdered cockroaches is in
      use in some Chinese hospitals as a treatment for burns and in
      Korea for cosmetic facial masks.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, a syrup invented by a pharmaceutical company in Sichuan
      promises to cure gastroenteritis, duodenal ulcers and pulmonary
      tuberculosis.<br>
      <br>
      "China has the problem of an ageing population," explained Prof
      Liu. "So we are trying to find new medicines for older people, and
      these are generally cheaper than Western medicine. Also we have a
      tradition of eating bugs here in Shandong."<br>
      <br>
      For a decade, Mr Wang farmed another type of insect, Eupolyphaga
      Sinensis, which is also used in Traditional Chinese Medicine.<br>
      <br>
      But in the past two years, the demand for cockroaches has soared,
      and Mr Wang has switched his entire production to Periplaneta
      americana, or the American cockroach, a copper-coloured insect
      that grows to just over an inch and a half.<br>
      <br>
      "These are not the same ones you see in your home, those are
      German cockroaches," he said. "There are hundreds of species of
      cockroaches, but only this one has any medicinal value. It is
      native to Guangdong province."<br>
      <br>
      Inside his bunkers are hundreds of nests, bolted together from
      concrete roof tiles, that line the shelves of dark corridors.<br>
      <br>
      The doorways are lined with mesh, but some cockroaches have
      clustered on the low ceilings overhead and the air is heavy with a
      fetid stink. "That is just how they smell," Mr Wang shrugged.<br>
      <br>
      Last month was harvest time across Shandong.<br>
      <br>
      As farmers elsewhere in the province picked apples and cut corn,
      Mr Wang reaped huge sackfuls of roaches.<br>
      <br>
      "We kill them before they reach four months old, because then
      their wings are fully grown and they can fly," he said. "They are
      very easy to kill, we take large vats of boiling water into the
      corridors and dunk the nests into them."<br>
      <br>
      His entire output is sold to pharmaceutical companies, he said,
      and the price has risen strongly.<br>
      <br>
      Since 2011, he has quintupled production, to more than 100 tons a
      year, and he has eight workers.<br>
      <br>
      Outside his farm, another man is waiting to be shown around.<br>
      <br>
      Since this spring, Mr Wang has had 100 enquiries from would-be
      cockroach farmers and has helped to build 30 other farms.<br>
      <br>
      "Oh, the money is good," said Xiao Zhongwu, a wiry 49-year-old who
      has a smaller set of farms in the countryside near Qufu, the
      birthplace of Confucius. "I have a trucking business too,
      transporting marble, paper and farm products for local companies.
      But that brings in pocket money: it is cockroaches that bring in
      the big money."<br>
      <br>
      Mr Xiao said he had invested $270,000 in building a series of
      small farms, their windows taped over with plastic sheeting to
      stop the cockroaches from escaping.<br>
      <br>
      But, he said, he earns at least $50,000 a year from the insects,
      and up to $150,000 in a good year. "The pharmaceutical companies
      set the price, but I stockpile my cockroaches when the supply is
      plentiful to wait for when the demand picks up."<br>
      <br>
      Mr Xiao feeds his cockroaches a "special formula" of mashed up
      vegetables and waste to produce the high levels of amino acids
      that his buyers demand.<br>
      <br>
      But, he said, farming the bugs is very simple. "Just keep them
      warm and they are happy."<br>
      <br>
      Until now, the industry, while booming, has remained mostly under
      the radar.<br>
      <br>
      But in August, a million cockroaches escaped from a farm in
      Jiangsu province, making headlines in the Chinese media.<br>
      <br>
      Wang Pengsheng, a 38-year-old former engineer, said he had bought
      the plot of land to raise the insects after six months of research
      into the industry.<br>
      <br>
      He bought more than 80kg of eggs for $16,846 and set up his farm.<br>
      <br>
      But while he was out inspecting the goats and pigs he was raising
      elsewhere, the local government deemed his building illegal and
      knocked it down.<br>
      <br>
      "When I came back in the evening, everything was gone, reduced to
      rubble," he said. "Afterwards, a team of exterminators came around
      to try to kill all the escaped cockroaches."<br>
      <br>
      Mr Wang said he was determined to start again. "The problem is
      that the government has been under pressure from people saying the
      cockroaches are pests and they should not let me rebuild."<br>
      <br>
      In Jinan, the other Mr Wang said he had heard of the misfortune
      suffered by his namesake.<br>
      <br>
      But, he added, he has not had any recent break outs from his farm.<br>
      <br>
      "In the beginning a few got away. But since we covered all the
      windows and doors with mesh, they have been well trapped," he
      said.<br>

      </b><br>
      The utility model relates to an insect breeding boxes, that is, a
      American cockroach breeding tank.<br>
      <br>
      According to the literature, the natural growth of the American
      cockroach was cold, infectious diseases such as cholera mediated<br>
      <br>
      First, the examination of its transmission, is made from natural
      growth Periplaneta americana contagious source, and then touch the
      human. This constituted the food chain of infection.<br>
      <br>
      Periplaneta americana is indoor pests, is an omnivorous, eating
      both A variety of food, and damaged clothing, books. Therefore,
      since ancient times, have been known as one of the four victims.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, the rapid progress of science and technology, the
      American cockroach unique and great medicinal value has been
      developed Out. As the needs of the pharmaceutical industry,
      relying on the natural growth of capturing the American cockroach
      is far unable to meet, The artificial breeding the most critical
      issues, but also that it can not become a source of infection and
      disease to become indoor pests.<br>
      <br>
      So how to solve the stationary environment type farming, has
