        <b>Sepp Hasslberger</b><br>

      <br>
      Dr Peter Plichta studied chemistry, physics and nuclear chemistry
      in Cologne, Germany. He obtained his doctorate in chemistry in
      1970, and in the years following he did much research, on the
      subject of silanes. Similar to hydrocarbons, silanes are
      hydrosilicons, molecules that incorporate atoms of both silicon
      and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Plichta also studied law, and in the 1980s he studied and
      researched logics, numbers theory and mathematics. As a result, he
      published several books outlining a new theory on prime numbers in
      German. In this article however, I will only discuss his proposal
      to use silanes as a highly energetic fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon is more abundant than carbon. It oxidizes or combines with
      oxygen into silicon dioxide, which forms crystals present in rocks
      like quartz, basalt and granite. Silicon dioxide is especially
      prevalent in sand which fills deserts and sea shores. We process
      silicon dioxide into glass and purify the silicon for use in
      electronics. Both of those processes require much external energy
      input.<br>
      <br>
      Before the 1970s, silanes were considered unsuitable for use as
      fuels, because they instantaneously self-combust at room
      temperature. Not satisfied to leave it at that however, Plichta
      went to work and succeeded in producing longer-chained silanes
      that appeared as clear, oily liquids and were stable at room
      temperature. He argues that these higher (long-chain) silanes
      could be used as an abundant fuel as an alternative to both
      hydrocarbons and pure hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike hydrocarbons, silanes use both the nitrogen and the oxygen
      in air for combustion. While the hydrogen component of silanes
      reacts with oxygen, the silicon oxidizes in a highly energetic
      reaction with nitrogen. So the burning of silanes produces much
      higher temperatures and frees more energy than the burning of
      hydrocarbon fuels. The silane reaction leaves no toxic residues.<br>
      <br>
      Much of the information in this article comes from a recent
      description of Plichta's discoveries and his proposed silane fuel
      cycle written by Norbert Knobloch and published in the German
      magazine Raum &amp; Zeit. <br>
      <br>
      Peter Plichta's book "Benzin aus Sand" (Gasoline from Sand), first
      published in 2001, advocates a change in energy strategy away from
      burning hydrocarbons to using the energy potential of silanes or,
      as I would term them, hydrosilicates....<br>

      <b>Nitrogen oxidizes silicon</b><br>
      <br>
      Silicon is the most abundant element in the earth's crust.
      Combined with hydrogen, silicon forms what in chemistry are known
      as "silanes". Given sufficient heat, silanes react with the
      nitrogen in the air. This is a new discovery. Nitrogen was thought
      to be inert, as far as combustion is concerned. So we obviously
      must re-think the possibilities of combustion. Silicon makes up
      25% of the earth's crust, while nitrogen makes up 80% of air. A
      process that uses silicon/nitrogen combustion in addition to the
      known carbon/oxygen cycle, presages some mind boggling new
      possibilities.<br>
      <br>
      While carbon is also a relatively abundant element, its prevalence
      is way lower than that of silicon. The relation is about a hundred
      to one. In addition, most of the available carbon is bound up in
      carbonaceous minerals such as marble and other carbon-based rocks
      and some of it is in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. Those forms
      are not available for use in the combustion cycle. Only one in
      about a hundred thousand carbon molecules is bound to hydrogen,
      making it available for the purpose of combustion. So while carbon
      has served us well for the first century and a half of
      industrialization, it is a rather limited fuel.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Using 100% of air for combustion</b><br>
      <br>
      Plichta's idea was to exchange chains of carbon atoms in
      hydrocarbons for chains of silicon in hydrosilicons or silanes.
      The long chained "higher silanes" are those with five or more
      silicon atoms in each molecule. They are of oily consistency and
      they give off their energy in a very fast, highly energetic
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      While hydrocarbon-based gasoline only uses oxygen, which makes up
      20% of air, for their combustion, the hydrosilicon-based silanes
      also use nitrogen, which makes up the other 80% of air, when they
      burn. Silanes with chains of seven or more atoms of silicon per
      molecule are stable and can be pumped and stored very much like
      gasoline and other carbon-based liquid fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The efficiency of combustion depends on the amount of heat that is
      created. Expanding gases drive pistons or turbines. When
      hydrocarbons are burned with air as the oxidant, efficiency of
      combustion is limited by the fact that the 20% of air that
      partakes in the combustion also has to heat up the nitrogen gas,
      which isn't participating but has to be expanded as well. When
      burning silanes, practically all of the air participates directly
      in the combustion cycle, making for a much more efficient
      expansion of all the gases involved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Burning silanes</b><br>
      <br>
      The combustion process of hydrosilicons is fundamentally different
      from the exclusively oxygen based combustion we know from burning
      hydrocarbons. In a sufficiently hot reaction chamber, silanes
      separate into atoms of hydrogen and silicon, which immediately mix
      with the oxygen and nitrogen of the air. The hydrogen from the
      silanes and the air's oxygen now burn completely leaving only
      water vapor, bringing the temperature of the gases close to 2000
      degrees C.<br>
      <br>
      Since there is no more oxygen, no silicon oxide can be formed in
      the following phase. What happens instead is an extremely
      energetic reaction of the 80% nitrogen in the air with the silicon
      atoms present, that forms a fine powder called silicon nitride
      (Si3N4).<br>
      <br>
      For those more technically inclined, taking the example of
      hexasilane (Si6H14), here is what the reaction would look like:<br>
      <br>
      2 Si6H14 + 7 O2 + 8 N2 -&gt; 4 Si3N4 + 14 H2O<br>
      <br>
      After this first reaction, a great deal of unreacted nitrogen is
      still in the combustion gases, which would now react in a
      stochiometric combustion as follows:<br>
      <br>
      4 1/2 Si6H14 + 18 N2 -&gt; 9 Si3N4 + 63 H<br>
      <br>
      Overall, on the input side of the equation we would have:<br>
      <br>
      6 1/2 Si6 H14 + 7 O2 + 26 N2<br>
      <br>
      and on the output side, we get:<br>
      <br>
      14 H2O + 13 Si3N4 + 63 H<br>
      <br>
      The silicon nitride we find in the "exhaust" is the only known
      noble gas that exists in solid form, an original discovery by
      Peter Plichta. That white powdery stuff is a rather valuable raw
      material for ceramics.<br>
      <br>
      Wikipedia says that silicon nitride powder will form "... a hard
      ceramic having high strength over a broad temperature range,
      moderate thermal conductivity, low coefficient of thermal
      expansion, moderately high elastic modulus, and unusually high
      fracture toughness for a ceramic. This combination of properties
      leads to excellent thermal shock resistance, ability to withstand
      high structural loads to high temperature, and superior wear
      resistance. Silicon nitride is mostly used in high-endurance and
      high-temperature applications, such as gas turbines, car engine
      parts, bearings and metal working and cutting tools. Silicon
      nitride bearings are used in the main engines of the NASA's Space
      shuttles."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rocket fuel for space propulsion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      One of the first uses Peter Plichta envisioned for these
      long-chain hydrosilicons he discovered was to be a fuel for
      rockets. Space travel today is hindered by the immense weight of
      fuel a rocket has to carry to lift itself plus the fuel, plus its
      payload, into space. With a more efficient combustion process, and
      an oxidant that could be "scooped up" in the atmosphere, a
      disk-shaped craft could be propelled to great speed and altitude,
      before having to fall back on a rather small amount of oxidant
      that may be carried as liquefied air or liquid nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      I found a discussion of this on the net, here, which I reproduce
      below in shortened and slightly edited form:<br>
      <br>
      <a href="http://discaircraft.greyfalcon.us/Richard%20Miethe.htm"
        "><b>http://discaircraft.greyfalcon.us/Richard%20Miethe.htm</b><b><br>
        </b></a><br>
      "Dr Plichta can use his concepts of cyclic mathematics to effect a
      revolution in space travel. He has already received several
      patents for the construction of a disc-shaped reusable spacecraft
      which will be fueled by the diesel oils of silicon. The special
      feature of these carbon analog substances is that they do not only
      burn with oxygen, but also with nitrogen. Such a spacecraft can
      use the atmosphere for buoyance. Its engines can inhale air and
      thus do without the standard oxidant reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      "In 1970 Peter Plichta disproved the textbook theory that the
      higher silanes are unstable. One of his achievements was to create
      a mixture of silanes with the chain lengths 5 to 10 (Si5H12 to
      Si10H22). He also managed to separate the oil into the individual
      silanes by of means gas chromatic analysis. This showed the
      surprising result that silanes with a chain length of over 7
      silicon atoms will no longer ignite spontaneously and can thus be
      used for commercial purposes.<br>
      <br>
      "Multi-stage rockets function from the mathematical point of view
      according to principles of rocket ascent. At the first stage of
      the launch they have to lift their whole weight with the power of
      fuel combustion. Because they quickly lose weight as they use up
      fuel, they then accelerate although the power of thrust remains
      the same. The discarded stages are burned in the atmosphere, which
      can only be described as a ridiculous waste of money. The Space
      Shuttle was intended to make space travel less costly; but
      actually the opposite has happened. Just as the invention of the
      wheel made all human transport easier, a circular spacecraft will
      some day soon replace the linear design of current multi-stage
      rockets. We are all familiar with the elegance with which a disc
      or a Frisbee is borne by the air through which it flies.<br>
      <br>
      "Peter Plichta got the idea of constructing a disc in which
      jet-turbines attached to shafts would drive two ring-shaped blade
      rings rotating in opposite directions. This will cause the disc to
      be suspended by the air just like a helicopter. The craft can then
      be driven sideways by means of a drop-down rocket engine. When a
      speed of over 200 km/h has been reached, the turbines for the
      blade rings will be switched off and covered to enhance the
      aerodynamic features of the shape. The craft will now be borne by
      the up-draught of the air, just like an aircraft is. This will
      also mean that the critical power required for rocket ascent will
      not be necessary. When the spacecraft accelerates into orbit, the
      N2/O2 mixture of the air will first be fed in through a drop-down
      air intake, as long as the craft is still at a low altitude of 30
      km (1 per cent air pressure). The air will be conducted to the
      rocket motor and the craft will thus accelerate to a speed of
      5000-8000 km/h. This is where a standard rocket jettisons its
      first stage, because by then about 75% of the fuel has already
      been used up.<br>
      <br>
      "The disc on the other hand will continue to accelerate to 20,000
      km/h and will thus reach an altitude of about 50 km (1 per
      thousand of air pressure). The speed will increase as the air
      pressure drops, so that the process can be continued until an
      altitude of about 80 kilometers and 25,000 km/h can be maintained.
      In order to reach the required speed of 30,000 km/h and an
      altitude of around 300 km, only a relatively small quantity of
      oxidation agent will be needed at the end.<br>
      <br>
      "In the hot combustion chamber silanes decompose spontaneously
      into hydrogen and silicon radicals. The hydrogen is burned by the
      oxygen in the air and water formed. Because molecular nitrogen is
      very tightly bonded, it must be preheated and subjected to
      catalytic dissociation. The extremely hot silicon radicals will
      provide additional support for this process, which will in turn
      lead to silicon nitride being formed. In order to burn superfluous
      nitrogen, Mg, Al or Si powder can be added to the silane oil.<br>
      <br>
      "When the spacecraft returns from space the ceramic-protected
      underside of the disc will brake its speed to approximately 500
      km/h. Then the covering will open again, making the blade rings
      autorotate. The jet turbines will then be started for the actual
      landing operation..."<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      In 2006, Plichta developed a new low-cost procedure for the
      production of highly purified silicon. This makes it possibile to
      hypothesize a more widespread use of silanes. If widely and
      cheaply available one day, the new fuel could be used in turbines
      and modified internal combustion engines, in addition to space
      rocket use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Large-scale production of silanes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In order to use long-chain silanes as a fuel, the possibility of
      large scale production of those silicon oils will have to be
      experimentally confirmed. According to Plichta, this process would
      also involve production of pure silicon for use in photovoltaic or
      other industrial applications. High grade energy is needed to
      transform silicon oxide into pure silicon, to be hydrated
      producing the silanes.<br>
      <br>
      One possible way to go about this is to use photovoltaic
      electricity to disassociate hydrogen and oxygen from water. Those
      gases could then be used to process sand into pure silicon and to
      obtain silanes.<br>
      <br>
      Another procedure, widely used today, is to purify silicon dioxide
      using heat from coal, but Plichta has now developed a new process
      that would use tar, pitch and bitumen as well as aluminium
      silicate to produce pure silicon and silanes at a very low cost.
      The highly exothermic process produces large amounts of hydrogen
      and it involves super heated hydrogen fluoride. Monosilanes, a
      by-product of this new process, could be reacted with carbon
      dioxide to obtain water and silicon carbide, an extremely hard
      substance and industrial raw material.<br>
      <br>
      Details are still confidential. The process is being patented.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Turbines and engines</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="TurbinePlichta.jpg" alt="Plichta

      <br>
      Since the silane combustion process is substantially different
      from that of the hydrocarbons used today, specially designed
      turbines and engines will be needed to make use of the new fuel.
      Dr Plichta has patented a turbine that would optimally use the
      silicon-based combustion process.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of silane oil (10) and silicon powder (11) are mixed and
      injected by a pump (7) into the main combustion chamber. There the
      fuel is burned together with pre-heated air (8). In the secondary
      combustion chamber (2) the fuel mix is further burned with a large
      amound to cold air (9), quickly lowering the temperature of the
      gases from about 2000 degrees C to a few hundred degrees. This
      brings a large pressure increase. If the silicon nitride powder
      produced by the combustion process were too hot and not diluted
      with air, it would destroy the turbine blades.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting mixture of gases (H2O, O2, and Si3N4 of oily
      consistency) is now able, in the turbine chamber (3), to cause the
      turbine blades to rotate. The rotation is transmitted over a
      connected shaft (5) to the compressor chamber (4) where air is
      aspired through air inlets (6). The air is mostly conducted into
      the secondary combustion chamber (2) and a small part of it goes,
      after heating, to the first combustion chamber (1). The the
      absorption of heat by the air also provides needed cooling of the
      combustion chambers.<br>
      <br>
      The water vapor produced by the combustion process leaves the
      turbine through exhaust openings (21) while the cooled down, solid
      silicon nitride is trapped in dust bags (20), ready to be passed
      on for later industrial uses.<br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines of the Otto and Diesel type would
      suffer breakdown of lubrication if made to burn silicon oils. The
      temperatures of combustion are considerably higher than those
      reached by gasoline or diesel. But according to Plichta, the
      Wankel-type rotary piston motor could be modified to accomodate
      the high temperatures. It parts would have to be coated with
      silicon nitride ceramics or be entirely constructed using the even
      harder silicon carbide.<br>
      <br>
      The silane oils could not be compressed together with air, they
      would have to be injected at the point of maximal compression. The
      silicon nitride contained in the combusting fuel/air mixture would
      initially be in gaseous and liquid form, providing the necessary
      lubrification and acting as a sealant. Exhaust gases, still very
      hot, could be further burned in a turbine, with the addition of
      cold air as in the second stage of Plichta's turbine design.<br>
      <br>
      Like in the turbine, combustion in this engine would produce small
      amounts of silicon nitride in powder form, which would be filtered
      out from the exhaust gases and collected by filling stations, to
      be passed on for industrial uses...<br>

      Peter Plichta (* 21. Oktober 1939 in Remscheid) ist ein deutscher
      Chemiker, Apotheker und Autor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Leben und Wirken</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Peter Plichta studierte Chemie in Köln, legte 1966 seine
      Diplomprüfung ab und wurde 1970 mit einer Dissertation über Silane
      („Präparative und spektroskopische Untersuchungen zur Darstellung
      von Disilanyl- und Digermanylverbindungen und
      Germaniumwasserstoffen“)[1] unter Franz Fehér[2] am Institut für
      Anorganische Chemie der Universität Köln promoviert. 1977 erlangte
      er die Approbation als Apotheker.<br>
      <br>
      Zu Plichtas technischen Konzepten gehört ein Fluggerät, das in
      seiner Form einem Diskus ähnelt. Dieses Konzept soll nach Plichta
      das heute übliche Mehrstufenantriebs-Prinzip in der Raumfahrt
      ablösen, welches nur zur Beförderung sehr geringer Nutzlasten
      (etwa 4 Prozent bei Ariane 5) in der Lage ist. Seinem Buch Benzin
      aus Sand zufolge ist das „einstufige“ Erreichen der erdnahen
      Umlaufbahn möglich, weil der von Plichta entdeckte Treibstoff
      (siehe unten) nicht nur in Sauerstoff, sondern auch in Stickstoff
      brennt, und deshalb in der Erdatmosphäre kein Oxidationsmittel
      mitgeführt werden muss.<br>
      <br>
      Peter Plichta hat in mehreren Ländern Patente auf einige seiner
      Entwicklungen angemeldet, darunter in den USA. Sein Entwurf wird
      von der Fachwelt abgelehnt. Bis heute wurde kein ernstzunehmender
      Versuch einer Realisierung unternommen.<br>
      <br>
      In den 1970er-Jahren begann Plichta, sich mit der synthetischen
      Treibstoffgewinnung aus Silicium, insbesondere aus Sand, zu
      beschäftigen. Plichta gibt an, als erster stabile, längerkettige
      Silane synthetisiert zu haben. Trotz Plichtas
      Veröffentlichungstätigkeit zu diesem Thema (Hauptwerk: „Benzin aus
      Sand. Die Silan-Revolution“) blieben seine Forschungen bisher ohne
      nachhaltige Resonanz in der Fachwelt und bei Automobilherstellern.
      In einer der wenigen Rezensionen des Werks in einer
      Fachzeitschrift wird Plichtas Vorschlag der Silan-Revolution als
      „origineller Vorschlag“ bezeichnet und die Frage gestellt, ob
      dieser „… belastbar oder gar seriös?“ sein könne. Das Buch
      informiere den Leser „… in einer eigenartigen Mischung aus
      Selbstbewusstsein, verkanntem Genie, Besserwisserei und
      Weinerlichkeit über selbstgewählte Höhepunkte …“ und folge in
      seinen Deutungen einer dem Rezensenten nicht zugänglichen Logik.
      Auch wenn nicht klar würde, was das Werk solle, gehe ein gewisser
      Reiz davon aus.[3]<br>
      <br>
      Seit 1991 veröffentlicht Peter Plichta seine Überlegungen zu
      seinem Weltbild. Er möchte dabei die physikalisch-chemische
      Realität aufbauend auf zahlentheoretischen und zahlenmystischen
      Überlegungen beschreiben, wobei insbesondere Primzahlen eine
      wichtige Rolle spielen.[4] Er behauptet, mit seiner Arbeit die
      Quantenmechanik obsolet gemacht zu haben:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; „Diese Vorgehensweise ersetzt das ganze
      Kartenhaus der modernen Naturwissenschaft, die Quantenmechanik,
      durch exakte Mathematik. Deren Struktur ist euklidisch und im
      Dezimalsystem, dem einzig möglichen Zahlensystem der Natur,
      angelegt.“[5]<br>
      <br>
      Plichta stellt den Anspruch, seine Theorie mathematisch
      „bewiesen“[6] zu haben. Er schließt Indeterminismus damit
      kategorisch aus:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; „Für jede Theorie, die auf zufälligem Geschehen
      aufbaut, ist mit einem Schlag das Ende eingeläutet. Einstein muß
      es geahnt haben.“[6]<br>
      <br>
      Die Urknalltheorie lehnt Plichta ab. Er vertritt eine alternative
      Erklärung für die Bindung des Sauerstoffs ans Hämoglobin im
      Blut.[7]<br>
      <br>
      Die Chemiker Jan C. A. Boeyens und Demetrius C. Levendis haben
      Plichta in ihrem Werk Number Theory and the Periodicity of Matter
      referenziert. Ebenso wie Plichta versuchen sie die moderne
      Quantenphysik durch elementare zahlentheoretische Überlegungen zu
      ersetzen, im Gegensatz zu Plichta stellen sie jedoch nicht die
      allgemeine Relativitätstheorie in Frage, in der der Raum nicht
      euklidisch ist, und sehen keine ausgezeichnete Rolle des
      Dezimalsystems (The specification of common numbers in decimal
      notation is almost certainly a remnant of counting practice using
      a ten-finger base[8]). Peter Plichta trat seit 2011 mehrfach als
      Gesprächspartner beim Alpenparlament.tv sowie 2013 beim
      Alpenparlament Kongress auf.[7]<br>

      Dr. Peter Plichta, Jahrgang 1939, studierte Chemie, Physik,
      Kernchemie und Jura an der Universität Köln. Promotion 1970 über
      Silanverbindungen, deren Darstellungen bis dahin als unmöglich
      galten. Zu Beginn seiner Habilitation 1971 gelang ihm die
      Gewinnung der Dieselöle von Siliziumwasserstoffen (Höhere Silane).
      1973 - 1976 Studium Pharmazie und Biochemie an der Universität
      Marburg. Ab 1981 Privatgelehrter auf den Gebieten Logik,
      Zahlentheorie und Mathematik. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt löste er das
      geometrische Problem der 4. Dimension aus der Verteilung der
      Primzahlen. Der Raum um einen Atomkern ist schalenförmig und von
      der Form zweier sich durchdringender Flächen und besitzt die
      Dimensionen Länge hoch 4. Damit war die Verknüpfung der 3
      Dimensionen des Raumes mit einer eindimensionalen Zeit als eine
      geistige Fehlentwicklung entlarvt. 1991 Veröffentlichung der
      ersten beiden Bücher "Das Primzahlkreuz" Band I und II.<br>

        <b>Cyclic production of silicon or silicon compounds and
          hydrogen...</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A cyclic method for production of crystalline silicon (Si),
      silane, silicon nitride or carbide and hydrogen (H 2) is based on
      pyrolysis of oil-containing sand or shale (I) (as mixture of
      hydrocarbons and silicates), contaminated with potassium aluminum
      silicate and carbonate. Released H 2is heated with fluorine to
      give hydrogen fluoride, which is reacted with the Si of (I) to
      give silicon tetrafluoride for conversion into Si by thermite
      methods using aluminum. Cyclic production of crystalline silicon
      (Si), silane, silicon nitride or carbide and hydrogen (H 2)
      involves pyrolyzing oil-containing sand or shale (I) (as mixture
      of hydrocarbon energy source (tar) and silicates (SiO 2)),
      contaminated with potassium aluminum silicate and carbonate, at
      more than 2000[deg] C. The released H 2is fed into a gas main or
      heated at ca. 4000[deg] C with a specific amount of fluorine (F 2)
      to give hydrogen fluoride (HF). The hot HF is immediately reacted
      with the Si of (I) to give silicon tetrafluoride (SiF 4) gas and
      water vapor; and the hot SiF 4(contaminated with HF) is fed
      directly into a combustion chamber supplied continuously with
      aluminum (Al) powder, in which SiF 4is converted into high purity
      crystalline Si by a thermite process. The obtained Al fluoride
      (AlF 3) powder (stable towards aqueous base) is filtered off
      before electrolytic conversion (in hexafluorosilicate form) into
      more Al and F 2. The necessary DC current is permanently obtained
      using process heat; the thermite process stoichiometrically
      releases 1172 KJ of energy per unit time and cooling with
      preheated water gives steam for AC generation. Heat from SiF
      4production is also used for electricity generation. In the
      pyrolysis stage, the SiF 4-H 2O mixture is passed into the center
      of an Al powder-filled rotating drum with a welding flame in the
      cylinder center, and heat conduction causes exponential decrease
      of high temperatures in the cylinder wall direction (as in the
      subsequent thermite process). Cooling of the double-walled drum
      with water allows generation of a large amount of current, and Al
      and F 2are recycled to the cyclic process.<br>

      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Cyclic large-scale production of crystalline silicon /
      photosilicon or the fuel silane or the ceramics silicon nitride or
      silicon carbide and very large amounts of gaseous hydrogen from
      oily sands / slags using aluminum and the mixture of fluorine and
      hydrogen which provides 4,000 ° C hot hydrogen fluoride on
      combustion , Is carried out in such a way that the welding flame
      temperature only pyrolytically cleaves the stoichiometric content
      of the oil / tar content into graphite and hydrogen and is
      achieved by means of a device in which the vessel wall is heated
      only to about 400 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      The stocks of oil-bearing sands (SiO2) and slate (SiO2 + [CO3]
      &lt;2&gt;) are, as is well known, much higher than the world oil
      reserves. The technical processes used to separate oil and
      minerals are inefficient and too expensive.<br>
      <br>
      The combustion products required to generate heat generate CO2. So
      far, it is only in patent application 10 2006 023 515.0 that
      mention is made of the use of the sand present in the mixtures as
      energy carriers and to extract new raw materials from the
      products, whereby the oil pitch present in the sands and obliques
      itself becomes a supplier of gaseous hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to provide a cyclic process
      in which only a certain amount of fluorine and aluminum is used in
      addition to the oil sand / shale. This amount is constantly
      recycled, as will be explained below. In fact, only as much
      silicate is to be converted into silicon fluoride, as is available
      per primary unit of oil / tar as primary energy. In this
      procedure, for example, as with an Archimedean screw, oil sand /
      shale or a mixture of sand and waste oils, Strongly
      sulfur-containing petroleum is passed through a rotating stainless
      steel boiler. The burner arrangement is located in the center of
      the vessel so that the enormous heat of almost 4,000 ° C decreases
      exponentially during the rotary movement of the sands to the outer
      vessel spacing. It is thereby achieved that the boiler wall which
      is coated with hard metal, which is not attacked by gaseous
      hydrogen fluoride, is supplied with little heat. The liberated
      heat can be converted into electrical current via the generation
      of water vapor via a turbine.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture of silicon fluoride, hydrogen and carbon dioxide is
      now passed into a second vessel, in which stoichiometrically
      enough aluminum granules are fed per unit of time, so that, as
      above, the gas mixture is fed back into the middle via a rotating
      drum. The resulting termite reaction produces so much heat that
      the double-walled boiler must be cooled with water. This generates
      so much electrical current that the amounts of current can be used
      for the electrolysis of the aluminum fluoride. Here, the ALF 3 is
      admixed with potassium fluoride, so that potassium aluminum
      hexafluoride is formed. The cryolite thus obtained can be melted
      with purified bauxite and used to obtain aluminum. The object of
      the invention is also to recover electrolytically the fluorine
      used in copper boilers. The amounts of current for recovering the
      fluorine and aluminum used can be achieved via the three-phase
      current generators.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen gas required for the application can be removed from
      the hydrogen produced.<br>
      <br>
      Overall, the primary energy of the oil / tar provides so much heat
      and hydrogen that 100% recycling of the fluorine and aluminum is
      ensured.<br>
      <br>
      The crystalline silicon obtained is chemically very pure. The
      large amounts of hydrogen can be used for the production of
      aluminum, whereby no CO 2 is liberated when hydrogen is burnt,
      while today the aluminum plants work with brown coal. The
      remaining hydrogen is chemically separated from the carbon dioxide
      and can be fed into existing gas networks instead of natural gas,
      which burns to carbon dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      Since 40 billion tons of oil shale are stored in Jordan alone, the
      process described here can be used to produce photosilicon at
      incredibly low prices. At the same time, the process can be
      coupled with an aluminum production. The cleaning of bauxite and
      silicate, which has hitherto been carried out, can be carried out
      very simply in a further patent chemically.<br>
      The cyclic process is now to be explained in more detail
      chemically by several digits. Annex 1 shows a series of
      large-scale production plants, which begin with the fact that oily
      sands / shale are transported to the decomposition plant I on
      mechanical transport routes.<br>
      <br>
      Annex II shows the points 1 and 3 of Annex I schematically. 1)
      With patent (a) DE 21 53 954 and (b) DE 195 33 765, it is known
      that, when the fluorine is hydrogenated with hydrogen, the
      hydrofluoric silicatified rock formed is completely converted into
      gaseous components SIF4, AlF3 (see a) The resulting silicon
      fluoride is rendered harmless with sodium hydroxide solution in
      this process (see b). 2) Oil-containing sands can be treated with
      the very hot hydrogen fluoride (over 3,000 ° C) formed during
      combustion, so that silicon fluoride is produced in the main (one,
      one). A lot of heat is released. 3) The heat pyrifies the involved
      oil pitch to carbon / graphite, which can be removed from the
      process (two, two). If slate is present, calcium oxide CaO is also
      created to be reused elsewhere. 4) The gaseous SiF 4, possibly
      contaminated by AlF 3 and traces of potassium fluoride and other
      metal fluorides, is now transferred together with the large
      amounts of hot hydrogen gas to (3, 3).<br>
      <br>
      There, it is mixed with aluminum granules (10, 10) by the Thermit
      method in the form of the salt SiF4 · 2KF = K2 [SiF6] according to
      the equation 3SiF4 + 4Al? 3Si + 4AlF3 + 1172.7 kj is converted
      into crystalline silicon by evaporation of air. The heat liberated
      in (1, 1) and (3, 3) can be withdrawn from the system by the
      production of hot water vapor by built-in cooling coils and
      converted into three-phase current (fourteen, 14). 5) The mixture
      of crystalline silicon, AlF 3 and H 2 arriving in (4, 4) is free
      of CO and CO2, since the process is carried out under airtight
      conditions. If the pitch oil mixture contains shale, CO2 is formed
      next to calcium oxide, which is separated in (4, 4) in aqueous
      solution with calcium hydroxide. The CO2 can thus be bound as
      calcium carbonate with the CaO obtained in (2, 2) and removed from
      the system. 6) The main quantity of hydrogen is fed into existing
      heating gas pipeline systems (seven, 7), while the stoichiometric
      quantity of H2 required for the circuit is fed back via a line (8,
      8) (one, one).<br>
      <br>
      7) The dried, powdered AlF3 (insoluble in water and lye) freed
      from the water by filter pressing is subjected to melt flow
      electrolysis (9, 9). For this purpose, the stream produced with
      the self-produced hydrogen will be used (thirteen, 13). In
      addition, there are bundled streams (fourteen, fourteen) (one,
      one) and three (three). 8) The aluminum (ten, 10) resulting from
      the electrolysis will largely be cyclically reused in (3, 3). The
      unused part of the aluminum can be removed. The resulting F2
      (eleven, 11) is used again without loss in (one, 1). 9) In the
      equation under no. 4) there are 3 moles of silicon on the right
      side as well as 1172 kj. At present, crystalline silicon is
      represented by an elaborate process using coal, high electrical
      costs and fractionating chlorosilanes with subsequent pyrolysis.
      The price is very high, since it is agreed worldwide. The new
      cyclic process would reduce the kilo price for photosilicon to one
      hundredths.<br>
      <br>
      10) If desired, this crystalline silicon can be converted directly
      to pure silicon nitride by ignition with pure cold nitrogen, since
      the reaction is strongly exothermic. (Si3N4 is a solid noble gas
      [Plichta]. ) The most important ceramics used in the art - Silicon
      nitride (with its remarkable thermal conductivity) and silicon
      carbide (with its diamond-like hardness) Can be obtained in this
      way, since the very pure carbon from (2, 2) can also be used here.
      11) The available crystalline silicon is surface active and could
      be catalytically treated with hydrogen to form monosilane. This
      monosilane can be removed from the reaction chamber and converted
      into long-chain silanes in a further patent application. These are
      not only to be used in space travel because they supply atomic
      hydrogen in the heat (Plichta). The atomic hydrogen can also be
      used in a fuel cell, which can be inferred from an additional
      patent application.<br>
      <br>
      12) The heat generated in (1, 1) and (2, 2) and (4, 4) is, as
      discussed above, so low that it can be used to produce
      electricity. In general, the use of open-cast oil sands and slate
      is so high that it can be compared with the combustion of coal,
      lignite and natural gas, with the scouring of fossil deposits and
      the emission of carbon dioxide from electricity factories And
      vehicles as irresponsible. Only the use of low-cost solar cells
      can be referred to as "perpetuum mobile" when low-cost silane
      gasoline is subjected to a nitrogen cycle, in which ammonia is
      produced by the production of Si3N4 and its cleavage, which
      produces electricity during combustion Nitrogen back into the
      atmosphere. (Plichta)<br>

      The present invention relates to a plurality of processes for
      producing higher silanes, in particular with regard to the
      inexpensive recovery and use as fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The decomposition of magnesium silicide with acids produces
      hydrogen and monosilane. The yield of the liquid silanes tri- and
      tetrasilane is approx. 5%.<br>
      <br>
      It is known from patent 21 39 155 to obtain higher silanes by
      pyrolysis of tri-, tetra- and pentasilane. Higher silanes are
      non-toxic, since heptasilane is no longer self-igniting and thus
      safe to handle. Such higher silanes can be used as a propellant
      according to patent specification 44 37 524 in that they are
      combusted with atmospheric air. In hot combustion chambers,
      silanes decompose into free silicon atoms which react with the air
      nitrogen, which is considered inert, to form silicon nitride
      Si3N4. The hydrogen content of the silane reacts with the air
      oxygen to water. Both reactions provide energy. In order to burn
      the air nitrogen completely, it is also known, as disclosed in
      Patent Specification No. 196 12 507, to add silanol, additionally
      dispersed silicon powder or dispersed metal silicides, which also
      react with the air nitrogen with heat dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the stoichiometric combustion equation for
      heptasilane is Si7H16 with air consisting of 20% oxygen and 80%
      nitrogen: 16H + 4O2? 8H2O; 7 Si + 16 N2 + 17 dispersed Si? 8

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object of the present invention is to produce higher silanes
      or partially methylated higher silanes inexpensively and in high
      yields and to remedy the disadvantages of the prior art. As a
      basic substance, silicon compounds that are already being used in
      industry in large scale, such as, for example, Mono- or disilane,
      or mono- or disilane Disilanes with different methyl groups or
      chlorine residues. The use of fluorosilanes is also advantageous
      since these can be prepared directly from SiO 2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method I</b><b><br>
      </b><b>(Modified Müller-Rochow synthesis)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object is achieved according to the invention by the fact that
      silicon powder is contaminated with catalysts, and is reacted
      under pressure and heat with silyl chlorides or disilyl chlorides
      or methylated silyl or disilyl chlorides. According to the
      conventional Mueller-Rochow synthesis, methyl chloride CH3Cl is
      reacted with powdered silicon in the presence of copper / copper
      oxide as catalyst to give methylchlorosilanes. 80% of
      dimethyldichlorosilane (CH3) 2SiCl2 is formed, followed by (CH3)
      SiCl3 (10-15%) and other methylchlorosilanes.<br>
      <br>
      (A) It is proposed to first modify the Müller-Rochow synthesis in
      such a way that the methyl chloride is replaced by silyl chloride.
      SiH3Cl can be obtained from tetrachlorosilane SiCl4 by
      hydrogenation. On the other hand, it can also be catalytically
      chlorinated with HCl according to Alfred Stockmonosilan. Silyl
      chlorides, however, are generally used as waste products in
      silicone chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, silicon powders with catalysts such as copper / copper oxide
      are reacted under pressure and heat with silyl chloride to give
      disilyldichlorosilane (SiH3) 2SiCl2 (a trisilane).<br>
      The next step is to extend the Si-Si chain even further. To this
      end, the trisilane must first be partially hydrogenated to the
      monochloride (SiH 3) 2SiHCl. If this monochlorotrisilane is again
      introduced into the Miiller-Rochow apparatus and allowed to react
      with elementary silicon, [(SiH3) 2SiH] 2-SiCl2 is formed, an
      iso-heptasilane dichloride:<br>
      The chlorine atoms can then be easily hydrogenated so that (SiH3)
      2SiH-SiH2-SiH (SiH3) 2, a pure iso-heptasilane.<br>
      <br>
      It is, of course, possible to introduce the heptasilane
      hydrogenated into the monochlor form once more into the
      Miiller-Rochow synthesis so as to obtain a Si15H30Cl2 or
      hydrogenation Si15H32 after hydrogenation.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that other metals / metal oxides could also be used
      as catalysts. The possibility of using silanichloride SiH 2 Cl 2
      or even SiHCl 3 as the starting product is also to be covered by
      the process described here.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of chlorosilanes, fluorosilanes such as SiH 3 F could also
      be used. The advantage is that this material can be obtained
      directly from sand or rock, so that smaller amounts of expensive
      elementary silicon are needed. For this purpose, SiO 2 is mixed
      with hot hydrogen fluoride gas or alternatively with hydrofluoric
      acid / conc. Sulfuric acid mixture, SiF4 being formed.
      Chlorofluorides such as ClF 3 can also be used, whereby silicon
      fluorofluorides such as SiClF 3 are formed. These resulting
      fluorides, ie, SiF 4 or SiClF3, can now be hydrogenated to mono-
      or di-fluoroform analogously to the procedures described with
      chlorosilanes at the beginning of this section and fed into the
      Rochow synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      The processes described in paragraphs 1b), c), d) and method 2
      also work with the corresponding fluorides as well as with
      chlorides.<br>
      <br>
      B) Disilan monochloride Si2H5Cl could also be used. This substance
      is obtained from hexachlorodisilane Si2Cl6 by hydrogenation.
      (Si2Cl6 itself is prepared from tetrachlorosilane SiCl4. ) In this
      case, the main product is dis-disilyldichlorosilane (Si2H5)
      2SiCl2, a dichloropentasilane.<br>
      <br>
      Further, an industrial waste product, such as a disilane
      containing both chloro atoms and methyl groups, could again be
      used. A silane of this kind is then hydrogenated to a form in
      which it contains only one chlorine atom, in order subsequently to
      employ the Miiller-Rochow synthesis. In the case of a disilane, a
      dichloropentasilane with methyl substituents is formed. One of the
      two chloro atoms can then be hydrogenated, so that the
      Müller-Rochow synthesis can be used once more. The result is an
      undecasilane, the methyl groups of which are of little importance
      when used as a fuel.<br>
      <br>
      As in FIG. 1a), it is also possible here to directly use a
      partially methylated chlorosilane with two or even several
      chlorine atoms.<br>
      <br>
      C) The chlorosilanes described in 1a) or 1b) can also be dimerized
      or cyclized directly with alkali metals such as lithium or
      alkaline earth metals such as magnesium. One of the two free
      chlorine atoms on the central silicon atom can also be
      hydrogenated and the dimerization can then be carried out.<br>
      <br>
      The higher silanes (SiH3) 2SiH - SiH (SiH3) 2, a hexasilane, or
      the (Si2H5) 2SiH - SiH (Si2H5) 2, a decasilane can thus be used as
      a propellant in the form of a non - ignitable mixture. Even higher
      cyclic compounds such as substituted pentasilanes are, of course,
      not self-ignitable.<br>
      <br>
      D) The chlorosilanes obtained by (1a) and (1b) could also be
      chain-extended by pyrolysis, as described in pure silanes, as
      described in German Patent 31,315,155. Subsequently, the
      thus-obtained substance would be hydrogenated to obtain a pure
      silane.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object is achieved according to the invention by the fact that
      silicon tetrachloride SiCl 4 or hexachlorodisilane Si 2 Cl 6 is
      hydrogenated either by lithium hydride, if possible by hydrogen
      pressure hydrogenation on the catalyst, so that mono- or Disilane
      is formed. It can, of course, also be based on mono- Disilane,
      which are obtained as gaseous products in the case of the Cane
      acid decomposition, and are usually flaked off.<br>
      <br>
      These two silanes, in turn, are then reacted with liquid
      sodium-potassium alloys in higher ethers, so that the monosilane,
      potassium silyl, is SiH3K, from the disilane potassium disilyl
      Si2H5K. The filtered solutions contain the two potassium compounds
      in liquid form. Both attack chlorosilanes, whereby KCl
      precipitates. The iso-octasilane (SiH3) 3Si-Si (SiH3) 3 is formed
      from hexachlorodisilane from tetrachlorosilane, for example, from
      the tetrachlorosilane, the longer-chain iso-pentasilane.<br>
      <br>
      It is also proposed to replace the above-described modified
      Müller-Rochow synthesis and the chain extension with potassium
      silane compounds in the course of the preparation of longer-chain
      silanes.<br>
      <br>
      This is done with the intention of allowing continued chain
      extensions. If the chlorosilanes are treated with too large a
      quantity of potassium silyl, then all the chlorinatoms with the
      potassium combine to form KCl, and further chain lengthening is
      impossible. If, however, the potassium silane is added in a lesser
      quantity, the chlorosilanes formed still contain some, and in the
      ideal case a chlorine atom. This allows the Müller-Rochow
      synthesis to be used again for chain elongation, and then again to
      carry out chain lengthening by potassium silyl. <br>

      Crude tri-, tetra- and penta-silanes are vaporised under high
      vacuum in a boiler heated with warm water, passed through a
      vertical Pyrex column packed with glass wool catalyst and heated
      by external electrical heating elements, the products being
      collected in a receiver at the top of the column cooled to -196
      degrees C. The mixed products are fractionated by vapour phase
      chromatography at 220 degrees C. To produce up to 7-Si chains (n-
      and iso-heptasilane) the column is run at 420 degrees C, for 8-si
      chains at 410 degrees C, for 9-Si chains at 360 degrees C, and for
      10-Si chains with a glass wool-silica gel-platinum (5%) catalyst
      at 410 degrees C. For the prodn. of higher germanes from
      trigermane the column is run at 300 degrees C. The fractionated
      higher silanes are diluted with benzene and frozen at -80 degrees
      C for storage.; To increase yields the pyrolysis is repeated
      several times by deep cooling the original boiler and heating the

      The invention relates to a process for the preparation of higher
      silanes by pyrolysis of trisilane, n-tetrasilane and / or
      n-pentasilane and of higher germanes by pyrolysis of Trigerman.<br>
      The device further relates to a device for carrying out said
      method.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that, in the decomposition of magnesium silicide with
      loic hydrochloric acid, not only silicon-hydrogen but also higher
      silanes are formed, which can be fractionated as a liquefied
      mixture in the high vacuum into the individual constituents.<br>
      <br>
      This is the classical Stock method, in which the following
      reactions have obtained some significance for the preparation of
      higher silanes: the pyrolysis of low silanes; The effect of silent
      electric discharge on low silanes; The pyrolysis of (SiF2) X with
      aqueous hydrofluoric acid; The hydrogenation of perchlorosilanes
      and the reaction of halosilanes with potassium silyl. None of
      these methods has so far led to the preparation of higher silanes
      with chain lengths of more than 6 silicon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the technical yield of higher silanes is low in the
      known processes.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the invention is to produce higher silanes, even
      with chain lengths of more than 6 silicon atoms, at a high yield.
      Moreover, the object of the invention is to prepare higher
      germanes from the starting substance Trigerman and to remedy the
      disadvantages of the prior art with regard to the production of
      higher silanes and germanenes.<br>
      <br>
      The object is achieved according to the invention by the fact that
      the starting silane or Is vaporized in the high vacuum, the
      starting / German on a glass wool contact at a temperature in the
      range from 360 C to 420 C or<br>
      <br>
      Is pyrolyzed below 300 ° C. for the production of higher germanes,
      then the decomposition products are condensed and converted
      gaschromatically into individual higher silanes or Germane.<br>
      <br>
      According to the method according to the invention, it is possible
      to present higher silanes and germans in a comparatively simple
      manner with high yield. Moreover, it was found that, unlike
      previous views, the higher silanes are stable with more than six
      silicones, and pure heptasilane is not self-ignitable in the
      presence of air, 1 as has always been assumed. This opens up new
      possibilities for technology.<br>
      <br>
      For the preparation of iso-tetrasilane, isa-pentasilane, n- and
      iso-hexasilane and n- and iso-heptasilane, it is preferably
      proposed to use trisilane as the starting substance and to carry
      out the pyrolysis at a temperature of 4200.degree. This is used as
      the main product to produce n- and iso-pentasilane Si5H12.<br>
      <br>
      It is important that iso-tetrasilane is also formed as 5-loX.<br>
      <br>
      For the preparation of especially n- and iso-heptasilane Si7H16,
      according to a further proposal of the invention, n-tetrasilane is
      to be used as the starting silane and the pyrolysis is carried out
      at a temperature of 410 ° C. In order to arrive at a main product
      n- and iso-octasilane Si8H18, n-pentasilane is used as starting
      silane in a suitable embodiment of the invention and the pyrolysis
      is carried out at a temperature of 3600.degree.<br>
      <br>
      The pyrolytic decomposition of n-tetrasilane on the glass wool
      silica gel platinum contact, preferably on a glass wool silica gel
      platinum (5 ff) contact, even results in the preparation of
      decasilane.<br>
      <br>
      The production process according to the invention includes, as the
      last process step, the gas-chromatographic separation into
      individual higher silanes or Germane. The gas chromatographic
      separation is preferably carried out at a temperature of about 220
      ° C., in which the straight-chain silanes can be separated well
      from their isomers. The condensation of the silane of the German
      steam prior to the gas chromatographic separation is preferably
      carried out at a temperature of -1960.degree.<br>
      <br>
      Silanes with chain lengths of six to ten silicon atoms are oily,
      colorless liquids. While hexasilane Si6H14 spontaneously ignites
      spontaneously in the air, gaseous pure heptasilane is no longer
      self-igniting and first flames with the aid of a catalyst, B.
      Cellulose paper. Higher silanes are much more stable than
      previously thought. This shows their preparation at temperatures
      around 400 ° C. and their gas chromatographic separation at a
      temperature of 220 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      At room temperature, higher silanes decompose after standing for a
      long time with the deposition of white flakes. Such abundant
      quantities spontaneously flinch in air, which is due to the
      formation of low silanes. This can be proved by gas
      chromatography. In a further embodiment of the invention, it is
      therefore proposed to dilute the products with absolute benzene
      for the purpose of storing the higher silanes and subsequently to
      freeze the solutions at a temperature of -8.degree. The benzene is
      easily separated off by gas chromatography if this is again
      necessary.<br>
      <br>
      To increase the yield of higher silanes, the pyrolysis can be
      repeated several times, with heating baths being ensured that the
      higher silanes formed are not thermally decomposed a second time.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the apparatus for carrying out the
      described process for the production of hydraulic silanes or
      germanics is characterized in that a heatable pyrex tube filled
      with glass wool is provided, one open end of which is connected to
      a container for receiving the starting silane or geranium And the
      other end of which opens into a condenser which is coolable to a
      temperature of 1980 ° C by means of a cooling unit, and that the
      vessel and the condenser are connected to a high vacuum system and
      are provided with pressure-tight openings for filling and / The
      starting substances used for carrying out the process according to
      the invention trisilane, n-tetrasilane, n-pentasilane and
      trigerrnane can be prepared in a known manner. The starting
      substances thus obtained are treated according to the method
      according to the invention in the apparatus described below, which
      is schematically illustrated in the drawing. The essential element
      of the apparatus suitable for carrying out the process, which is
      shown in the drawing, is a pyrolysis column consisting of a pyrex
      tube 1, which is filled internally with glass wool as filling
      material.<br>
      <br>
      The pyrex tube 1 is suspended essentially vertically and is
      surrounded by a heating device which is capable of producing
      temperatures of more than 420 degrees Celsius inside the pyrex
      tube 1. In the exemplary embodiment, the heating device consists
      of an outer winding 2 consisting of heating strip (asbestos and
      electrically conductive wires), which extends almost over the
      entire length of the pyrex tube 1. With its lower end, the pyrex
      tube 1 is connected to a glass flask 3, which is a container for
      receiving the starting silane or gander. The connection is
      designed to be highly vacuum tight by means of a corresponding
      cut.<br>
      <br>
      The glass flask is provided with two openings 4, 5, one of which
      is for connection to a vacuum chamber and the other is
      vacuum-tightly closed by means of a known rubber cap, which is
      made of a material which prevents the filling and emptying of the
      glass flask 3 by means of a syringe- Without the risk of access to
      external atmosphere. The connection of a @ Oueckilber steam jet
      pump to the opening 5 of the glass bulb 3 is indicated in the
      drawing by an arrow. The schematically illustrated rubber cap is
      provided with the reference numeral 6.<br>
      <br>
      The glass flask 3 is surrounded by a Dewar vessel 7, which is
      suitable for receiving a heating bath or liquid nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      A substantially similar arrangement is located at the upper end of
      the pyrex tube 1. A glass bulb 9 is also vacuum-tightly connected
      to the pyrex tube 1 via a glass tube line 8, which is surrounded
      by insulating material. The glass flask 9 has an opening 10 with
      which the vacuum chamber can be connected and an opening 11 for
      filling and emptying the glass flask 9, which is provided with a
      through-cut cap 12 corresponding to the rubber cap 4. The glass
      flask 9 is arranged within a Dewar vessel 15 which can be filled
      with a heating bath or liquid nitrogen. For the preparation of the
      silanes used, a robust mixture is prepared by decomposing
      magnesium silicide with aqueous phosphoric acid, which is
      separated by preparative gas chromatography. The process is
      carried out with the utmost exclusion of oxygen and moisture in an
      atmosphere of ultra-fine nitrogen in the apparatus described.
      First, hot water is filled into the Dewar vessel 7 and the
      starting silane is filled into the glass flask 5 by means of a
      syringe .<br>
      <br>
      Liquid nitrogen is then introduced into the Dewar vessel 15 to
      build up a condenser at the upper end of the pyrex tube 1.<br>
      <br>
      The high vacuum pump, which is connected to the opening 10 of the
      glass bulb 5, is adjusted and maintains a high vacuum in the
      apparatus. At the same time, the heating is switched on by
      applying a voltage to the coil 2 of the heating coil. The result
      of this is that the starting fluid evaporates and rises through
      the pyrex tube 1 filled with glass wool. Pyrolysis takes place.
      The pyrolysis product condenses in the glass flask 9, that the
      glass flask 9 now has a content, while the glass flask 3 is
      emptied.<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, aeration of the apparatus to atmospheric pressure
      with nitrogen takes place, and the Dewar vessel 7 is filled with
      liquid nitrogen, in order to remove a condenser at this point.
      Analogously, the Dewar vessel 15 is filled with hot water and the
      high vacuum is built up through the opening 5 of the glass bulb 5.
      The reverse process takes place as described above, and a new
      pyrolysis takes place. This process is repeated up to 8 ×, it
      being pointed out that the higher silanes which are formed do not
      pyrolyze again since they have a higher boiling point. At the end
      of the process, the higher silanes shown are placed in the glass
      flasks 5 and 9 in approximately the same amount. They are removed
      through openings 4 and 11 and fed to the gas chromatographic
      separation.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of pyrolysis, additional products are hydrogen,
      monosilane and disilane. During the reaction, the hydrogen is
      withdrawn continuously from the mercury vapor jet pump of the high
      vacuum system, and the monosilane and the disilane are also
      removed after each reccondensation.<br>
      <br>
      In carrying out the process according to the invention, the
      quantitative compositions described in Table 1, Table 2 and Table
      3 were prepared, for example, on higher silanes. In the pyrolysis
      of n-tetrasilane on a glass wool-silica gel platinum (5%) contact,
      n- and iso-decasilane Si101122 was prepared. The iso-decasilane is
      a clear paraffin-like oil.<br>
      <br>
      The gas chromatographic separation of the pyrolysis products can
      be carried out with the known, known devices. The substances are
      collected by means of an injection needle, which is soldered to
      the gas-chromatographic outlet, in collecting tubes with rubber
      caps and V2A taps in order to reduce the risks when working with
      self-igniting substances.<br>
      In the pyrolysis of Trigerman Ge3H8 according to the method
      according to the invention, n-tetragerman Ge4H10, iso-tetragerman
      i-Ge4H1O, iso-pentagerman i-Ge5H12 and n-pentagerman Ge 012 are
      produced, where n-tetragerman is the main product. As a working
      temperature, a temperature of less than 3000 ° C. is preferred in
      carrying out the pyrolysis of Trigerman. At this temperature
      higher germans can be produced with high yield than at
      temperatures above 3000 ° C., in which the decomposition into
      germanium and hydrogen predominates.<br>

      use as propellants The present invention relates to a plurality of
      processes for preparing higher silanes, in particular with regard
      to the inexpensive recovery and use as fuels.<br>
      <br>
      The decomposition of magnesium silicide with acids produces
      hydrogen and monosilane. The yield of the liquid silanes tri- and
      tetrasilane is approx. 5%.<br>
      <br>
      It is known from patent 21 39 155 to obtain higher silanes by
      pyrolysis of tri-, tetra- and pentasilane. Higher silanes are
      non-toxic, since heptasilane is no longer self-igniting and thus
      safe to handle. Such higher silanes can be used as propellant
      according to patent specification 44 37 524 in that they are
      combusted with atmospheric air. In hot combustion chambers,
      silanes decompose into free silicon atoms which react with the air
      nitrogen, which is considered inert, to form silicon nitride
      Si3N4. The hydrogen content of the silane reacts with the air
      oxygen to water. Both reactions provide energy. In order to burn
      the air nitrogen completely, it is also known, as disclosed in
      Patent Specification No. 196 12 507, to add silanol, additionally
      dispersed silicon powder or dispersed metal silicides, which also
      react with the air nitrogen with heat dissipation.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the stoichiometric combustion equation for
      heptasilane is Si7Hl6 with air consisting of 20% oxygen and 80%
      nitrogen: 16H + 4028H20; 7 Si + 16 N2 + 17 dispersed Si Si4N4.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The object of the present invention is to prepare higher silanes
      or partially methylated higher silanes inexpensively and in high
      yields and to remedy the disadvantages of the prior art. As a
      basic substance, silicon compounds that are already being used in
      industry in large scale, such as, for example, For example mono-
      or disilane, or mono- or disilane.<br>
      Disilanes with different methyl groups or chlorine residues. The
      use of fluorosilanes is also advantageous because these can be
      prepared directly from SiO 2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Method I (modified Müller-Rochow synthesis)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      &nbsp;The object is achieved according to the invention by the
      fact that silicon powder is contaminated with catalysts and is
      reacted under pressure and heat with silyl chlorides or disilyl
      chlorides or methylated silyl or disilyl chlorides.<br>
      <br>
      According to the conventional Mueller-Rochow synthesis, methyl
      chloride CH3Cl is reacted with powdered silicon in the presence of
      copper / copper oxide as catalyst to give methylchlorosilanes. 80%
      of dimethyldichlorosilane (CH3) 2SiCl2 are formed, followed by
      (CH3) SiCl3 (10-15%) and other methylchlorosilanes. A) It is
      proposed to first modify the Müller-Rochow synthesis in such a way
      that the methyl chloride is replaced by silyl chloride. SiH3C1 can
      be obtained from tetrachlorosilane SiCl4 by hydrogenation. On the
      other hand, it can also be catalytically chlorinated with HCl
      according to Alfred Stockmonosilan.<br>
      <br>
      Silyl chlorides, however, are generally used as waste products in
      silicone chemistry.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, silicon powders with catalysts such as copper / copper oxide
      are reacted under pressure and heat with silyl chloride to give
      disilyldichlorosilane (SiH3) 2SiCl2 (a trisilane). &lt;Img class =
      "EMIRef" id = "013737427-00020001" /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      The next step is to extend the Si-Si chain even further. For this
      purpose, the trisilane must first be partially hydrogenated to the
      monochloride (SiH 3) 2SiHCl.<br>
      If this monochlorotrisilane is again introduced into the
      Miiller-Rochow apparatus and allowed to react with elemental
      silicon, [(SiH3) 2SiH] 2-SiCl2 is formed, an iso-heptasilane
      dichloride: &lt;img class = "EMIRef" id = "013737427-00020002"
      /&gt;<br>
      <br>
      Subsequently, the chloro atoms can be easily hydrogenated so that
      (SiH3) 2SiH-SiH2-SiH (SiH3) 2, a pure iso-heptasilane.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, it is possible to feed the heptasilane hydrogenated
      into the monochlor form once again into the Müller-Rochow
      synthesis, so that a sil5H30C12 or hydrogenation silsH32 is
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that other metals / metal oxides could also be used
      as catalysts. The possibility of using silanichloride SiH2C12 or
      even SiHCl3 as the starting product is also to be covered by the
      process described here.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of chlorosilanes, fluorosilanes such as SiH 3 F could also
      be used. The advantage is that this material can be obtained
      directly from sand or rock, so that smaller amounts of expensive
      elementary silicon are needed.<br>
      <br>
      For this purpose, SiO 2 is mixed with hot hydrogen fluoride gas or
      alternatively with hydrofluoric acid / conc. Sulfuric acid
      mixture, SiF4 being formed. Chlorofluorides such as C1F3 can also
      be used, whereby silicon chlorofluorides such as SiCIFs are
      formed. These resulting fluorides, ie, SiF 4 or SiCIFs, can now be
      hydrogenated to mono or di-fluoroform analogously to the
      procedures described with chlorosilanes at the beginning of this
      section and fed into the Rochow synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      The processes described in paragraphs (Ib), (c), (d) and Method 2
      also work with the corresponding fluorides as well as with
      chlorides. B) Disilane monochloride Si2H5C1 could also be used.<br>
      <br>
      This substance is obtained from hexachlorodisilane Si2C16 by
      hydrogenation.<br>
      <br>
      (Si2Cl6 itself is prepared from tetrachlorosilane SiCl4. ) In this
      case, the main product is dis-disilyldichlorosilane (Si2H5)
      2SiC12, a dichloropentasilane.<br>
      <br>
      Further, an industrial waste product, such as a disilane
      containing both chloro atoms and methyl groups, could again be
      used. A silane of this kind is then converted by hydrogenation to
      a form in which it contains only one chlorine atom, in order to
      subsequently employ the Miiller-Rochow synthesis. In the case of a
      disilane, a dichloropentasilane with methyl substituents is
      formed. One of the two chloro atoms can now be hydrogenated so
      that the Müller-Rochow synthesis can be applied once more. The
      result is an undecasilane, the methyl groups of which are of
      little importance when used as a fuel.<br>
      <br>
      As in 1a), it is also possible here to directly use a partially
      methylated chlorosilane with 2 or even several chloro atoms. C)
      The methods described in la) and Ib) can also be dimerized or
      cyclized directly with alkali metals such as lithium or alkaline
      earth metals such as magnesium. One of the two free chlorine atoms
      on the central silicon atom can also be hydrogenated and the
      dimerization can then be carried out.<br>
      <br>
      The higher silanes (SiH3) 2SiH-SiH (SiH3) 2, a hexasilane, or the
      (Si2H5) 2SiH-SiH (Si2H5) 2, a decasilane can thus be used as a
      propellant in the form of a non-ignitable mixture. Even higher
      cyclic compounds such as substituted pentasilanes are, of course,
      not self-ignitable. D) The chlorosilanes obtained by 1a) and / or
      lb) could also be chain-extended by pyrolysis, as described in
      pure silanes, as described in German Patent No. 31 39,155.
      Subsequently, the thus obtained substance would be hydrogenated to
      obtain a pure silane.<br>
      Method 2: The object according to the invention is achieved by
      hydrogenating silicon tetrachloride SiC14 or hexachlorodisilane
      Si2Cl6 either by means of lithium hydride, but preferably by
      hydrogen pressure hydrogenation on the catalyst, so that mono-<br>
      <br>
      Disilane is formed. It can, of course, also be used on mono or
      multi- Disilane, which are obtained as gaseous products in the
      case of the Cane acid decomposition, and are usually flaked off.<br>
      <br>
      These two silanes, in turn, are then reacted with liquid sodium
      potassium alloy in higher ethers, so that the monosilane is
      potassium silyl SiH3K, from which disilane forms potassium disilyl
      Si2H5K. The filtered solutions contain the two potassium compounds
      in liquid form. Both attack chlorosilanes, whereby KCl
      precipitates. The iso-octasilane (SiH3) 3Si-Si (SiH3) 3 is formed
      from hexachlorodisilane from tetrachlorosilane, for example, from
      the tetrachlorosilane, the longer-chain iso-pentasilane.<br>
      <br>
      It is also proposed to replace the above-described modified
      Müller-Rochow synthesis and the chain extension with potassium
      silane compounds in the course of the preparation of longer-chain
      silanes.<br>
      <br>
      This is done with the intention of allowing continued chain
      extensions.<br>
      <br>
      If the chlorosilanes are treated with too large a quantity of
      potassium silyl, then all the chlorates with the potassium are
      combined with KCl, and further chain extension is impossible. If,
      however, the potassium silane is added in a lesser quantity, the
      chlorosilanes formed still contain some, and in the ideal case a
      chlorine atom. This allows the Müller-Rochow synthesis to be used
      again for chain elongation, and then again to carry out chain
      lengthening by potassium silyl.<br>

        <b>Method and apparatus for operating a gas turbine with silane
          oil as fuel</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method of driving a shaft by reaction
      of silanes, preferably silane oils, with air in a double
      combustion chamber and an assiciated drive mechanism. The hydrogen
      of the silanes reacts in the first combustion chamber with an
      insufficient level of oxygen of the air supplied, thereby
      producing high temperatures. At said high temperatures, the
      nitrogen from the air supplied reacts with the silicon of the
      silane to form silicon nitride. The resultant combustion gases and
      dust and the non-combusted hydrogen are mixed in the second
      combustion chamber with a large quantity of cold compressed air,
      the hydrogen undergoing late burning, and they subsequently enter
      a turbine chamber to actuate turbine blades connected to a shaft.
      The method is particularly environmentally-friendly since no toxic
      or polluting waste gases are produced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention is directed to a method of driving a shaft
      as well as to a drive mechanism for carrying out such method.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      From DE-OS-22 31 008 it is known to use tetrasilane (Si4 H10) as a
      rocket propellant. DE 42 15 835 c2 also describes silicon
      hydrides, preferably silane oils, as rocket propellants. The
      production of such silane oils is described in DE-PS 21 39 155. In
      the systems described in these publications the silane oils are
      burned together with liquid oxygen, liquid chlorine or liquid
      fluorine.<br>
      <br>
      In the non-published German patent application P 44 37 524.7 (see
      also U.S. Pat. No. 5,730,390 of Mar. 24, 1998) a method for
      operating a reaction-type missile propulsion system and a drive
      mechanism for carrying out such method are described. The drive
      mechanism is operated in such a manner that silicon hydride
      compounds are reacted with nitrogen and/or nitrogen compounds at
      increased temperatures in the presence of an oxidizing agent for
      the hydrogen of the silicon hydride compounds. Preferably, the
      nitrogen and the oxydizing agent can be taken from the atmosphere
      of the earth so that a corresponding oxidizing agent for the
      silicon hydride compounds need not be carried along in the
      missile. Preferably, silane oils are burned as silicon hydride
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of
      driving a shaft as well as a drive mechanism therefor which
      operate with very high temperatures and a correspondingly high
      efficiency and which have little pollution effects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the invention this the following steps:<br>
      a. introducing silicon hydrides and air into the first part of a
      double combustion chamber;<br>
      b. reacting the hydrogen of the silicon hydrides with a
      sub-stoichiometric amount of oxygen of the introduced air for the
      generation of increased temperatures;<br>
      c. reacting the excess of the introduced nitrogen of the air at
      the increased temperatures with the silicon of the silicon
      hydrides for the generation of silicon nitride;<br>
      d. discharging the combustion gases and combustion dusts and the
      non-burned hydrogen portion from the first part into the second
      part of the double combustion chamber and mixing these combustion
      products with a large amount of air with after-burning of the
      hydrogen; and<br>
      e. directing the combustion gases and combustion dusts into a
      turbine chamber for driving turbine blades connected to a shaft.<br>
      <br>
      The N2 -molecule as such, notwithstanding its triple bond, is
      extremely inactive and tends to open its linkage only with
      electron bombardment, for instance in thunderstorms, and reacts
      with oxygen so that nitric oxides are formed. However, above 1400
      DEG C. hot nitrogen reacts with finely distributed silicon and
      forms silicon nitride Si3 N4. The reasons for this nitrogen
      combustion can be found in the fact that silicon, in contrast to
      carbon, cannot enter into double bonds or triple bonds. Nitrogen
      shows an especially good reaction performance with silicon hydride
      compounds. The invention takes advantage of this recognition and
      uses intentionally nitrogen or nitrogen compounds for the reaction
      with silicon hydride compounds whereby an especially efficient
      propelling system can be obtained. Nitrogen is at disposal in big
      amounts in the atmosphere so that a high efficiency with low costs
      results.<br>
      <br>
      When burning silicon hydride compounds, especially silane oils,
      with compressed air the oxygen portion reacts with the hydrogen of
      the silane chain in accordance with the equation<br>
      <br>
      4H+O2 =2H2 O.<br>
      <br>
      In this hydrogen-oxygen combustion temperatures of about 3000 DEG
      C. are reached. This temperature is sufficient in order to crack
      the N2 -molecule which is presented by the supply of the
      compressed air. According to the equation<br>
      <br>
      4N+3Si=Si3 N4<br>
      <br>
      the nitrogen radicals now attack the free silicon atoms with
      extreme vehemence. Silicon nitride is formed which has a molecular
      weight of 140 and thus is nearly three times as heavy as carbon
      dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, the cited reaction occurs only with correspondingly
      high temperatures. In the air silane oils after ignition burn only
      to develop red-brown amorphous silicon monoxide since the
      combustion substance has not enough oxygen on account of the
      rapidity of the combustion. No reaction with nitrogen takes place
      since nitrogen does not form any free radicals under these
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, at a sufficiently high temperature the silicon
      hydride compounds are ultimately thermally decomposed into Si and
      H. The highly reactive H-atoms bind the oxygen of the air for the
      generation of water. The linkage enthalpy of H2 O becoming free
      thereby supplies necessary energy for achieving high combustion
      temperatures. The N2 -dissociation increases very much above about
      2500 K. Since the oxygen is bound in water the highly reactive
      atomic nitrogen reacts with Si for the generation of Si3 N4.
      During this reaction the very high linkage enthalpy of Si3 N4 is
      liberated. It amounts to -745 kJ/mol at T=298 K.<br>
      <br>
      Since air consists of oxygen for only 20% and since the
      oxygen/hydrogen reaction is energetically more beneficial than the
      oxygen/silicon reaction, the ratio between the supply of air and
      the supply of silicon hydride can be adjusted such that a portion
      of the hydrogen is not burned while the nitrogen combustion of the
      silicon takes place quantitatively. In this I prevent the
      generation of silicon oxides altogether. With a conventional jet
      engine the 80% hydrogen of the air are coaccelerated in a
      non-burned manner. The same occurs if silicon hydrides are burned
      with an excess of air. The generated silicon oxides would prevent
      confirming of nitrogen. Accordingly, the described method provides
      an air-breathing rocket propulsion unit since no oxygen tank has
      to be carried along and the mixture of the oxygen of the air and
      the nitrogen is 100% burned.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, as silicon hydride compounds silane oils, especially
      those with a chain length of Si5 H12 to Si9 H20, are used. Such
      silane oils are described in the already mentioned DE-PS 21 39
      155. Surprisingly, such long-chain silanes are not
      self-inflammable in the air. They have the constistency of
      paraffin oils and can be manufactured simply. They can be pumped
      so that they can be supplied to an appropriate combustion chamber
      without problems.<br>
      <br>
      According to the inventive method water vapor and silicon nitride
      dusts are generated. Both substances are not toxic and do not
      represent an environmental load. The generated dusts can be
      collected by filtering the combustion gases after leaving the
      turbine chamber while the gases substantially consisting of water
      vapor can be discharged into the atmosphere. Accordingly, the
      method and the corresponding drive mechanism have very little
      pollution effects.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, compressed air is introduced into the combustion
      chamber for improving the efficiency. The air is taken from the
      environment, is compressed by means of a compressor and is
      introduced into the combustion chamber. Preferably, the compressor
      is driven by the shaft.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, air is taken from the atmosphere and is then
      preferably compressed. By contact of the air line with the walls
      of the double combustion chamber the same are cooled and thus
      protected from vaporization. The air heated to above 1500 DEG C.
      helps to initiate the N2 -dissociation. Of course, the combustion
      chamber has to consist of metals suitable for this.<br>
      <br>
      In order to save costs with the inventive method but also in order
      to completely exclude the silicon/oxygen combustion it can be
      advantageous to add powdered silicon or metal silicides, for
      instance magnesium silicide, to the silicon hydrides. It is known
      that magnesium reacts with nitrogen with the discharge of a large
      amount of heat.<br>
      <br>
      After the start of the described combustion in the first chamber
      of the double combustion chamber and after the adjustment of the
      corresponding operating temperatures the method will run in the
      described manner, and a part of the non-burned hydrogen together
      with the hot H2 O--Si3 N4 mixture with a temperature between 2500
      and 3000 DEG C. will flow into the second part of the double
      combustion chamber (after-burning chamber). These gases are much
      too hot in order to drive a shaft by means of turbine blades.
      Therefore, in the second part of the combustion chamber heat is
      directly used for compressing cold air.<br>
      <br>
      Cold air compressed by the compressor is introduced into the upper
      part of the second combustion chamber through controllers. The
      combustion gases having a temperature of more than 2500 DEG C. are
      cooled with a multiple amount of air, wherein simultaneously the
      non-burned hydrogen is after-burned. In this manner large amounts
      of turbine gases convertable into work are generated, which are
      introduced into a turbine chamber and drive the turbine blades
      there. As already mentioned, the turbine shaft is connected to the
      air compressor.<br>
      <br>
      Practically, the outlet of the turbine chamber leads into a filter
      chamber which has an outlet leading to the atmosphere. In the
      filter chamber the silicon nitride dusts generated by the reaction
      are retained so that substantially only water vapor is discharged
      into the atmosphere.<br>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention is described below in detail by means of an example
      in connection with the drawing.<br>

      The sole FIGURE of the drawing shows a schematic longitudinal
      section through a drive mechanism formed according to the

      <br>
      <b>SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The drive mechanism consists of a housing including, in the FIGURE
      from left to right, in succesion, a main combustion chamber 1, an
      afterburner chamber 2, a turbine chamber 3 and a compressor
      chamber 4. The housing is restricted between the several chambers
      so that appropriate connection channels are formed. Of course, the
      housing is comprised of appropriate materials or is provided with
      suitable linings in order to withstand the increased temperatures
      (up to 3000 DEG C.), especially those occuring in the main
      combustion chamber 1, as well as the occuring increased pressures.<br>
      <br>
      A fuel mixing chamber 7 is located at the left end of the FIGURE.
      A conduit 10 for the supply of silane oil and a conduit 11 for the
      supply of silicon/metal silicide dust open into the mixing chamber
      7. Furthermore, an appropriate mixing device is provided within
      the mixing chamber 7. A channel extends from the mixing chamber 7
      into the main combustion chamber 1. A plurality of air supply
      apertures 8 are annularly disposed laterally from the central
      supply channel for the fuel (silane oil+Si/metal silicide).<br>
      <br>
      These air supply apertures are connected to a supply conduit 12
      for hot air annularly surrounding the main combustion chamber 1,
      the afterburner chamber 2 and the turbine chamber 3. The supply
      conduit 12 for hot air is connected to an outlet 17 of the
      compression chamber 4. Furthermore, the compression chamber 4 has
      an outlet 18 which is connected to a supply line 9 for cold air
      which laterally opens into the afterburner chamber 2. The supply
      line 9 for cold air extends through a controller 13 by means of
      which the supply of cold air into the afterburner chamber can be
      regulated.<br>
      <br>
      A shaft 5 is centrally disposed within the turbine chamber 3 and
      within the compressor chamber 4 and extends through both chambers.
      The shaft 5 is rotated by the reactions taking place within the
      main combustion chamber and the afterburner chamber and can
      supply, for instance, mechanical energy or electrical energy
      through a generator. Turbine blades are disposed at the shaft
      within the turbine chamber 3. These turbine blades are driven by
      the combustion gases or combustion dusts entering into the turbine
      chamber from the afterburner chamber and rotating the shaft 5
      hereby. Blades disposed within the compressor chamber 4 compress
      air entering through inlets 6 by means of the rotating shaft 5.
      The air is introduced into the conduits 9 and 12 through the
      outlets 17 and 18.<br>
      <br>
      The turbine chamber 3 is connected through outlets for the
      combustion gases or combustion dusts to filter boxes 19 in which
      replaceable filter sacks 20 are disposed. These filter sacks 20
      retain the dusts (substantially silicon nitride) while the
      combustion gases (substantially water vapor) are discharged to the
      atmosphere through outlets 21.<br>
      <br>
      The above-described drive mechanism operates in the following
      manner:<br>
      <br>
      Silane oil is pumped into the mixing chamber 7 through the conduit
      10. Metal silicide dust is supplied through the conduit 11. These
      components are mixed within the mixing chamber. The generated
      mixture is introduced into the main combustion chamber 1 through
      the corresponding introduction conduit. The main combustion
      chamber 1 receives compressed hot air through the introduction
      apertures 8. The oxygen of the air reacts vehemently with the
      hydrogen of the silane oil. The nitrogen of the air reacts with
      the silicon of the silane oil and generates silicon nitride by the
      generated very high temperatures. The generated combustion gases
      or combustion dusts (with an excess of H2) enter the afterburner
      chamber 2 into which compressed cold air is introduced through the
      conduit 9. The introduced cold air causes a combustion of the
      excess H2 to form water vapor. The turbine blades in the turbine
      chamber 3 are applied with the gases and dusts discharged by the
      afterburner chamber 2 so that the shaft 5 is rotated. The
      corresponding gases and dusts leave the turbine chamber through
      the outlets 16, enter the filter sacks 20 within the filter
      chambers 19 in which the dusts are filtered, and are discharged
      into the atmosphere through the outlets 21.<br>

        </b><b>Method for powering an engine by combustion of silicon

          nitride lubrication</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for powering a motor by using a
      combination of an explosion motor and a turbine. The combustion
      reaction in said combination occurs by the reaction of a variable
      mixture consisting of silicon hydrogens, silicon powder in a water
      solution and air, whereby water and silicon nitride are produced
      as exhaust gas. The inner wall of the motor should be coated with
      silicon nitride, which continuously and simultaneously takes place
      during the combustion process. A sufficient lubricating film
      consisting of silicon nitride is always is always provided in the
      fringe area between the inner wall of the motor and the combustion
      chamber so that no friction occurs. After being expelled from the
      explosion engine, the excess heat in the combustion gases is mixed
      with cold, compressed air, which is then used to drive a turbine
      whose shaft is coupled to the shaft of the explosion engine to
      enable the latter to run uniformly. By mixing the exhaust gases
      with cold air, the combustion gases are cooled off so that the
      silicon nitride can be filtered as solid dust during the end phase
      and subsequently processed industrially.<br>

      [0001] By German patent 196 12 07 it is known to burn silicon
      hydrides with air in a turbine with two combustion chambers.
      Dispersed silicon powder or dispersed metal suicides are added to
      the fuel in order to completely burn the nitrogen of the air.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] For example, the stoichiometric combustion equation for a
      heptasilane Si7H16 mixed with silicon powder with air consisting
      of 20% oxygen and 80% nitrogen is<br>
      16H+402-&gt;8H2O (equation 1)<br>
      <br>
      7Si+16N2+17 dispersed Si-&gt;8Si3N4 (equation 2)<br>
      <br>
      [0003] It is the object of the present invention to describe a
      method, as supplement of German patent 196 12 507, for driving one
      and the same shaft primarily with an explosion engine and
      additionally and secondarily through the mechanical rotary forces
      which are generated in a joined turbine chamber in which the very
      hot combustion gases from the explosion engine are mixed with cold
      air sucked from the atmosphere and are cooled in this manner. The
      dusty silicon nitride generated thereby is captured and
      subsequently processed for the generation of ammonia, as known
      from German patent application 100 48 472.7. A mixture of air and
      not self-igniting higher silane has the characteristic to
      immediately ignite when compressed. Accordingly, one can desist
      from an ignition spark in an explosion engine operated with
      silane. The difference with regard to a conventional Diesel engine
      consists in the fact that one can desist from the high pressures
      necessary for igniting a Diesel air mixture. On the other side,
      the silane Diesel fuel cannot be injected during the compression
      phase since it ignites with the air untimely. In place of that the
      silane oil is only injected at the time of the maximum compression
      of the working space volume with high pressure and ignites
      instantaneously (see FIGS. 2A, b). Especially, conventional Wankel
      engines have the additional disadvantage that the working space is
      insufficiently sealed so that a carbon Diesel operation is
      practically impossible on account of the necessary high pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] When operating with silanes the combusiton temperature
      within the explosion engine is very high since the nitrogen does
      not cool the total reaction as inert passive gas, as this is the
      case with conventional combustion reactions, but acts as an
      oxidant, i.e. supplies additional combustion heat. Water H2O and
      silicon nitride Si3N4 are generated as combustion products.
      Therefore, the inner space of the engine has to be coated with
      ceramic. However, silicon nitride is used as material for the
      construction of turbines and engines just on account of its
      hardness and abrasion resistance and heat resistance up to
      1900[deg.] C. If the engine parts adjacent to the working spaces
      are coated with silicon nitride the inner walls of the engine
      consist of the same substance as the combustion product Si3N4
      which is continuously generated in the inner space of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Since the engine parts are cooled from the outside a kind
      of solid-liquid interface layer is formed on the inner wall of the
      engine in which the substance silicon nitride is present in
      different phases at temperatures up to 1900[deg.] C. However,
      since silicon nitride is always present in excess on account of
      the continuous new generation a mechanical abrasion of the engine
      walls does not occur. Simultaneously, the interface layer acts as
      sealant or lubricant.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Since conventional explosion engines work at substantially
      lower temperatures the efficiency of the described silane
      explosion engine is substantially higher.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The amount of the injected silane oil is stoichiometrically
      dependent on the amount of the oxygen from the sucked air since
      the formation of silicon monoxide is suppressed. Accordingly, the
      major part of the 80% nitrogen portion of the sucked air is not
      influenced by the reaction with the silane. In place of that this
      reacts with additionally introduced silicon powder (see reaction
      equations 1 and 2).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] This silicon powder can be either injected as dispersion
      together with silane or it is already blown in during the
      compression phase together with air or it is used as dispersion
      with water (see FIGS. 1B, b). In addition to that additional water
      can prevent an overheating of the engine and simultaneously does
      additional work by evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It has to be taken care that the total amount of silicon is
      not larger than the total amount of nitrogen in every combustion
      process since otherwise silicon would remain which might cause
      abrasion. This is especially important during a cold start phase.
      The first two operation steps 1 and 2 of the silane Wankel engine
      are shown in FIG. 1 while the operation steps 3 and 4 are shown in
      FIG. 2 schematicly. The central triangular rotary piston rotates
      anticlockwisely therein. The three sides of the rotary piston are
      characterized by the letters a, b and c and form together with the
      combustion chamber wall three part-ranges. In these part-ranges
      sequentially different processes take place during the course of
      rotation of the rotary piston which are shown in the drawing.
      After the operation step 4 the combustion cycle is terminated. The
      next begins again with operation step 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The combustion products discharged from the explosion
      engine have still an enormous temperature. In order to use this
      energy in the second part of the engine the hot combustion gases
      are mixed with the multiple amount of compressed cold air. This
      mixture operates a turbine for the additional generation of energy
      whose shaft is connected to the shaft of the explosion engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Consequently, the silicon nitride cooled in this manner can
      be subsequently captured or filtered and does not enter into the
      atmosphere but into an replacable container.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Furthermore, if a Wankel engine is used the coupling of the
      shaft improves the running characteristic of the same just at
      small speeds.<br>

      The invention relates to a novel energy concept that relates to an
      artificial silicon-nitrogen cycle and that constitutes the
      complement to the natural carbon-oxygen cycle. Pure silicon is
      produced from sand using solar energy. By repeated Muller-Rochow
      synthesis with silylchlorides the silicon is converted to higher
      silanes. The silylchlorides used are either silicons derived from
      chemical wastes or are economically produced from monosilanes or
      disilanes. They are mixed with silicon powder and combusted with
      air to give H2O and silicon nitride Si3H4, thereby generating
      power. The silicon nitride is converted to ammonia NH3 under
      alkaline conditions, thereby producing silicates. Part of the NH3
      is converted to follow-on products, the major portion however is
      combusted with air to give H2O and N2, thereby generating power.
      The N2 cycle is thereby closed.<br>

      <br>
      [0001] In the periodic system of elements silicon is situated
      directly below carbon and is very similar to it. However, the
      hydrogen compounds of the silicon have some differences with
      respect to the hydrocarbons. Already Friedrich Wöhler discovered
      the silicon homologue of the methan CH4, i.e. monosilane SiH4,
      during the change of the century. At the beginning of the 20th
      century Prof. Alfred Stock, Karlsruhe was able to produce the
      longer-chain homologues of the hydrocarbons ethane, propane and
      butane, namely the disilane Si2H6, trisilane Si3H8 and tetrasilane
      n-Si4H10 which, however, are all self-igniting in air.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] 1951 the silane research started in Cologne with Prof.
      Franz Fehér. At the beginning of the seventies his assistant Peter
      Plichta succeeded in producing the so-called higher silanes of the
      pentasilane Si5H12 to the decasilane Si10R22 for the first time
      which were unknown until this date (German patent 21 39 155
      (1976)). One came to know that-in contrast to the opinion up to
      this date higher silanes do not become instable with increasing
      chain length but, in contrast, become more stable so that, for
      instance, already the heptasilane (n-Si7H16) is no more<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Copper Oxide in the Direct Process, a Dangerous Mixture?").
      self-ingniting at ambient temperature. Higher silanes are
      handle-safe, non-toxid liquids similar to diesel oil and thus
      pumpable.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Silanes can be used as energy producing fuels (German
      patent 42 15 835 (1994), U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,096 (1998)).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In the following the combustion of hydrocarbons is compared
      with the combustion of silicon hydrides.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] As one knows, when combusting hydrocarbons not only the
      hydrogen portion but also the carbon portion reacts only with the
      20% oxygen portion of the air:<br>
      H2+1/202-&gt;H2O and C+O2-&gt;CO2<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Disadvantages: The nitrogen portion of the air which is 80%
      remains unused. Furthermore, the breathing poison carbon dioxide
      is generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In contrast to carbon, silicon has the characteristic to
      form a very stable nitride compound, i.e. the industrially known
      silicon(tetra)nitride Si3N4:<br>
      3Si+2N2-&gt;Si3N4+750 kJ<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The technical production of Si3N4 was carried out up to now
      by the reaction of molecular nitrogen with Si powder at
      1100-1400[deg.] C. However, tests carried out at Wacker Chemie AG
      have shown that even cold (about 200[deg.] C.) nitrogen reacts
      with silicon (catalytically) or ignites (Congress "Silicon for the
      Chemical Industry V", May 29-Jun. 2, 2000, Tromso (Norway), speech
      of Dr. G. Tamme: "Silicon Cyclone Dust and Copper Oxide in the
      Direct Process, a Dangerous Mixture?").<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In an air breathing driving mechanism the following
      reactions are possible:<br>
      3Si+2N2-&gt;Si3N4+750 kJ (I)<br>
      H2+1/202-&gt;H2O (II)<br>
      Si+O2-&gt;SiO2 (III)<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Advantages: The nitrogen of the air can be co-utilized
      during the combustion of silanes.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] It is the aim of a combustion with silicon hydrides to
      combust the hydrogen portion stoichiometrically with oxygen of the
      air in a combustion chamber (as with hydrocarbons), however, to
      simultaneously let the nitrogen portion of the air react with
      silicon. In order to reach the complete combustion of the added
      nitrogen of the air one might add dispersed silicon powder to the
      silane fuel (German patent 196 12 507 (1997), U.S. Pat. No.
      5,996,332 (1999)). The silane/silicon mixture remains pumpable.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] For instance, if one selects the n-heptasilane
      Si7H16(boiling point 226.8[deg.] C., density 0.859 g/cm&lt;3&gt;)
      the following stoichiometrical combustion of a normal air mixture
      consisting of 20% O2 and 80% N2 results:<br>
      16H+402-&gt;8H2O<br>
      7Si+16N2+additional 17 dispersed Si-&gt;8Si3N4<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The chemical equations show that indeed the sucked amount
      of air can be used as oxidizing agent with a yield of 100%. During
      this reaction the inert gas nitrogen has the function of an
      oxidant. Furthermore, during this reaction no breathing poison but
      in addition to water only silicon nitride is generated which can
      be even collected or filtered.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In order to be able to carry out such a combustion in
      practice a jet engine was already developed which manipulates the
      very hot combustion gases in two combustion chambers arranged
      behind one another in such a manner that a shaft can be driven
      (German patent 196 12 507 (1997), U.S. Pat. No. 5,996,332 (1999)).
      This jet engine serves as substitute for conventional explosion
      motors. Furthermore, an air breathing rocket motor (without
      oxidation tank) is known which is to be used in supersonic
      aircrafts and space shuttles (German patents 44 37 524 (1996) and
      44 39 073 (1996)).<br>
      <br>
      [0016] With the German patent applications 100 46 037 of Sep. 18,
      2000and of Sep. 29, 2000 it is known to produce higher silanes by
      the repeated use of the modified Muller-Rochow synthesis (i.e.
      with silylchlorides instead of methylchlorides) in a cheap manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Accordingly, the presuppositions are present to make
      silanes for the central component of the energy supply of the
      future.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It is the object of the present invention to indicate a
      novel chemical, inorganic cycle according to which silicon
      dioxide, the main component of the earth crust, at first is
      converted into pure silicon by means of the sunlight. Thereafter,
      higher silanes produced therefrom are combusted with nitrogen of
      the air with the production of energy wherein silicon nitride
      Si3N4 is generated. This Si3N4 is converted into ammonia NH3 in an
      alkaline manner. During this reaction silicates are generated
      either which, however, have not to be introduced into the cycle
      since SiO2 is available without any costs. When combusting NH3,
      again N2 is generated with the production of energy so that the
      nitrogen cycle is closed.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] On principle, the individual steps are known, can be found
      in chemistry books or are already protected.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] However, the present invention describes the idea to
      connect the individual known steps to a cyclic system which is
      similar to that of the natural carbon cycle. The conventional
      carbon cycle consists of the dualism or the symbiosis of the
      organisms of the plants on the one side and of the living beings
      on the other. side: CO2 is assimilated in the plants by
      photosynthesis with the assistance of sunlight and O2 is
      generated. The products of hydrocarbons generated in the plants
      during this procedure serve as food for animals and human beings.
      The oxygen generated by the plants is breathed by the animals and
      human beings wherein energy is produced. During this procedure CO2
      is generated which is needed by the plants for surviving.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] During the millions of years of the evolution a balance
      adjusted which keeps the carbon dioxide portion in the atmosphere
      constant. However, this balance has become more and more unsteady
      with the beginning of the industrial era up to now. The more and
      more increasing industrial CO2 output threatening the whole
      ecological system worldwide is accompanied by the fact that the
      crude oil reserves become more and more shorter.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to
      show a way out of this more and more critical situation.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The advantages of the use of silanes as fuels is the
      unlimited availability of the element silicon in contrast to the
      very limited crude oil sources. 25% of the earth crust consist of
      silicon. For instance, sand has the chemical formula SiO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] (I) The high demand for pure silicon can be met by reducing
      the sand (SiO2) with coal and solar current in an electrical arc
      furnace in situ to obtain pure silicon. In the same manner as the
      sunlight provides in the plants for the use of electrons for the
      C-C-coupling, in the here described inorganic cycle electrical
      current is generated by means of solar cells consisting of
      silicon, the generated electrical current being required for. the
      production of pure silicon in the arc furnace.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The pure CO2 generated in this process can be used for the
      generation of the basic organic chemical substance methanol so
      that the CO2 does not enter the atmosphere. Methanol is an
      upgraded form of coal. The hydrogen required for the upgrading of
      CO2 for methanol CH3OH according to the formula CO2+3H2
      -&gt;CH3OH+H2O is generated by electrolysis wherein the electrical
      current necessary herefor is generated by the solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] (II) In the next step higher silanes are produced from the
      silicon by the modified Müller-Rochow synthesis with
      silylchlorides. For this, as silylchlorides ideally industrial
      waste of the silicon chemistry, as methyl chlorodisilanes, which
      otherwise have to be discarded in an expensive manner, is to be
      used. Alternatively, one obtains the silylchlorides by the
      chlorination of monosilanes and disilanes generated in large
      amounts during the acidic decomposition of magnesium silicide.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] (III) In the third step the higher silanes are combusted to
      water H2O and silicon nitride Si3N4 with the addition of dispersed
      silicon powder with atmospheric air (20% O2, 80% N2). This silicon
      nitride Si3N4 which is also required in the industry is a
      grey-white completely non-toxic dust which melts only at
      temperatures of about 1900[deg.] C. with decomposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] (IV) Si3N4 can be solved in lyes and can be converted into
      ammonia NH3. The silicates which are generated in this process are
      harmless and have not to be recycled since sand SiO2 is available
      in large amounts. Parts of the ammonia can be used for the
      production of artificial fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] (V) However, the major part should be combusted in the next
      step with atmospheric air to nitrogen N2 and water H2O again with
      a high output of heat. By this, nitrogen is again introduced into
      the atmosphere which is then again available for the combustion of
      the higher silanes.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The above-described reactions result in their cooperation
      in a novel chemical cycle which is shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The described silicon-nitrogen cycle represents a
      completely novel energy concept. This cycle is the artificial
      complement to the natural carbon-oxygen cycle. The silicon era was
      announced by the introduction of silicon rectifiers, transistors,

      </div>
      <br>
      Producing silane fuels by high-pressure synthesis comprises
      producing monosilane from finely divided etched crystalline
      silicon at 300[deg] C using a catalyst, contacting the monosilane
      with silicon and catalyst at a temperature below 300[deg] C and
      performing a third step to increase the chain length of the
      silanes to produce a fuel with a consistency and boiling point
      similar to that of diesel fuel. CHEMICAL ENGINEERING - Preferred
      Process: The catalyst is e.g. subgroup elements or their mixtures
      with metal oxides. The product comprises n- and iso-silanes with
      an average chain length of about five silicon atoms.<br>
      <br>
      The gaseous silanes: monosilane (SiH4) to 80% and disilane (Si2H6)
      to 15%, as well as the liquid silanes trisilan (Si3H8) and
      tetrasilane are formed during the decomposition of magnesium
      silicide (Mg2Si) in hot acid, which is called Stocksch's method
      (Si4H10). Higher liquid silanes were produced by F. Fehér in 1974,
      after winning three liters of a liquid crude silane mixture in
      1970. For example, he gained over 700 grams of n- and
      iso-pentasilane. Previously, in 1970, his university assistant, P.
      Plichta, had succeeded in obtaining silanes with five, six, seven,
      eight, nine and ten silicon atoms as pure pure iso- and
      iso-isomers in the milliliter range by simple pyrolysis of tri-
      and tetrasilane DE 21 39 155). It was found that higher silanes,
      in contrast to the theory (A. Stock), are completely stable at
      room temperature. The proven false view of the instability of the
      silane is still 36 years later still in the chemist's books in
      this world.<br>
      <br>
      While the boranes prepared by Stock were used, which led to the
      award of a Nobel Prize, the liquid silanes first came into contact
      with DE 44 37 524, because P. Plichta demonstrated their nitrogen
      combustion in 1994. In 1970 the monosilane was still fired at the
      only silane institute in the world because nobody had grasped its
      importance for the production of photosilicon and computer chip
      silicon. In the meantime, monosilane is produced industrially in
      quantities of thousands of tons.<br>
      <br>
      The representation of raw silicon in Norway is very expensive.
      Accordingly, chlorosilanes and monosilane are so expensive for the
      production of photosilicon that the generation of electricity from
      light via solar cells does not occur to the extent that
      electricity can be produced on the roofs of buildings all over the
      world. With the patent applications AZ 10 2006 023 515.0 and AZ 10
      2006 029 282.0, P. Plichta was able to prove that oil-containing
      sands / shales can be very cheap photosilicon. As early as the
      year 2000, P. Plichta had filed a major synthesis of higher
      silanes by means of a modified Müller-Rochow process (AZ 100 59
      625.8). In 2006, P. Plichta developed a "silane fuel cell with
      pure nitrogen silicon combustion from fed-in air." According to P.
      Plichta in 2006, a "vehicle engine with silane nitrogen drive for
      the generation of three-phase current for driving a motor vehicle
      without mobile engine parts" (AZ 10 2006 009 907.9) "(AZ 10 2006
      028 063.6).2003<br>
      <br>
      P. Plichta and A. Kornath (University of Dortmund) succeeded in
      developing a large-scale synthesis of pure cyclopentasilane by
      means of an organic base diphenyl dichlorosilane (Phe2CL2Si) for
      the first time. In the meantime, Plichta's assistant, B. Hidding,
      2003 (University of the German Armed Forces, Munich), had proved
      that all combustion spirals published by F. Fehér were wrong.
      Plichta, Hidding, and Kornath also demonstrated that the
      combustion tyne of cyclopentasilan, which was measured by N. Auner
      1998 (Unversität Frankfurt) at the ICT Berghausen, is completely
      false.<br>
      <br>
      Since liquid silanes will be the fuel of the future, it is
      necessary to develop a process to present liquid silanes so
      cheaply that they will completely replace the fuels gasoline,
      diesel and liquid hydrogen. At the instigation of P. Plichta at
      the University of Dortmund 2003 preliminary experiments were
      undertaken.<br>
      <br>
      The object of the present invention is to develop a process for
      producing gaseous and liquid silanes from inexpensive crystalline
      silicon. The process is characterized by synthesizing monosilane
      as a whole in two steps in order to convert it into liquid
      silanes. These liquid silanes could then be pyrolyzed if it is
      necessary not to produce self-ignitable silanes.<br>
      Preliminary tests have shown that etched silicon reacts with
      monosilane (SiH4) with the addition of a catalyst in an autoclave.
      The choice of the catalyst such as platinum or copper is
      apparently not important. More importantly, it is very difficult
      to grind crystalline photosilicon obtained from oil sands / oil
      shales and to treat them with hydrogen under pressure at
      temperatures of over 300 °. The SiH4 / H2 mixture obtained in this
      way can then immediately be converted into a second autoclave, the
      main being trisilane (Si3H8). The gas mixture of hydrogen,
      monosilane, disilane, trisilane and tetrasilane can then be
      converted into a third autoclave at temperatures of about 250 ° C.
      and react again with crystalline silicon. The higher silane
      mixtures obtained in this way can be fractionated in vacuo.
      Similar to gasoline or diesel, this fuel is also a mixture of n-
      and iso-silanes with a high proportion of pentasilane.<br>
      <br>
      Since crystalline silicon is obtained directly from the production
      of oil sand / oil shale because silicon fluoride (SiF4) is
      liberated (AZ 59607219.8 P. Plichta) and is converted into
      aluminum fluoride by means of aluminum grits in a termite process,
      the production of cheap synthetic silicon-containing gasolines is
      nothing More in the way. The dangers of the oil shortage are now
      done. <br>

      By patent application, it is known that liquid silanes (a mixture
      of Si3H8 to Si8H18) can be burned to the point that no silicon
      oxides are formed, but only water vapor, amorphous silicon nitride
      and the main atomic hydrogen. (Plichta) According to
      Gibbs-Helmholtz equation: F = ?H + ?S, a molecule Si3N4 is formed
      during the union of three Si atoms with four N atoms, which is
      important for entropy. Si3N4 (Wöhler 1859) is indeed a solid noble
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      The patent has already been attempted in a two-chamber motor
      without mechanical elements to drive a shaft with two turbine
      elements in such a way that heat is converted into rotational
      energy by silane combustion, the heat being cooled down by
      compressed cold air and gas pressure being generated.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on the object of constructing a
      motor vehicle motor which no longer has mechanical motor elements,
      such as pistons or washers, and thus does not have to be
      lubricated, characterized in that two stoichiometric equations are
      used in the invention which prove that the method
      Thermodynamically not only true, but also technically feasible.<br>
      <br>
      The method is now to be explained in detail with reference to the
      appendix: 1. The system shows an air intake funnel (1). 2. Behind
      it is a compression turbine, which is driven electrically (2), (+
      -). 3. Compressed air is conducted into a combustion chamber
      through the air channel (1), (2) (FIG. 4). 4. Liquid silane or
      compressed gaseous silane is injected into the same combustion
      chamber (11), (12). 5. The combustion chambers (4), (6), (7) are
      of silicon ceramics such as silicon nitride or silicon carbide.
      According to the state of the art, an SiC chamber can be produced
      three-dimensionally by a machine in such a way that it contains a
      network of cooling channels. (These are not explicitly shown in
      the drawing. ) 6. Silanes are oxidized by heat during the heat so
      that the air oxygen and the air nitrogen are stoichiometrically
      combusted, which is to be represented by means of a hexasilane:
      2Si6H14 + 7O2 + 8N2? 4Si3N4 + 14H2O + ?W The amount of nitrogen
      unburned per unit time is calculated according to the equation
      41/2Si6H14 + 18N2? 9Si3N4 + 63H1 +? W is oxidized and a large
      amount of atomic hydrogen is released.<br>
      <br>
      7. Since the motor housing (4) is extremely loaded despite cooling
      at the occurring temperatures of about 3000 °, it is absolutely
      necessary to inject a calculated amount of water (3) at a
      particular time. Here, the water evaporates and generates
      pressure, while the pressure drops due to the disappearance of the
      nitrogen. Overall, heat of 3,000 ° is converted into gas pressure
      of about 1000 °. 8. The highly compressed water vapor / silicon
      nitride oil mist (14H2O + 13Si3N4) and the atomic hydrogen (63H1)
      are chased through a Lavalle nozzle (6). The atomic hydrogen has a
      lifetime of half a second so that it reaches the chamber 7 as the
      H atom. 9. Behind the Lavalle nozzle the pressure continues to
      rise in the funnel-shaped space (7). 10. In order to burn the
      atomic hydrogen with oxygen, cold compressed air is supplied to
      each time unit via supply lines (5). This creates further heat and
      water vapor. It is necessary to come down from the high
      temperature to about 300 ° by further feeding compressed air.<br>
      <br>
      All in all, heat is simply converted into work and the large
      turbine (8) is driven. 11. Behind the large gas turbine (8), which
      generates alternating current for the drive of the motor vehicle
      and the compressed air pumps, the now 300 ° hot mixture of water
      vapor, air and silicon nitride powder is to be filtered (9). The
      dust filter acts like a silencer. The silicon nitride is collected
      in the dust filter (9), the filter wall being applied to a screen
      jacket. 12.200 ° hot water vapor and air escape (10). 13. The gas
      turbine (8) is connected to a three-phase alternator (13). The
      electric current (+ -) is transmitted to the electric motors
      driving the wheels of the motor vehicle (Patent No. 14). 1. The
      system shows an air intake funnel (1). 2. Behind it is a
      compression turbine, which is driven electrically (2), (+ -). 3.
      Compressed air is conducted into a combustion chamber through the
      air channel (1), (2) (FIG. 4).<br>
      <br>
      4. Liquid silane or compressed gaseous silane is injected into the
      same combustion chamber (11), (12). 5. The combustion chambers
      (4), (6), (7) are of silicon ceramics such as silicon nitride or
      silicon carbide. According to the state of the art, an SiC chamber
      can be produced three-dimensionally by a machine in such a way
      that it contains a network of cooling channels. (These are not
      explicitly shown in the drawing. ) 6. Silanes are oxidized by heat
      during the heat so that the air oxygen and the air nitrogen are
      stoichiometrically combusted, which is to be represented by a
      hexasilane: 2Si6H14 + 7O2 + 8N2? 4Si3N4 + 14H2O + ?W The amount of
      nitrogen unburned per unit time is calculated according to the
      equation 41/2Si6H14 + 18N2? 9Si3N4 + 63H1 +? W is oxidized and a
      large amount of atomic hydrogen is released. 7. Since the motor
      housing (4) is extremely loaded despite cooling at the occurring
      temperatures of approx. 3,000 °, it is absolutely necessary to
      inject a calculated amount of water (3) at a particular time.<br>
      <br>
      Here, the water evaporates and generates pressure, while the
      pressure drops due to the disappearance of the nitrogen. Overall,
      heat of 3,000 ° is converted into gas pressure of about 1000 °. 8.
      The highly compressed water vapor / silicon nitride oil mist

      <br>
      7. Since the motor housing (4) is extremely loaded despite cooling
      at the occurring temperatures of about 3000 °, it is absolutely
      necessary to inject a calculated amount of water (3) at a
      particular time. Here, the water evaporates and generates
      pressure, while the pressure drops due to the disappearance of the
      nitrogen. Overall, heat of 3,000 ° is converted into gas pressure
      of about 1000 °. 8. The highly compressed water vapor / silicon
      nitride oil mist (14H2O + 13Si3N4) and the atomic hydrogen (63H1)
      are chased through a Lavalle nozzle (6). The atomic hydrogen has a
      lifetime of half a second so that it reaches the chamber 7 as the
      H atom. 9. Behind the Lavalle nozzle the pressure continues to
      rise in the funnel-shaped space (7). 10. In order to burn the
      atomic hydrogen with oxygen, cold compressed air is supplied to
      each time unit via supply lines (5). This creates further heat and
      water vapor. It is necessary to come down from the high
      temperature to about 300 ° by further feeding compressed air.<br>
      <br>
      All in all, heat is simply converted into work and the large
      turbine (8) is driven. 11. Behind the large gas turbine (8), which
      generates alternating current for the drive of the motor vehicle
      and the compressed air pumps, the now 300 ° hot mixture of water
      vapor, air and silicon nitride powder is to be filtered (9). The
      dust filter acts like a silencer. The silicon nitride is collected
      in the dust filter (9), the filter wall being applied to a screen
      jacket. 12.200 ° hot water vapor and air escape (10). 13. The gas
      turbine (8) is connected to a three-phase alternator (13). The
      electric current (+ -) is transmitted to the electric motors
      driving the wheels of the motor vehicle (Patent No. 14).<br>
      <br>
      While a steam-powered locomotive has an efficiency of about 10%
      and a high-tech TDI motor vehicle has an efficiency of 45%, the
      present silane nitrogen drive achieves an efficiency of more than
      90% in the illustrated form. Precisely because silanes
      disintegrate in the heat and thereby heat is released and atomic
      hydrogen, the foundations of thermodynamics have to be
      recalculated. The resulting dusty Si 3 N 4 is collected in a
      filter bag and fed into the chemical industry and processed into
      ammonia by the prior art.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A method for the recovery of crystalline silicon from liquid
      silanes used for hydrogen storage in fuel cells or engines with no
      moving parts, in which the silicon radicals left after the removal
      of atomic hydrogen are cooled to form crystalline silicon which
      can be recycled to the silane production process, while the atomic
      hydrogen rapidly combines to form molecular hydrogen for use in
      the fuel cell. A method for the recovery of crystalline silicon
      (I) from liquid silanes used for storing hydrogen in fuel cells or
      engines with no moving parts, in which the silicon radicals left
      after the removal of atomic hydrogen form (I) on cooling, so that
      the silicon obtained can be recycled to the silane production
      process; this offers a new approach to silicon production which
      should be changed due to the cost of carbon and electricity, while
      the silicon formed can be used again (crystalline (I) has until
      now been obtained by the pyrolysis of chlorosilanes). In this way
      silicon can perform the functions required of a metal hydride
      storage medium and the hydrogen from the silanes can, e.g. keep a
      fuel cell running so that the rest of the silicon acts as an
      accumulator which admittedly stores no electrons but stores atomic
      hydrogen which has a half-life of 0.5 second before it combines to
      form molecular hydrogen. Skilful arrangement should enable the
      effective operation of a fuel cell and replace the prior-art
      chemical process (pyrolysis of silicon radicals with nitrogen)
      because, whereas in a scramjet atomic hydrogen has to leave the
      jet nozzle unburnt due to its low molecular weight, in a car the
      fuel cell supplies useful current directly, while the silicon
      atoms crystallise out on cooling and do not migrate into the fuel
      cell.<br>
      <br>
      With patent application AZ 10 2006 041 605.8 "Pressure synthesis
      of higher silanes" (P. Plichta) and with AZ 10 2006 028 063.6
      "Silane fuel cell with pure nitrogen / silicon combustion from fed
      air" (P. Plichta) and AZ 10 2006 009 907.9 " (P. Plichta), it is
      known that liquid silanes are excellently suitable as hydrogen
      storage media because the silane chain decomposes in atomic
      hydrogen and in silicon radicals on heating. See: (AZ 10 2006 038
      912.3) "Method for operating a single-stage blasting machine in
      the sub-, over- and hypersonic range: scramjet, which
      stoichiometrically burns liquid silanes with the 78% nitrogen
      content of the fed air, the hot, unburned Atomic hydrogen of the
      silane chain with its Mg of 1 represents the main thrust element.
      (Plichta, P.)<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on the object of using atomic /
      molecular hydrogen H1 / H2 as energy storage means with the aid of
      silicon / silanes using a cyclic method. That the recovery of the
      pyrolytically separated atomic / crystalline silicon is used
      worldwide. Thus, it becomes possible to drastically reduce the
      production cost of the fuel silane. In simple terms, liquid
      silanes represent an accumulator that does not store electrons but
      hydrogen. For decades, we have been looking for a metal hydride
      store.<br>
      <br>
      In the catalytic representation, for example, of pentasilane (AZ
      10 2006 041 605.8) by pressing monosilane onto the etched silicon,
      neo-pentasilane Si (Si H 3) 4 would have to be formed. A simple
      consideration shows that such an isomeric silane has a much lower
      boiling point than the n-pentasilane and the iso-pentasilane (DE
      21 39 155) "Process for the preparation of higher silanes and
      germanenes" (P. Plichta). The cruciform compound neo-pentasilane
      decomposes to four silicon radicals at about 300 ° C. during the
      heat and provides heat upon decomposition (AZ 10 2006 038 912.3)
      (P. Plichta). The remaining twelve atomic hydrogen atoms have a
      half-life of half a second before they turn into molecular
      hydrogen H2 with the release of heat. This hydrogen can now be
      used to drive a fuel cell or a motor without mechanical elements.
      The remaining silicon radicals can be converted back into
      crystalline silicon by cooling, so that this silicon can be
      returned to the production process of silanes by collecting.<br>
      <br>
      In this way it is achieved that silicon in the form of silanes can
      be used as hydrogen storage, since subsequently no expensive crude
      silicon or even more expensive pure crystalline silicon is
      required permanently for the production process of higher silanes.
      Silane is traditionally represented with the aid of acid
      decomposition in such a way that hydrogen in statu nascendi forms
      gaseous silanes at the silicon anions in the main. During the
      combustion of silanes, these atomic hydrogen atoms are released
      again, so that the cleavage yields energy which has not been
      disclosed by inorganic textbooks. (Plichta, P. &amp; B. Hidding)<br>
      <br>
      The production of raw silicon costs coal and electricity, because
      the 2,200 ° C heat can only be generated by expensive electric
      power. The subsequent chlorination for the production of
      crystalline silicon was modified by P. Plichta by fluorination.
      (AZ 10 2006 023 515.0 and AZ 10 2006 029 282.0) because the oil
      sands and oil shale used are available as practically free
      resources. Overall, a very large amount of higher silanes, For
      example, neo-pentasilane, in order to reduce the production of
      such silanes by repeatedly using the same amount of liberated
      crystalline silicon.<br>
      <br>
      The described hydrogen storage silicon is thus produced without
      the use of coal and electrically produced heat and then processed
      with the hydrogen from oil sand / shale to silanes.<br>
      Since liquid hydrogen will never be used in vehicles or in
      households, the patent application described here represents a
      preliminary conclusion of the step into the silicon period since
      the nitrogen-burning properties of the silanes are
      thermodynamically the departure from the age of the hydrocarbons.

        <b>A revolutionary concept that would make a 10 000$ space
          voyage possible.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The Düsseldorf chemist and mathematician Dr Peter Plichta is the
      author of the book "God's Secret Formula” (Element Books) which
      has just been published in England and the United States. The book
      deals with the famous Euler formula for unit circle which connects
      the transcendental mathematical constants e, i and p with the
      numbers +1, -1 and 0. The astonishing thing, however, is that Dr
      Plichta can also use his concepts of cyclic mathematics to effect
      a revolution in space travel. He has already received several
      patents for the construction of a disc-shaped reusable spacecraft
      which will be fuelled by the diesel oils of silicon. The special
      feature of these homologue substances of carbon is that they do
      not only burn with oxygen, but also with nitrogen. Such a
      spacecraft can namely lie on the atmosphere, inhale its air and
      thus do without the standard oxidation tank.<br>
      <br>
      In 1933 the chemist Alfred Stock published his book "Hydrides of
      Boron and Silicon" in the United States. During and following the
      First World War he worked at the Technische Hochschule in
      Karlsruhe, Germany and showed that silicon-hydrogen compounds
      could be synthesised. Because the element silicon is listed in the
      periodic table below the element carbon, this result was actually
      expected. Stock managed to reach a chain length of 4 silicon
      atoms, with the first two silanes being gaseous, the third and
      fourth liquid. All these silanes are very highly prone to
      self-ignition.<br>
      <br>
      In 1970 Peter Plichta disproved the textbook theory that the
      higher silanes are unstable. One of his achievements was to create
      a mixture of silanes with the chain lengths 5 to 10 (Si5H12 to
      Si10H22). He also managed to separate the oil into the individual
      silanes by of means gas chromatic analysis. This showed the
      surprising result that silanes with a chain length of over 7
      silicon atoms will no longer ignite spontaneously and can thus be
      used for commercial purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon has already made a significant contribution to our century
      as a means of rectifying alternating currents, and more
      importantly in the replacement of radio tubes by transistors; and,
      of course, no computer could function without memory chips made of
      silicon. Its importance can be seen in chemistry, too. Silicon
      oils, silicon-based plastics and newly developed ceramics, e.g.
      cerane, have finally arrived and they are here to stay.<br>
      <br>
      It has been known since 1924 that nitrogen at a temperature of
      1400 oC reacts with powder silicon to form silicon-nitride while
      emitting heat. This material can resist temperatures of up to 1900
      oC, indicating a very high bonding strength in the molecule. In
      contrast to silicon, carbon atoms cannot burn for reasons of
      quantum mechanics, which means that rocket fuel such as kerosene,
      liquid hydrogen and hydrazine in an air-intaking engine can do
      nothing with the 80% nitrogen contained in the air but agitate it
      through the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Multi-stage rockets function from the mathematical point of view
      according to principles of rocket ascent. At the first stage of
      the launch they have to lift their whole weight with the power of
      fuel combustion. Because they quickly lose weight because of the
      spent fuel, they then accelerate although the power of the thrust
      remains the same. The discarded stages are burned in the
      atmosphere, which can only be described as a ridiculous waste of
      money. The Space Shuttle was intended to make space travel less
      costly; but actually the opposite has happened. Just as the
      invention of the wheel made all human transport easier, a circular
      spacecraft will some day soon replace the linear design of current
      multi-stage rockets. We are all familiar with the elegance with
      which a disc or a Frisbee is borne by the air through which it
      flies.<br>
      <br>
      Peter Plichta got the idea of constructing a disc in which
      jet-turbines attached to shafts would drive two ring-shaped blade
      rings rotating in opposite directions. This will cause the disc to
      be suspended by the air just like a helicopter. The craft can then
      be driven sideways by means of a drop-down rocket engine. When a
      speed of over 200 km/h has been reached, the turbines for the
      blade rings will be switched off and covered to enhance the
      aerodynamic features of the shape. The craft will now be borne by
      the up-draught of the air, just like an aircraft is. This will
      also mean that the critical power required for rocket ascent will
      not be necessary. When the spacecraft is orbiting the planet, the
      N2/O2 mixture of the air will first be fed in through a drop-down
      air intake when the craft is still at a low altitude of 30 km (1 %
      air pressure). This will be conducted to the rocket motor and the
      craft will thus accelerate to a speed of 5000-8000 km/hour. This
      is where a standard rocket jettisons its first stage, because by
      then about 75% of the fuel has already been used up.<br>
      <br>
      The disc on the other hand will continue to accelerate to 20,000
      km/h and will thus reach an altitude of approx. 50 km (1 per
      thousand of air pressure). The speed will increase as the air
      pressure drops, so that the process can be continued until an
      altitude of approx. 80 kilometres and 25,000 km/h can be
      maintained. In order to reach the required speed of 30,000 km/h
      and an altitude of around 300 km, only a single measure of
      oxidation agent will be needed at the end.<br>
      <br>
      In the hot combustion chamber silanes decompose spontaneously into
      hydrogen and silicon radicals. The hydrogen is burned by the
      oxygen in the air and water formed. Because molecular nitrogen is
      very tightly bonded, it must be preheated and subject to catalytic
      dissociation. The extremely hot silicon radicals will provide
      additional support for this process, which will in turn lead to
      silicon nitride (Hf = -750 kJ) being formed. In order to burn
      superfluous nitrogen, larger amounts of Mg, Al or Si powder can be
      added to the silane oil.<br>
      <br>
      When the spacecraft is returning from space the ceramic-protected
      underside of the disc will brake its speed to approximately 500
      km/h and the covering will open again, while the blade rings will
      automatically begin to rotate. The jet turbines will then be
      started for the landing operation.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      Limiting factors in air and space propulsion systems affect both
      design and operation of the engines and the energy derived from a
      fuel source. Translation of the fuel source to energy (combustion)
      always requires an oxidizer. The process of breaking the
      energy-laden bonds of the fuel has classically been achieved using
      the oxygen in air for air-breathing engines or an onboard source
      of oxidizer for spaceflight. This is a critical limitation for a
      possible single-stage vehicle, because the weight of the fuel and
      oxidizer needed to achieve the necessary speed and altitude for
      orbit is excessive. This problem was overcome using multi-stage
      engines that are discarded sequentially during vertical ascent.
      However, the relative inefficiency of fuels currently available
      perpetuates the requirement for multi-stage engines to achieve
      orbit. Multi-stage rockets still require onboard fuel and oxidizer
      at lift-off that can account for over 95% of the lift-off weight.
      Only with more efficient fuels and propulsion systems will it
      become possible to achieve orbit and spaceflight without this
      limitation. More effective spacecraft designs incorporating a
      propulsion system powered by a more efficient fuel would greatly
      reduce the oxidizer to payload ratio. This could be accomplished
      with a vehicle that uses air while in the atmosphere and switches
      to onboard oxidizer only after reaching the upper limit of the
      atmosphere. This more efficient fuel is now available. The use of
      silanes (silicone hydrites) provides the fuel necessary to achieve
      this radically different and efficient means of propulsion, using
      both the oxygen and tthe 80% nitrogen of our atmosphere for
      combustion. <br>

      The method involves decaying of a material mixture from the start
      of flight. The emerging free silicon atoms corrode the gaseous
      molecular air nitrogen by heat supply and form non-gaseous silicon
      nitride. The water and silicon nitride emerge as combustion
      products, and the non-combusted, atomic hydrogen has molecular
      weight of one. The gaseous nitrogen disappears from the reaction
      mixture, and the combustion chamber pressure is compensated by the
      non-combusted hydrogen. The mixture discharges from the combustion
      chamber, where center molecular weight of mixture is computed at

      Method for flying a spacecraft comprises melting protons and
      neutrons to form a single ball having a charge on the surface with
      a complex tetrahedron structure. The electrical charge is a
      physical reciprocal time and sits on the surface of atom cores.
      Preferred Features: The spacecraft has spatial gliders on the
      front side which can combust oxygen and nitrogen from the planets
      with a scramjet.<br>

      he method involves providing a toroid with a sandwich component,
      which has individual modules. A toroid shaped passenger
      compartment comprising a circular seat is formed using metallic,
      ceramic and plastic materials. The disks in the sandwich component
      are reverted back to the earth, so that the individual disks
      rotate around 180 degrees. The disks are fixed to a parent ship,
      which is operated chemically.<br>

      <br>
      The method involves utilizing hydrosilicon mixture in a hot
      combustion chamber made of silicon ceramics. The hydrosilicon
      mixture disintegrates into atomic hydrogen and atomic silicon due
      to the heat in the combustion chamber, where 21 percent of oxygen
      portion in the air is burned stoichiometrically without formation
      of silicon oxide. Atmospheric nitrogen constituting 78 percent
      with atomic silicon burns to silicon nitride.<br>
