        <br>
        <div align="left"> DIESEL engines, with their rough-and-ready,
          spark-plug-free method of fuel ignition, have a reputation for
          being smoky and smelly. These days, that is a bit unfair.
          Fussy consumers and even fussier regulations mean the
          sophisticated diesels used to propel modern cars are pretty
          much as clean as their petrol-powered, sparked-up equivalents.
          But the heavy-duty diesels employed in ships still have a long
          way to go. <br>
          <br>
          And that matters. Research by James Corbett of the University
          of Delaware estimates that soot from ships’ diesels
          contributes to 60,000 deaths from heart and lung disease every
          year. Dirty ships’ diesels also produce oxides of nitrogen —
          the main ingredient of smog. Now that land-based
          nitrogen-oxide pollution is being cleaned up, about 30% of the
          world’s remaining emissions of the stuff are reckoned to come
          out of the funnels of seagoing cargo vessels. <br>
          <br>
          The problem is incomplete combustion. The long-chain
          hydrocarbons used as diesel fuel do not burn as easily as the
          lighter ones found in petrol. Some of the carbon therefore
          ends up as soot, rather than carbon dioxide, and oxygen that
          should be combining with carbon combines with nitrogen from
          the air instead.<br>
          <br>
          But there may be a way out. Though it sounds bizarre, mixing
          water into the fuel helps it to burn better. The heat of
          combustion breaks water molecules up. The resulting hydrogen
          atoms help to split hydrocarbon molecules, making them more
          combustible, while the oxygen released goes on to combine with
          the carbon, ensuring that more of it burns.<br>
          <br>
          All this has, in truth, been known for years. But previous
          attempts to turn it into practical technology have failed.
          Reinhard Strey of the University of Cologne is, however,
          having another go. He thinks he has cracked the main (and
          obvious) difficulty — that oil and water do not easily mix.<br>
          <br>
          His answer is to use a surfactant. This is a molecule or
          molecular combination that has different properties on
          different parts of its surface: in particular, one part
          prefers to dissolve in water whereas another part prefers oil.
          Adding a surfactant to a mixture of oil and water therefore
          binds the mixture together and allows it to form an emulsion
          of water droplets dispersed in oil. (The dispersants being
          used against the Gulf of Mexico oil spill work similarly, to
          create droplets of oil in water.)<br>
          <br>
          That is effective, and has been tried in the past. But it is
          only part of the trick. Previous attempts to mix water and
          diesel fuel this way have resulted in emulsions that still
          separate, albeit more slowly than a surfactant-free mixture
          would. In practice, fuel can hang around in a tank for a long
          time, so for the process to be useful, the emulsion has to be
          stable for ever.<br>
          <br>
          Dr Strey was not put off by these previous failures. He
          searched for years and eventually lighted on a mixture of
          oleic acid (a fatty acid found in various vegetable oils) and
          nitrogen-containing compounds called amines. This mixture
          dissolves readily in diesel fuel and binds water to it without
          any need for stirring. The water droplets themselves can be as
          small as a nanometre (a billionth of a metre) across. That
          they are so small helps stabilise the emulsion. The result is,
          in effect, a liquid sponge, and means the mixture can be
          stored indefinitely, like ordinary diesel, without risk of
          separation. <br>
          <br>
          The result, when it is burned, is the near-complete abolition
          of soot, and a reduction of up to 80% in nitrogen-oxide
          emissions. The surfactant itself also burns without creating
          emissions beyond water, carbon dioxide and nitrogen.<br>
          <br>
          The next stage is to test the mixture in the real world. MTU,
          a German engine-builder, is now looking into the matter. If
          all goes well, though, the days when a smoking funnel was an
          icon of every child’s drawing of a ship on the horizon may be
          numbered.<br>

          fuels permit an increased efficiency of internal combustion

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to microemulsions which
          have a characteristic nanostructure of alternating continuous
          hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains. Such microemulsions serve
          as fuels which allow combustion with unprecedented low noxious
          substances emission and high efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0002] The combustion of fossil fuels based on raw petroleum
          poses problems in many respects. The world oil consumption is
          currently around 3.5 billion tons, about 90% thereof being
          used as fuels. Automobile fuels, power plant fuels, ship fuels
          and aircraft fuels form the major part thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] However, when the consumption remains constant, the
          world's oil resources will last for only about another 50 to
          100 years, so that there is a high need for more efficient
          combustion methods.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] More efficient combustion methods are also required in
          order to reduce the emission of CO2 as a product of
          combustion. In the earth's atmosphere, CO2 reflects the heat
          radiation emitted from the ground. Therefore, the high
          emission of CO2 is considered a main cause of the greenhouse
          effect.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] Another problem in the combustion of conventional fuels
          is the emission of noxious substances, which cannot be
          eliminated completely even by novel fuel-injection and
          combustion techniques or fuel additives.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Just in the motorized traffic, the load on the air from
          noxious substances like nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide
          (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate matter (PM) and
          precursor substances, which adversely affect the ozone
          balance, causes great problems. These problems can be solved
          only partially by modern exhaust gas aftertreatment
          techniques, such as automobile exhaust catalysts. Thus,
          although diesel fuel can be combusted more efficiently as
          compared to other fuels, such combustion results in a
          considerable formation of particulate matter. For technical
          reasons, an exhaust gas aftertreatment for the removal of NOx
          is not employed in diesel vehicles currently.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Also, the load on the atmosphere from noxious
          substances emitted by aircrafts is an as yet unsolved problem.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] For the more efficient use of fossil energy sources,
          improved combustion techniques, such as improved fuel
          injection in combustion engines, are being developed. However,
          improved combustion methods often result in an increased
          emission of noxious substances. Due to thermodynamic laws, the
          efficiency of combustion engines is enhanced as the combustion
          temperature increases. However, an increase of combustion
          temperature often results in an increased emission of noxious
          substances, especially NOx.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] One possibility for the simultaneous improvement of
          combustion efficiency and reduction of emission of noxious
          substances is the use of special fuels, especially fuels which
          consist of a mixture of aqueous and non-aqueous phases, such
          as water-in-oil (w/o) emulsions. Such fuels allow an efficient
          combustion process in spite of comparatively low combustion
          temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] A central point in the use of these particular fuels is
          the positive effect of the addition of water on the combustion
          due to the steam engine effect of the evaporating water. This
          means that water is transferred from the liquid to the vapor
          state and thereby joins the combustion gases in driving the
          piston. Due to the evaporation enthalpy, the evaporation of
          the water reduces the temperature in the combustion chamber,
          whereby a reduction of the noxious substances NOx and CO, HC
          and PM ("particulate matter", soot) in the exhaust gases is
          achieved.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The use of emulsions of oil and water in various
          combustion processes has been tested many times. The main
          disadvantage of such emulsions is their instability, and
          moreover, their water content is not variable and very low.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Formulations which are described as kinetically
          stabilized microemulsions are known. Also, the use of
          thermodynamically stable microemulsions has been described
          before. These are non-optimum microemulsions (w/o) consisting
          of water-swollen micelles existing in the fuel. Thus, they are
          microemulsions comprising exactly one continuous phase.
          Therefore, the water content in the fuel microemulsions known
          so far is rather low and is often not more than 20%.
          Microemulsions with higher water contents have often high or
          expensive emulsifier fractions. Further, many formulations
          include high contents (up to 20%) of alcohols.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Most known water-fuel mixtures have only water-in-oil
          micelles as a microstructure and are not optimum bicontinuous
          microemulsions. In many inventions, there is a problem in that
          little water can be emulsified. In addition, for optimizing
          the combustion, a technology is needed for adjusting the water
          content of the mixture at will. If the composition of the
          known water-fuel mixtures is considered in more detail, they
          are often not water-fuel emulsions with alcohol additions, but
          rather alcohol-fuel emulsions with low additions of water.
          Often, the high fugacity of ethanol causes the additional
          problem that ethanol, but also other more volatile substances
          are increasingly driven out of the mixture and into the gas
          phase.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] <span style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Pat. No.
            4,744,796</span> describes water/fuel microemulsions with
          diesel fuel, gasoline, fuel oil and kerosine as the oil
          component that are stably one-phase and clear over a maximum
          broad range of temperatures of from -10[deg.] C. to +70[deg.]
          C. while showing a high salt tolerance. Their content of the
          aqueous component consisting of water and/or methanol is from
          3 to 40%. As a cosurfactant, tert-butyl alcohol (TBA, 1-20%,
          with methanol up to 30%) is added to one or more cationic,
          anionic, amphoteric and non-ionic surfactants (2-20%). Betains
          with different carbon chain lengths (11-17) are employed as
          amphoteric surfactants, and ethoxylated alcohols (CiEj),
          alkylphenols and carboxylates are employed as non-ionic
          surfactants. Quaternary ammonium salts are used as cationic
          surfactants, and fatty acids are used as anionic surfactants.
          These water/fuel microemulsions are non-bicontinuous o/w
          microemulsions which are not optimal for this purpose.
          Further, TBA is used as an obligatory cosurfactant in this
          patent.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] <span style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Pat. No.
            4,158,551</span> describes an emulsion of gasoline, water
          and non-ionic surfactants in order to minimize exhaust gases
          harmful to the environment in the combustion. The mixture
          includes up to 22% of water and is stabilized by 1-3.5% of
          surfactants The surfactants are essentially ethoxylated
          alkylphenols with 1.5-30 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of
          nonylphenol. However, such an emulsion is thermodynamically
          unstable.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] <span style="font-weight: bold;">U.S. Pat. No.
            6,302,929</span> describes high-water fuels which are based
          on two-phase water-continuous (o/w) emulsion systems in
          contrast to most other known emulsions. As compared to pure
          hydrocarbons, these fuels have the advantage that they are not
          inflammable outside the combustion chamber. In the mixtures
          described, from 20 to 80% of water can be emulsified. Further,
          the emulsions contain from 2 to 20% of alcohols, low amounts
          (0.3-1%) on non-ionic surfactants (CiEj, alkylglucosides,
          Igepal CO-630), and minor proportions of polyorganosiloxanes.
          The fuel component is gasoline, kerosine, diesel fuel,
          synthetic and biological fuels, which can be combusted more
          effectively than the pure hydrocarbons. The high proportion of
          water decreases the combustion temperature so much that the
          emission of noxious substances is reduced (CO: -50%). However,
          the described preparation of the mixtures is difficult to
          perform, and the combustion composition probably varies widely
          in the application. In addition, in practice, the engines must
          be modified to a higher extent for two-phase mixtures ("rotary
          engines") as compared to one-phase mixtures.<br>
          [0017] EP 0 475 620 describes non-temperature-sensitive diesel
          fuel, gasoline and kerosine microemulsions and their
          low-pollutant combustion. The mixtures include up to 30% of
          water, which can be replaced partially or wholly by methanol,
          ethanol or propanol. In addition to a wide variety of
          additives (for example, ammonium nitrites, nitrates and
          halogenates as well as halogen acids and organic compounds)
          for improving the combustion parameters, a comprehensive
          selection of emulsifier systems is described which are
          employed as combinations of at least two different
          surfactants. Thus, in addition to many ionic surfactants
          (C8-C30 chains with and without branching/ring) with different
          head groups (including alkali metals, -SO3H, -NH3 and
          alkylated, alkanoylated, ethoxylated or sulfonated ammonium),
          a number of non-ionic surfactants (for example, CiEj, Igepals,
          ethoxylated alkylphenols) are also used. The classification is
          not by ionic and non-ionic, but by hydrophilic and lipophilic
          surfactants (phase condition 2 or {overscore (2)} at
          T=20[deg.] C., [Phi]=[alpha]=0.5 and [gamma]=0.02). In
          addition, a wide range of cosurfactants (medium-chain
          alcohols, glycol ethers and ethers) are employed. What is
          described is one-phase, transparent microemulsions. However,
          one-phase microemulsions with 2% of surfactant are optically
          turbid, and therefore, it can be assumed that the optically
          clear microemulsions must contain more than 10% of surfactant.
          Such mixtures with a low water/surfactant ratio are not
          sufficiently efficient for an economical application.<br>

          emulsions consisting of diesel fuel and 1-40% of water and
          surfactant for the reduction of noxious substances (CO, NOx,
          HC, PM, soot). A key characteristic is the use of organic
          alkyl nitrates. Linear hydrocarbons having a chain length of
          from 5 to 10 carbon atoms as well as branched hydrocarbons,
          especially the 2-ethylhexyl residue, serve as alkyl residues.<br>

          microemolsions which have high stabilities at low
          temperatures. In their non-elucidated microstructure, the
          existence of w/o micelles is assumed. The mixtures consist of
          diesel fuel (34-99%), water (0.1-6%), alcohol (0.5-42%) and a
          surfactant system (0.5-58%). As alcohols, which make up the

          mainly consists of methanol, ethanol or propanol
          ([Psi]eth=70-95%). Amines trialkylated with long-chain fatty
          acids are used as surfactants and supplemented by large
          amounts of butanol as a cosurfactant (about 20%). In this case
          too, w/o micelles are assumed as microstructures.<br>

          (cosurfactant). The microemulsions are stably monophase from

          glycolipids of the form A-X-R, where the hydrophilic

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0033] Microemulsions have now been found which are optimum
          bicontinuous microemulsions, in contrast to known
          formulations. These microemulsions can be employed as
          hydrofuels, they have a characteristic nanostructure of
          alternating water and oil domains and prove to be fuels with
          unprecedented low noxious substances emission and high
          efficiency. Such microemulsions allow to mix water and
          conventional fuels in any ratio desired and are still
          thermodynamically stable.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The present invention relates to:<br>
          <br>
          [0035] (1) a bicontinuous one-phase microemulsion at least
          consisting of an aqueous component (A), a hydrophobic
          component (B) and an amphiphilic component (C/D), wherein the
          microemulsion simultaneously comprises a continuous aqueous
          phase and a continuous hydrophobic phase, and the hydrophobic
          component (B) contains one or more substances which can be
          employed as a fuel;<br>
          <br>
          [0036] (2) a preferred embodiment of (1), wherein said
          amphiphilic component contains at least one non-ionic
          surfactant (C);<br>
          <br>
          [0037] (3) a preferred embodiment of (2), wherein said
          amphiphilic component further contains at least one ionic
          surfactant (D), preferably a sulfur-free ionic surfactant (D);<br>
          <br>
          [0038] (4) the use of the microemulsion as defined in (1) to
          (3)<br>
          <br>
          [0039] (i) as a fuel in combustion engines, preferably in
          reciprocating piston engines, rotating piston engines and
          turbine engines; and/or<br>
          <br>
          [0040] (ii) as a fuel in thrust engines, preferably in jet
          engines, turbine jet engines and rocket engines; and/or<br>
          <br>
          [0041] (iii) as a fuel in furnaces, preferably in heating
          installations and steam generation installations; and/or<br>
          <br>
          [0042] (iv) in ignition processes; and/or<br>
          <br>
          [0043] (v) in explosives; and<br>
          <br>
          [0044] (5) a method for the determination and optimization of
          microemulsions according to (1) to (3), comprising the steps
          of:<br>
          <br>
          [0045] (i) determining the temperature variance and adjusting
          the temperature invariance of the one-phase microemulsion by
          adjusting the content of amphiphilic component (C/D); and<br>
          <br>
          [0046] (ii) adjusting the water-to-oil ratio within a range of
          the volume ratio of oil to water plus oil of from 4 to 96% by
          volume of the hydrophobic component (B).<br>
          <br>
          [0047] The central point of the present invention is the
          efficient solubilization of water in conventional fuels, such
          as diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, gasoline, premium gasoline,
          kerosine and fuel oil, using low concentrations of novel
          emulsifier mixtures of surfactants, cosurfactants and other
          additives which exhibit non-residue combustion. In contrast to
          existing emulsions, these mixtures are characterized by their
          thermodynamic stability, electric conductivity and one-phase
          property, which is found over wide ranges of temperature, at
          least from -30[deg.] C. to +95[deg.] C., preferably from
          -30[deg.] C. to +70[deg.] C. According to the invention, a
          clear reduction of emission of noxious substances is found in
          the combustion of the optimized hydrofuels. Thus, mainly the
          emission of NOx, CO, incompletely burnt hydrocarbons (HC) and
          particulate matter is clearly reduced as compared to
          conventional fuels. A further aspect of the invention is the
          more efficient combustion of the hydrofuels as compared to
          conventional fuels.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
            INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0063] In the following statements, a distinction is made
          between emulsions and microemulsions.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] "Emulsions" within the meaning of the present invention
          means liquid dispersions of water in oil which are stabilized
          by the presence of an emulsifier. Their preparation process is
          characterized by extremely high shear and an interfacial
          tension within a range of from 1 to 10 mN/m.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] "Microemulsions" spontaneously form from the components
          upon slight stirring, preferably from an aqueous component, a
          hydrophobic component and at least one amphiphilic component
          and optionally further additives. They are nanostructured
          mixtures in which the water-oil contact is optimally shielded,
          with interfacial tensions within a range of from 10&lt;-4 &gt;
          to 10&lt;-1 &gt; mN/m.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] In the present application text, "bicontinuous" means
          that there is a mixture according to the invention consisting
          of an aqueous and a hydrophobic phase which are separated from
          each other by an amphiphilic film on a microscopic level.
          Thus, this is a structure comprising two continuous domains,
          namely an aqueous and a hydrophobic domain.<br>
          <br>
          [0067] Synonymously with the also employed term "hydrophilic
          component" and the word component "water" in word combinations
          which comprise the component "water-oil", the term "aqueous
          component" means water and water-soluble liquids or liquids
          which are completely miscible with water, especially water and
          short-chain organic alcohols, such as ethanol, methanol,
          n-propanol and isopropanol, butanol, ethylene glycol,
          propylene glycol, glycerol.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] Synonymously with the also employed term "fuel", "oil"
          and the word component "oil" in word combinations which
          comprise the component "water-oil", the term "hydrophobic
          component" means hydrophobic liquids or liquids which are
          miscible with hydrophobic liquids, especially fuels based on
          fossil fuels and fuels recovered from renewable resources,
          more particularly diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel (rapeseed methyl
          ester), gasoline, premium gasoline, kerosine, bunker C oil and
          bio-oils (native oils, e.g., rapeseed oil, soybean oil etc.).<br>
          <br>
          [0069] The term "amphiphilic component" comprises non-ionic
          and ionic surfactants, cosurfactants and other amphiphilic
          compounds as further specified under groups C and D. The terms
          "emulsifier" and "surfactant", which are also employed in the
          following text, are to be understood as synonyms with
          "amphiphilic component" unless further specified.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] "Alkyl derivatives" and "alkyl residues" (synonymous
          with the word component "alkyl", such as in
          "polyalkylglucoside") within the meaning of the present
          invention include linear and branched saturated, mono- or
          polyunsaturated aliphatic hydrocarbyl chains, aliphatic
          alcohols, fatty alcohols, oxo alcohols or carboxylic acids,
          preferably aliphatic alcohols, fatty alcohols or oxo alcohols.<br>
          <br>
          [0071] Thermodynamically stable one-phase mixtures of an
          aqueous component (A), a hydrophobic component (B) and an
          emulsifier component (C/D) have been found in which the volume
          ratio of oil to water plus oil can be adjusted freely within a
          broad range and the water content is variable. They have a
          bicontinuous microstructure, a low water/oil interfacial
          tension and electric conductivity and will burn more
          completely than the corresponding pure oil components.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] With a low emulsifier content, the mixtures are stable
          through a wide range of temperatures, preferably from
          -30[deg.] C. to +95[deg.] C., more preferably from -30[deg.]
          C. to +70[deg.] C., even more preferably from 0[deg.] C. to
          +70[deg.] C. The mixtures may contain additives (E).<br>
          <br>
          [0073] The content of the amphiphilic component (C/D) in the
          microemulsions according to the invention is from 0.5 to 20%
          by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 15% by weight, more
          preferably from 1 to 8% by weight, even more preferably from 1
          to 5% by weight.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] <span style="font-weight: bold;">It is the object of
            the invention to provide optimized and clean fuels which can
            be burnt with air as efficiently and completely as possible
            in terms of the provided hydrocarbon content, preferably to
            form exclusively water and carbon dioxide. The emissions of
            NOx, CO, incompletely burnt hydrocarbons (HC) and
            particulate matter (PM) are to be suppressed as far as
            possible, and the fuel consumption reduced.</span><br>
          <br>
          [0075] <span style="font-weight: bold;">According to the
            invention, this object is achieved by employing bicontinuous
            optimum microemulsions as the fuel and by adding emulsifier
            systems to the mixture which are adapted to each oil
            respectively and consist of at least one non-ionic
            surfactant, preferably in admixture with at least one ionic
            surfactant, more preferably in the presence of cosurfactants
            (longer-chain alcohols, amphiphilic block copolymers etc.)</span>.<br>
          <br>
          [0076] <span style="font-weight: bold;">The microemulsions
            according to embodiment (1) are thermodynamically stable
            one-phase microemulsions which preferably consist of water,
            technical oils and technical emulsifier mixtures.</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0077] As oils, there are used diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel,
          bio-oil, gasoline, premium gasoline, kerosine and/or fuel oil
          with water in a volume ratio of oil to water plus oil of
          [phi]=0.04-0.99, preferably [phi]=0.04-0.96.<br>
          <br>
          [0078] The thermodynamic stability of the microemulsions
          according to the invention is achieved by emulsifier systems
          which are respectively adapted to each oil and preferably
          consist of non-ionic and ionic surfactants and cosurfactants,
          e.g., longer-chain alcohols, amphiphilic block copolymers etc.
          In addition to their efficiency, i.e., their low mass
          contents, the surfactants employed have the advantage to burn
          without additional emissions of noxious substances.<br>
          <br>
          [0079] Optionally, oil-insoluble components, e.g., salts,
          glycerol, methanol and other cosolvents, which serve for
          improving the combustion are added to the water.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] According to the invention, the most favorable water
          content is respectively adjusted for each oil in order to burn
          the oils as microemulsions in an optimal way in terms of
          emission of noxious substances and energy yield. For a minimum
          use of surfactants, optimum bicontinuous and conductible
          microemulsions for each water-to oil ratio are formulated. The
          composition of the microemulsion is selected to remain stably
          one-phase from -30[deg.] C. to +95[deg.] C., more preferably
          from -30[deg.] C. to +70[deg.] C., even more preferably from
          0[deg.] C. to +70[deg.] C.<br>
          <br>
          [0081] The microemulsions according to embodiment (2) consist
          of an aqueous component (A), a hydrophobic component (B) and
          an amphiphilic component (C/D; synonymous with emulsifier
          mixture) consisting of one or more non-ionic surfactants (C)
          which may additionally contain ionic surfactants (D) and which
          preferably contains at least one ionic surfactant (D)
          (embodiment (3)). Optionally, salts and additives (E) may be
          added to the aqueous component (A).<br>
          <br>
          [0082] The aqueous component (A) of the microemulsions
          according to (1) consists of water to which one or more
          water-soluble alcohols may optionally be added, preferably
          from 0 to 50% by weight (based on A) of methanol, ethanol
          and/or bioethanol, from 0 to 40% by weight of propanol and/or
          tert-butyl alcohol, from 0 to 80% by weight of glycerol and/or
          ethylene glycol. Particularly preferred is the addition of one
          or more water-soluble alcohols in concentrations of the
          individual alcohols of from 0 to 40% by weight (based on A),
          even more preferably in concentrations of the individual
          alcohols of from 0 to 20% by weight. The total concentration
          of the alcohols in A is preferably from 0 to 90% by weight,
          more preferably from 0 to 30% by weight, even more preferably
          from 0 to 20% by weight.<br>
          <br>
          [0083] The hydrophobic component (B) of the microemulsions
          according to embodiment (1) consists of one or more of
          substances selected from diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel (rapeseed
          methyl ester), gasoline, premium gasoline, kerosine, bunker C
          oil and bio-oils (native oils, e.g., rapeseed oil, soybean oil
          etc.). Mixtures of these substances in any mixing ratios can
          be employed as component (B). Diesel fuel or a mixture of
          diesel fuel, gasoline or premium gasoline on the one hand with
          bio-oil and/or biodiesel fuel on the other hand in any mixing
          ratios is preferably employed. Even more preferred is diesel
          fuel or a mixture of diesel fuel and biodiesel fuel or
          bio-oil.<br>
          <br>
          [0084] The non-ionic surfactants (C), ionic surfactants (D)
          and salts and additives (E) may be employed in pure or
          technical grade, preferably in technical grade.<br>
          <br>
          [0085] Non-ionic surfactants (C) in embodiment (1) and (2) are
          selected from one or more of the groups of linear or branched
          non-ionic surfactants (C-1), surfactants with a core

          origin, i.e., natural fatty acids (such as oleic acid), citric
          acid, salicylic acid etc. Salts of the carboxylic acids may
          also be employed, wherein ammonium ions, tetra(short chain
          alkyl)ammonium ions, quaternary hydroxylamines or alkali metal
          cations may also be used. For application as a fuel, it is
          particularly preferred that the ionic surfactants (D) are
          sulfur-free. As the sole sulfur-containing members of ionic
          surfactants (D), sodium alkylsulfates or sodium bisalkyl
          sulfosuccinates with an alkyl residue as defined above and

          halides, preferably chlorides, bromides and iodides, of the
          alkali metals and ammonium ion. In the case of ammonium
          halides, especially NH4Cl, the proportion of the aqueous
          component (A) is from 0 to 50% by weight, preferably from 0 to
          20% by weight, more preferably from 0 to 10% by weight, even
          more preferably from 0.1 to 5% by weight. In the case of all
          other halides, this proportion is from 0 to 10% by weight,

          to 4% by weight.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] The additives (E-3) comprise urea and its derivatives
          as well as other water-soluble, non-ionic additives. They may
          be employed in proportions of 0-25% by weight of component A,
          preferably 0.5-15% by weight, more preferably 0.5-10% by
          weight.<br>
          <br>
          [0099] Component (E) is also preferably sulfur-free.<br>

          [0100] The mixing ratios in the microemulsion according to
          embodiment (1) are calculated as follows, wherein always one

          <br>
          [0110] The formulation and optimization of fuel microemulsions
          according to embodiment (5) comprises the following steps:<br>
          <br>
          [0111] 1. Preparing a microemulsion from water (A),
          conventional fuel (B) and non-ionic surfactant (C), preferably
          CiEj, with [phi]=0.5 with pure surfactants or suitable
          technical surfactant mixtures.<br>
          <br>
          [0112] 2. Replacing the pure surfactants by suitable technical
          surfactant mixtures.<br>
          <br>
          [0113] 3. Adding additives (E) and optimizing the efficiency
          by efficiency boosters (C-4).<br>
          <br>
          [0114] 4. Adjusting the temperature invariance of the
          one-phase microemulsion by mixing from technical ionic (D) and
          non-ionic (C) surfactants.<br>
          <br>
          [0115] 5. Adapting the salt content (E).<br>
          <br>
          [0116] 6. Adjusting the water-to-oil ratio within a range of
          [phi]=0.04-0.99, preferably [phi]=0.04-0.96.<br>
          <br>
          [0117] 7. Establishing the optimum water-to-oil ratio by
          combustion, followed by reiterating the optimization,
          especially by adding further additives.<br>
          <br>
          [0118] The order of the formulation steps can be varied, and
          in particular, the adding of the additives (E) to (A) can be
          performed already in the first step (cf. Ex. 1), and
          optionally, it may also be performed reiteratively.<br>
          <br>
          [0119] The bicontinuity and the sponge structure of the
          microemulsions according to (1) can be detected by the high
          electric conductivity of the high-oil microemulsions, by
          electron microscopy, neutron-scattering experiments and by NMR
          self-diffusion measurements. The microscopic structure of a
          bicontinuous microemulsion according to the invention
          consisting of equal amounts of water and n-octane at a
          surfactant (C12E5) content of 5% is shown in FIG. 1. This
          Figure illustrates the three-dimensionally continuous form of
          the surfactant film which separates water from oil on a
          microscopic level.<br>
          <br>
          [0120] Optimum microemulsions are characterized in that, when
          further water or oil is added, it will segregate as an excess
          phase. Thus, optimum microemulsions are maximally swollen with
          water and oil, and their surfactant content cannot be reduced
          further. The microemulsions according to the invention include
          water, mixtures of hydrocarbons, emulsifier mixtures and
          optionally cosurfactants and additives, such as anticorrosives
          or preservatives.<br>
          <br>
          [0121] The emulsifier mixtures (C/D) of non-ionic and ionic
          surfactants are optionally based on renewable resources. For
          each oil, they are adjusted in such a way that
          temperature-invariant one-phase domains exist from -30[deg.]
          C. to +95[deg.] C., preferably from -30[deg.] C. to +70[deg.]
          C.<br>
          <br>
          [0122] For the use of ionic surfactants, some salt content in
          the water is useful. Employed are combustible inorganic salts,
          such as ammonium carbonates, ammonium acetates and ammonium
          nitrates, which at the same time reduce the emission of
          noxious substances. Low-temperature stability is achieved with
          glycerol, ethanol and/or further additives. The addition of
          short-chain alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol) in fuel
          microemulsions is advantageous because the alcohol will become
          enriched at the interface between the water and fuel domains
          due to its surface activity. On the one hand, this reduces the
          vapor pressure of the alcohol, and on the other hand, the
          alcohol present at the interface does not cause an increase of
          the vapor pressure of volatile components, such as benzene and
          other aromatics.<br>
          <br>
          [0123] The thus obtained mixtures are optimized with respect
          to their emulsifier content to the extent that water and
          conventional fuels can be mixed in a thermodynamically stable
          way with an emulsifier content of less than 5%. The
          surfactants are characterized by being combustible completely
          and without residues.<br>
          <br>
          [0124] According to the invention, continuous water and oil
          domains are separated in the microemulsions by an amphiphilic
          film consisting of the emulsifier mixture. One property of
          these bicontinuously structured microemulsion fuels to be
          pointed out is their good electric conductivity. Thus,
          measuring the latter is a simple method for establishing
          bicontinuity. The electric conductivity offers new possible
          ignition and dispersion methods by applying high voltages with
          a correspondingly resulting high current density.<br>
          <br>
          [0125] The optimum microemulsions according to the invention
          are characterized by their special emulsifier mixtures (see
          above) and the thus achieved solubilization efficiency. Thus,
          conventional fuels and water can be mixed in a
          thermodynamically stable way with an emulsifier content of
          clearly less than 5%.<br>
          <br>
          [0126] On a microscopic level, this high efficiency leads to
          the formation of a unitary microstructure of water and fuel
          domains on the order of 100 nm which allows optimum combustion
          conditions to be adjusted. Due to the strong light scattering,
          the novel microemulsion fuels appear optically turbid like
          emulsions. Nevertheless, they are one-phase, thermodynamically
          stable microemulsions.<br>
          <br>
          [0127] The property that the bicontinuous microstructuring of
          the microemulsion fuels according to the invention correlates
          with the presence of very low interfacial tensions between
          water and conventional fuel on the order of 10&lt;-4 &gt;
          mNm&lt;-1 &gt; is to be pointed out particularly. Thus, the
          microemulsion fuel is distributed clearly better when injected
          into the combustion chamber as compared to conventional
          fuel/water mixtures, so that the hydrocarbons are burnt more
          completely. Consequently, there is a clear increase in
          efficiency of the combustion as well as reduction of the
          emission of noxious substances (mainly PM and HC, but also
          CO).<br>
          <br>
          [0128] A further minimization of emissions and improvement of
          energy yield is caused by the transfer of the water
          solubilized in the microemulsion from the liquid to the
          gaseous state, thereby joining the combustion gases in driving
          the piston of a combustion engine ("steam engine effect").<br>
          <br>
          [0129] At the same time, due to the evaporation enthalpy to be
          employed, reaction heat is dissipated, thus reducing the
          temperature in the combustion chamber. A significant reduction
          of noxious substances in the exhaust gases (mainly NOx and CO,
          but also HC and PM) is achieved thereby.<br>
          <br>
          [0130] Thus, all in all, the total efficiency of the
          combustion engine is not substantially reduced by using the
          microemulsion fuels according to the invention despite of a
          reduction of the combustion temperature.<br>
          <br>
          [0131] To eliminate or reduce the emissions of noxious
          substances, both inorganic and organic additives can be
          additionally added to the optimum bicontinuous microemulsions.<br>
          <br>
          [0132] The microemulsion fuels according to (1) at least
          consist of an aqueous component, a hydrophobic component and
          an amphiphilic pseudocomponent. Said aqueous component
          predominantly consists of water. If required, additives, such
          as small amounts of salt, glycerol and/or other water-soluble
          substances may be added to the water. The use of TBA as well
          as of short-chain alcohols (methanol and ethanol) can be
          dispensed with. The fuel/water quality (which can be defined,
          e.g., by the octane number), suppression of undesirable
          structures (lamellar phase), winterproofness as well as
          favorable combustion properties can be matched to the
          different requirements by adding ethanol and methanol. In this
          connection, the microemulsions according to the invention have
          substantial advantages over conventional products.<br>
          <br>
          [0133] The microemulsions according to embodiment (1) have a
          volume ratio of oil to water plus oil, [phi], of from
          [phi]=0.04 to [phi]=0.99, preferably to [phi]=0.96, and have a
          bicontinuous microstructure. Their thermodynamic stability is
          achieved by a suitable emulsifier or emulsifier mixture. For
          each oil, there are suitable technical surfactant mixtures of
          non-ionic and ionic surfactants to obtain
          temperature-invariant one-phase domains from -30[deg.] C. to
          +95[deg.] C., preferably from -30[deg.] C. to +70[deg.] C.,
          while the formation of disturbing anisotropic and highly
          viscous structures is suppressed.<br>
          <br>
          [0134] For the use of ionic surfactants, it is preferred that
          the water contains some salt, which is achieved by using
          combustible inorganic salts, preferably ammonium carbonates,
          ammonium nitrates etc. At the same time, this results in a
          reduction of the emission of noxious substances during
          combustion.<br>
          <br>
          [0135] The viscosity of the microemulsion according to (1) is
          preferably the same as the viscosity of the pure hydrocarbon
          of the oil component.<br>
          <br>
          [0136] The thus obtained mixtures according to (1) are
          optimized with respect to their emulsifier content. As
          cosurfactants, longer-chain aliphatic alcohols (e.g.,
          1-octanol) of group (C-3) and block copolymers (C-4) can be
          used for enhancing the efficiency. Also, the cosurfactants
          employed are completely combustible without residues and do
          not cause any additional emissions of noxious substances
          during combustion.<br>
          <br>
          [0137] The emulsifier mixtures according to the invention
          consist of inexpensive surfactants which mostly can be
          prepared from renewable resources. Alternatively, a
          combination of sugar surfactants with a longer-chain alcohol
          may also be used.<br>
          <br>
          [0138] Short-chain alcohols, preferably ethanol, methanol or
          propanol, may also be used as components of the aqueous phase.
          The problem of a high alcohol vapor pressure as in
          conventional fuels does not occur in a microemulsion according
          to embodiment (1) when these alcohols are used, because the
          alcohol becomes enriched at the interface due to its surface
          activity and therefore does not substantially increase
          fugacity. A comparison of the vapor pressure curves of
          water/ethanol mixtures with those of ethanol-containing
          microemulsions shows that the ethanol vapor pressure above
          bicontinuous microemulsions is significantly lower.<br>
          <br>
          [0139] For each fuel/water mixture according to the invention,
          there is a specific optimum oil-to-water ratio, which firstly
          yields the lowest emissions of noxious substances during
          combustion and which secondly can be burnt most efficiently.
          By further additives, such as alcohols and organic and/or
          inorganic additives, the microemulsions can be varied and
          optimized. According to the invention, the ratio of aqueous to
          hydrophobic components can be adjusted freely in virtually any
          mixing ratio due to the particular characteristics of the
          microemulsion.<br>
          <br>
          [0140] The fuels according to the invention which consist of
          bicontinuous microemulsions have the following advantages over
          conventional fuels:<br>
          <br>
          [0141] The combustion temperature is reduced.<br>
          <br>
          [0142] The hydrocarbons are burnt more completely.<br>
          <br>
          [0143] The utilization of the heat of combustion for
          evaporating the water allows an efficient utilization of the
          energy content of the hydrocarbons, also for low combustion
          temperatures.<br>
          <br>
          [0144] Due to the reduced combustion temperature, the
          emissions of noxious substances (CO, NOx, HC, PM) can be
          significantly reduced.<br>
          <br>
          [0145] The tendency to knocking (detonation) of Otto engines
          can be reduced. The use of antiknock compounds, such as
          aromatics or MTBE, can be reduced thereby.<br>
          <br>
          [0146] The use of biodiesel fuel and/or bio-oil is possible
          despite of its water content.<br>
          <br>
          [0147] Over the known fuel/water mixtures, the fuels according
          to the invention which consist of bicontinuous microemulsions
          have the following advantages:<br>
          <br>
          [0148] The microemulsion fuels according to the invention are
          characterized by their thermodynamic stability.<br>
          <br>
          [0149] They are based on optimum microemulsions with a
          bicontinuous structure which are characterized by minimum
          amounts of surfactants, have low oil-water interfacial
          tensions and monodisperse structural quantities, and are
          electrically conductive.<br>
          <br>
          [0150] Due to the more efficient combustion of bicontinuous
          microemulsions, raw materials can be saved.<br>
          <br>
          [0151] The content of water or aqueous component can be chosen
          freely. Thus, the water content can be adjusted to optimum
          combustion conditions.<br>
          <br>
          [0152] The optimum microemulsions require only small amounts
          of emulsifiers (&lt;5%) and are thus low-cost.<br>
          <br>
          [0153] The combination of emulsifiers enables
          temperature-insensitive one-phase microemulsions to be
          formulated (for example, with a stability range of from
          -30[deg.] C. to +70[deg.] C.).<br>
          <br>
          [0154] Short-chain alcohols can be used in microemulsions
          without causing fugacity problems, because continuous water
          domains are available.<br>
          <br>
          [0155] Diesel fuel, biodiesel fuel, bio-oil, gasoline, premium
          gasoline, kerosine and fuel oil can be processed into a
          bicontinuous microemulsion fuel.<br>
          <br>
          [0156] The combustion of hydrocarbons is effected more
          completely than with conventional fuel/water mixtures (Ex.
          10).<br>
          <br>
          [0157] The microemulsion fuels can be premixed and stored in
          conventional tanks due to their stability.<br>
          <br>
          [0158] Microemulsion fuels can be readily mixed briefly before
          combustion.<br>
          <br>
          [0159] The invention will be further illustrated by the
          following Examples which are not intended, however, to limit
          the subject matter of the invention and the process according
          to the invention.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0160] In a first step, components (E), if required (for
          several components (E), each compound individually), were
          dissolved with stirring in fully desalted water as the first
          component (A). Subsequently, all further aqueous components
          (A), such as short-chain alcohols, glycerol etc., were mixed
          with the solution.<br>
          <br>
          [0161] If component (B) consisted of two or more components,
          these were mixed homogeneously at first. Subsequently, the
          non-ionic surfactants (C) were added with stirring. Solid
          surfactants had to be dissolved completely. If necessary, the
          mixture had to be homogenized by applying heat up to about
          60[deg.] C. with stirring. Subsequently, if required, the
          ionic surfactants (D) were added with stirring. Again, solid
          surfactants had to be dissolved completely. The mixture had to
          be homogenized anew.<br>
          <br>
          [0162] The aqueous component (A(+E)) was added to the
          oil-surfactant mixture (B+C(/D)). Upon stirring at room
          temperature, the thermodynamic equilibrium established
          spontaneously. By applying heat (up to 60[deg.] C.), the
          one-phase microemulsion formed more quickly in some cases.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Measurements on Engine Test
            Benches</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0187] A) Test bench I: The first combustion measurements were
          performed on an engine test bench of the University of
          Duisburg. A Hatz (diesel) engine was employed. The measurement
          was performed at a constant revolutions per minute of 1500
          min&lt;-1&gt; . Through a brake, the load and thus the power
          was adjusted. The measurement was performed for two loads, at
          14.0 Nm (2.20 kWh) and at 9.6 Nm (1.51 kWh). In addition to
          the microemulsion, a reference fuel (diesel fuel) was burnt
          for direct comparison. The consumption was established by a
          fuel balance. In addition to the exhaust gas temperature, the
          noxious substances NOx, CO, HC and PM as well as O2 and CO
          were measured in the exhaust gas. For the particulate matter,
          the Bosch number on the one hand and the particle size
          distribution on the other hand were determined by a
          differential mobility analyzer.<br>
          <br>
          [0188] The mixture of components K-1 was employed.<br>
          <br>
          [0189] B) Test bench II: Further combustion experiments were
          performed on an engine test bench of I.S.P. of Salzbergen. In
          this case, a VW TDI (turbo diesel) engine was employed. As a
          reference fuel, a standard diesel fuel was employed. The fuel
          consumption was established by a fuel balance by analogy with
          the MWEG cycle (EU Direction 93/116/EC). In addition and by
          analogy with test bench I, a partial load stage (N=2500
          min&lt;-1&gt; /torque=75 Nm) as well as two full load stages
          (N=1900 min&lt;-1 &gt; and N=4000 min&lt;-1&gt; ) were
          initiated in order to measure the exhaust gas temperatures and
          the noxious substances particulate matter (smoke values) and
          NOx, as well as the maximum power for the full load stages. In
          the partial load stage, the fuel consumption was also
          established.<br>
          <br>
          [0190] In these measurements, the water content was varied
          from 0 to 8.7% and from 9 to 27%. The following mixtures of
          components were used (derived from K-12 and K-10):<br>
          <br>
          [0191] (A) was water in all mixtures, (B) was diesel fuel in
          all mixtures employed, (C) was Lutensol TO5 in all mixtures
          employed, (E) was ammonium carbonate in all mixtures. (D) was
          either pure AOT or Lutensite(R) A-BO, where in the latter
          case, for calculating the AOT content and water content, the
          water content of Lutensite(R) A-BO was subtracted and added to
          (A).<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results of Measurements on
            Engine Test Benches</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0192] A) Test bench I: The measuring results are shown in
          FIG. 3. The first combustion measurements already showed clear
          improvements in the microemulsion over the reference diesel
          fuel, even though this was not yet the best suited
          microemulsion. Thus, the exhaust gas temperature decreased by
          50 K for the lower and by 100 K for the higher load as
          compared to the reference diesel fuel. The fuel consumption
          and the efficiency, based on the combustible fractions
          (without water), were almost identical. Within the scope of
          the measuring error, the microemulsion even had a slightly
          better efficiency. The exhaust gas emissions were reduced by
          the microemulsion as compared to the reference diesel fuel.
          Thus, NO, was reduced by up to 26%, and CO by up to 32%. The
          Bosch number (particulate matter) became lower by up to 37%,
          the measurable particles becoming smaller and their number
          higher.<br>
          <br>
          [0193] B) Test bench II: The measuring results are shown in
          FIG. 4. The first combustion experiments with variation of the
          water content showed improvements when microemulsions were
          used as compared to the reference diesel fuel. It was observed
          that the exhaust gas temperature decreased linearly as the
          water content decreased. The fuel consumption and the
          efficiency, based on the combustible components, remained the
          same here, like in Example 10A. In this case too, like in
          Example 10A, slight reductions of the fuel consumption within
          the measuring error could be seen. Measurements made at even
          higher water contents even indicated an increase of
          efficiency. For low water contents, no change of the
          NOxemission as compared to the reference diesel fuel could be
          observed. In contrast, for higher water contents, the NOx
          emission was decreased by about 10%. Already for lower water
          contents, the measurable particulate matter was reduced
          drastically, in part to below the detection limit. Thus, about
          85% less particulate matter was measured already for low water
          concentrations.<br>
