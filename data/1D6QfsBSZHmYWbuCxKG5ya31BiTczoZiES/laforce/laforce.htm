      <p>In the early 1970s, Edward La Force of Vermont and his brother,
        Robert, designed a highly efficient engine that utilized the
        usually wasted heavier gasoline molecules. The Los Angeles
        Examiner&nbsp; on December 29, 1974, reported that efficiency
        was produced by altering the cams, timing, and so on, of stock
        Detroit engines. These modifications not only eliminated most of
        the pollution from the motor, but -- by completely burning all
        the fuel -- produced double the usual mileage. </p>

      <p><b>The LaForce Engine</b> </p>
      <p>Edward La Force struggled for years in Vermont to get backing
        to perfect his amazing engine. Ignored for years by the
        automotive industry, Edward and Robert, his brother, survived on
        the contributions of several thousand individuals who believed
        in them. His engine design manages to use even the harder to
        burn heavy gasoline molecules. Current engines are said to waste
        these, and, since they make up to 25 percent of the current
        fuels, the use of the heavy molecules was a great step forward.
      </p>
      <p>According to a <i>Los Angeles Examiner</i> article (December
        29, 1974), the cams, timing, and so on were altered on stock
        Detroit engines. These modifications not only eliminated most of
        the pollution from the motor, but, by completely burning all of
        the fuel the mileage was usually doubled. One Examiner reporter
        saw a standard American Motors car get a 57 per-cent increase in
        mileage at the Richmond, Vermont, research centre. With such
        publicity, the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] was forced
        to examine the situation, and of course, they found that the
        motor designs were not good enough. </p>
      <p>Few persons believed the EPA, including a number of Senators. A
        Congressional hearing on the matter in March 1975 still brought
        nothing to light -- except silence. The LaForces were
        interviewed by newspapers and auto manufacturers across the
        world, and even though they only modified the basic Detroit
        designs; Detroit was not interested. Anyone need 80 percent more
        mileage? </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; There is disclosed an apparatus for
        ensuring maximum vaporization of fuel before entry into the
        intake manifold of an internal combustion engine. The apparatus
        comprises an extension of the carburetor which separates
        vaporized fuel from droplets of fuel which remain unvaporized or
        which are condensed before entering the intake manifold. The
        unvaporized fuel is collected and subjected to heat generated at
        the engine exhaust pipe. In particular, heated ambient air heats
        and vaporizes the unvaporized fuel. The thusly vaporized fuel is
        then re-introduced into the fuel-air mixture exiting the
        carburetor, and subsequently enters the intake manifold. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an apparatus for treating fuel
        prior to entry into the intake manifold of an internal
        combustion engine, and more particularly to an apparatus for
        gasifying that portion of the fuel which will not vaporize under
        normal conditions, or which most readily condenses once
        vaporized. </p>
      <p>Unvaporized or ungasified portions of fuel normally do not burn
        within the cylinder and are lost to the combustion process and
        so wasted. The greatest portion of this unburned (wasted) fuel
        is not sufficiently volatile to gasify in the time spent within
        the cylinders. As the wasted fuel passes through the engine to
        the exhaust, some marginal parts appear in an exhaust gas
        analysis as partially burned carbon monoxide (CO). Other
        marginal parts appear as unburned hydrocarbons (HC). While
        detecting some of the unburned products ordinary exhaust gas
        analysis procedures do not detect a great portion of these
        unburned fuel constituents. The residual heavy varnishes and
        tars associated with the unburned portions of fuel recondense
        and drop out of the exhaust gas samples and thus fail to
        register as pollutants which are normally discharged by the
        exhaust pipe to the atmosphere. </p>
      <p>Mechanical designers have long been concerned with developing
        an efficiently operating internal combustion engine. In the
        United States, the automobile is responsible for a significant
        percentage of pollutants found in the atmosphere, and the
        consumption of vast amounts of the petroleum available in this
        country. Accordingly, automobile engine designers have expended
        considerable efforts to reduce the fuel consumption and
        pollution-developing characteristic of internal combustion
        engines. This interest has led to various engine designs, many
        of which have achieved some success. However, there remains the
        need for more efficient engines. </p>
      <p>In addition to the engine designs themselves, automotive
        engineers have proposed various devices for use with internal
        combustion engines to increase engine efficiency. This equipment
        is frequently directed to improving the efficiency of the engine
        combustion phase, such as ignition systems, pre-heaters, and the
        like, Again, some of this apparatus has experienced success, but
        none has made a significant advance in the field. </p>
      <p>Other proposals for increasing combustion efficiency have
        included the redesign of the combustion and/or the engine
        carburetor. Redesign of the carburetor improves engine
        combustion and mechanical efficiency by improving the uniformity
        and quality of the fuel-air mixture entering the several engine
        combustion chambers. For example, combustion efficiency has to
        some extent been improved by increasing fuel vaporization by
        means of devices such as centrifugal separators, charge
        stratifiers, screens placed in the flow lines, etc. While there
        may be some improvement in engine efficiency by using these
        devices, other problems may arise such as unreliability and
        non-uniformity of operation, especially during cold-engine
        operation or during periods of high acceleration. Furthermore,
        such devices are often difficult to control, making these
        devices of marginal value at best. </p>
      <p>A serious drawback to the above-discussed known fuel
        vaporization device is the inability to adequately operate on
        the heavy ends of modern fuels, that is, those fuel components
        having the high molecular weight. Heavy ends atomize
        sufficiently to pass through an engine but do not readily
        vaporize. Therefore, unless specially handled, the heavy ends
        will be entrained in the fuel-air mixture entering the engine
        combustion chamber with resulting combustion inefficiencies. The
        devices discussed above, often provide a mechanism for removing
        some of the heavy ends from the fuel-air mixture, but do not
        utilize these heavy ends when removed. Such known devices are
        therefore wasteful and inefficient. </p>
      <p>One known method for vaporizing heavy ends has been to heat the
        fuel or the fuel-air mixture. While this method is potentially
        effective, it has not been entirely successful because the
        complex composition of modern fuels makes it difficult to
        provide a simple device which vaporizes all of the heavy ends
        present in a given fuel without overheating the air in which the
        fuel is entrained. Furthermore, an engine may at different times
        be used with a variety of fuels, thus making a fixed temperature
        heating system inefficient. One known device operates at
        temperatures high enough to vaporize all heavy ends in the fuel.
        This device is at best wasteful of energy, and may even be
        dangerous from a standpoint of risking a high temperature
        explosion. As a compromise, devices have been developed which
        generate a type of "average temperature", with a resultant
        efficient vaporization of only some, but not all of the heavy
        ends. </p>
      <p>Other presently known vaporizing devices operate at less than
        maximum performance as a result of heat loss in the vaporized
        fuel flowing back into the mainstream of the engine fuel-air
        mixture. Reliquification of the heavy ends due to such heat loss
        would tend to negate the effect of the vaporizing device. There
        could also result a fuel-air mixture which varies in quality
        among the engine cylinders, with only those cylinders located
        near the device receiving fully vaporized fuel and uniform
        mixtures. Such non-uniformity in mixture would cause engine
        control problems as well as engine efficiency losses. </p>
      <p>Therefore, to assure efficient, safe engine operating, the heat
        output of a fuel vaporizer must be carefully controlled so as to
        heat the heavy ends in an atmosphere too rich to burn while
        heating. It is this lack of control which is most likely
        responsible for the inefficient, ineffective and potentially
        dangerous operation of known devices. Such inefficiency and/or
        ineffectiveness presents serious doubts to the future use of
        these known fuel vaporizing devices as the solution to the
        problem of improving the performance of internal combustion
        engines. </p>
      <p>Recently, strict exhaust pollution level constraints have been
        placed on modern internal combustion engines in general, and on
        automobile engines in particular. Most modern pollution control
        devices treat engine exhaust and therefore are directed at
        curing the symptoms of inefficient combustion rather than the
        causes. Thus, while pollution levels are decreased, automobile
        costs and fuel consumption are increased. </p>
      <p>The exhaust from automobile engines generally contains
        hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and oxides of nitrogen such as
        nitric oxide and nitrous oxide. Modern pollution control devices
        such as the catalytic converter help to control the hydrocarbon
        and carbon monoxide levels, but do not effectively control the
        nitrogen oxide levels in engine exhausts. Therefore, pollution
        from engine exhausts remains a serious problem. </p>
      <p>The drawbacks of the piston-type internal combustion engine
        which are discussed above have to some extent recently resulted
        in the commercialization of the long-known rotary engine. Some
        of the problems characteristic of the piston engine have been
        overcome, yet the rotary engine suffers from its own drawbacks.
        As an example, the piston engine runs relatively hot, and hence
        nitrous oxide is formed. Yet the piston engine is low in its
        carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon levels. The rotary engine, on
        the other hand, runs cooler and hence the level of nitrous oxide
        is low. However, the levels of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon
        are high. Fuel consumption is also high due to low expansion
        ratios. It should be apparent from the above, that the problem
        of exhaust pollution has by no means been overcome. </p>
      <p>While some presently known devices are directed to the problem
        of providing efficient combustion, and other devices purportedly
        provide exhaust pollution control, there are no known engines
        and no known devices which provide efficient engine operation
        under normal engine conditions. Therefore, a great need exists
        for a device which effectively enhances both the operating
        efficiency and the freedom from exhaust pollution in an internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an internal combustion engine
        provided with a recirculating fuel-feed mechanism for increasing
        the efficiency of the combustion phases of the internal
        combustion engine by ensuring complete vaporization of the fuel
        entering the intake manifold. As such, the power developed by
        the engine is increased, and the level of pollutants is reduced.
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Briefly, the present invention relates to an apparatus for use
        in an internal combustion engine for vaporizing fuel heavy ends
        which would otherwise enter the intake manifold and hence the
        cylinders in a liquid state. The apparatus comprises a
        carburetor extension for delivering vaporized fuel to the intake
        manifold and for directing the flow of unvaporized fuel toward a
        heated collecting chamber which is energized by heat from the
        engine exhaust. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, two
        heater stages are provided to ensure total vaporization of the
        fuel heavy ends, with the outlet of the recirculating fuel-feed
        system feeding into the main stream of the carburetor fuel-air
        mixture just prior to introduction to the intake manifold. </p>
      <p>The mechansim for heat transfer utilized in the first heater
        stage comprises a continuous spiral groove in an outer surface
        of the engine exhaust pipe. The groove retains the unatomized
        liquid fuel in intimate contact with the heat source until the
        fuel is vaporized. </p>
      <p>The second heater stage is downstream of the first, and is
        positioned near a location where the atomized recirculated fuel
        is introduced into the intake manifold of the engine. Thus, any
        heat loss undergone by the vaporized fuel flowing from the first
        to the second stage is replaced by the second heater stage. A
        uniformly vaporized fuel is thus delivered to the cylinders of
        an engine by way of the present invention. Additional heaters
        can be strategically positioned in an engine to maximize the
        uniformity of the fuel-air mixture flowing into the engine
        intake manifold and to all engine cylinders. </p>
      <p>The present invention also relates to the method of vaporizing
        unvaporized heavy ends prior to entering the manifold of an
        engine. The inventive method comprises the steps of separating
        the unvaporized from the vaporized fuel, collecting the
        unvaporized fuel, preheating the thus collected fuel in a first
        heater stage using heat from the engine exhaust, directing the
        vapor thus formed to flow through a further heater stage
        downstream of the first to ensure complete vaporization, and
        introducing the vapor into the fuel-air mixture exiting the
        engine carburetor. </p>
      <p>While the apparatus of the present invention can be used with
        any internal combustion engine, it is contemplated that the
        invention be used on an engine having a high expansion ratio.
        Such a high expansion ratio engine is disclosed in co-pending
        U.S. patent application Ser. No. 427,048, filed Dec. 21, 1973
        now abandoned and entitled Internal Combustion Engines. The
        present invention results in a rapid and substantially complete
        fuel explosion. Such an explosion is best suited for use in the
        high expansion ratio engine which operates most efficiently best
        with rapid fuel explosion and which offers a rate of expansion
        sufficiently rapid to hold combustion temperatures well below
        the critical limits known to produce knock and the contaminant,
        nitrous oxide. </p>
      <p>An engine having a dual exhaust pipe is another advantageous
        application for the apparatus of the present invention.
        Scavenging is the process of removing burned gases from an
        internal combustion engine. Therefore, efficient scavenging of
        an engine will result in an increase in engine power and
        performance. Exhaust from certain cylinders may interfere with
        the functioning of other cylinders in single exhaust engines. A
        dual exhaust manifold engine overcomes this drawback by
        exhausting alternately firing cylinders in alternate sections of
        the exhaust manifold. </p>
      <p>With the present invention, substantially uniform fuel-air
        mixtures are fed to all cylinders. As such, the richness of the
        mixture need not be balanced to compromise engine performance, a
        step necessitated by the common unevenness of mixture in
        different cylinders. In addition, the uniform and fully
        vaporized nature of the fuel-air mixture in the cylinders
        results in substantially complete burning in the cylinders.
        Therefore, the present invention brings about a low level of
        nitrous oxide carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons as well. </p>
      <p>It is accordingly a broad object of the present invention to
        provide a mechanism to increase the efficiency of an engine. </p>
      <p>A further object of the present invention is to efficiently
        reduce the amount of unvaporized fuel entering the intake
        manifold of an engine. </p>
      <p>Yet a further object of the present invention is to improve the
        operating efficiency of an internal combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide improved
        control over the fuel-air mixture entering an engine intake
        manifold. </p>
      <p>Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce the
        level of pollutants found in the exhaust of an internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a
        uniform fuel-air mixture to all cylinders of an internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>Still a further object of the present invention is to vaporize
        fuel heavy ends without producing excess heat in the carburetor
        air or hot spots in the combustion chambers of an internal
        combustion engine. </p>
      <p>A further object of the present invention is to recycle
        unvaporized fuel prior to entry into the intake manifold until
        such fuel is fully vaporized. </p>
      <p>Yet a further object of the present invention is to improve
        engine scavenging. </p>
      <p>These and other objects of the present invention, as well as
        many of the attendant advantages thereof, will become more
        readily apparent when reference is made to the following
        description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Shown in FIG. 1 is an apparatus for vaporizing unvaporized
        fuel, such as fuel heavy ends. The apparatus is denoted
        generally by the reference numeral 10 and is illustrated as
        associating with a carburetor represented at 12. The carburetor
        12 may be of the conventional type in which air travelling at
        high velocity past a fuel intake jet results in a fuel-air
        mixture for injection into an intake manifold 14 of an internal
        combustion engine. An engine exhaust pipe is schematically
        illustrated at 16, having portions 16a and 16b which will be
        discussed in greater detail below. </p>
      <p>Because the fuels for internal combustion engines contain
        components having various molecular weights, some of the fuel
        exits carburetor 12 without being vaporized. Related to this is
        the problem of recondensation of the same portions of the fuel.
        Such unvaporized fuel is likely to be constituted by heavy ends,
        and can be seen in FIG. 1 by droplets 20. As above discussed,
        this unvaporized fuel, or heavy ends, is an undesirable
        component of the fuel-air mixture entering engine intake
        manifold 14, because such droplets 20 do not readily burn in the
        combustion chambers. </p>
      <p>Removal of undesirable droplets 20 from the fuel-air mixture
        entering intake manifold 14 is effected by the inventive
        apparatus 10. Apparatus 10 comprises a carburetor extension 30
        attached to the carburetor base and which is designed to deliver
        droplets 20 to a collecting funnel 32. Collecting funnel 32 is
        surrounded by a heat riser 34 similar to the known heat riser
        used in conventional engines. Heat riser 34 is supplied with air
        heated by the exhaust manifold through conduit 94, as will be
        explained below. From collecting funnel 32, the fuel droplets 20
        flow through a first conduit 36 and into a first stage heater 38
        comprising a heater box 40 surrounding the hottest accessable
        portion of engine exhaust pipe portion 16a. As shown in FIG. 1,
        droplet flow is denoted by solid arrows and vapor or gas flow is
        denoted by dashed arrows. The fuel droplets are vaporized in
        first stage heater 38 in a manner to be described below. Fuel
        which is vaporized in first stage heater 38 flows through a
        second conduit 42 and into a second stage heater 44 comprising a
        heater box 46 surrounding a region of exhaust pipe portion 16a.
        While the vapor exiting second stage heater 44 may be fed to
        still further heaters, only two are shown in FIG. 1. From heater
        44, the vaporized fuel flows through a third conduit 48 and into
        the carburetor extension 30 through a jet nozzle 50.
        Substantially all of the fuel exiting nozzle 50 will be
        vaporized, yet some of the fuel may condense prior to reaching
        intake manifold 14. These condensed droplets are recycled as
        shown by solid arrows until vaporized. </p>
      <p>As can be seen from FIG. 1, the collecting funnel 32 is in
        communication both with the outlet of the carburetor 12 and with
        the intake manifold 14. Therefore, two fuel paths are defined.
        The first is from the carburetor extension 30 to the intake
        manifold 14; vaporized fuel from the carburetor 12 and from
        nozzle 50 takes this path. The second is from extension 30 to
        the funnel 32; unvaporized and condensed fuel from carburetor 12
        and nozzle 50 takes this path. As can be seen, the vaporized
        fuel travels to the intake manifold 14 through a passage 54
        defined between carburetor extension 30 and collecting funnel
        32. </p>
      <p>The carburetor extension 30 comprises a tubular body 60 having
        an integral flange 61 at one end which associates with a flange
        12 of the carburetor and which is mounted at boss 67 of the
        intake manifold 14 by bolts 65. A knife edge 69 is provided at
        the lower end of the tubular body 60, remote from flange 61. The
        knife edge 69 prevents fuel from collecting on the bottom end of
        the extension 30. The outlet end of the extension 30 is shown at
        62. Nozzle 50 is located within extension 30 so that the
        fuel-air mixture flowing through extension 30 develops a suction
        nozzle 50, thereby drawing the vaporized fuel through the
        conduits of the system. </p>
      <p>The collecting funnel 32 takes the form of a cylindrical
        section 70 surrounding carburetor extension 30 and converging
        section 72 downstream of the outlet 62. Fuel droplets collected
        in collecting funnel 32 flow through the converging section 72
        under the influence of gravity and whatever dynamic forces are
        developed at outlet 62. A fluid or droplet trap 74 is defined at
        the bottom section 72. Trap 74 is associated with conduit 36 and
        heat riser 34 in a fluid-tight fashion, as by threads 76, nut 78
        and gaskets 80 and 81 as illustrated in FIG. 1. As can be seen,
        gasket 81 is held between the base 82 of heat riser 34 and a
        shoulder of the trap section 74. </p>
      <p>The heat riser 34 surrounds the converging section 72 of the
        collecting funnel 32, and comprises the base 82 to which trap 74
        is attached and sides 84 to which the cylindrical section 70 of
        funnel 32 is attached, as shown at 86. Another gasket 89 is
        employed to ensure a fluid-tight joint between the sides of
        defined riser 34 and a shoulder 91 defined integral with the
        collecting funnel 72. </p>
      <p>Heat for the heat riser 34 is supplied, if necessary, by a heat
        source or collector comprising a cup 90 secured to the engine
        exhaust manifold 16 by means of a bolt 96. Ambient air flows
        into cup 90 through openings 92 between the cup and the exhaust
        manifold, and is trapped in cup 90. The trapped air is heated by
        the exhaust manifold and flows out of the cup through air
        conduit 94 into heat riser 34. The heated air from the heat
        source flows around collecting funnel 32 and out of the heat
        riser 34 through air conduit 98 into fuel conduit 48. In some
        applications, it may be unnecessary to add heat to cup 90. In
        such case, the conduits 94 and 98 would be disconnected. FIG. 4
        shows an alternative embodiment of the heat collecting
        mechanism. There, air conduit 95 is connected to the atmosphere
        through opening 93. The path between conduit 94 and opening 92,
        in the form of conduit 97, is positioned inside exhaust manifold
        16 by means of a bolt 96. Ambient air flows into cup 90 through
        openings 92 between the cup and the exhaust pipe, and is trapped
        in cup 90. The trapped air is heated by the exhaust pipe and
        flows out of the cup though air conduit 94 into heat riser 34.
        The heated air from the heat source flows around collecting
        funnel 32 and out of the heat riser 34 through air conduit 98
        into fuel conduit 48. </p>
      <p>The heat riser 34 thus serves as a pre-heater for the fuel
        droplets entering the recirculating assembly 10. By applying
        heat to the fuel droplets in several stages, as is the case in
        the preferred embodiment of the invention, a high degree of
        control over the heat application can be accomplished.
        Importantly, the temperature of each stage of such a multistage
        heater system is lower than the temperature of a single stage
        system. Therefore, the undesirable hot spots of known
        atomization systems can be eliminated. </p>
      <p>A further advantage is brought about by the inventive apparatus
        as a result of the air flowing into conduit 48 from the heat
        riser 34 being heated. The heated air passing from jet 50 into
        the carburetor outlet enhances the combustion efficiency of the
        engine by supplying hot fuel vapors to the fuel-air mixture
        entering manifold 14. In addition, the highly enriched heated
        air added to the vapor flow in conduit 48 acts as a final stage
        heating point to maintain vapor temperature and to add heat to
        the vapor flowing out of jet 50. Such heat addition replaces any
        heat lost by the fluid while flowing in conduit 48 from the
        second heater stage 44. The air conduits 94 and 98 can be
        designed to provide any desired temperature air to the fuel
        conduit 48, as for example, by adding heaters or insulation. </p>
      <p>The vaporization of droplets 20 initiated by the heat riser 34
        is continued in the first stage heater 38. The droplets flowing
        into the heater stage 38 from conduit 36 are transferred by an
        extension 100 of conduit 36 to a groove 102 surrounding in the
        outer surface of engine exhaust pipe portion 16b. Groove 102
        resembles a screw thread in that it is continuous around the
        outer surface of pipe portion 16b for a preselected length of
        that pipe. However, to maintain the liquid fuel in the groove
        102, the bottom surface is tapered upwardly so as to define a
        trough. Fluid flows in groove 102 around the exhaust pipe
        portion 16b, thus being heated thereby. Gravity results in the
        liquid fuel flowing downwardly around groove 102, and the
        pressure gradients developed by jet 50 add to uniform flow in
        groove 102. The unvaporized droplets remain in groove 102 until
        vaporized, at which time the vapor fills the chamber defined by
        the first stage heater 38. Vapor produced in first stage heater
        38 flows through exit port 104 and into fuel conduit 42. </p>
      <p>All of the unvaporized fuel entering groove 102 should be
        vaporized in the first stage heater 38. </p>
      <p>The groove 102 is best shown in FIG. 2 as having a modified
        square shape. Top face 106 is essentially perpendicular to the
        longitudinal axis of exhaust pipe 16 and back face 108 is
        essentially parallel to the pipe centerline. Bottom face 110 of
        the groove is skewed with respect to face 108 thereby forming a
        V-shaped trough in the groove. This trough holds liquified fuel
        in groove 102 forcing the fuel to remain in intimate contact
        with the hot exhaust of pipe portion 16b. Therefore, the spiral
        groove 102 serves to maintain the fuel in contact with the
        exhaust pipe 16 and to increase the time the liquid fuel is in
        contact with the pipe 16b thus maximizing the time for
        vaporizing the fuel. The groove 102 also minimizes the effects
        of hot spots in the inventive system. </p>
      <p>The heat transfer rate between the hot exhaust gases flowing in
        pipe 16b and the unvaporized fuel flowing in groove 102 can
        further be increased by radiating vanes such as those
        illustrated in FIG. 3. Vanes 114 are shown as extending across
        the pipe 16b and intersecting at the centerline of the exhaust
        pipe. The vanes serve as heat transfer paths between the exhaust
        gases and the inner wall 112 of exhaust pipe 16b. It is
        contemplated that the vanes extend the entire length of the
        heater 38. A similar vane structure can be used in the second
        stage heater. If desirable to control the transfer rate between
        the hot exhaust gases in exhaust pipe 16b and the unvaporized
        fuel flowing in groove 102, the vanes can be specially shaped or
        of lengths other than those of their respective heaters. </p>
      <p>Fuel vapor developed in first stage heater 38 flows through
        fuel conduit 42 and into second stage heater 44. It is
        understood that while only two are shown, any number of heater
        stages can be used. Fuel vapor flows into the second stage
        heater 46 through an opening 120 in conduit 42 which may be
        equipped with an orifice to control the vapor flow into the
        heater box 46. The vapor flows through the heater box 46 which
        again effects contact between the vapor and the exhaust pipe
        16a. However, as is evident from FIG. 1, the second heater stage
        46 has no groove such as groove 102 of the first heater stage.
        Reheated vapor flows out of the heater box 46 through an exit
        port 122 and into the fuel conduit 48. A plurality of surfaces
        such as baffles 124 and fins 126 may be provided to control the
        vapor flow and/or the heat transfer rate. Preferably, the second
        stage heater 44 is positioned near jet 50 to maximize heat
        transfer. </p>
      <p>To further compensate for heat lost by the vaporized fuel, fuel
        conduits 36, 42 and 48 can be insulated. Flow through conduits
        36 and 42 is in a downward direction thereby taking advantage of
        gravity. The flow in conduit 48 may be upward due to the
        proximity thereof to the jet 50. The flow rate in fuel conduits
        36, 42 and 48 can also be adjusted to produce the most efficient
        vaporization of the fuel. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the cross-sectional
        area of conduits 36 and 48 is four times that of the carburetor
        jet cross-sectional area. Conduit 42, on the other hand, has a
        cross-sectional area sixteen times that of the carburetor jet
        cross-sectional area. Furthermore, the cross-sectional area of
        the outlet 62 is equal to that of the carburetor base area, and
        to that of passage 54. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing, it should be evident that the inventive
        apparatus 10 can provide significant improvement in the
        performance of an internal combustion engine. By improving the
        quality of the fuel-air mixture entering the engine intake
        manifold, significant power increases may be realized without a
        corresponding increase in the size of the engine. At the same
        time, the substantially total atomization of fuel improves
        combustion efficiency thus greatly increasing the miles per
        gallon ratio important to modern-day automobiles. Furthermore,
        by injecting a properly adjusted fuel-air mixture into the
        engine intake manifold, engine vacuum spark advance may be
        reduced. </p>
      <p>Another significant advantage of the engine designed in
        accordance with the present invention is the reduction in
        pollutants exhausted by the engine. Internal combustion engines
        equipped with the inventive apparatus 10 produce exhausts having
        negligible levels of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The
        invention also reduces the level of nitrogen oxides such as
        nitric or nitrous oxide in the exhaust of an engine. The
        apparatus of the present invention inherently accomplishes
        substantial pollutant reduction without the necessity for
        pollution devices such as those used with existing automobile
        engines. As discussed above, fuel droplets in the fuel-air
        mixture inhibit combustion in the engine. To compensate for the
        presence of fuel droplets, many engines operate at high
        temperatures. As the aspirated air is composed of roughly 78
        percent nitrogen, these high temperature explosions generate
        dangerous oxides of the nitrogen. The invention avoids the
        production of these pollutants since the combustion temperatures
        of an engine designed in accordance with the present invention
        are below those levels at which oxides of nitrogen are produced.
      </p>
      <p>Thus it should be apparent that the apparatus of the present
        invention not only increases engine efficiency in the way of
        engine performance, but also develops an exhaust containing only
        minimal pollutants, hence avoiding the necessity for external
        pollution control devices. </p>
      <p>The operation of the inventive apparatus is as follows.
        Unvaporized fuel-ends which are in the form of droplets 20 are
        separated out of the fuel-air mixture and are collected in
        collecting funnel 32. The collected droplets are pre-heated in
        heat riser 34, and flow through conduit 36 into first stage
        heater 38. In heater 38, the liquid fuel is carried in groove
        102 which transfers heat from exhaust pipe portion 16b to the
        liquid fuel. The fuel is maintained in the groove 102 until the
        heat from exhaust pipe portion 16b has vaporized the droplets.
        The vaporized fuel then flows through conduit 42 into the second
        heater stage 44 positioned in close proximity to carburetor
        extension 30, so that heat transfers from pipe portion 16a to
        the vaporized fuel. In this manner, the vaporized fuel is
        reheated prior to flowing through conduit 48 and out of jet 50
        into the carburetor exhaust stream. Finally, the vaporized fuel
        is directed to the engine intake manifold 14. The method can
        also include placing a plurality of heater stages at strategic
        points throughout the engine, such as in close proximity with an
        engine cylinder. Such placement will assure a thoroughly
        vaporized fuel in the fuel-air mixture entering any engine
        cylinder, even those cylinders located some distance from the
        apparatus and/or engine carburetor. That fuel which is not
        vaporized, or that fuel which condenses, is recirculated through
        the inventive fuel feed system. </p>
      <p>The vaporizing apparatus 10 is conveniently adapted for use in
        the aforementioned dual exhaust system engine. For purposes of
        illustration, the following discussion will be based upon a
        six-cylinder engine having an exhaust manifold divided into a
        front section of three cylinders and a rear section of three
        cylinders. With such an engine, exhaust pipe portion 16a is
        connected to the front three cylinders through the forward
        portion of the exhaust manifold, and portion 16b is connected to
        the rear three cylinders. In a six cylinder engine having a
        firing order of 1-5-3-6-2-4, successive exhausting will thereby
        occur in alternate manifold sections. Thus, cylinder 1 will
        exhaust into portion 16a, cylinder 5 into portion 16b, then
        cylinder 3 will exhaust into portion 16a, and so forth.
        Successive exhausting into alternate manifold sections prevents
        back pressure developed in a front cylinder from acting upon (or
        through) an open back cylinder exhaust valve (and vice versa).
        Such successive exhausting therefore results in the efficient
        scavenging of all cylinders; and as is known, such efficient
        scavenging improves engine power and efficiency. A single full
        length exhaust manifold can be easily converted into the dual
        exhaust manifold configuration shown in FIG. 1 by cutting the
        manifold at the center, capping the ends thus opened, and adding
        appropriate exhaust pipes. Such a dual manifold is shown in FIG.
        5 with the original manifold shown in phantom lines. A
        1-5-3-6-2-4 firing sequence is also illustrated in FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present
        invention are possible in light of the above teachings. For
        example, the present invention may include electric heaters for
        supplementing the heat added by the engine exhaust during cold
        engine start-up. Or, if the engine temperature is low even long
        after start up, it is possible to add heat to appropriate
        portions of the engine to improve performance. In addition, it
        has been discovered that with the high-expansion ratio engine,
        the lower side of the engine block runs quite cool. Therefore,
        to maintain the entire block at optimum temperature, water from
        the top of the head may be extracted and recirculated into the
        input side of the water pump for subsequent entry into the head.
        Other modifications are possible. It is therefore understood
        that, within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may
        be practiced otherwise than as specifically described. </p>
