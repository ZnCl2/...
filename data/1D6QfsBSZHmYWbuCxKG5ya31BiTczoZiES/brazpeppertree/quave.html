            MRSA superbug</b></font><br>
        <b>by </b><b>Karen Foster</b><br>

      &nbsp; <br>
      Superbugs are without a doubt a major threat affecting all health
      care systems. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
      infection is caused by a type of staph bacteria that's become
      resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph
      infections. Despite attempts by new antibiotics to neutralize the
      effects of MRSA, none have succeeded. But nature did.<br>
      <br>
      The red berries of the Brazilian peppertree -- a weedy, invasive
      species common in Florida -- contain an extract with the power to
      disarm dangerous antibiotic-resistant staph bacteria, scientists
      at Emory University have discovered.<br>
      <br>
      The journal Scientific Reports is publishing the finding, made in
      the lab of Cassandra Quave, an assistant professor in Emory's
      Center for the Study of Human Health and in the School of
      Medicine's Department of Dermatology.<br>
      <br>
      "Traditional healers in the Amazon have used the Brazilian
      peppertree for hundreds of years to treat infections of the skin
      and soft tissues," Quave says. "We pulled apart the chemical
      ingredients of the berries and systematically tested them against
      disease-causing bacteria to uncover a medicinal mechanism of this
      plant."<br>
      <br>
      The researchers showed that a refined, flavone-rich composition
      extracted from the berries inhibits formation of skin lesions in
      mice infected with MRSA. The compound works not by killing the
      MRSA bacteria, but by repressing a gene that allows the bacteria
      cells to communicate with one another. Blocking that communication
      prevents the cells from taking collective action, a mechanism
      known as quorum quenching.<br>
      <br>
      "It essentially disarms the MRSA bacteria, preventing it from
      excreting the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissues," Quave
      says. "The body's normal immune system then stands a better chance
      of healing a wound."<br>
      <br>
      While infections are becoming increasingly difficult to beat, no
      new class of antibiotic has been discovered since 1987. In
      contrast, a new infection emerges on an almost yearly basis.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery may hold potential for new ways to treat and prevent
      antibiotic-resistant infections, a growing international problem.
      Antibiotic-resistant infections annually cause at least two
      million illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States,
      according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The
      United Nations last year called antibiotic-resistant infections a
      "fundamental threat" to global health and safety, citing estimates
      that they cause at least 700,000 deaths each year worldwide, with
      the potential to grow to 10 million deaths annually by 2050.<br>
      <br>
      Bacteria are rife in conventionally grown US meat including
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria also known as superbugs. Almost half
      of beef, chicken, pork and turkey in samples tested from US
      grocery stores contained staph bacteria reported the Los Angeles
      Times in 2011 including the resistant MRSA staph bacterium
      (methicillin-resistant S. aureus). Pork tested by Consumer Reports
      in 2013 also contained MRSA and four other kinds of resistant
      bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      Blasting deadly bacteria with drugs designed to kill them is
      helping to fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance. Some of the
      stronger bacteria may survive these drug onslaughts and
      proliferate, passing on their genes to offspring and leading to
      the evolution of deadly "super bugs."<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, the Brazilian peppertree extract works by simply
      disrupting the signaling of MRSA bacteria without killing it. The
      researchers also found that the extract does not harm the skin
      tissues of mice, or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.<br>
      <br>
      "In some cases, you need to go in heavily with antibiotics to
      treat a patient," Quave says. "But instead of always setting a
      bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an
      anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping
      to restore balance to the health of a patient. More research is
      needed to better understand how we can best leverage
      anti-virulence therapeutics to improve patient outcomes." <br>
      <br>
      Quave, a leader in the field of medical ethnobotany and a member
      of the Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center, studies how indigenous
      people incorporate plants in healing practices to uncover
      promising candidates for new drugs.<br>
      <br>
      The Brazilian peppertree (Schinus terebinthifolia) is native to
      South America but thrives in subtropical climates. It is abundant
      in much of Florida, and has also crept into southern areas of
      Alabama, Georgia, Texas and California. Sometimes called the
      Florida holly or broad leaf peppertree, the woody plant forms
      dense thickets that crowd out native species.<br>
      <br>
      "The Brazilian peppertree is not some exotic and rare plant found
      only on a remote mountaintop somewhere," Quave says. "It's a weed,
      and the bane of many a landowner in Florida."<br>
      <br>
      From an ecological standpoint, it makes sense that weeds would
      have interesting chemistry, Quave adds. "Persistent, weedy plants
      tend to have a chemical advantage in their ecosystems, which help
      may protect them from diseases so they can more easily spread in a
      new environment." <br>

      Schinus terebinthifolius<br>
      Starr 041018-0009 Schinus terebinthifolius.jpg<br>
      Scientific classification<br>
      Kingdom: Plantae, Angiosperms, Eudicots, Rosids, Order:
      Sapindales; Family: Anacardiaceae; Genus: Schinus ; Species: S.
      terebinthifolia<br>
      Binomial name : Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi, 1820[1]<br>
      <br>
      Schinus terebinthifolia is a species of flowering plant in the
      cashew family, Anacardiaceae, that is native to subtropical and
      tropical South America (southeastern Brazil, northern Argentina,
      and Paraguay). It is found in these states of Brazil: Alagoas,
      Bahia, Espírito Santo, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais,
      Pernambuco, Paraná, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio
      Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, São Paulo, and Sergipe. Common
      names include Brazilian peppertree,[2] aroeira, rose pepper,
      broadleaved pepper tree,[3] wilelaiki (or wililaiki),[4] and
      Christmasberry.[5]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Brazilian peppertree is a sprawling shrub or small tree, with a
      shallow root system, reaching a height of 7–10 m. The branches can
      be upright, reclining, or nearly vine-like, all on the same plant.
      Its plastic morphology allows it to thrive in all kinds of
      ecosystems: from dunes to swamps, where it grows as a semiaquatic
      plant.[6] The leaves are alternate, 10–22 cm long, pinnately
      compound with (3–) 5–15 leaflets; the leaflets are roughly oval
      (lanceolate to elliptical), 3–6 cm long and 2–3.5 cm broad, and
      have finely toothed margins, an acute to rounded apex and
      yellowish veins. The leaf rachis between the leaflets is usually
      (but not invariably) slightly winged. The plant is dioecious, with
      small white flowers borne profusely in axillary clusters. The
      fruit is a drupe 4–5 mm diameter, carried in dense clusters of
      hundreds.<br>
      <br>
      The two varieties are:<br>
      <br>
      S. terebinthifolius var. acutifolius, leaves to 22 cm, with 7–15
      leaflets, fruit pink<br>
      <br>
      S. terebinthifolius var. terebinthifolius, leaves to 17 cm, with
      5–13 leaflets, fruit red<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cultivation and uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Brazilian pepper is widely grown as an ornamental plant in
      frost-free regions of South America for its foliage and fruit. It
      is considered as a melliferous flower[6] and is the main source of
      food for the bee Tetragonisca angustula, which is an important
      honey producer.[7]<br>
      <br>
      Although it is not a true pepper (Piper), its dried drupes are
      often sold as pink peppercorns, as are the fruits from the related
      species Schinus molle (Peruvian peppertree). The seeds can be used
      as a spice, adding a pepper-like taste to food. They are usually
      sold in a dry state and have a bright pink color. They are less
      often sold pickled in brine, where they have a dull, almost green
      hue.<br>
      <br>
      In the United States, it has been introduced to California, Texas,
      Hawaii, Arizona, Nevada, Louisiana,[8] and Florida. Planted
      originally as an ornamental outside of its native range, Brazilian
      pepper has become widespread and is considered an invasive species
      in many subtropical regions with moderate to high rainfall,
      including parts or all of Australia, the Bahamas, Bermuda,
      southern China, Cuba, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Malta,
      the Marshall Islands, Mauritius, New Caledonia, New Zealand,
      Norfolk Island, Puerto Rico, Réunion, South Africa, and the United
      States. In drier areas, such as Israel and southern California, it
      is also grown, but has not generally proved invasive. In
      California, it is considered invasive in coastal regions by the
      California Invasive Plant Council (www.cal-ipc.org.)<br>
      <br>
      Brazilian pepper is hard to control because it produces basal
      shoots if the trunk is cut. Trees also produce abundant seeds that
      are dispersed by birds and ants. This same hardiness makes the
      tree highly useful for reforestation in its native environment,
      but enables it to become invasive outside of its natural range.[6]<br>
      Toxicity<br>
      <br>
      Like many other species in the family Anacardiaceae, Brazilian
      pepper has an aromatic sap that can cause skin reactions (similar
      to poison ivy burns) in some sensitive people – although the
      reaction is usually weaker than that induced by touch of the
      closely related Lithraea molleoides, known in Brazil as "wild"
      aroeira (aroeira brava). Conversely, Schinus terebinthifolius is
      commonly known as "tame" aroeira (aroeira mansa).<br>
      <br>
      In a paper on triterpenes, the ingested fruits are noted to have a
      “paralyzing effect” on birds.[9] The narcotic and toxic effects on
      birds and other wildlife has also been noted by others, e.g.,
      Bureau of Aquatic Plant Management. The AMA Handbook of Poisonous
      and Injurious Plants reports that the triterpenes found in the
      fruits can result in irritation of the throat, gastroenteritis,
      diarrhea, and vomiting in man.[10] Like most other members of the
      Anacardiaceae, Brazilian pepper contains active alkenyl phenols,
      e.g., urushiol, cardol, which can cause contact dermatitis and
      inflammation in sensitive individuals.[11][12] Contact with the
      “sap” from a cut or bruised tree can result in rash, lesions,
      oozing sores, severe itching,reddening and swelling (especially of
      the eyes), and welts.[13]<br>
      <br>
      The burning of plant matter releases many airborne irritants, so
      is not an effective means of control. It is said to have a
      "mace-like" effect upon nearby people and is highly advised
      against.<br>
      <br>
      <b>History</b><br>
      <br>
      "Florida holly" was introduced to Florida by at latest 1891,
      probably earlier,[14] where it has spread rapidly since about
      1940,[15] replacing native plants, like mangroves, with thousands
      of acres occupied. It is especially adept at colonizing disturbed
      sites and can grow in both wet and dry conditions. Its growth
      habit allows it to climb over understory trees and invade mature
      canopies, forming thickets that choke out most other plants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Legal status</b><br>
      <br>
      The species, including the seed, is legally prohibited from sale,
      transport, or planting in Florida, according to the Florida
      Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Noxious Weed
      List.[16] It is classified as a Category I pest by The Florida
      Exotic Pest Plant Council (FL EPPC).[17] To keep the plant from
      spreading into native plant communities and displacing them, local
      regulations and environmental guidelines require eradication of
      Brazilian pepper wherever possible. The plant and all parts are
      also illegal for sale or transfer in Texas.[18] As one of the two
      species sold as pink peppercorn, the other being Schinus molle, it
      lacks generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status with the FDA.[19]<br>
      <br>
      It is a declared weed in several states of Australia.[20][21][22]
      In South Africa, it is classified as a category 1 invader in
      KwaZulu-Natal province, where any plants are to be removed and
      destroyed, and a category 3 invader in all other provinces,
      meaning it may no longer be planted.[23]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Control</b><br>
      <br>
      Two herbicides are approved for use in the United States to
      exterminate Brazilian pepper: Triclopyr, using the basal bark
      method; and glyphosate. Picloram can be used if the stump has been
      freshly cut, but this is not the preferred nor most effective
      means of eradication.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Medicinal uses</b><br>
      <br>
      Peppertree is the subject of extensive folk medicinal lore where
      it is indigenous. Virtually all parts of this tropical tree,
      including its leaves, bark, fruit, seeds, resin, and oleoresin (or
      balsam) have been used medicinally by indigenous peoples
      throughout the tropics. The plant has a very long history of use
      and appears in ancient religious artifacts and on idols among some
      of the ancient Chilean Amerindians.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      Throughout South and Central America, Brazilian peppertree is
      reported to be an astringent, antibacterial, diuretic, digestive
      stimulant, tonic, antiviral, and wound healer. In Peru, the sap is
      used as a mild laxative and a diuretic, and the entire plant is
      used externally for fractures and as a topical antiseptic. The
      oleoresin is used externally as a wound healer, to stop bleeding,
      and for toothaches, and it is taken internally for rheumatism and
      as a purgative. In South Africa, a leaf tea is used to treat
      colds, and a leaf decoction is inhaled for colds, hypertension,
      depression, and irregular heart beat. In the Brazilian Amazon, a
      bark tea is used as a laxative, and a bark-and-leaf tea is used as
      a stimulant and antidepressant. In Argentina, a decoction is made
      with the dried leaves and is taken for menstrual disorders and is
      also used for respiratory and urinary tract infections and
      disorders.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      Brazilian peppertree is still employed in herbal medicine today in
      many countries. It is used for many conditions in the tropics,
      including menstrual disorders, bronchitis, gingivitis, gonorrhea,
      gout, eye infections, rheumatism, sores, swellings, tuberculosis,
      ulcers, urethritis, urogenital disorders, venereal diseases,
      warts, and wounds. In Brazilian herbal medicine today, the dried
      bark and/or leaves are employed for heart problems (hypertension
      and irregular heart beat), infections of all sorts, menstrual
      disorders with excessive bleeding, tumors, and general
      inflammation. A liquid extract or tincture prepared with the bark
      is used internally as a stimulant, tonic, and astringent, and
      externally for rheumatism, gout, and syphilis. [24]<br>
      <br>
      Recently, the fruit of the plant has been studied and shows
      promise as a treatment for MRSA. A chemical in the berry appears
      to stop bacteria from producing a toxin which breaks down tissue.
      It also appears to suppress the way the bacteria communicate. [25]<br>

      ...Recently, Quave and her research team have discovered that an
      extract of Brazilian peppertree berries — an invasive species
      common in many warmer parts of the United States — prevents MRSA
      from forming skin lesions in mice and shrinks biofilms formed by
      the bacteria. “I really believe these kind of inhibitors are a
      major part of the solution to antibiotic resistance,” Quave says.
      “We can shut down bacteria’s most dangerous machinery without
      killing them.” She envisions using such drugs as prophylactics in
      surgeries with a high infection risk, or in combination with other
      antimicrobials if a serious infection is already established...<br>

          deadly staph bacteria</b><b><br>
        </b><i>Extract shuts down staph without boosting its drug
          resistance</i><i><br>
        </i></div>
      <br>
      Leaves of the European chestnut tree contain ingredients with the
      power to disarm dangerous staph bacteria without boosting its drug
      resistance, scientists have found.<br>
      <br>
      PLOS ONE is publishing the study of a chestnut leaf extract, rich
      in ursene and oleanene derivatives, that blocks Staphlococcus
      aureus virulence and pathogenesis without detectable resistance.<br>
      <br>
      The use of chestnut leaves in traditional folk remedies inspired
      the research, led by Cassandra Quave, an ethnobotanist at Emory
      University.<br>
      <br>
      "We've identified a family of compounds from this plant that have
      an interesting medicinal mechanism," Quave says. "Rather than
      killing staph, this botanical extract works by taking away staph's
      weapons, essentially shutting off the ability of the bacteria to
      create toxins that cause tissue damage. In other words, it takes
      the teeth out of the bacteria's bite."<br>
      <br>
      The discovery holds potential for new ways to both treat and
      prevent infections of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, or MRSA,
      without fueling the growing problem of drug-resistant pathogens.<br>
      <br>
      Antibiotic-resistant bacteria annually cause at least two million
      illnesses and 23,000 deaths in the United States, according to the
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. MRSA infections lead
      to everything from mild skin irritations to fatalities. Evolving
      strains of this "super bug" bacterium pose threats to both
      hospital patients with compromised immune systems and young,
      healthy athletes and others who are in close physical contact.<br>
      <br>
      "We've demonstrated in the lab that our extract disarms even the
      hyper-virulent MRSA strains capable of causing serious infections
      in healthy athletes," Quave says. "At the same time, the extract
      doesn't disturb the normal, healthy bacteria on human skin. It's
      all about restoring balance."<br>
      <br>
      Quave, who researches the interactions of people and plants -- a
      specialty known as ethnobotany -- is on the faculty of Emory's
      Center for the Study of Human Health and Emory School of
      Medicine's Department of Dermatology. She became interested in
      ethnobotany as an undergraduate at Emory.<br>
      <br>
      For years, she and her colleagues have researched the traditional
      remedies of rural people in Southern Italy and other parts of the
      Mediterranean. "I felt strongly that people who dismissed
      traditional healing plants as medicine because the plants don't
      kill a pathogen were not asking the right questions," she says.
      "What if these plants play some other role in fighting a disease?"<br>
      <br>
      Hundreds of field interviews guided her to the European chestnut
      tree, Castanea sativa. "Local people and healers repeatedly told
      us how they would make a tea from the leaves of the chestnut tree
      and wash their skin with it to treat skin infections and
      inflammations," Quave says.<br>
      <br>
      For the current study, Quave teamed up with Alexander Horswill, a
      microbiologist at the University of Iowa whose lab focuses on
      creating tools for use in drug discovery, such as glow-in-the-dark
      staph strains.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers steeped chestnut leaves in solvents to extract
      their chemical ingredients. "You separate the complex mixture of
      chemicals found in the extract into smaller batches with fewer
      chemical ingredients, test the results, and keep honing in on the
      ingredients that are the most active," Quave explains. "It's a
      methodical process and takes a lot of hours at the bench. Emory
      undergraduates did much of the work to gain experience in chemical
      separation techniques."<br>
      <br>
      The work produced an extract of 94 chemicals, of which ursene and
      oleanene based compounds are the most active.<br>
      <br>
      Tests showed that this extract inhibits the ability of staph
      bacteria to communicate with one another, a process known as
      quorum sensing. MRSA uses this quorum-sensing signaling system to
      manufacture toxins and ramp up its virulence.<br>
      <br>
      "We were able to trace out the pathways in the lab, showing how
      our botanical extract blocks quorum sensing and turns off toxin
      production entirely," Quave says. "Many pharmaceutical companies
      are working on the development of monoclonal antibodies that
      target just one toxin. This is more exciting because we've shown
      that with this extract, we can turn off an entire cascade
      responsible for producing a variety of different toxins."<br>
      <br>
      A single dose of the extract, at 50 micrograms, cleared up MRSA
      skin lesions in lab mice, stopping tissue damage and red blood
      cell damage. The extract does not lose activity, or become
      resistant, even after two weeks of repeated exposure. And tests on
      human skin cells in a lab dish showed that the botanical extract
      does not harm the skin cells, or the normal skin micro-flora.<br>
      <br>
      The Emory Office of Technology Transfer has filed a patent for the
      discovery of the unique properties of the botanical extract. The
      researchers are doing further testing on individual components of
      the extract to determine if they work best in combination or
      alone.<br>
      <br>
      "We now have a mixture that works," Quave says. "Our goal is to
      further refine it into a simpler compound that would be eligible
      for FDA consideration as a therapeutic agent."<br>
      <br>
      Potential uses include a preventative spray for football pads or
      other athletic equipment; preventative coatings for medical
      devices and products such as tampons that offer favorable
      environments for the growth of MRSA; and as a treatment for MRSA
      infections, perhaps in combination with antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      "It's easy to dismiss traditional remedies as old wives' tales,
      just because they don't attack and kill pathogens," Quave says.
      "But there are many more ways to help cure infections, and we need
      to focus on them in the era of drug-resistant bacteria."<br>

      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Staphylococcus aureus is a highly problematic pathogen. Rates of
      infection in both the community and healthcare setting are on the
      rise, and coupled with its highly antibiotic-resistant nature,
      this makes S. aureus a top public health concern. In fact,
      invasive methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is responsible for
      more deaths in the USA than AIDS. Nevertheless, the number of new
      antibiotic leads in the pipeline is diminishing, and many
      scientists have put out a call for the discovery and development
      of a new class of drugs which could mediate microbial
      pathogenicity rather than growth and survival. The staphylococcal
      quorum-sensing pathway, controlled by the accessory gene regulator
      (agr) system, is a potential target for such anti-pathogenic drug
      discovery efforts, as it serves as a global regulator of
      staphylococcal virulence. Following extensive studies on the
      complementary and alternative medical (CAM) practices of southern
      Italians in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infection, over
      100 plant samples were identified, collected, extracted, and
      examined for their anti-staphylococcal potential. Among the tests
      included was a screen for the inhibition of??-hemolysin, a
      translational protein product of RNAIII, whose production is
      regulated through the agr quorum-sensing pathway. Extract 134,
      which is derived from a popular tree with edible fruits and
      medicinal leaves and bark, was found to exhibit a strong
      dose-dependent inhibition of ?-hemolysin at sub-inhibitory
      concentrations for growth. The dose-dependent quorum-quenching
      effects of Extract 134 were confirmed through the use of
      fluorescent genetic reporters for agr (types I-IV). This activity
      is important based upon previous animal studies with agr knockout
      mutants that show a diminished capacity to initiate and persist in
      a skin infection model. In the proposed study, we seek to improve
      our understanding of the mechanistic basis for Extract 134's
      quorum-quenching effects and evaluate the therapeutic relevance of
      such an anti-virulence therapy using in vivo models. The study
      will address four specific aims: 1) identification and structural
      elucidation of the active constituent(s) (or marker compounds for
      standardization) in Extract 134;2) elucidation of the mechanism of
      action for the quorum-quenching effects observed;3) determination
      of drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic parameters (DM/PK) of the
      bioactive constituent(s);and 4) evaluation of efficacy in treating
      S. aureus skin infection in a murine model.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      The Mediterranean is home to a rich history of medical traditions
      that have developed under the influence of diverse cultures over
      millennia. Today, many such traditions are still alive in the folk
      medical practices of local people. Investigation of botanical folk
      medicines used in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections
      led us to study Castanea sativa (European Chestnut) for its
      potential antibacterial activity. Here, we report the quorum
      sensing inhibitory activity of refined and chemically
      characterized European Chestnut leaf extracts, rich in oleanene
      and ursene derivatives (pentacyclic triterpenes), against all
      Staphylococcus aureus accessory gene regulator (agr) alleles. We
      present layers of evidence of agr blocking activity (IC50 1.56–25
      µg mL-1), as measured in toxin outputs, reporter assays hemolytic
      activity, cytotoxicity studies, and an in vivo abscess model. We
      demonstrate the extract’s lack of cytotoxicity to human
      keratinocytes and murine skin, as well as lack of growth
      inhibitory activity against S. aureus and a panel of skin
      commensals. Lastly, we demonstrate that serial passaging of the
      extract does not result in acquisition of resistance to the quorum
      quenching composition. In conclusion, through disruption of quorum
      sensing in the absence of growth inhibition, this study provides
      insight into the role that non-biocide inhibitors of virulence may
      play in future antibiotic therapies.<br>
      <br>
      A series of studies by Quave et al. [4–6] investigated the
      bioactivity of plant extracts used in the traditional treatment of
      skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) in Italy. Extracts were
      screened for activity against multiple targets, including S.
      aureus biofilms, communication (quorum-sensing) and growth. As a
      result of this work, three potential leads (Castanea sativa,
      Ballota nigra, and Sambucus ebulus) for the inhibition of quorum
      sensing in the absence of growth-inhibitory effects were
      identified [4]. Here, we continue to explore other mechanisms by
      which anti-infective traditional botanical medicines may function,
      and report the discovery of quorum quenching natural products
      extracted from Castanea sativa (European Chestnut) leaves, which
      are used in traditional therapies for treating skin inflammation
      SSTIs in the Mediterranean [7]. Notably, we report the ability of
      C. sativa leaf extracts to attenuate virulence by quenching S.
      aureus agr-mediated quorum sensing, effectively blocking
      production of harmful exotoxins at sub-inhibitory concentrations
      for growth. We also report the lack of cytotoxicity to human skin
      cells, lack of growth inhibitory activity against the normal skin
      microflora, lack of resistance development, and efficacy in a skin
      abscess animal model...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Extraction and purification of QSI-containing fractions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Crude methanol extracts (Extract 224) of the ground leaves were
      created by maceration of the plant materials at room temperature
      using a ratio of 1g dry leaves:10 mL MeOH for two successive
      periods of 72 hours, with daily agitation. Filtered extracts were
      combined, concentrated at reduced pressure and a temperature
      &lt;40°C with rotary evaporators, and lyophilized before being
      re-suspended in water and partitioned in succession with hexane,
      ethyl acetate and butanol (all solvents acquired from Fisher
      Chemical, Certified ACS). The resulting non-aqueous partitions
      were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated in vacuo, and
      lyophilized before testing for activity.<br>
      <br>
      The most active partition (ethyl acetate, extract 224C) was
      subjected to further fractionation using a CombiFlash Rf+
      (Teledyne ISCO) flash chromatography system using a RediSep Rf
      Gold silica column. Extract 224C was bonded to Celite 545 (Acros
      Organics) at a 1:4 ratio and dry-loaded using a RediSep dry load
      cartridge. The mobile phase consisted of (A) hexane, (B) EtOAc,
      and (C) MeOH. The linear gradient begins with 100% A for 6.3
      column volumes (CV), and then increased to 50:50 A:B by25.3 CV,
      and increased to 100% B at 63.3 CV, which was held until 69.6 CV,
      and then to 70:30 B:C at 88.6 CV, which was held until 94.9 CV.
      The chromatography was monitored at 254 and 280 nm, as well as via
      ELSD. The resulting fractions were combined into 5 fractions.
      Following further bioassay testing, it was determined that the
      fraction which eluted from 30–40 CV (224C-F2) was most active. The
      full extract fractionation scheme is presented in Fig 2...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><br>
      <br>
      The ethnobotanical approach to drug discovery [55] was used here
      to identify Castanea sativa leaves as a potential source new
      anti-infective agents. Through design of a bioactivity-guided
      fractionation strategy based on limited growth-impact coupled to
      quorum sensing inhibition, we were successful in creating a highly
      efficacious botanical composition with universal quenching
      activity for all agr alleles. To the best of our knowledge, the
      present work represents the first in-depth investigation of
      European Chestnut leaf extract for its quorum quenching and
      anti-virulence effects since its identification as a potential
      quorum quenching lead [4]. Furthermore, this is the first report
      of the quorum quenching effects of a botanical composition rich in
      ursene and oleanene derivatives (Fig 10) against S. aureus.
      Additional compounds identified in the most active region (at
      &lt;1% relative abundance each) included putative gallotannins,
      which share a tri-galloyl structure with varying core sugars (32,
      33, 34), and a putative ellagitannin (39). It is possible that in
      addition to the pentacyclic triterpenes present in 224C-F2,
      hydrolysable tannins also contribute to the extract’s quorum
      quenching activity.<br>
      <br>
      European Chestnut leaf extracts have been the focus of a number of
      studies centered on evaluation of its activity in scavenging
      reactive oxygen species [42, 56] and cytoprotective effects,
      specifically with regards to protection from UV-damage in skin
      cells [57]. The examination of European Chestnut leaf extracts
      with a patch test revealed that with respect to irritant effects,
      such extracts can be considered as safe for topical applications
      [58]. The integration of C. sativa leaf extracts into cosmetic
      compositions has also been patented, and is based on the
      antibacterial and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging effects
      of the extract [59]. Our safety studies in both human keratocytes
      (HaCaT cells) and murine skin (Fig 6) have reconfirmed that this
      version of European Chestnut leaf extract (224C-F2) can be
      considered safe for topical applications based on its lack of
      cytotoxic and irritant effects.<br>
      <br>
      Several layers of evidence in support of the efficacy of C. sativa
      leaf extracts in blocking S. aureus virulence have been presented.
      Specifically, we have demonstrated that European Chestnut leaf
      extracts are effective in blocking production of the translational
      products of RNAIII, including a number of exotoxins. Overall
      virulence was quenched as demonstrated by the lack of cytotoxic
      effects elicited by supernatants of cultures treated with the
      extract. Importantly, using an in vivo model, we have demonstrated
      efficacy in attenuating dermonecrosis, even in the absence of
      adjuvant antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      This inhibition of virulence and pathogenesis was accomplished
      without posing growth inhibitory pressures on not only S. aureus,
      but also a panel of common members of the human cutaneous
      microbiome. A robust skin microflora is critical to skin barrier
      health and prevention of disease onset. The majority of the
      bacterial cutaneous microbiome is represented by Actinobacteria,
      Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes [60]. Much like cases
      of dysbiosis in gut microflora, broad-spectrum activity against
      the skin microflora also holds the potential for fostering an
      environment amenable to the proliferation of pathogenic bacteria
      [61]. The presence of commensals, like Staphylococcus epidermidis,
      is essential to state of host innate immunity [62]. Thus, it is
      noteworthy that 224C-F2 specifically blocks S. aureus virulence
      without adding selective pressures on major representatives of the
      cutaneous microbiome.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanistic basis for 224C-F2’s quorum quenching activity
      remain unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that components
      within 224C-F2 directly target the core machinery of the agr
      system, such as our observation of agr P3 promoter reduction (Fig
      3) and reduced levels of d-toxin production (Fig 4), which is
      encoded within RNAIII transcript regulated by P3. If 224C-F2 only
      targeted downstream factors regulated by quorum sensing, such as
      a-hemolysin, inhibition of agr P3 or d-toxin production would not
      have been expected. Potential targets within the agr system
      include inhibition of AIP docking with AgrC, prevention of AIP
      production through AgrB, or reduction of AgrA activation (Fig 1).
      Future studies will seek to resolve the mechanism, and this will
      be facilitated by the isolation of individual active components
      for incorporation in structure-activity relationship (SAR)
      studies.<br>
      <br>
      We hypothesized that use of a complex mixture that targets an
      indirect pathway to pathogen success (rather than direct targeting
      for growth and survival) would be unlikely to result the
      generation of resistant mutations. In fact, following 15 days of
      sequential passaging with 224C-F2 in vitro, no resistance was
      detected. This is not surprising; recent findings comparing
      individual natural products to complex botanical compositions in
      other targets, such as multidrug-resistant malaria, have
      demonstrated that single-compound drugs may not be the best
      answer. For example, in the face of growing artemisinin resistance
      for malaria, more chemically complex whole plant therapies
      (Artemisia annua L., Asteraceae) have demonstrated superior
      efficacy to the single compound in preventing drug resistance
      [63]. Indeed, complex botanical compositions that meet the FDA
      standards for safety and efficacy are eligible for an alternative
      regulatory approval pathway as “botanical drugs”, which are
      distinct from dietary supplements, and are standardized to levels
      of marker compounds and regulated like other single compound
      pharmaceuticals once approved [64]. Two examples of successful
      botanical drugs include Veregen (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze,
      Theaceae, sinecatechin topical formulation for anogenital warts)
      and Fulyzaq (Croton lechleri Müll. Arg., Euphorbiaceae,
      procyanidin and prodelphinidin oral formulation for
      HIV/AIDS-related diarrhea).<br>
      <br>
      While it is debatable whether virulence inhibitors will ever serve
      as stand-alone therapeutics, many agree that their application as
      adjuvants to existing lines of antibiotics could be a critical
      tool in this era of rising antibiotic resistance. Specifically, by
      inhibiting agr, such a therapy effectively blocks the production
      of an entire suite of diverse staphylococcal toxins, ranging from
      immune-attacking PSMs, pore-forming hemolysins, and a number of
      other proteases and lipases that damage the host tissue and weaken
      the host immune response. This will be of particular relevance to
      patients faced with toxin-mediated infection, including
      staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (esp. in neonates),
      abscesses, necrotizing fasciitis, sepsis, atopic dermatitis
      (eczema) and more.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a folk-medical treatment
      for skin inflammation and SSTIs that does not demonstrate
      “typical” antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic or bactericidal)
      nevertheless shows great potential for development as a
      therapeutic due to its ability to specifically target and quench
      S. aureus virulence. The results of this study are important not
      only to future antibiotic discovery and development efforts, but
      are also vital to the validation of this previously poorly
      understood traditional medicine as an efficacious therapy, and not
      simply an unsubstantiated relict of folklore. Importantly, this
      composition was non-toxic to human keratinocytes and no
      dermatopathology was noted upon administration to murine skin.
      Moreover, the composition did not inhibit growth of the normal
      skin microflora, suggesting that its disruptive action on the
      cutaneous microbiome would be minimal to nil. Future work will
      focus on evaluation of individual actives within the composition
      with the aim of determining whether a complex mixture, such as
      224C-F2 or a single compound will prove most effective against all
      agr alleles and which will be least likely to develop resistance
      when administered under multiple selective pressures, such as for
      in vivo administration as an antibiotic adjuvant...<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Since the widespread introduction of antibiotics in the
      1940s, the same storyline has repeated itself over and over again:
      new antibiotic is introduced and then resistant variants emerge
      and quickly spread, effectively limiting the utility and lifespan
      of the drug. Staphylococci are frequently the cause of hospital
      infections such as infections from implanted medical devices. Many
      staphylococcal strains have become resistant to many modern day
      antibiotics. Improved therapies are needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] One proposed strategy to overcome the problem of highly
      virulent and resistant variants is to indirectly attack bacteria
      by interfering with their means of communication, also known as
      quorum sensing. Targeting microbial communication makes sense
      because bacteria coordinate many of their virulence and
      pathogenesis pathways through these systems. Quave et al., report

      Collection of Plant Material<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Schinus terebinthifolia Raddi, Anacardiaceae leaves, stems,
      and fruits were collected in bulk from private lands in DeSoto
      County, Fla. in November of 2013 and 2014 after obtaining
      permission from the land owner. Procedures from the 2003 WHO
      Guidelines for good agricultural and collection practices (GACP)
      for medicinal plants were followed for the collection and
      identification of bulk and voucher specimens, specifically
      excluding any populations that may have prior exposure to
      herbicides. Vouchers were deposited at the Emory University
      Herbarium (GEO) (Voucher CQ-400, GEO Accession No. 020063) and
      were identified using the standard Flora for Florida. Plant
      leaves, stems, and fruits were separated and manually cleaned of
      soil and contaminants. Plant material was then dried in a
      desiccating cabinet at low heat. Once dry, plant material was
      sealed in paper bags and stored at room temperature until further
      processing.<br>
      <br>
      Extraction and Separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Crude methanol extracts of fruits were created by blending
      a ratio of 1 g dry material:10 mL MeOH into a slurry in a Waring
      commercial blender for 5 min, and sonicating the material for 20
      minutes. Following decantation of the extract, plant material was
      subjected to two more rounds of sonication followed by filtration.
      Filtered extracts were combined, concentrated at reduced pressure
      with rotary evaporators (&lt;40° C.), and lyophilized. The dried
      extract was resuspended in 1:5 MeOH:H2O at 1 g:31 mL and underwent
      sequential liquid-liquid partitioning three times each with an
      equal volume of hexane, EtOAc, and H2O saturated n-butanol. The
      organic partitions were dried over Na2SO4 and filtered. Each
      partition was concentrated in vacuo at &lt;40° C. The hexane
      partition was dissolved and transferred to a tared scintillation
      vial and dried under forced air to yield 430B. The remaining
      partitions were suspended in dH2O, shell frozen, lyophilized and
      stored at −20° C. The EtOAc partition was labeled 430C, the

      new antibiotic is introduced and then resistant variants emerge
      and quickly spread, effectively limiting the utility and lifespan
      of the drug. From an evolutionary biology perspective, this is not
      surprising; indeed, resistant mutants are expected to arise when
      any lifeform with the ability to rapidly reproduce and mutate is
      faced with a direct selective pressure, especially when a single
      drug is used against a single target. Staphylococci are frequently
      the cause of hospital infections such as infections from implanted
      medical devices. Many Staphylococci strains have become resistant
      to many modern day antibiotics. Improved therapies are needed.<br>

      [0004] One proposed strategy to overcome the problem of resistant
      variants is to indirectly attack bacteria by interfering with

      Chestnut Leaf Extracts Block Staphylococcus aureus Virulence and
      Pathogenesis<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Quorum quenching activity has been discovered in the
      natural products extracted from Castanea sativa leaves. The
      extract is able to attenuate virulence by quenching S. aureus
      agr-mediated quorum sensing, effectively blocking production of
      harmful exotoxins at sub-inhibitory concentrations for growth.
      Experiments indicate a lack of cytotoxicity to human skin cells,
      lack of growth inhibitory activity against the normal skin
      microflora, lack of resistance development, and efficacy in a skin
      abscess animal model.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Staphylococcus aureus is an abundant, opportunistic
      pathogen that is the causative agent of numerous infections. Due
      to its prevalence as a leading cause of healthcare-associated
      infection, and its highly multidrug resistant nature, S. aureus is
      a serious threat. It colonizes the nasal passages of approximately
      30% of the healthy adult population. S. aureus infections initiate
      through trauma to the skin or mucosal layer and then progress
      through an invasive or toxin-mediated process. The prevalence of
      these infections has increased due to higher rates of
      immunosuppressive conditions, greater use of surgical implants,
      and dramatic increases in antibiotic resistance.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] S. aureus produces an extensive array of enzymes,
      hemolysins, and toxins that are important to its ability to spread
      through tissues and cause disease. These virulence factors serve a
      wide scope of purposes in the infection process, including
      disruption of the epithelial barrier, inhibition of opsonization
      by antibody and complement, neutrophil cytolysis, interference
      with neutrophil chemotaxis, and inactivation of antimicrobial
      peptides. The expression of all of these invasive factors is
      controlled by cell-density quorum sensing using the autoinducing
      peptide (AIP) molecule. Like other quorum-sensing signals, AIP
      accumulates outside the cell until it reaches a critical
      concentration and then binds to a surface receptor called AgrC,
      initiating a regulatory cascade. Since AIP controls the expression
      of accessory factors for S. aureus, this regulatory system has
      been named the accessory gene regulator (agr), and the majority of
      the proteins necessary for this quorum-sensing system to function
      are encoded in the agr chromosomal locus. Applying inhibitors to
      quench this communication system to attenuate pathogenicity and
      virulence lies at the core of the quorum quenching approach...<br>

      [0087] In certain embodiments, the extracting process comprises
      the step of mixing the leaf from the plant with a polar solvent,
      such as a liquid comprising methanol, ethanol, ethyl acetate,
      acetonitrile, acetone, methylene chloride or chloroform, under
      conditions such that a mixture of compounds in the leaf dissolves
      in the solvent. In certain embodiments, the process further
      comprises the step of removing the solvent by evaporation from the
      mixture of compounds. In certain embodiments, the process further
      comprises the step of purifying the mixture of compounds by liquid
      chromatography through a solid absorbent, e.g., wherein the solid
      absorbent comprises silica gel or alumina.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] In certain embodiments, the disclosure relates to extracts
      comprising a leaf derived mixture of compounds from a Castanea
      plant wherein the extracting process comprises the steps of:
      mixing a leaf with methanol under conditions such that leaf
      compounds dissolves in the methanol and removing the methanol
      providing a methanol derived mixture of compounds; partitioning
      the methanol derived mixture of compounds in hexane and water
      providing a water derived mixture of compounds; partitioning the
      water derived mixture of compounds by mixing the water with ethyl
      acetate under conditions such that leaf compounds dissolve in the
      ethyl acetate and removing the ethyl acetate providing an ethyl
      acetate derived mixture of compounds; and purifying the ethyl
      acetate derived mixture of compounds by liquid chromatography
      through silica with a mobile phase comprising hexane and ethylene
      acetate; wherein the mobile phase comprises increasing amounts of
      ethyl acetate, and a mobile phase fraction is isolated comprising
      a leaf derived mixture of compounds which does not contain
      chlorogenic acid, ellagic acid, hyperoside, isoquercitrin, or
      rutin...<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Chromatography refers to the separation of a mixture of
      compounds dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which
      carries the compounds through a structure holding another material
      called the stationary phase. The various compounds or components
      of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to
      separate. The separation is based on differential partitioning
      between the mobile and stationary phases. Subtle differences in a
      partition coefficient of each compound result in differential
      retention on the stationary phase and thus changing the
      separation.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In normal-phase chromatography, the stationary phase is
      polar. In reversed phase, the stationary phase is nonpolar.
      Typical stationary phases for normal-phase chromatography are
      silica or organic moieties with cyano and amino functional groups.
      For reversed phase, alkyl hydrocarbons are the preferred
      stationary phase. Examples are solid supports containing a surface
      conjugated with a hydrocarbon chain, e.g., octadecyl (C18), octyl
      (C8), and butyl (C4).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In normal-phase chromatography, the least polar compounds
      elute first and the most polar compounds elute last. The mobile
      phase typically consists of a nonpolar solvent such as hexane or
      heptane mixed with a slightly more polar solvent such as
      isopropanol, ethyl acetate or chloroform. Retention to the
      stationary phase decreases as the amount of polar solvent in the
      mobile phase increases. In reversed phase chromatography, the most
      polar compounds elute first with the most nonpolar compounds
      eluting last. The mobile phase is generally a binary mixture of
      water and a miscible polar organic solvent like methanol,
      acetonitrile or THF.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] In certain embodiments, methods of extraction comprise
      mixing leaves of a Castanea plant with an water miscible carbon
      containing solvent, e.g., such as a protic solvent, an alcohol,
      methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, tetrahydrofuran,
      acetone, acetic acid, 1,4-dioxane or mixture providing a
      concentrate with a mixture of compounds and substantially removing
      the solvent from the concentrate, purifying the solvent derived
      concentrate to less than 5%, 1%, or 0.5% by weight of the solvent
      used in the extraction, e.g., evaporating the protic solvent
      and/or optionally in combination with mixing the concentrate with
      water, sonicating the water, freezing the water to provide ice,
      and removing the ice by sublimation (e.g. in a vacuum of low
      pressure) wherein said purification methods may be repeated in
      combination. In certain embodiments, the method further comprises
      suspending the solvent derived concentrate in water and optionally
      extract impurities in a hydrocarbon solvent such as cyclohexane,
      heptane, hexane, pentane, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane, separating the
      hydrocarbon from the water providing a water layer. In certain
      embodiments, the method further comprises mixing the water layer
      with a solvent that is immiscible in water (polar and/or aprotic),
      e.g., such as ethyl acetate, diethyl ether, methyl tertbutyl
      ether, toluene, methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-di
      chl oroethant, and/or chloroform, and purifying the solvent to
      provide a second solvent derived concentrate. In further
      embodiments, the second derived concentrate is purified one or
      more times by liquid chromatography, e.g., normal phase
      chromatography. Typically the solid absorbent is polar such as
      silica. In certain embodiments, the extract is a portion isolated
      after the column solvent is more than 50% ethyl acetate in
      hexane...<br>

      Extraction and Purification of QSI-containing Fractions<br>
      <br>
      [0181] Crude methanol extracts (Extract 224) of the ground leaves
      were created by maceration of the plant materials at room
      temperature using a ratio of 1 g dry leaves: 10 mL MeOH for two
      successive periods of 72 hours, with daily agitation. Filtered
      extracts were combined, concentrated at reduced pressure and a
      temperature&lt;40° C. with rotary evaporators, and lyophilized
      before being re-suspended in water and partitioned in succession
      with hexane, ethyl acetate and butanol. The resulting non-aqueous
      partitions were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, concentrated in
      vacuo, and lyophilized before testing for activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] The most active partition (ethyl acetate, extract 224C) was
      subjected to further fractionation using a CombiFlash® Rf+
      (Teledyne ISCO) flash chromatography system using a RediSep Rf
      Gold silica column. Extract 224C was bonded to Celite 545 (Acros
      Organics) at a 1:4 ratio and dry-loaded using a RediSep dry load
      cartridge. The mobile phase consisted of (A) hexane, (B) EtOAc,
      and (C) MeOH. The linear gradient begins with 100% A for 6.3
      column volumes (CV), then 50:50 A:B at 25.3 CV, to 100% B at 63.3
      CV, which is held till 69.6 CV, then to 70:30 B:C at 88.6 CV which
      is held till 94.9 CV. The chromatography was monitored at 254 and
      280 nm, as well as via ELSD. The resulting fractions were combined
      into 5 fractions. Following further bioassay testing, it was
      determined that the fraction which eluted from 30-40 CV (224C-F2)
      was most active. The full extract fractionation scheme is

        <b>US2012088671 </b><br>
      </div>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention generally relates to biofilms. In
      particular, it relates to compositions and methods for inhibiting
      biofilm formation and/or reducing the growth of an established
      biofilm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Staphylococcus aureus is arguably the most problematic
      pathogen faced by modern healthcare systems today, owing in large
      part to the persistent emergence of antibiotic resistant strains.
      This is perhaps most evident in the recent appearance of
      methicillin-resistant strains even among isolates causing
      community-acquired infection. Moreover, many of these strains,
      most notably those of the USA300 clonal lineage, have the capacity
      to cause serious, life-threatening infection even in otherwise
      healthy individuals. This accounts in large part for the
      observation that, in the United States alone in 2005, an estimated
      94,360 patients suffered from invasive infection caused by
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with approximately 18,650
      resulting in a fatal outcome.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The continued emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains has
      created an urgent need for new antimicrobial agents. However, many
      S. aureus infections are recalcitrant to antimicrobials even in
      the absence of issues related to acquired resistance. A primary
      contributing factor to this recalcitrance is formation of a
      biofilm on both native tissues and indwelling medical devices.
      This is due to the fact that the biofilm confers a degree of
      intrinsic resistance that often necessitates surgical intervention
      to debride infected tissues and/or remove infected devices. For
      example, one study found that nearly half of patients with
      implanted orthopedic devices admitted to a hospital with S. aureus
      bacteremia had developed an implant-associated infection. Thus,
      while there is an urgent need for new antibiotics, there is an
      equally urgent need to develop therapeutic agents that could be
      used to limit biofilm formation. While such agents would not
      necessarily function as antibiotics in and of themselves, they
      could be used as a prophylactic to limit biofilm formation (e.g.
      coating for implanted devices, surgical lavage, or pre-operative
      oral prophylaxis) or as a therapeutic to be used in conjunction
      with more conventional antibiotics to treat an established
      biofilm-associated infection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] Among the various aspects of the present disclosure is the
      provision of a polyphenolic composition. The polyphenolic
      composition is prepared by a process comprising (a) partitioning
      an alcohol extract of a plant with a mixture of water and hexane
      to form a first water partition and a hexane partition; (b)
      partitioning the first water partition with a mixture of water and
      ethyl acetate to form a second water partition and a ethyl acetate
      partition; (c) partitioning the second water partition with a
      mixture of water and butanol to form a third water partition and a
      butanol partition; and (d) fractionating the butanol partition by
      column chromatography with a mobile phase comprising a mixture of
      methanol and dichloromethane, wherein the polyphenolic composition
      is eluted by the mobile phase in which the volume ratio of
      methanol to dichloromethane is about 40:60.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Another aspect of the disclosure provides a combination
      comprising at least one phenolic phytochemical and at least one
      antimicrobial agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Still another aspect of the disclosure encompasses a method
      for inhibiting formation of a biofilm. The method comprises
      contacting a plurality of free floating microorganisms with the
      polyphenolic composition detailed above or a fraction thereof such
      that formation of the biofilm is inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A further aspect of the disclosure provides a method for
      inhibiting growth of an established biofilm. The method comprises
      contacting the biofilm with at least one phenolic phytochemical
      and at least one antimicrobial agent such that the biofilm has a
      reduced number of microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Other features and iterations of the invention are
      described in more detail below...<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0023] The present invention provides compositions and methods for
      inhibiting the formation and growth of biofilms. In one aspect,
      the disclosure provides a polyphenolic composition comprising
      ellagic acid and ellagic acid derivatives. The phenolic
      composition is derived from a plant extract by a process disclosed
      herein. It has been discovered that the polyphenolic composition
      inhibits biofilm formation and increases susceptibility of an
      established biofilm to antimicrobial agents. Another aspect of the
      disclosure provides a combination comprising at least one phenolic
      phytochemical and at least one antimicrobial agent, wherein the
      combination inhibits the growth of established biofilms.
      Advantageously, the activity of the combination disclosed herein
      is synergistic, i.e., its activity is more than the sum of the
      activity of each individual component. Also provided herein are
      methods for inhibiting the formation of a biofilm, as well as
      methods inhibiting the growth of an established biofilm.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] (I) Polyphenolic Composition<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In one embodiment a polyphenolic composition is provided.
      The polyphenolic composition is prepared by a process comprising
      (a) partitioning an alcohol extract of a plant with a mixture of
      water and hexane to form a first water partition and a hexane
      partition; (b) partitioning the first water partition with a
      mixture of water and ethyl acetate to form a second water
      partition and a ethyl acetate partition; (c) partitioning the
      second water partition with a mixture of water and butanol to form
      a third water partition and a butanol partition; and (d)
      fractionating the butanol partition by column chromatography with
      a mobile phase comprising a mixture of methanol and
      dichloromethane, wherein the polyphenolic composition is eluted by
      the mobile phase in which the volume ratio of methanol to
      dichloromethane is about 40:60.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The method comprises a series of steps such that a fraction
      enriched with a polyphenolic composition may be isolated from an
      alcohol extract of a plant.<br>
      <br>
      (a) Alcohol Extract<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The alcohol extract may be derived from a plant belonging
      to a variety of plant families. Non-limiting examples of suitable
      plant families include Rosaceae, Fagaceae, Salicaceae, Myrtaceae,
      Vitaceae, Ericaceae, Combretaceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Lythraceae,
      Symplocaceae, Hypoxidaceae, Amaranthaceae, Juncaceae,
      Juglandaceae, Sapindaceae, Lamiaceae, Magnoliaceae, Gentianaceae,
      Apocynaceae, Moringaceae, Apiaceae, Rutaceae, Aquafoliaceae,
      Santalaceae, Cornaceae, Asteraceae, Bignoniaceae, and Fabaceae.
      Preferred plant families include Rosaceae, Fagaceae, Salicaceae,
      Myrtaceae, Vitaceae, Ericaceae, Combretaceae, and Juglandaceae. In
      some embodiments, the plant may be Castanea sativa, Quercus
      cerris, Juglans regia, Vitis vinefera, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus
      spinosa, Rosa canina, or Rubus ulmifolius. In some embodiments,
      the plant family may be Rosaceae. In an exemplary embodiment, the
      plant may be Rubus ulmifolius.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A variety of plant parts may be used to arrive at the
      alcohol extract. Suitable plant parts include roots, bulbs,
      tubers, leaves, basal leaves, stems, stem nodes, stem internodes,
      galls, stalks, woody parts, flowers, inflorescences, fruits,
      infructescences, seeds, and combinations thereof. The plant part
      may be fresh, dried, frozen, or lyophilized. The plant part may be
      ground or pulverized into a plant material using a homogenizer, a
      blender, a mortar and pestle, a sonicator, or a similar apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The plant extract typically is prepared by contacting the
      plant material with an alcohol solvent for an appropriate period
      of time. Non-limiting examples of suitable alcohol solvents
      include methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, or combinations
      thereof. In preferred embodiments, the solvent may be ethanol such
      that the alcohol extract is an ethanol extract. The concentration
      of alcohol that is contacted with the plant material may range
      from about 1% to about 100%. In embodiments in which ethanol is
      the solvent, the concentration of ethanol may range from about 1%
      to about 20%, from about 20% to about 40%, from about 40% to about
      60%, from about 60% to about 80%, or from about 80% to about 100%.
      In an exemplary embodiment, the concentration of ethanol may be
      about 95%.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The period of time the plant material is contacted with the
      alcohol solvent may range from about 1 hour to about 5 days. In
      various embodiments, the plant material may be contacted with the
      alcohol solvent for about 1-24 hours, for about 24-48 hrs, for
      about 48-72 hours, for about 72-96 hours, or for about 96-120
      hours. In an exemplary embodiment, the period of time the plant
      material is contacted with the alcohol solvent may be about 72
      hours: Upon removal of the extract from the plant material, the
      plant material may be extracted one or more additional times with
      fresh alcohol solvent, essentially as detailed above.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The alcohol solvent may be removed from the plant alcohol
      extract to form a dry plant alcohol extract. Those of skill in the
      art are familiar with suitable techniques to remove the alcohol
      solvent including, without limit, evaporation, distillation, and
      lyophillization.<br>
      <br>
      (b) Liquid Extractions<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The process for preparing a fraction rich in the
      polyphenolic compounds comprises subjecting the plant alcohol
      extract to a series of liquid extractions such that the
      polyphenolic compounds are partitioned into one of the phases and
      the other compounds are partitioned into the other phase. In
      general, the series of liquid extractions comprises contacting the
      plant alcohol extract (or partition thereof) with a solvent
      system, wherein the polarity of one or more of the solvents
      changes during each successive series of extractions. Those of
      skill in the art are familiar with liquid extraction protocols and
      suitable solvent systems. Generally, the liquids are mixed by
      gentle inversion at room temperature. After separation of the
      phases, the phase containing the polyphenolic compounds thereof
      may be extracted one or more times with the solvents of interest.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] For example, the first step of the process may comprise a
      liquid extraction during which the plant alcohol extract is
      partitioned in a mixture of water and an alkane to form a first
      water partition and an alkane partition. Typically, the
      polyphenolic compounds are partitioned into the water phase upon
      extraction with a mixture of water and alkane. The alkane
      typically will comprise from five to ten carbons, and may be
      linear or branched. Suitable alkanes include, without limit,
      pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, and combinations thereof. An
      exemplary alkane is hexane.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In the next step of the process, for example, the first
      water partition may be extracted in a mixture of water and a
      non-polar solvent to form a second water partition and a non-polar
      solvent partition. Generally, the polyphenolic compounds are
      partitioned into the water phase upon extraction with a mixture of
      water and non-polar solvent. In various embodiments, the non-polar
      solvent may be ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, chloroform, diethyl
      ether, or combinations thereof. An exemplary non-polar solvent is
      ethyl acetate.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The next and final extraction step, for example, may
      comprise extracting the second water partition with a mixture of
      water and an alcohol to form a third water partition and an
      alcohol partition. Typically, the polyphenolic compounds are
      partitioned into the alcohol phase upon extraction with a mixture
      of water and alcohol. The alcohol may comprise from one to ten
      carbons, and may be linear or branched. Non-limiting examples of
      suitable alcohols include methanol, ethanol, propanol,
      isopropanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, and heptanol. An
      exemplary alcohol is butanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In a preferred embodiment, the first liquid-liquid
      extraction comprises water and hexane, the second liquid-liquid
      extraction comprises water and etliyl acetate, and the third
      liquid-liquid extraction comprises water and butanol.<br>
      <br>
      (c) Column Chromatography<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The method may further comprise fractionating the
      polyphenolic-rich fraction by column chromatography. Typically,
      the column will comprise an inorganic stationary phase.
      Non-limiting examples of suitable inorganic stationary phase
      materials include silica-based materials, silica gel, magnetic
      silica particles, glass powder, diatomaceous earth, zeolites,
      aluminium oxides, silicon oxides, titanium oxides, zirconium
      oxides, and hydroxyapatite. In an exemplary embodiment, the column
      chromatography comprises a silica gel stationary phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The mobile phase may comprise a mixture of methanol and
      dichloromethane. Those of skill in the art will appreciate that
      other mobile phases may be used to separate the polyphenolic
      composition from the other compounds. In embodiments in which the
      mobile phase comprises methanol and dichloromethane, the
      concentration of dichloromethane in the mobile phase typically
      decreases during the fractionation while the concentration of
      methanol in the mobile phase increases during the fractionation.
      The phenolic-rich fraction generally elutes from the column with a
      volume ratio of methanol to dichloromethane from about 30:70 to
      about 70:30. For example, the volume ratio of methanol to
      dichloromethane that elutes a phenolic-rich fraction may range
      from about 30:70, 32.5:67.5. 35:65, 37.5:62.5, 40:60, 42.5:57.5,
      45:55, 47.5:52.5, 50:50, 52.5:47.5, 55:45, 57.5:42.5, 60:40,
      62.5:37.5, 65:35, 67.5:32.5, or 70:30. In preferred embodiments,
      the polyphenolic-rich fraction may elute from the column at a
      volume ratio of methanol to dichloromethane of about 40:60, 50:50,
      or 60:40. In an exemplary embodiment, the polyphenolic-rich
      fraction may elute from the column at a volume ratio of methanol
      to dichloromethane of about 40:60. The polyphenolic-rich fraction
      may be dried by removing the mobile phase solvents using standard
      procedures...<br>
