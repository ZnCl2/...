            Reincarnation Is Real</b></big><br>

      <br>
      Men and women are being brought back from the dead by the
      mysterious extract from a tree of life that grows only in the most
      remote regions of the Amazon.<br>
      <br>
      And amazing stories they tell prove conclusively that there is
      life after death.<br>
      <br>
      Staggering reports of the miraculous recoveries of men, women and
      children and their accounts of reincarnation have been documented
      by excited research scientists who've carried out extensive tests
      throughout South America.<br>
      <br>
      Now they say they're almost at the stage where they'll be able to
      make the tree extract available to all mankind.<br>
      <br>
      "The potential application of the compound is mind-boggling", says
      forensic biochemist Dr Howard Wynn-Hughes.<br>
      <br>
      "It could add a whole new dimension to the way we live our lives."<br>
      <br>
      Wynn-Hughes and his colleagues were astounded at the first-hand
      stories they heard after hacking their way through dense brush to
      a remote clinic in Paraguay.<br>
      <br>
      One man who'd been brought back from the dead said the extract
      helped him to recall that, in an earlier existence, he'd been a
      conquistador from Spain, a captain named Don Aldro Valdez.<br>
      <br>
      Later, Wynn-Hughes checked his story with ancient documents, and
      discovered that the soldier had, indeed, taken part in several
      campaigns in South America.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Torture</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Don Aldro Valdez was involved in terrible bloodshed.<br>
      <br>
      "Thousands of Indians were tortured and slain", said the man
      brought back to life from the dead with the extract from the tree
      of life.<br>
      <br>
      "All we were concerned about was the pursuit of gold. We rampaged
      throughout the land, slaughtering and stealing and amassing a
      tremendous hoard of treasure.<br>
      <br>
      "But life was hard. Many of my men died from disease and from
      surprise attacks by the Indians.<br>
      <br>
      "Eventually, I suffered a mortal wound myself in a battle to
      overthrow a local chieftain.<br>
      <br>
      "I clearly recall a spear being thrust through my chest, the sharp
      stab of pain. Then nothing. I had no recollection of these events
      until my recent death", the man recalled.<br>
      <br>
      "Then I was treated with the extract from the tree of life, and
      they all came flooding back."<br>
      <br>
      Wynn-Hughes heard from a woman how, in an earlier life, she'd
      lived in his native Wales.<br>
      <br>
      Enlisting the aid of relatives, he discovered that a woman by the
      name he'd been given had lived in the mining village of Aberfain
      at one time.<br>
      <br>
      "All the men in my family were colliers", the woman recalled.
      "Times were hard. Their pay terrible. But somehow we managed to
      survive.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Humble</b><br>
      <br>
      "Clearly now, I can recollect the humble cottage where we lived,
      the grime-covered streets and the towering pit heads.<br>
      <br>
      "It just seemed to hit me after I was given the tree extract."<br>
      <br>
      The extract is obtained from a tree with the colloquial name of
      Black Man's Head.<br>
      <br>
      It's long been recognized as a snake-venom antidote and has often
      been used by natives to resurrect animals that have suffered
      attacks from poisonous snakes.<br>
      <br>
      It's only recently, however, that successful experiments have been
      carried out on humans, the first in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janiero,
      Brazil.<br>
      <br>
      U.S. and Japanese chemists have been able to synthesize the
      plant's active ingredients, but they still don't know the identity
      of the natural source.<br>
      <br>
      "At least a dozen plants share the name of Black Man's Head, or
      Cabeza de Negro, explains Koji Nakanishi of Columbia University.<br>
      <br>
      "Unfortunately, the woman who supplied us with the extract
      wouldn't tell us which one it came from."<br>
      <br>
      Nakanishi's team was able to isolate and describe the structure of
      the antidote molecule.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Tests</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Then other scientists tested it on mice and dogs that had been
      given two to three times the lethal dose of venom from a snake
      known as the fer-de-lance.<br>
      <br>
      The fer-de-lance is found throughout the tropics, and its bite
      usually is fatal to humans.<br>
      <br>
      The research scientists found that the antidote successfully
      restores heartbeat, blood pressure and respiration to normal
      within approximately two hours.<br>
      <br>
      Nakanishi believes that the antidote may be effective against
      venom from many other snake species as well.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists were given a clue to its incredible properties when
      animals were seen to seek out the tree after they'd been bitten by
      a snake.<br>
      <br>
      It's thought that just rubbing against the plant might reward some
      animals with total immunity against snake bites<br>
      <br>
      Astounding human experiments show that not only is the extract
      extremely potent in its use against snake bites, it also has the
      fantastic power to halt and reverse a number of degenerative
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      It also enabled those who took part in the experiments to recall
      experiences they didn't even realize they had experienced.<br>
      <br>
      "Incredible as it may sound, it's been found to act even after men
      and women have been pronounced clinically dead", says Wynn-Hughes.<br>
      <br>
      "It's uncertain at this stage in time whether it'll work on every
      person who's died. But it's certain that the extract can restore
      life in a number of cases.<br>
      <br>
      "It would appear that it's likely to prove most effective in
      bringing back to life children and adolescents who haven't been
      subjected to long-term diseases or who've died in accidents."<br>
      <br>
      Now, scientists can synthesize the amazing compound. They'll soon
      start manufacturing batches in laboratories throughout the world.<br>
      <br>
      But Dr Alfred Spiegel, an associate of Wynn-Hughes, cautions: "It
      may well be some years before the compound can be made generally
      available.<br>
      <br>
      "In the United States, Britain, Japan and other Western nations,
      it'll hve to be subjected to extensive testing before it can be
      made available to doctors and hospitals.<br>
      <br>
      "South American physicians have reported success in dozens of
      cases. And now attempts will be made to replicate their fantastic
      results in America and England.<br>
      <br>
      "The discovery of the compound is probably the most exciting
      breakthrough in medicine since the discovery of penicillin."<br>

          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to products of manufacture which are
          substantially pure crystalline pterocarpan compounds which
          have been isolated from the crude extracts of natural products
          and to methods for isolating the compounds.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><br>
          <br>
          It has been known that the aqeuous alcoholic extract of the
          root of the South American cabeca de negra tree has been
          available to plantation workers in the upper Amazon jungle as
          an oral antidote against snake and spider venoms. About ten
          varieties of the species cabeca de negra are known in South
          America. Neither the nature of the active components nor
          studies on the side effects, pharmacological activity,
          stability and the like are known to have been published on the
          compounds of the invention. Pterocarpans possessing
          antimicrobial properties have been identified in the
          literature, see Heterocycles, Vol. 15, 1163 (1981).<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTI</b><b>ON</b><br>
          <br>
          The invention includes the following products of manufacture
          which have been isolated in substantially pure crystalline
          form: ##STR2## For convenience, the compounds of the above
          structure will be referred to hereinafter as cabenegrin I and
          cabenegrin II, or as compounds (I) and (II), respectively. The
          invention also includes the step-wise method employed to
          recover and isolate the essentially pure crystalline products
          referred to as cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II.<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us1.jpg" height="481"
              width="419"><br>
            <br>
          </div>
          The compounds cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II have
          pharmaceutical utility in the treatment of mammals, including
          man, that have been envenomated by poisonous snakes and
          insects. That is, these compounds act as potent antidotes
          against effects of snake and insect toxins. The compounds (I)
          and (II) are also useful in treating the effects of other
          known organic toxins such as E. coli endotoxin and that
          produced by Clostridium botulinum, commonly referred to as
          botulism or food poisoning. The details of tests establishing
          the utility of compounds I and II are described in a
          co-pending application filed concurrently herewith in the name
          of Lazslo Darko under U.S. Ser. No. 358,191, and the entire
          disclosure of that application is incorporated herein by
          reference. Pharmaceutical utility is generally indicated for
          the treatment of the effects in mammals of toxins produced by
          pathogenic bacteria (endotoxins and exotoxins) which attack
          the nervous system of the victim and particularly where
          paralysis of the respiratory system is manifested. Treatment
          against the effects of cardio-vascular toxins is also
          indicated.<br>
          <br>
          The compounds can be administered orally in liquid form as a
          suspension or solubilized in a compatible pharmaceutical
          carrier. The pure crystalline material can be administered
          orally in capsule or tablet form when compounded with suitable
          pharmaceutical carriers. Alternatively, either of the
          compounds cabenegrin I or II can be dissolved in a suitable
          liquid pharmaceutical carrier and the solution administered
          intravenously by syringe, or by catheter where monitoring
          equipment is available to determine the effects of the
          therapy. If desired compounds (I) and (II) can be mixed
          together in various proportions, and the mixture prepared as
          described above with suitable pharmaceutical carriers.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
          </b><br>
          Approximately 1/2 kilo of the washed root of the cabeca de
          negra tree is chopped into small pieces which may then be
          mascerated, pulverized or otherwise treated to break down the
          fibrous structure. This step can be accomplished in a blender
          or laboratory homogenizer. Roots evidencing mold or fungus
          should not be used. The pulverized root is placed in a large
          glass beaker or other suitable vessel which may be covered and
          subsequently stirred. A sufficient quantity of ethanol:water
          77:23 is added to cover the pulverized root and briskly
          stirred for a few minutes. The vessel containing the aqueous
          ethanol and root is allowed to stand at ambient temperatures
          for at least 48 hours, with occasional stirring. At the end of
          this period, the aqueous alcoholic solution comprising the
          crude extract is separated from the root by any convenient
          means, for example, by pouring through medium filter paper.
          The pulverized root is discarded. The filtered solution is the
          color of strong tea.<br>
          <br>
          The following procedure was employed to isolate the active
          compounds from the crude extract as prepared above.<br>
          <br>
          The aqueous ethanol crude extract (135 ml) was concentrated by
          gentle warming under vacuum to obtain 1.2 grams of a brown
          oily residue. This concentrated material was treated with 50%
          aqueous methanol and the solution was extracted by vigorous
          shaking with hexane. The hexane layer was separated and
          discarded. The water layer was extracted with ether by
          vigorous shaking. The ether layer and the water layer were
          separated, the ether layer (640 milligrams) being set aside.
          The water layer was extracted with n-butyl alcohol by vigorous
          shaking. The n-butyl alcohol layer was separated and set
          aside, and the water layer was discarded.<br>
          <br>
          The ether layer extracted above is subjected to high pressure
          liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Sephadex LH-20 as a first step
          and as the next step on silica gel using aqueous methanol as
          the eluting solvent. This procedure results in two fractions,
          and the first is further separated by HPLC employing
          Partisil-10 eluted with 3% methanol in methylene chloride to
          yield pure solid compounds.<br>
          <br>
          The compound identified as cabenegrin I is recovered as a
          white crystalline material in a yield of 44 mg. A sharp
          melting point of 167 DEG-168 DEG C. is obtained and analysis
          shows the composition to be C21 H20 O6. The Rf value of
          compound I on thin layer chromatography employing silica gel
          CO/Kiesel guhr F-254 and benzene/ethyl acetate/methanol
          (15/4/1) was 0.53.<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us2.jpg" height="735"
              width="819"><br>
          </div>
          <br>
          The U.V., C.D., and I.R. of compound I are as follows:<br>
          <br>
          UV (in MeOH): 209 nm (E 75,000), 233 nm (shoulder, E 24,000),
          309 nm (E 13,000)<br>
          <br>
          CD (in MeOH): 213 nm (E -25.58), 220 nm (.DELTA.E -2.00), 238
          nm (.DELTA.E -9.84); 302 (.DELTA.E +3.15)<br>
          <br>
          IR (in CHCl3): 3550 cm@-1, 1600 cm@-1, 1113 cm@-1, 925 cm@-1.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to these spectral data, the following @1 H-NMR,
          @13 C-NMR, and MS (E1) data were measured; these spectroscopic
          measurements led to the depicted structure.<br>
          <br>
          PMR, CMR and MS of Compound (I): ##STR3##<br>
          <br>
          The second sample of material recovered from the HPLC
          described above comprised an oily mixture of approximately 10
          mg. This second active fraction, which had been obtained from
          the HPLC of the ether layer described above, is treated as
          follows to obtain the compound cabenegrin II. The mixture was
          subjected to further HPLC employing .mu.-Bondapak C18 and
          methanol/acetonitrile/H2 O/n-PrOH (71/71/59/2). Compound (II)
          was obtained in essentially pure crystalline form in a yield
          of about 1 mg. The structure of this compound is based on the
          following physical constants: ##STR4##<br>
          <br>
          <div align="center"><img alt="" src="us3.jpg" height="418"

            <br>
          </div>
          The structure of compound (II) is shown by NMR data to be a
          3:1 mixture of epimers at C-3'. The structures of both
          compounds cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II have been confirmed
          by synthesis of their respective racemates.<br>

          The invention relates to physiologically active
          pterocarpan-compounds and methods for the isolation thereof.
          These compounds have the formula I &lt;CHEM&gt; wherein
          R&lt;1&gt; represents a hydrogen atom and R&lt;2&gt;
          represents a -CH2CH2-CH(CH3)-CH2OH group, or R&lt;1&gt;

          atom, together with all optical isomers and racemic mixtures
          thereof. These compounds are effective against the toxic
          venoms of poisonous snakes, spiders and other insects, and
          against E. coli endotoxins. The invention further relates to
          therapeutically active compositions containing the above
          pterocarpan compounds.<br>

          [0001] This invention relates to physiologically active
          pterocarpan-compounds, methods for the isolation thereof and
          therapeutically active compositions containing them. More
          particularly it relates to products of manufacture which are
          substantially pure crystalline pterocarpan compounds which
          have been isolated from the crude extracts of natural products
          and to methods for isolation of the compounds.<br>
          <br>
          [0002] It is known that the aqueous alcoholic extract of the
          root of the South American cabeca de negra tree has been
          available to plantation workers in the upper Amazon jungle as
          an oral antidote against snake and spider venoms. About ten
          varieties of the species cabeca de negra are known in South
          America. Neither the nature of the active components nor
          studies of the side effects, pharmacological activity,
          stability and the like are known to have been published on the
          compounds of the invention. Pterocarpans possessing
          antimicrobial properties have been identified in the
          literature, see Heterocycles, Vol. 15, 1163 [1981].<br>
          <br>
          [0003] In one aspect, the invention relates to pterocarpan
          compounds having the formula (I)<br>

          optical isomers and racemic mixtures thereof.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] We have been able to isolate such compounds in
          substantially pure crystalline form. For convenience, the
          compounds of the above structure will be referred to
          hereinafter as cabenegrin I
          [3-hydroxy-4-(3-hydroxymethyl-butene-2)-8,9-methylenedioxy-pterocarpan]
          and cabenegrin II
          [2-(3-hydroxymethyl-butyl)-3-hydroxy-8,9-methylenedioxy-pterocarpan],
          respectively. The invention also relates to a step-wise method
          employed to recover and isolate the essentially pure - 95-100%
          - crystalline products referred to as cabenegrin I and
          cabenegrin II.<br>
          <br>
          [0005] The compounds cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II have
          pharmaceutical utility in the treatment of mammals, including
          man, that have been envenomated by poisonous snakes and
          insects. These compounds have been found to acts as potent
          antidotes against effects of snake and insect toxins. The
          compounds of the invention are also useful in treating the
          effects of other known organic toxins such as E. coli
          endotoxin and that produced by Clostridium botulinum, commonly
          referred to as botulism on food poisoning. Pharmaceutical
          utility is generally indicated for the treatment of the
          effects in mammals of toxins produced by pathogenic bacteria
          (endotoxins and exotoxins) which attack the nervous system of
          the victim and in particular where paralysis of the
          respiratory system is manifested. Treatment against the
          effects of cardio-vascular toxins is also indicated.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The compounds can be administered orally e.g. in liquid
          form as a suspension or solubilized in a compatible
          pharmaceutical carrier. Pure crystalline material can be
          administered orally in capsule or tablet form when compounded
          with suitable pharmaceutical carriers. Alternatively, either
          of the compounds cabenegrin I or II can be dissolved in a
          suitable liquid pharmaceutical carrier and the solution
          administered intravenously by syringe, or by catheter where
          monitoring equipment is available to determine the effects of
          the therapy. If desired, the compounds of the invention can be
          mixed together in various proportions, and the mixture
          prepared as described above with suitable pharmaceutical
          carriers.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] A crude extract from which the compounds of the
          invention may be obtained may be prepared as follows:<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Approximately 2 kilo of the washed root of the cabeca
          de negra tree is chopped into small pieces which may be
          macerated, pulverized or otherwise treated to break down the
          fibrous structure. This step can be accomplished in a blender
          or laboratory homogenizer. Roots evidencing mold or fungus
          should not be used. The pulverized root is placed in a large
          glass beaker or other suitable vessel which may be covered and
          subsequently stirred. A sufficient quantity of the mixture of
          water and aliphatic alcohol having 1-4 carbon atoms,
          preferably ethanol:water 77:23 is added to cover the
          pulverized root and briskly stirred for a few minutes. The
          vessel containing the aqueous ethanol and root is allowed to
          stand at ambient temperatures for at least 48 hours, with
          occasional stirring.' At the end of this period, the aqueous
          alcoholic solution comprising the crude extract is separated
          from the root by any convenient means, for example, by pouring
          through medium filter paper. The pulverized root is discarded.
          The filtered solution is the color of strong tea.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The following procedure may then be employed to isolate
          the active compounds from the crude extract as prepared above.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] The aqueous ethanol crude extract (135 ml) was
          concentrated by gently warming under vacuum to obtain 1.2
          grams of a brown oily residue. This concentrated material was
          treated with 50% aqueous methanol and the solution was
          extracted by vigorous shaking with an aliphatic hydrocarbon
          having 5-8 carbon atoms, preferably with hexane. The hexane
          layer was separated and discarded. The water layer was
          extracted with ether by vigorous shaking..The ether layer and
          the water layer was separated, the ether layer (640
          milligrams) being set aside. The water layer was extracted
          with n-butyl alcohol by vigorous shaking. The n-butyl alcohol
          layer was separated and set aside for. a possible
          investigation, and the water layer was discarded.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] The ether layer extracted above is separated using
          well-known chromatographic methods. Preferably, the ether
          layer extracted above is subjected in a first step to high
          pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on Sephadex LH-20 and as
          a second step on silica gel using aqueous methanol as the
          eluting solvent. This procedure results in two fractions and
          the first is further separated by HPLC employing Partisil-10
          eluted with 3% methanol in methylene chloride to yield pure
          solid compounds.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] The compound identified as cabenegrin I is recovered as
          a white crystalline material in a yield of 44 mg. A sharp
          melting point of 167-168[deg.]C is obtained and analysis shows
          the composition to be C21H20O6. The &lt;Rf&gt; value of this
          compound on thin layer chromatography employing silica gel
          CO/Kieselguhr F-254 and benzene/ethyl acetate/methanol
          (15/4/1) was 0.53.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] The U.V., C.D., and I.R. of compound I are as follows:<br>
          <br>

          &lt;1&gt;H-NMR, &lt;13&gt;C-NMR, and MS (El) data were
          measured concerning cabenegrin I:<br>

          [0016] The second sample of material recovered from the HPLC
          described above comprised an oily mixture of approximately 10
          mg. This second active fration, which had been obtained from
          the HPLC of the ether layer described above, is treated as
          follows to obtain the compound cabenegrin II. The mixture was
          subjected to further HPLC employing /u-Bondapack C18 and
          methanol/ acetonitrile/H2O/n-PrOH(71/71/59/2). The compound
          (II) was obtained in essentially pure - 95-100% - crystalline
          form in a yield of about 1 mg. The structure of this compound
          is based on the following physical constants, and analysis
          (MS) shows the composition to be C21H22O6'<br>

          <br>
          [0020] The structure of this compound is shown by NMR data to
          be a 3:1 mixture of epimers at C-3' and the invention includes
          the individual optical isomers together with racemic mixtures
          within its scope. The structures of both compounds cabenegrin
          I and cabenegrin II have been confirmed by synthesis of their
          respective racemates.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] The new compounds produced by the method of the
          invention are suitable for making therapeutically active
          compositions, which are antidotes for treating the effects of
          poisonous snake and insect bites in mammals, including man.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] They are also suitable for the treatment of pathogenic
          bacterial toxins such as E. coli endotoxins, botulism and
          others which exhibit central nervous system effects and
          related respiratory paralysis, and to the treatment of the
          effects of cardiovascular toxins on mammals.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] As for the new compounds obtained by the above
          extraction methods, the presence of physiologically active
          compounds was determined by in vivo tests employing mice. Test
          animals were Swiss Webster white mice, mixed sexes, weighing
          from 25-30 grams. Each group of test animals was envenomated
          with two and one-half times the lethal dose of snake venom
          from the Fer de Lance (Bothrops atrox) by intraperitoneal
          injection. In the absence of treatment, envenomated animals
          succumbed within a few minutes.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] Concentrates of compounds of the invention obtained
          from each of the fractions of the above extraction scheme were
          tested for antidotal activity by injecting the mice
          immediately after envenomation with an aqueous ethanol
          solution (77.23) of the material isolated from each fractions.
          Each animal was treated with 0.25 ml of the respective
          solutions. On the basis of this protocol, the minimum dosage
          for survival against the Fer de Lance venom was 2.8 mg/kg of
          cabenegrin I and 2.0 mg/kg of cabenegrin II.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] Toxicological studies indicate that administration of
          aqueous ethanolic solutions of cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II
          to healthy test animals produce no significant changes in
          vital physiological functions. Administration can be by
          intravenous or intramuscular injection, or orally via a
          stomach tube. No significant change is noted in arterial blood
          pressure, heart rate, respiration, EKG or central venous
          pressure at any time following administration of compounds I
          and II to normal healthy (i.e. non-envenomated) animals.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Administration does not significantly alter resting
          action potentials, end plate potentials, nerve impulse
          transmission, neuro-muscular function or brain wave activity
          in experimental animals.<br>
          <br>
          <b>1. Antidotal effects against snake venom in dogs.</b><br>
          <br>
          [0027] Envenomation by-a lethal dose of snake venom, such as
          Bothrops atrox, Crotalus adamamteuns, or Crotalus atrox,
          produces a precipitous fall in arterial blood pressure, a
          decrease of heart rate and en elevation in central venous
          pressure. This is followed by partial recovery of these
          parameters and then by a complete respiratory and
          cardiovascular collapse. Death appears to be due to a
          combination of peripheral vascular collapse and to an
          interruption in the normal respiratory mechanism. In addition,
          there appears to be some action of these venoms on the central
          nervous system of the experimental animals. This CNS effect is
          exhibited by a decrease in both the alpha and the beta rhythm
          of the brain (EEG). This change is also associated with a
          decrease in impulse transmission over the motor verves and
          progressive blockage of the neuromuscular apparatus which is
          similar to that produced by curare. Venoms had no effect on
          muscle response to direct stimulation.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] A series of seven adult beagle dogs are used to study
          the effectiveness of cabenegrin I and II against the venoms.
          The dogs are anaesthetized with Na pentobarbital (30 mg/kg)
          and monitored for changes in arterial blood pressure, heart
          rate, electrocardiogram and respiration. Lethal doses (five to
          ten times of LD50) of lyophilized reconstituted Bothrops atrox
          (Fer de Lance) (2.5 mg - 5.0 mg/kg) or (10 mg/kg) South
          American rattle snake venom are administered.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] Within 15 minutes following envenomation, marked
          decreases in heart rate and blood pressure are consistently
          noted. At from 15 to 30 minutes, respiration likewise
          descreases from an average of 20 per minute to 5 per minute.
          Treatment is initiated when severe cardio- vascular
          embarrassment and apparent respiratory difficulties are
          observed, usually at from 15-30 minutes following
          envenomations.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] A solution of cabenegrin I is prepared by dissolving 33
          mg of the crystalline material of compound in 100 ml of
          aqueous ethanol (25:75). Similarly, a solution of 24 mg of
          cabenegrin II in 100 ml of aqueous ethanol (15:75) is
          prepared. Doses are prepared for administration by stirring 5
          ml of each of the respectve alcoholic solutions of the
          compounds of the invention into 50 ml of water.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] Administration of the respective solutions is through a
          tube placed and advanced into the stomach of the dog.
          Treatment is as follows: No immediate response is noted
          following therapy. Blood pressure, heart rate and respiration
          all remain extremely low. At approximately 30 minutes
          following the first dose of the respective alcoholic solution
          of the compound of the invention, a slow gradual improvement
          of breathing occurs followed by partial restoration of heart
          rate and blood pressure. Continuous therapy is provided at 30
          minute intervals in 50 ml water until all monitored vital
          signs return to within 10% of control. The effective dose
          range is between 10 to 20 ml of antivenom extract per animal.
          From two to four doses are required. After observation for
          8-10 hours the animals are placed in a holding cage with food
          and water. At 24 hours, all 7 dogs show signs of depressed
          activity. At 72 hours, all dogs are taking food and water. No
          additional therapy is required.<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. Activity of cabenegrin I and II against E. coli
            endotoxin</b><br>
          <br>
          [0032] Three adult beagle dogs are used to demonstrate the
          effectiveness of the cabenegrin I and II in treating shock
          caused by E. coli endotoxin. The dogs are anaesthetized with
          Na pentobarbital (30 mg/kg) and monitored for changes in
          arterial blood pressure, heart rate, EKG and respiration.
          Lethal doses (1 mg/kg) of E. coli endotoxin are injected i.v.
          into a catheter placed in the vein of the hind limb of the
          dogs. In the first experiment no antidotal therapy was
          initiated and the animal expired 2 hours after injection. In
          the three additional cases antidotal therapy is initiated at
          the time when severe cardiovascular collapse and respiratory
          difficulties appear. These usually occur within about 112
          hours after the injection of the toxin.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] Solutions of cabenegrin I and II, prepared as described
          above, are administered by stomach tube in a single dose of 10
          ml in 100 ml of water to each of the dogs. The animals so
          treated survive and resume normal activity.<br>
          <br>
          <b>3. Isolated heart (Langendorff) preparation</b><br>
          <br>
          [0034] A series of 2 dog heart preparations are tested to
          measure the antivenom effect on coronary blood flow, heart
          rate, EKG, force of ventricular contraction and coronary
          vascular resistance when cabenegrin I and II are given either
          before or after lethal venom challenge. It is observed that
          treatment appears capable of overcoming the toxic effects of
          the venom on cardiovascular functions. These effects are a
          decrease of the force of contraction and heart rate. Coronary
          vascular resistance also increases progressively following the
          administration of venom. When solutions containing 0.05 mg/ml
          of either of the compounds of the invention are injected
          directly into the circulation prior to tropical rattle snake
          venom challenge, no detrimental effect on the heart is
          observed. Rather, the force of contraction and coronary blood
          flow increases by about 15 to 20%.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] When either of the compounds is given following. lethal
          challenge of tropical rattle snake venom, the antidote
          restores force of contraction and heart rate to normal levels
          and reverses the minor arrhythmias caused by envenomation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>4. Neurophysiological function</b><br>
          <br>
          [0036] Three dogs and one cat are tested for the antidotal
          effect on neuromuscular function, action potential and brain
          wave activity following envenomation with lethal doses of Fer
          de Lance venom.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] Snake venom decreases both brain wave activity and
          nerve impulse transmission. These are restored to nearly, if
          not completely, normal levels by the administration of
          cabenegrin I and II. Action potentials and neuromuscular
          function remain depressed for approximately 30 to 60 minutes
          after treatment with each of the compounds. This is followed
          by a slow, gradual return to control levels after from 12 to
          24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] In certain experiments in which complete neuro-
          muscular blockage occurs and the animals are no longer capable
          of spontaneous respiration, artificial ventilation is required
          until the action of the compound has manifested itself. This
          may occur after envenomation, but once stabilized, the animals
          are capable of spontaneous breathing and no further therapy is
          required.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] Cortical electrical activity is markedly (25-30%)
          depressed by the venom. These changes are restored to normal
          by the administration of the compounds cabenegrin I and II.
          Following treatment no further changes are noted.<br>
          <br>
          [0040] Results of these studies indicate that oral or i.v.
          doses of cabenegrin I and II are capable of treating
          conditions clinically thought of as being either cardiotoxic
          and/or neurotoxic in nature with no inherent observable side
          effects.<br>
          <br>
          [0041] As mentioned above, the new compounds of the method of
          the invention are suitable for the preparation of
          pharmaceutical compositions, preferably for oral
          administration, or for parenteral injections.<br>
          <br>
          [0042] Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for oral
          administration include liquids which are inert to the gastric
          mucosa. Liquid carriers can be of the type in which a stable
          suspension of compounds of the invention can be prepared.
          Alternatively the liquid carrier can be a solvent for the
          cabenegrin I or II. In the latter case, the liquid
          pharmaceutical carrier solution can be prepared for either
          oral administration, or for parenteral injection.<br>
          <br>
          [0043] Novel compositions for oral administration can also be
          prepared by blending cabenegrin I and II with appropriate dry
          pharmaceutical carriers known to the art. These dry
          compositions can be put into any suitable dosage form for
          ingestion including pills, tablets and capsules.
          Micro-encapsulation techniques can be employed to provide a
          sustained release of the desired dosage if the particular
          condition of the subject indicates this form of therapy.<br>
          <br>
          [0044] In many instances, either the nature of the poisonous
          toxin, or the type of deteriorating condition of the subject
          will necessitate that a liquid dosage be administered to
          insure a prompt initiation of the therapeutic effects of the
          compounds. Effective treatment of animals or of subjects that
          are unconscious or whose vital functions are in an advanced
          state of deterioration will require administration of oral
          doses via stomach tube or intravenous injection by syringe or
          catheter.<br>
          <br>
          [0045] A pharmaceutical composition was prepared by blending
          the following materials in the specified proportions by
          weight:<br>
          <br>
          After the dry composition was thoroughly blended tablets were
          prepared from the mixture. Each tablet was formed so that it
          contained 100 mg of cabenegrin I. Similarly, tablets were
          prepared using the same mixture for the pharmaceutical carrier
          and the same proportion of cabenegrin II was substituted for
          the compound, with each tablet containing 70 mg of cabenegrin
          I.<br>

          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          This invention relates to antidotes for treating the effects
          of poisonous snake and insect bites in mammals, including man.
          It also relates to the use of products of manufacture in the
          treatment of pathogenic bacterial toxins such as E. coli
          endotoxins, botulism and others which exhibit central nervous
          system effects and related respiratory paralysis, and to the
          treatment of the effects of cardiovascular toxins on mammals
          with the products of manufacture and with aqueous alcoholic
          extracts of the natural products from which they are derived.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The invention includes therapeutically active compositions for
          the treatment of mammals comprising compounds selected from
          the class of: ##STR2## and pharmaceutical carriers. The
          invention also includes methods of treating mammals for the
          effects of neuro toxins and cardiovascular toxins which
          comprise administering to a mammal a therapeutic quantity of a
          composition consisting of compounds selected from the class of
          compounds (I) and (II) set forth above and pharmaceutical
          carriers. The invention disclosed herein also includes the
          treatment of specific symptoms in mammals, including humans,
          with the aqueous alcoholic extracts, or their equivalents, of
          the natural materials from which they are derived.<br>
          <br>
          The methods for producing cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II in
          substantially pure crystalline form are described in a
          co-pending application filed concurrently herewith in the
          names of Laszlo Darko, Koji Nakanishi and Masachi Nakagawa,
          under U.S. Ser. No. 357,805, entitled Physiologically Active
          Compounds and Their Isolation, and the entire disclosure of
          that application is incorporated herein by reference. That
          application describes in detail an extraction scheme whereby,
          as new products of manufacture, crystalline compounds
          corresponding to compounds (I) and (II) and referred to as
          cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II, respectively, are obtained,
          that scheme may be summarized as follows:<br>
          <br>
          About one-half kilo of the cleaned root from the cabeca de
          negra tree is chopped and further comminuted to break down the
          fibrous structure. The pulverized root is placed in a
          container with a sufficient quantity of ethanol:water (77:33)
          to cover it, and allow to stand, with occasional stirring for
          about two days. The aqueous alcoholic solution is separated
          from the root and reduced by gentle warming under vacuum by to
          brown oily residue. This concentrate is treated with 50%
          aqueous methanol and the solution extracted with hexane. The
          hexane layer is discarded and the water layer is extracted
          with ether. After separation the ether layer is subjected to
          high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a column of
          Sephadex LH-20 and silica gel, using aqueous methanol as the
          eluting solvent. Two fractions are obtained. The first
          fraction is subjected to further HPLC and compounds (I), also
          referred to as cabenegrin I, is obtained as a substantially
          pure white crystalline material having a sharp melting point
          at 167 DEG-168 DEG C. The second fraction described above is
          an oily material which is subjected to further HPLC and
          compound (II), also referred to as cabenegrin II, is obtained
          as a crystalline material.<br>
          <br>
          In the above extraction scheme, the presence of
          physiologically active compounds was determined by in vivo
          tests employing mice. Test animals were Swiss Webster white
          mice, mixed sexes, weighing from 20-25 grams. Each group of
          test animals was envenomated with two and one-half times the
          lethal dose of snake venom from the Fer de Lance (Bothrops
          atrox) by intraperitoneal injection. In the absence of
          treatment, envenomated animals succumbed within a few minutes.<br>
          <br>
          Concentrates or compounds (I) and (II) obtained from each of
          the fractions of the above extraction scheme were tested for
          antidotal activity by injecting the mice immediately after
          envenomation with an aqueous ethanol solution (77:23) of the
          material isolated from each fraction. Each animal was treated
          with 0.25 ml of the respective solutions. On the basis of this
          protocol, the minimum dosage for survival against the Fer de
          Lance venom was 2.8 mg/kg of cabenegrin I and 2.0 mg/kg of
          cabenegrin II.<br>
          <br>
          Toxicological studies indicate that administration of aqueous
          ethanolic solutions of cabenegrin I and cabenegrin II to
          healthy test animals produce no significant changes in vital
          physiological functions. Administration can be by intravenous
          or intra muscular injection, or orally via a stomach tube. No
          significant change is noted in arterial blood pressure, heart
          rate, respiration, EKG or central venous pressure at any time
          following administration of compounds I and II to normal,
          healthy (i.e., non-envenomated) animals.<br>
          <br>
          Administration does not significantly alter resting action
          potentials, end plate potentials, nerve impulse transmission,
          neuro-muscular function or brain wave activity in experimental
          animals.<br>
          <br>
          The following tests demonstrate the treatment with cabenegrin
          I and II of the effects of toxins which affect either the
          cardiovascular and/or the neurophysiological systems of
          experimental animals.<br>
          <br>
          <b>ANTIDOTAL EFFECTS AGAINST SNAKE VENOM IN DOGS</b><br>
          <br>
          Envenomation by a lethal dose of snake venom, such as Bothrops
          atrox, Crotalus adamamteuns, or Crotalus atrox, produces a
          precipitous fall in arterial blood pressure, a decrease of
          heart rate and an elevation in central venous pressure. This
          is followed by partial recovery of these parameters and then
          by a complete respiratory and cardiovascular collapse. Death
          appears to be due to a combination or peripheral vascular
          collapse and to an interruption in the normal respiratory
          mechanism. In addition, there appears to be some action of
          these venoms on the central nervous system of the experimental
          animals. This CNS effect is exhibited by a decrease in both
          the alpha and the beta rhythm of the brain (EEG). This change
          is also associated with a decrease in impulse transmission
          over the motor nerves and progressive blockage of the
          neuromuscular apparatus which is similar to that produced by
          curare. Venoms had no effect on muscle response to direct
          stimulation.<br>
          <br>
          A series of seven adult beagle dogs are used to study the
          effectiveness of cabenegrin I and II against the venoms. The
          dogs are anesthetized with Na pentobarbitol (30 mg/kg) and
          monitored for changes in arterial blood pressure, heart rate,
          electrocardiogram and respiration. Lethal doses (five to ten
          times of LD50) of lyophilized reconstituted Bothrops atrox
          (Fer de Lance) (2.5 mg-5.0 mg/kg) or (10 mg/kg) South American
          rattle snake venom are administered.<br>
          <br>
          Within 15 minutes following envenomation, marked decreases in
          heart rate and blood pressure are consistently noted. At from
          15 to 30 minutes, respiration likewise decreases from an
          average of 20 per minute to 5 per minute. Treatment is
          initiated when severe cardiovascular embarrassment and
          apparent respiratory difficulties are observed (usually at
          from 15-30 minutes following envenomation).<br>
          <br>
          A solution of cabenegrin I is prepared by dissolving 33 mg of
          the crystalline material of compound in 100 ml of aqueous
          ethanol (25:75). Similarly, a solution of 24 mg of cabenegrin
          II in 100 ml of aqueous ethanol (15:75) is prepared. Doses are
          prepared for administration by stirring 5 ml of each of the
          respective alcoholic solution of compounds (I) and (II) into
          50 ml of water.<br>
          <br>
          Administration of the respective solutions is through a tube
          placed and advanced into the stomach of the dog. Treatment is
          as follows: No immediate response is noted following therapy.
          Blood pressure, heart rate and respiration all remain
          extremely low. At approximately 30 minutes following the first
          dose of the respective alcoholic solution of compounds (I) and
          (II), a slow gradual improvement of breathing occurs followed
          by partial restoration of heart rate and blood pressure.
          Continuous therapy is provided at 30 minute intervals in 50 ml
          water until all monitored vital signs return to within 10% of
          control.* From two to four doses are required. After
          observation for 8-10 hours the animals are placed in a holding
          cage with food and water. At 24 hours, all 7 dogs show signs
          of depressed activity. At 72 hours, all dogs are taking food
          and water. No additional therapy is required.<br>
          <br>
          *The effective dose range is between 10 to 20 ml of antivenom
          extract per animal.<br>
          <br>
          <b>ACTIVITY OF CABENEGRIN II AND II AGAINST E. COLI ENDOTOXIN</b><br>
          <br>
          Three adult beagle dogs are used to demonstrate the
          effectiveness of the cabenegrin I and II in treating shock
          caused by E. coli endotoxin. The dogs are anesthetized with Na
          pentabarbital (30 mg/kg) and monitored for changes in arterial
          blood pressure, heart rate, EKG and respiration. Lethal doses
          (1 mg/kg) of E. coli endotoxin are injected IV into a catheter
          placed in the vein of the hind limb of the dogs. In the first
          experiment no antidotal therapy was initiated and the animal
          expired at 2 hours after injection. In the three additional
          cases antidotal therapy is initiated at the time when severe
          cardiovascular collapse and respiratory difficulties appear.
          These usually occur within about 11/2 hours after the
          injection of the toxin.<br>
          <br>
          Solutions of cabenegrin I and II, prepared as described above,
          are administered by stomach tube in a single dose of 10 ml in
          100 ml of water to each of the dogs. The animals so treated
          survive and resume normal activity.<br>
          <br>
          <b>ISOLATED HEART (LANGENDORFF) PREPARATION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          A series of 2 dog heart preparations are tested to measure the
          antivenom effect on coronary blood flow, heart rate, EKG,
          force of ventricular contraction and coronary vascular
          resistance when cabenegrin I and II are given either before or
          after lethal venom challenge. It is observed that treatment
          appears capable of overcoming the toxic effects of the venom
          on cardiovascular functions. These effects are a decrease of
          the force of contraction and heart rate. Coronary vascular
          resistance also increases progressively following the
          administration of venom. When a solution containing 0.5 mg/ml
          of either compound (I) or compound (II) are injected directly
          into the circulation prior to tropical rattle snake venom
          challenge, no detrimental effect on the heart is observed.
          Rather, the force of contraction and coronary blood flow
          increases by about 15 to 20 percent.<br>
          <br>
          When either compound (I) or compound (II) is given following
          lethal challenge of tropical rattle snake venom, the antidote
          restores force of contraction and heart rate to normal levels
          and reverses the minor arrhythmias caused by envenomation.<br>

          <b>NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTION</b><br>
          <br>
          Three dogs and one cat are tested for the antidotal effect on
          neuromuscular function, action potential and brain wave
          activity following envenomation with lethal doses of Fer de
          Lance venom.<br>
          <br>
          Snake venom decreases both brain wave activity and nerve
          impulse transmission. These are restored to near, if not
          completely, normal levels by the administration of cabenegrin
          I and II. Action potentials and neuromuscular function remain
          depressed for approximately 30 to 60 minutes after treatment
          with each of the compounds. This is followed by a slow,
          gradual return to control levels at from 12 to 24 hours.<br>
          <br>
          In certain experiments in which complete neuromuscular
          blockage occurs and the animals are no longer capable of
          spontaneous respiration, artificial ventilation is required
          until the action of the compound has manifested itself. This
          may occur after envenomation, but once stabilized, the animals
          are capable of spontaneous breathing and no further therapy is
          required.<br>
          <br>
          Cortical electrical activity is markedly (25-35%) depressed by
          the venom. These changes are restored to normal by the
          administration of the compounds cabenegrin I and II. Following
          treatment, no further changes are noted.<br>
          <br>
          Results of these studies indicate that oral or IV doses of
          cabenegrin I and II are capable of treating conditions
          clinically thought of as being either cardiotoxic and/or
          neurotoxic in nature with no inherent observable side effects.<br>
          <br>
          Suitable pharmaceutical carriers for oral administration
          include liquids which are bland to the gastric mucosa. Liquid
          carriers can be of the type in which a stable suspension of
          compounds I and II can be prepared. Alternatively, the liquid
          carrier can be a solvent for the cabenegrin I and II. In the
          latter case, the liquid pharmaceutical carrier solution can be
          prepared for either oral administration, or for parental
          injection.<br>
          <br>
          Novel compositions for oral administration can also be
          prepared by blending cabenegrin I and II with appropriate dry
          pharmaceutical carriers known to the art. These dry
          compositions can be put into any suitable dosage form for
          ingestion including pills, tablets and capsules.
          Micro-encapsulation techniques can be employed to provide a
          sustained release of the desired dosage if the particular
          condition of the subject indicates this form of therapy.<br>
          <br>
          In many instances, either the nature of the poisonous toxin,
          or the type or deteriorated condition of the subject will
          necessitate that a liquid dosage be administered to insure a
          prompt initiation of the therapeutic effects of the compounds.
          Effective treatment of animals or of subjects that are
          unconscious or whose vital signs are in an advanced stage of
          deterioration will require administration of oral doses via
          stomach tube or intravenous injection by syringe or catheter.<br>
          <br>
          A pharmaceutical composition was prepared by blending the
          following materials in the specified proportions by weight:<br>
          Compound I: 20<br>
          Starch: 15.0<br>
          Magnesium stearate: 2.0<br>
          Sodium benzoate: 6.0<br>
          Benzalkonium chloride: 2.0<br>
          <br>
          After the dry composition was throughly blended tablets were
          prepared from the mixture. Each tablet was formed so that it
          contained 100 mg of compound (I). Similarly, tablets were
          prepared using the same mixture for the pharmaceutical carrier
          and the same proportion of compound (II) was substituted for
          the compound, with each tablet containing 70 mg of compound
          (I).<br>
