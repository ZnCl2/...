      <b>Abstract:</b><br>
      Early developments that preceded nomography are cited, and the
      development of the subject is examined in outline. The special
      problem of nomograms in three variables is considered in a general
      way. Uses of nomography, both old and recent, are given. The tone
      is intended to be descriptive, not technical, but references are
      provided so that the interested reader can investigate the subject
      further.<br>

      <br>
      The Smith Chart was originally created many years ago as an RF
      engineering aid by Phillip Smith of RCA. Actually, Smith may not
      have been the first inventor of this tool -- a Japanese engineer
      named Kurakawa independently created a similar chart about a year
      before Smith. In any event, the Chart is a clever, complex number
      nomograph in a circular format which is an invaluable tool in RF
      design...<br>

          graphical representation of mathematical relationships</b><br>
        <b>Leslie Glasser &amp; Ron Doerfler</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Nomographs (or nomograms, or alignment charts) are graphical
      representations of mathematical relationships (extending to
      empirical relationships of data) which are used by simply applying
      a straightedge across the plot through points on scales
      representing independent variables, which then crosses the
      corresponding datum point for the dependent variable; the choice
      among independent and dependent variable is arbitrary so that each
      variable may be determined in terms of the others. Examples of
      nomographs in common current use compute the lift available for a
      hot-air balloon, the boiling points of solvents under reduced
      pressure in the chemistry laboratory, and the relative forces in a
      centrifuge in a biochemical laboratory. Sundials represent another
      ancient yet widely familiar example. With the advent and ready
      accessibility of the computer, printed mathematical tables, slide
      rules and nomographs became generally redundant. However,
      nomographs provide insight into mathematical relationships, are
      useful for rapid and repeated application, even in the absence of
      calculational facilities, and can reliably be used in the field.
      Many nomographs for various purposes may be found online. This
      paper describes the origins and development of nomographs,
      illustrating their use with some relevant examples. A
      supplementary interactive Excel file demonstrates their
      application for some simple mathematical operations.<br>

          for dimensioning multi-packed-bed dehumidifiers</b><br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>This work deals with the dimensioning of multi-packed-bed
      dehumidifiers used in solar air-conditioning systems. An efficient
      dimensioning methodology is elaborated, explained and visualized
      by a chart. The proposed methodology permits to ensure an
      appropriate packed-bed dimensioning based on a compromise between
      the highest possible amount of heat and mass transfer and the
      lowest possible level of pressure drop within a
      packed-bed-dehumidifier. Nomography tool is implemented in order
      to simplify, speed up and expand the possibilities of
      dimensioning. The proposed nomographs permit to determine the
      appropriate values of the diameter, the porosity and the height of
      the packed-bed. The mathematical construction techniques of all
      nomographs are presented in detail. Applied examples are carried
      out in order to show the effectiveness of each nomograph.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      Traditionally, history of mathematics was more interested in the
      production of abstract concepts and major theories than in the one
      of methods and tools of calculation. As a result, it has often
      neglected to consider the mathematical practices of engineers. I
      want to sketch here a sample of these practices through the
      example of nomography in the second half of 19th century and first
      half of the 20th century, precisely at the time when the
      professional community of engineers structures itself and deepens
      its mathematical culture.<br>

      resuscitation and intensive therapy, and can be used in executing
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). That is ensured by chest
      compressions with using a device comprising a bar with an
      anteroposterior chest size scale, a force transfer contact element
      representing a strain-free support plate adjusted on a patient's
      chest, a sound-and-light indicator generating a sound and light
      signal of fixed frequency 100 times a minute a case of which
      comprises the bar to be mounted and fastened thereon, a contact
      element horizontal position sensor comprising a laser pointer, and
      a nomograph to determine an optimum excursion depth in length
      units. The nomograph has points 14 to 24 cm corresponding to the
      anteroposterior chest size, and dial graduations are provided in
      the form of steps formed by upper borders of nomograph columns
      which have height equal to 2.247xi cm where xi is a number of dial
      graduation specifying the anteroposterior chest size. The laser
      pointer is fixed on the support plate and directs a light ray in a
      field of the nomograph columns. Chest compression is executed in a
      projection of the middle one-third of breast bone by pressing
      through the strain-free flat surface of the contact element at
      frequency 100 in a minute at an excursion depth, with first 2-3
      pressings made 50-70 % of the specified excursion depth.
      Compression is accompanied with sound and light signals radiated
      at pressing frequency, and the contact element is followed
      visually by projecting with a ray its position in a nomograph
      column field within upper and lower limits of the corresponding
      column. ^ EFFECT: invention allows providing the most effective
      CPR ensured by creating optimum artificial blood-groove volume in
      great vessels with simultaneous simplification of technical
      compression control facilities, and higher correct chest
      compression data reliability. <br>

      <b> </b>The forming time necessary to superplastically form an

      complete forming of the cells from an interim point where the core
      sheet forming pressure and the die temperature are increased from

      point. The apparatus includes a mechanical spring-driven clock
      mechanism having a rotating settable pointer passing adjacent a
      clock face for visually ascertaining time measurement during a
      specified time interval. The clock face has a prescribed set of
      indicia formed thereon defining a nomograph which correlates the

      Seismic signals are registered from earthquakes by seismographs,
      located in the peaks of equilateral triangles on bed rock. They
      determine the time the seismic signals were caused, the distance
      using triangulation. They measure the speed of the longitudinal

      the triangle. The read the seismic signals from the earthquake.
      They measure the time of the delay. They determine using the two
      minimum times of the delay the azimuthal angles between the norm
      to the front of the seismic wave, occurring through the centre of
      the triangle, the epicenter of the earthquake, and the given
      initiating point of the report. The precise location of the
      epicenter of the earthquake, the magnitude of the temporal delay
      for the horizontal plain (surface of the earth), the angle of the
      location of the focus, the distance, the focus, the distance to
      the epicenter, the depth of the focus are calculated. At the
      seismic monitoring station with the aid of a computer the maximum
      magnitude of the observed underwater earthquake is calculated in
      microns or seismograms. The magnitude (M) is then calculated
      according to the Richter scale using a nomograph. If MÃ«Ã‘7 then the
      conclusion is that a tsunami is possible. To confirm the accuracy
      of the information a check is carried out on the presence of
      tsunami waves with the help of information received by radio from
      a device for determining tsunami waves, located in the ocean in
      the proximity of contact between the lithosphere plates or the
      break in the earth's core. Furthermore, information is taken and
      analysed about the wave's movements from the surface to the seabed
      at a speed of 700-900 km/hour. The force of wave pressure is taken
      into account. The height of the tsunami wave is taken into account
