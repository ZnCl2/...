      <div align="center"><b>The Italian B.A.C. Coil</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In July 2016 I was informed about the Italian BAC coil which I had
      not heard of before. Itâ€™s function is very much like that of the
      Joe Cell coil described above, but it is much more simple. The
      video shown at YouTube describes its construction and uses. This
      is not a coil which I have tested and so all that I can do is to
      pass on the information. The coil is a bi-filar coil which is
      closed off to form a single, continuous loop but it is wound in a
      clockwise direction which is not the usual direction:<br>
      <br>
      The claims made for this coil are quite remarkable and as the coil
      is so very simple that they are easily checked. The number of
      turns in the coil is a critical factor, depending on the
      application. The coil is wound using two wires of 1 sq. mm.
      diameter copper wire and connected together as shown in the
      illustration. The coil is said to improve the quality of a wide
      range of things:<br>
      <br>
      Water quality can be improved very substantially as follows:<br>
      Water with mild limestone hardness can be improved with one
      15-turn coil on the water pipe.<br>
      Water with severe limestone hardness can be improved with one
      13-turn coil.<br>
      For industrial use in a severe hardness area: two separate 13-turn
      coils on the water pipe.<br>
      Water treated with any of these procedures makes much healthier
      drinking water<br>
      <br>
      Fuel treatment results in improved mpg results:<br>
      Petrol: two separate 13-turn coils on the fuel pipe.<br>
      Diesel: one 13-turn coil plus one 7-turn coil on the fuel pipe.<br>
      LPG: one 13-turn coil plus one 28-turn coil on the fuel pipe.<br>
      Up to 25% fuel reduction can be expected. <br>
      <br>
      Natural gas:<br>
      One 13-turn coil on the gas pipe OR one 28-turn coil if the
      13-turn coil is not effective.<br>
      Up to 25% gas reduction can be expected.<br>
      <br>
      On High-voltage cables such as spark-plug leads:<br>
      One 13-turn coil on the high-voltage lead.<br>
      A further 15% mpg improvement may result from improved fuel burn.<br>

      SIMPLE, FAST, FREE INSTRUCTION. BUILD IT BY YOURSELF! IT DOES NOT
      USE MAGNETS, BATTERIES OR ANY OTHER SOURCE OF POWER! IT'S POWERED
      BY MICROWAVES EXSISTING IN THE AIR AND BY THE ELECTRICAL CHARGES
      OF FLUIDS - GAS.<br>
      <br>
      Every idea is the result of studies derived from Nikola Tesla,
      Magnetic Field, Fluid systems, to each its own merit and respect.
      This study aims to make available to everyone, the practical
      application of the 'Energy that creates the whole of which
      electromagnetism is a very powerful manifestation in our reality.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;This is the first practical application, and the first time
      that you combine these technologies for saving energy in its
      various manifestations, and the use of water every day, to reduce
      pollution and costs.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"Because by today' savings , starts the economy of
      tomorrow's technologies" Marco Cocca<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;"There is real progress, only when the benefits of a new
      technology are for everyone." Henry Ford<br>
      <br>
      <b>Operating Principles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A coil of insulated copper wire wound on a support, for example a
      tube, when crossed by electric current and voltage, creates a
      magnetic field inside the coil. It 's the so called
      Electromagnetic Induction effect<br>
      <br>
      A fluid that passes through the tube, is magnetized by the
      electromagnetic field created by the coil around it, for Induction
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      The passage of a fluid, which, though weak, has a small electric
      charge, in a tube, induces a power that charges the coil wound on
      the tube itself, which in turn creates an electromagnetic field
      inside the tube in the sense of its length.<br>
      <br>
      The water that is magnetized through the tube, has many properties
      ... still a lot to discover in magnetized water<br>
      <br>
      The Hydrocarbons as Gasoline - Diesel - LPG - CNG - Butane -
      Propane - BioDiesel that are treated with the B.A.C. Coil, thanks
      to the magnetization, tend to charge energy and align their
      molecules with the magnetic field of the coil, resulting in better
      combustion and flame, less waste and cleaner exhausts , improved
      acceleration and lower fuel consumption<br>
      <br>
      The Closed Coil, Short Circuit, 30 laps of insulated copper wire,
      works as an antenna that receives the microwave frequencies that
      are in the environment, ranging from 8-15 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      By increasing the number of Volts at the ends of a coil, the
      magnetic field generated by the coil will be bigger.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a BIFILAR coil increases several times the voltage that
      is created at the ends of the coil, to a much higher efficiency,
      in the creation of the electromagnetic field of the coil.<br>
      <br>
      According to testing, with extended use of the device, total
      performances increase slowly.<br>
      <br>
      Possible applications:<br>
      <br>
      Tubes of fuel Petrol - Diesel - LPG - CNG - Cars - Motorcycles -
      Boats - Scooter - Generators - Gas Boilers - Gas Furnaces - Gas
      stove<br>
      <br>
      More power , less consumption 25 -30%<br>
      Enhanced and optimized combustion<br>
      <br>
      A concentrated magnetic field , produced by the BAC COIL generates
      polarization of the fuel particles and the positively charged ,
      and is able to burn faster and almost entirely , by decreasing
      fuel consumption , and increases engine performance (power, engine
      RPM) .<br>
      <br>
      Conditions of magnetized mixture combustion are close to those
      optimal , reduce toxic substances and is , by that point of view
      of environmental protection action, similar to the action of the
      catalytic.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the fuel magnetized not only is deposited as sediment
      or soot on valves, injectors, cylinders and candles, but also
      cleans, from the previous scale .<br>
      Usually this process takes time , so the optimal efficiency is
      achieved progressively<br>
      <br>
      Reduction of tear in sinks, washing machines, showers, outdoor
      watering cans <br>
      <br>
      Greater absorption of magnetized water by biological and synthetic
      tissues, resulting in the best wash at lower temperatures and less
      detergents-soaps. Better cleaning of the skin, for your own
      health, better cleaning in the washing of the food.<br>
      <br>
      On water stanchions - radiators installing tubes - Faucets -
      Showers - Boilers<br>
      <br>
      Partially removal of deposits smells flavors of limestone,
      chlorine and substances in the water.<br>
      <br>
      What we usually call "WATER", it is almost always a " Water
      Solution + Minerals and Metals." So, it means that are dissolved
      in the water other substances such as scale, chlorine, arsenic,
      fluoride and other<br>
      <br>
      Magnetized Water for the molecular configuration that assumes by
      carried tests, seems to have a tendency to "expel by itself" the
      dissolved substances. That is, it tends to make INSOLUBLE part of
      the substances, and begins to clean and descale the inside of the
      tube where it passes. It is understandable that can be seen with
      the naked eye residuals and grains of thickened substances
      expelled from the water, on the bottom of glasses and clear
      bottles.<br>
      <br>
      Results obtained from the conducted tests:<br>
      <br>
      Shower : After the application of the BAC COIL on the tube of the
      head of the shower, your skin stays cleaner and soft using less
      soap and shampoo<br>
      <br>
      Gas Boiler : After applying the BAC COIL on the gas pipe, the
      boiler produces more hot water in the same position of the mixer.<br>
      <br>
      Gas cooking stove : After applying the BAC COIL on the gas pipe,
      the flame is stronger at the same Adjuster set of the stove, gas
      burns better, warms more, there is also less pollution inside the
      home. <br>
      <br>
      Cleaning surfaces without leaving marks. Cleaner and residue-free
      glasses and surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      Water faucet kitchen: Water initially had a high calcium dissolved
      and the flavor was not pleasant at all. After application on sink
      tube, cold water on,, you start more and more 'to taste the water
      is' much more 'light' on the mouth.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Even cooking food with this water, makes food more '"digestible",
      less weight for the stomach compared to the same amount of food we
      prepared, washed, cleaned, boiled, without this water.<br>
      <br>
      Laundry with washing machine -- Initial situation: Washing machine
      4 years old, still leaves stains with additive based on "Active
      Oxygen" and detergent capsules at 60 degrees. Then: Washing
      machine washes well no streaks and stains, no additives, only
      detergent capsule at 60 degrees. After a few washes the washed
      clothes are longer soft to the touch.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2-4 wheels Vehicles </b><br>
      <br>
      Power consumption reduced by 30% on 2500 Ducato motorhome TD
      Diesel 1984<br>
      Power consumption reduced by 35 % on 2000 Ducato motorhome TD
      Diesel 1990<br>
      <br>
      The tests results indicate an immediate increase in engine power
      and acceleration , then in a few days the on-board computer , " is
      self / settles down " to the new condition and you will see the
      consumption decrease because you have to press less on the pedal
      to accelerate ...<br>
      <br>
      There may be different results from vehicle to vehicle. even if
      the same model and different power supply : 1 gasoline and 1 to
      diesel, but the difference is minimal .<br>
      <br>
      Possible by the fact that they use different fuels with different
      intrinsic properties at molecular atomic level. Example . Regular
      gasoline and gasoline V-Power<br>
      <br>
      We also invite other people to test and compare the results with
      everyone, in order to further improve and deepen the research<br>

      In his patent #512,340 , http://www.magnetricity.com/Bifilar.php ,
      Nikola Tesla explains that a standard coil of 1000 turns with a
      potential of 100 volts across it will have a difference of 0.1
      volt between turns. A similar BIFILAR coil will have a potential
      of 50 volts between turns.<br>
      <br>
      In that the stored energy is a function of the square of the
      voltages the energy in the BIFILAR will be ... 50 squared / .1
      squared = 2500 / .01 = 250,000 times greater than the standard
      coil<br>
      <br>
      "Bifilar wound coils are used in the system because a bifilar
      wound coil maximizes the voltage difference between its turns, the
      current is then minimized."<br>
      <br>
      BIFILAR COILS&nbsp; are used for: Fastest impulse, Stronger
      Magnetic field, BackEMF increased, More power from generators<br>
      <br>
      <b>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL:</b><br>
      <br>
      Building B.A.C.coil to magnetize water - fuel - gas<br>
      <br>
      1) Cut STEREO CABLE ( red - black ) at least 1 meters of insulated
      copper wire 1.0 mm2 .<br>
      <br>
      2 ) Wrap 15 not 30 turns on the tube ( in the video&nbsp; is the
      V01- FIRST VERSION of B.A.C. Coil )&nbsp; , <br>
      never to cross over the wires, and fix with duct tape, freeing the
      beginning and at the end of at least 10 cm of thread. Do three or
      four laps early and fix immediately with tape. It will be easier
      winding. Secure the end with tape.<br>
      <br>
      3) Turn the wires towards the opposite end up to overlap in length
      of at least 5 cm. Remove with a pair of scissors the plastic
      insulation at the ends of the wire for at least 2 cm.<br>
      <br>
      4 ) Mix together the 2 internal strands of thread, and the 2
      external ends of the wire together and tape the whole thing.<br>
      <br>
      Further tests are to be done, such as the use of more wires ,
      greater or less than 1.5 sq mm wire size, isolated steel wire,
      insulated wire of aluminum, other materials and coatings.<br>
      <br>
      In developing further improvements with other technologies, rate
      of work, different materials, and a new combination for a solution
      with higher returns.<br>
      <br>
      Many many test has begun, with more number of wire, length, awg,
      and type of wire, isolated iron, isolated aluminum wire and many
      type of dielectrics and materials for the coils, different number
      of turn for different frequency range.<br>
