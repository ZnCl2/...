      It has become unarguably obvious to all but the most recidivist
      technocrats ( present company excepted, of course ), that
      "fracking" for natural gas is unprofitable, unsustainable,
      unclean, and it is a direct cause of earthquakes. But what else
      can we corporatists vampires do ?<br>
      <br>
      In anticipation your mindful inquiry, here is a sneak peek at the
      Next Bigly Thing in Petro-Pumping : Electro-Osmosis !<br>
      <br>
      Water in porous material ( e.g., soil or concrete ) is attracted
      to ground, to the negative electrode. This factoid is used
      industrially to dewater concrete constructions at a much faster
      rate.<br>
      <br>
      The same principle applies to oil. Not only is the migration of
      molecules accelerated, but the overall energy requirements are
      reduced. <br>
      <br>
      Electrical field treatment of oil in pipelines also minimizes
      surface tension between the pipe and petroleum, thereby
      accelerating delivery.<br>
      <br>
      In this same manner, apparently exhausted wells can be rejuvenated
      in a timely manner, simply by electrically inducing the planet to
      excrete still more black goo for our Needful Things.<br>
      <br>
      Considerable field research has been performed over several
      decades to determine the parameters for electro-osmotic production
      of oil. The required voltage, amperage, waveforms, and frequencies
      are known, and equipment has been developed to implement the
      technology.<br>

            Billions of Barrels Waiting Below Us</b></font><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Given today’s fluctuating oil prices, as well as the ever-present
      politics of supply and demand, the need for further heavy oil
      recovery is enormous… as is the opportunity. Currently, there are
      several hundred billion barrels of known heavy oil reserves in
      North America and vast reserves elsewhere in the world. The
      prevailing methods for heavy oil extraction are steam-based (which
      require massive amounts of water and power), including steam
      flood, cyclic steam injection, and steam-assisted gravity
      drainage. However, Electro-Petroleum, Inc. (EPI) now offers a
      cost-effective alternative and can recover oil in reservoirs where
      steam methods cannot… and with less effect on the environment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EEOR – Electrically Enhanced Oil Recovery SM — Highly Effective
        for Heavy Oil Recovery, Cost Savings, and the Environment</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This patented technology from Electro-Petroleum, Inc. (EPI) sets a
      new standard for heavy oil recovery that requires no water and
      less power to apply. The process enables low-cost recovery of
      stranded oil reserves by applying electric currents to
      hydrocarbons in the ground, which upgrades and mobilizes heavy
      oils that are too viscous to be extracted by conventional pumping
      techniques. Plus, EEOR is dramatically more environmentally
      friendly than alternative heavy oil extraction techniques (such as
      steam injection), which requires massive amounts of water and
      power.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Breakthrough technology for heavy oil recovery using direct
        current electricity.</b><br>
      <br>
      Demonstrated ten-fold increase in production in field tests.<br>
      More cost-effective and less capital intensive than other
      secondary recovery processes.<br>
      Ability to access oil heavy oil reserves where other technologies
      cannot… without depth limitations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Our Technology</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      EEOR – Electrically Enhanced Oil Recovery SM process involves
      passing direct current (DC) electricity between cathodes (negative
      electrodes) in the producing well and anodes (positive electrodes)
      either at the surface or at depth. <br>
      <br>
      Important facts include:<br>
      <br>
      EEOR has demonstrated, in an 18-month field test, the ability to
      increase heavy oil production ten-fold from baseline levels in a
      field where other secondary oil recovery techniques were not
      successful.<br>
      <br>
      Able to retrofit exiting wells for EEOR<br>
      <br>
      EEOR is able to be effective in reservoirs where steaming is
      either ineffective or uneconomical<br>
      <br>
      Energy costs for EEOR are less than $4/barrel, and capital costs
      are a fraction of steam-based methods.<br>
      <br>
      The 3 Mechanisms of EEOR in Heavy Oil Recovery:<br>
      <br>
      Electro-Chemical Upgrading, or “Cold Cracking” — Oxidation and
      reduction reactions break down heavy oil molecules into lighter
      oil molecules, upgrading the oil in the reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      Electro-Kinetics or Electro-Osmosis — Oil in the reservoir
      migrates toward the negative cathode, creating a drive mechanism,
      or flow, towards the well.<br>
      <br>
      Resistance, or Joule Heating — Oil around the well bore is heated,
      becoming less viscous and easier to extract.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Advantages Over Steam-Based Technologies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      EEOR has several important advantages over competing steam-based
      heavy oil recovery technologies<br>
      No depth limitations — Steam-based methods are effective up to
      approximately 2,500 feet while over 50% of US heavy oil reserves
      are below 2,500 feet.<br>
      Energy costs of less than $4 per barrel produced — Plus lower
      capital costs than steaming.<br>
      No water supply needed — And does not use a working fluid.<br>
      Produces no greenhouse gases.<br>
      Heat is generated directly in the reservoir — Rather than at the
      surface.<br>
      Depends upon resistivity, not permeability — And increases
      apparent permeability in the reservoir.<br>
      No “thief zones.”<br>
      Ability to add capital/infrastructure incrementally allowing for
      faster cash flow break-even.<br>
      Electro-kinetics influence produced fluid and flow.<br>

      <br>
      Among the leading emerging technologies for in-situ oil recovery
      is the use of an electrokinetic technology known as electrically
      enhanced oil recovery (EEORTM)i. Electrokinetic methods are
      continually tested and improved both in the laboratory and in the
      field to render them highly feasible for increased oil recovery.
      The effectiveness of the process to enhance the flow and
      production of both light and heavy crude oil from sandstone
      reservoirs have been demonstrated in the laboratory by researchers
      for the last four decades. Successful but limited field
      applications, both in-situ and ex-situ have also been reported for
      the same duration of time. There has been little work done on the
      applicability of the technology to carbonate rock reservoirs,
      owing to predicted high energy consumption due to low clay content
      formations and high salinity environments. Yet, compared to
      currently incurred high costs of conventional electrical oil
      recovery which depends on joule heating of the formation ,
      electroosmotic mass transport may offer a feasible option to
      augment the flow of these large volumes of crude oil both onshore
      and offshore.<br>
      <br>
      A great additional incentive is that EEORTM can be engineered as a
      truly green technology, where there is no water consumption, and
      no air, water, and formation pollution. The technology can be
      applied with no depth limitation in-situ rendering it even more
      attractive in remote operating locations as well as the
      environmentally challenging ones. This paper addresses the first
      attempt undertaken at the newly-established Electrokinetic
      Laboratory of the Petroleum Institute in Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. to
      determine the efficacy of electrokinetic technology in EEORTM
      tested on field collected data samples of Abu Dhabi. The results
      of the initial tests conducted on field retrieved specimens of Abu
      Dhabi on-shore carbonate reservoir rock candidates from several
      formations in high salinity environments that contained various
      crude types are reported.<br>

      <br>
      This paper aims to investigate the effect of soil contamination by
      oil on the geotechnical properties of the soil and evaluation of
      the feasibility of using electrochemical method for the treatment
      of the contaminated soils. The properties of contaminated soil
      samples by different proportions of lubricating oil were
      determined and compared with the properties of uncontaminated soil
      samples to study the effect of oil contamination on soil
      properties. The results showed that oil contamination caused
      deleterious effects on the basic geotechnical properties of the
      soil. Contaminated samples have been treated using electrochemical
      treatment method. The properties of treated soil samples were
      determined and compared with the properties of contaminated and
      uncontaminated samples to determine the efficiency of
      electrochemical treatment method. The results showed that
      geotechnical properties of treated soil samples are significantly
      improved. The feasibility of using electrochemical treatment
      method has been prooved. Beside the ability of treating huge
      amount of soil, the electrochemical treatment methods are
      characterized by high efficiency and ecological safety.<br>

      </b><b>Technology</b><br>
      <br>
      The QOR technology is an electro chemical based method for
      electric enhanced oil recovery by inducing a low electric DC
      current into the formation.<br>
      <br>
      In the field it`s using the existing well casing as electrode. One
      setup consists of two electrodes, whereas one is an anode and the
      other a cathode.<br>
      <br>
      The QOR Technology is based on two electro chemical processes,
      namely the GeoOxidation and the Geokinetic.<br>
      <br>
      The GeoOxidation creates, in the formation, redox reactions, which
      in steps breaks down the long chained molecules, this means that
      the heavy oil is being transformed into lighter fractions. This
      stage of the process is called liquefaction. Full scale test have
      shown that oil with an API gravity of 15 over a period of 45 days
      is changed into an API gravity of 39 to 40.<br>
      <br>
      The second stage of the process, Geokinetic, creates through
      electro osmosis a flow of oil and water towards the cathode. Full
      scale tests have shown an tenfold increase in the oil production.<br>
      <br>
      The QOR Technology is used in normal producing oilfields as well
      as in deemed exhausted oilfields, but is specially developed for
      use in fields with heavy oil and in oil sand.<br>

      <br>
      A method of enhancing oil production from an oil bearing formation
      includes the steps of providing a first borehole in a first region
      of the formation and a second borehole in a second region of the
      formation. A first electrode is positioned in the first borehole
      in the first region, and a second electrode is positioned in
      proximity to the second borehole in the second region. A voltage
      difference is established between the first and second electrodes
      to create an electric field across the plugging materials. The
      electric field is applied to destabilize the plugging materials
      and improve oil flow through the formation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates generally to oil production, and
      more particularly to a method for enhancing the production of oil
      from subterranean oil reservoirs with the aid of electric current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      When crude oil is initially recovered from an oil-bearing earth
      formation, the oil is forced from the formation into a producing
      well under the influence of gas pressure and other pressures
      present in the formation. The stored energy in the reservoir
      dissipates as oil production progresses and eventually becomes
      insufficient to force the oil to the producing well. It is well
      known in the petroleum industry that a relatively small fraction
      of the oil in subterranean oil reservoirs is recovered during this
      primary stage of production. Some reservoirs, such as those
      containing highly viscous crude, retain 90 percent or more of the
      oil originally in place after primary production is completed.<br>
      <br>
      A variety of conditions in the oil-bearing formation can impede
      the flow of oil through interstitial spaces in the oil-bearing
      formation, limiting the recovery of oil. In many cases, formations
      become damaged during the process of drilling wells into the
      formation. Mud, chemical additives and other components used in
      drilling fluids can accumulate around the well, forming a cake
      that blocks the flow of oil into the well bore. Drilling fluids
      can also migrate and accumulate in fissures in the formation,
      blocking the flow of oil through the formation. Parrafins and
      waxes may precipitate at the interface between the well bore and
      the formation, further impeding the flow of oil into the well
      bore. Sediments and native materials in the formation can also
      migrate and block interstitial spaces.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous methods have been used to alleviate the problems
      associated with plugging in oil bearing formations. Plugging is
      often addressed by backflushing the well to remove mud from around
      the well. Backflushing the well can consume significant time and
      energy, and has limited effectiveness in unplugging areas that are
      located deep within a formation and away from the well. Acidizing
      the well and flushing the well with solvents are also used to
      alleviate plugging, but these methods can create hazardous waste
      that is expensive and difficult to dispose of. As a result, known
      methods for unplugging oil bearing formations leave much to be
      desired.<br>
      <br>
      In many cases, crude oil is extracted with high concentrations of
      sulfur, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) and other compounds
      that reduce the quality and value of the oil. The presence of
      undesirable compounds in the oil requires subsequent processing of
      the oil, increasing the time and cost of production. Therefore,
      there is a great need to develop oil production methods that allow
      oil to be treated while it is being extracted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The foregoing problems are solved to a great degree by the present
      invention, which uses electrodes to enhance oil production from an
      oil bearing formation. A first borehole is provided in a first
      region of the formation, and a first electrode is positioned in
      the first borehole. A second electrode may be placed above ground
      in proximity to the formation. Alternatively, the second electrode
      may be installed in a second borehole. The second borehole may be
      positioned in a second region of the formation, or in proximity to
      the formation. A voltage difference is established between the
      first and second electrodes to create an electric field across the
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      It has been discovered that the method of the present invention
      can be used to improve the condition of the oil formation and
      repair damaged or plugged formations where oil flow is impeded by
      drilling fluids, natural occlusions or other matter. The method
      can also be applied to pre-treat oil in the formation as it is
      extracted from the formation. The electric field may be applied
      and manipulated to destabilize occlusions and plugging materials,
      increase oil flow through the formation and improve the quality of
      the oil prior to and during extraction.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>[0016] Referring to the Figures in general, and to FIG. 1,
      specifically, the reference number 11 represents a subterranean
      formation containing crude oil. The subterranean formation 11 is
      an electrically conductive formation, preferably having a moisture
      content above 5 percent by weight. As shown in FIG. 1, formation
      11 is comprised of a porous and substantially homogeneous media,
      such as sandstone or limestone. Typically, such oil-bearing
      formations are found beneath the upper strata of earth, referred
      to generally as overburden, at a depth of the order of 1,000 feet
      or more below the surface. Communication from the surface 12 to
      the formation 11 is established through on or more boreholes. In
      FIG. 1, communication from the surface 12 to the formation 11 is
      established through spaced-apart boreholes 13 and 14. The hole 13
      functions as an oil-producing well, whereas the adjacent hole 14
      is a special access hole designed for the transmission of
      electricity to the formation 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The present invention can be practiced using a multiplicity
      of cathodes and anodes placed in boreholes. The boreholes may be
      installed in a variety of vertical, horizontal or angular
      orientations and configurations. In FIG. 1, the system is shown
      having two electrodes installed vertically into the ground and
      spaced apart generally horizontally. A first electrode 15 is
      lowered through access hole 14 to a location in proximity to
      formation 11. Preferably, first electrode 15 is lowered through
      access hole 14 to a medial elevation in formation 11, as shown in
      FIG. 1. By means of an insulated cable in access hole 14, the
      relatively positive terminal or anode of a high-voltage d-c
      electric power source 2 is connected to the first electrode 15.
      The relatively negative terminal on the power source or cathode is
      connected to a second electrode 16 in producing well 13, or within
      close proximity of the producing well. Between the electrodes, the
      electrical resistance of the connate water 4 in the underground
      formation 11 is sufficiently low so that current can flow through
      the formation between the first and second electrodes 15, 16.
      Although the resistivity of the oil is substantially higher than
      that of the overburden, the current preferentially passes directly
      through the formation 11 because this path is much shorter than
      any path through the overburden to "ground."<br>
      <br>
      [0018] To create the electric field, a periodic voltage is
      produced between the electrodes 15, 16. Preferably, the voltage is
      a DC-biased signal with a ripple component produced under
      modulated AC power. Alternatively, the periodic voltage may be
      established using pulsed DC power. The voltage may be produced
      using any technology known in the electrical art. For example,
      voltage from an AC power supply may be converted to DC using a
      diode rectifier. The ripple component may be produced using an RC
      circuit or through transistor controlled power supplies. Once the
      voltage is established, the electric current is carried by captive
      water and capillary water present in the underground formation.
      Electrons are conducted through the formation by naturally
      occurring electrolytes in the groundwater.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The electric potential required for carrying out
      electrochemical reactions varies for different chemical components
      in the oil. As a result, the desired intensity or magnitude of the
      ripple component depends on the composition of the oil and the
      type of reactions that are desired. The magnitude of the ripple
      component must reach a potential capable of oxidizing and reducing
      bonds in the oil components. In addition, the ripple component
      must have a frequency range above 2 hertz and below the frequency
      at which polarization is no longer induced in the formation. The
      waveshape of the ripple may be sinusoidal or trapezoidal and
      either symmetrical or clipped. Frequency of the AC component is
      preferably between 50 and 2,000 hertz. However, it is understood
      in the art that pulsing the voltage and tailoring the wave shape
      may allow the use of frequencies higher than 2,000 hertz.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A system suitable for practicing the invention is shown in
      FIG. 2. In this system, borehole 13 functions as an oil producing
      well which penetrates one region 17 of underground oil-bearing
      formation 11. Well 13 includes an elongated metallic casing 18
      extending from the surface 12 to the cap rock 23 immediately above
      region 17. The casing 18 is sealed in the overburden 19 by
      concrete 20 as shown, and its lower end is suitably joined to a
      perforated metallic liner 24 which continues down into the
      formation 11. Piping 21 is disposed inside the casing 18 where it
      extends from the casing head 22 to a pump 25 located in the liquid
      pool 26 that accumulates inside the liner 24. Preferably the
      producing well 13 is completed in accordance with conventional
      well construction practice. The pump 25 is selected to operate at
      sufficient pumping head to draw oil from adjacent formation 11 up
      through metallic liner 24.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Access hole 14 that contains first electrode 15 includes an
      elongated metallic casing 28 with a lower end preferably
      terminated by a shoe 29 disposed at approximately the same
      elevation as the cap rock 23. The casing 28 is sealed in the
      overburden 19 by concrete 30. Near the bottom of hole 14, a
      tubular liner 31 of electrical insulating material extends from
      the casing 28 for an appreciable distance into formation 11. The
      insulating liner 31 is telescopically joined to the casing 28 by a
      suitable crossover means or coupler 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Below the liner 31, a cavity 34 formed in the oil-bearing
      formation 11 contains the first electrode 15. The first electrode
      15 is supported by a cable 35 that is insulated from ground. The
      first electrode 15 is relatively short compared to the vertical
      depth of the underground formation 11 and may be positioned
      anywhere in proximity to the formation. Referring to FIG. 2, first
      electrode 15 is positioned at an approximately medial elevation
      within the oil-bearing formation 11. The first electrode may be
      exposed to saline or oleaginous fluids in the surrounding earth
      formation, as well as a high hydrostatic pressure. Under these
      conditions, first electrode 15 may be subject to electrolytic
      corrosion. Therefore, the electrode assembly preferably comprises
      an elongate configuration mounted within a permeable concentric
      tubular enclosure radially spaced from the electrode body. The
      enclosure cooperates with the first electrode body to protect it
      from oil or other adverse materials that enter the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] It should be noted that FIG. 2 is not to scale, and some of
      the dimensions of the hole 14 and components in the hole are
      exaggerated. For example, the diameter of hole 14 is shown to be
      quite large in comparison to the cable 35 and other components.
      The diameter of the hole 14 may be much closer to the diameter of
      the cable 35. In addition, liner 31 preferably has a substantial
      length and a relatively small inside diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Referring now to FIG. 3, a preferred assembly for the first
      electrode 15 is shown. The assembly comprises a hollow tubular
      electrode body 15 electrically connected through its upper end to
      a conducting cable 35 and disposed concentrically in radially
      spaced relation within a permeable tubular enclosure 16a of
      insulating material. The first electrode 15 is preferably coated
      externally with a material, such as lead dioxide, which
      effectively resists electrolytic oxidation. The assembly
      preferably includes means to place the internal surfaces of the
      first electrode 15 under pressure substantially equal to the
      external pressure to which the first electrode is exposed, thereby
      to preclude deformation and consequent damage to the first
      electrode. The enclosure 16a is closed at the bottom to provide a
      receptacle for sand or other foreign material entering from the
      surrounding formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Referring again to FIG. 2, the first electrode 15 is
      attached to the lower end of insulated cable 35, the other end of
      which emerges from a bushing or packing gland 36 in the cap 37 of
      casing 28 and is connected to the relatively positive terminal of
      an electric power source 38. The other terminal on the electric
      power source 38 is connected via a cable 42 to an exposed
      conductor that acts as a second electrode 16 at the producing well
      13. The second electrode 16 may be a separate component installed
      in the proximity of producing well 13 or may be part of the
      producing well itself. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the
      perforated liner 24 serves as the second electrode 16, and the
      well casing 18 provides a conductive path between the liner and
      cable 42.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Thus far, it has been presumed that electrodes 15, 16 are
      located in a formation with a suitable moisture content and
      naturally occurring electrolytes to provide an electroconductive
      path through the formation. In formations that do not have
      adequate capillary and captive groundwater to be electrically
      conductive, an electroconductive fluid may be injected into the
      formation through one or both boreholes to maintain an
      electroconductive path between the electrodes 15, 16. Referring to
      FIG. 2, a pipe 40 in borehole 14 delivers electrolyte solution
      from the ground surface to the underground formation 11.
      Preferably, a pump 43 is used to convey the solution from a supply
      44 and through a control valve 45 into borehole 14. Borehole 14 is
      preferably equipped with conventional flow and level control
      devices so as to control the volume of electrolyte solution
      introduced to the borehole. A detailed system and procedure for
      injecting electrolyte solution into a formation is described in
      the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,782,465. See also, U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,074,986, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by
      reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Referring now to FIGS. 1-2, the steps for practicing the
      improved method for stimulating oil recovery will now be
      described. An electric potential is applied to first electrode 15
      so as to raise its voltage with respect to the second electrode 16
      and region 17 of the formation 11 where the producing well 13 is
      located. The voltage between the electrodes 15, 16 is preferably
      no less than 0.4 V per meter of electrode distance. Current flows
      between the first and second electrodes 15, 16 through the
      formation 11. Connate water 4 in the interstices of the oil
      formation provides a path for current flow. Water that collects
      above the electrodes in the boreholes does not cause a short
      circuit between the electrodes and surrounding casings. Such short
      circuiting is prevented because the water columns in the boreholes
      have relatively small cross sectional areas and, consequently,
      greater resistances than the oil formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] As current is applied across formation 11, electrolysis in
      the capillary water and captive water takes place. Water
      electrolysis in the groundwater releases agents that promote
      oxidation and reduction reactions in the oil. That is, negatively
      charged interfaces of oil compounds undergo cathodic reduction,
      and positively charged interfaces of the oil compounds undergo
      anodic oxidation. These redox reactions split long-chain
      hydrocarbons and multi-cyclic ring compounds into lighter-weight
      compounds, contributing to lower oil viscosity. Redox reactions
      may be induced in both aliphatic and aromatic oils. As viscosity
      of the oil is reduced through redox reactions, the mobility or
      flow of the oil through the surrounding formation is increased so
      that the oil may be drawn to the recovery well. Continued
      application of electric current can ultimately produce carbon
      dioxide through mineralization of the oil. Dissolution of this
      carbon dioxide in the oil further reduces viscosity and enhances
      oil recovery.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In addition to enhancing oil flow characteristics, the
      present invention promotes electrochemical reactions that upgrade
      the quality of the oil being recovered. Some of the electrical
      energy supplied to the oil formation liberates hydrogen and other
      gases from the formation. Hydrogen gas that contacts warm oil
      under hydrostatic pressure can partially hydrogenate the oil,
      improving the grade and value of the recovered oil. Oxidation
      reactions in the oil can also enhance the quality of the oil
      through oxygenation.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Electrochemical reactions are sufficient to decrease oil
      viscosities and promote oil recovery in most applications. In some
      instances, however, additional techniques may be required to
      adequately reduce retentive forces and promote oil recovery from
      underground formations. As a result, the foregoing method for
      secondary oil recovery may be used in conjunction with other
      processes, such as electrothermal recovery or electroosmosis. For
      instance, electroosmotic pressure can be applied to the oil
      deposit by switching to straight d-c voltage and increasing the
      voltage gradient between the electrodes 15, 16. Supplementing
      electrochemical stimulation with electroosmosis may be
      conveniently executed, as the two processes use much of the same
      equipment. A method for employing electroosmosis in oil recovery
      is described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,782,465.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Many aspects of the foregoing invention are described in
      greater detail in related patents, including U.S. Pat. No.
      3,724,543, U.S. Pat. No. 3,782,465, U.S. Pat. No. 3,915,819, U.S.

      the entire disclosures of which are incorporated by reference
      herein. Oil formations in which the methods described herein can
      be applied include, without limitation, those containing heavy
      oil, kerogen, asphaltinic oil, napthalenic oil and other types of
      naturally occurring hydrocarbons. In addition, the methods
      described herein can be applied to both homogeneous and
      non-homogeneous formations.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] It has been discovered that the method of the present
      invention can be used to improve the condition of the oil
      formation and repair damaged or plugged formations where oil flow
      is impeded. The method can also be applied to pre-treat oil in the
      formation as it is extracted from the formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 110 for improving flow
      conditions and pre-treating oil in a formation is shown in a block
      diagram. The method 110 is applicable to a variety of well pump
      installations that draw material from underground formations,
      including oil recovery wells. The method 110 utilizes electric
      current to enhance the production of oil from an oil-bearing
      formation and improve the flow characteristics within the
      formation. The improved flow characteristics increase the volume
      of oil that is recoverable from the formation. Electric current is
      also applied to modify the properties of the oil in the formation
      and increase the quality of oil recovered. The decomposition of
      long-chain compounds decreases the viscosity of the oil compounds
      and increases oil mobility through the formation such that the oil
      may be withdrawn at the recovery well. Electrochemical reactions
      in the formation also upgrade the quality and value of the oil
      that is ultimately recovered.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The components used in the present method include many of
      the same components described in U.S. patent application Ser. No.
      10/279,431. The system generally includes two or more electrodes
      placed in proximity of the oil bearing formation. In systems using
      only two boreholes, a first borehole and a second borehole are
      provided within the underground formation, or in proximity of the
      underground formation. The first and second boreholes may be
      drilled vertically, horizontally or at any angle that generally
      follows the formation. A first electrode is placed within the
      first borehole and a second electrode is placed within or in
      proximity of the second borehole. Alternatively, the second
      electrode may be positioned at the earth's surface. A source of
      voltage is connected to the first and second electrodes. The first
      and second boreholes may penetrate the body of oil to be
      recovered, or they may penetrate the formation at a point beyond
      but in proximity to the body of oil. A voltage difference is
      applied between the electrodes to create an electric field through
      the oil bearing formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The method 110 for improving flow conditions and
      pre-treating oil in an underground formation will now be described
      in greater detail. A first borehole is provided in a first region
      of the formation in step 120. A second borehole is provided in a
      second region of the formation in step 130. A first electrode is
      placed in the first borehole in step 140, and a second electrode
      is placed in proximity of the second borehole in step 150. A
      voltage difference is established between the first and second
      electrodes to create an electric field across plugging materials
      in the formation in step 160. The electric field is applied across
      the plugging materials to destabilize the plugging materials in
      step 170.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The method of FIG. 4 may be applied in several ways to
      improve flow characteristics in a formation. For example, if a mud
      cake is deposited on the interface between the well bore and the
      formation, an electric field may be applied to loosen and remove
      the mud. A negative electrode is placed in the well bore that is
      blocked by the mud cake, and the electric field is applied across
      the mud cake. Formation water will can move through the well bore
      interface toward the negative electrode under the influence of the
      electric field. As the water moves through the interface, the
      electroosmotic forces hydrate the mud and gradually dislodge the
      clay from the well bore to unblock the well.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The method of FIG. 4 may also be applied to remove plugging
      materials from fissures within the formation. Plugging materials
      may include mud or residue from drilling fluid, naturally formed
      occlusions, or other matter that blocks flow of oil through the
      interstitial spaces in the formation. The electrode in the well
      bore may be negatively charged to draw plugging materials into the
      well bore and out of the formation. Alternatively, the electrode
      in the well bore may positively charged to repel and push the
      plugging materials deeper into the formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The electric field can be applied alone or in conjunction
      with other techniques for unplugging formations. For example, the
      present method may be used in conjunction with acidizing to
      dissolve and remove clay plugging materials. An unplugging acid is
      introduced into the formation, and an electrode in the formation
      is positively charged. An electric field is applied to drive the
      unplugging acid into the formation until the acid reaches the
      plugging materials. Migration of the acid is carried out by
      electroosmosis, but may be assisted by other means, such as well
      pumping. The electric field may be used to drive the acid into
      regions of the formation that cannot be reached through boreholes.
      If desired, the voltage may be increased to impart resistive
      heating and decrease viscosity of the plugging materials.
      Additives may be introduced into the formation to change the
      electric charge of plugging materials. Once the plugging materials
      are destabilized, the formation may be backflushed to remove any
      remnants or byproducts remaining in the formation. One or more
      well pumps may be operated to establish suction pressure in the
      well and draw the destabilized plugging materials into the well.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] As noted above, the present invention promotes
      electrochemical reactions that upgrade the quality of the oil
      being recovered. For example, the electric field may be used to
      remove sulfur-containing compounds from crude, thereby improving
      the quality and value of oil as it is recovered. It has been found
      that superimposing a variable AC signal with a frequency between 2
      Hz and 1.24 MHz on to a DC signal can induce oxidation to convert
      sulfur compounds to sulfates. The sulfates tend to remain in the
      formation as the oil is removed. The present invention may also be
      applied to remove polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHS) from crude
      oil. Operation of the electric field to remove sulfur compounds
      and PAHs may take place prior to extraction of oil, or while the
      oil is being extracted. The electric field may be applied for a
      specified period of time. Alternatively, the electric field may be
      applied until the concentration of sulfur compounds and/or PAHs is
      reduced below a predetermined limit.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The present invention can be practiced using a multiplicity
      of cathodes and anodes placed in vertical, horizontal or angular
      orientations and configurations, as stated earlier. Referring now
      to FIG. 5, an alternate system is shown with electrodes installed
      in well casing 113, 114. The well casings 113, 114 extend in a
      generally horizontal orientation through an oil-bearing formation
      111. The relatively positive terminal or anode of a high-voltage
      d-c electric power source 102 is connected to the first well
      casing 113. The relatively negative terminal on the power source
      or cathode is connected to the second well casing 114. In this
      arrangement, well casing 113 acts a cathode producer, and well
      casing 114 acts as an anode. Insulating components or breaks 120
      are placed in each of the well casings 113, 114 so that
      electricity flows between the horizontal sections of the casings
      within the oil-bearing formation 111. Between the well casings
      113, 114, the electrical resistance of the connate water in the
      formation is sufficiently low so that current can flow through the
      formation between the casings. Although the resistivity of the oil
      is substantially higher than that of the overburden, the current
      preferentially passes directly through the formation 111 because
      this path is much shorter than any path through the overburden to
      "ground."<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The present method may include one or more electrodes
      placed above ground, as described earlier. Referring now to FIG.
      6, an alternate system is shown with a first electrode 215 placed
      below the earth's surface (marked "E") and a second electrode 216
      placed above the earth's surface in proximity to an underground
      oil-bearing formation 211. The first electrode 215 is installed in
      a borehole 214 that penetrates the formation 211. The first
      electrode 215 is positioned within the formation, but may be
      positioned outside the formation, depending on the desired
      position and range of the electric field. The second electrode 216
      is placed on the earth's surface. By means of an insulated cable
      in access hole 214, a terminal on a high-voltage d-c electric
      power source 202 is connected to the first electrode 215. The
      opposite terminal on the power source 202 is connected to the
      second electrode 216. A voltage difference is established between
      the first and second electrodes 215, 216 to create an electric
      field across the formation 211. It should be noted that the second
      electrode 216 may be installed at a shallow depth just beneath the
      earth's surface to produce an electric field. For example, the
      second electrode may be installed within fifty feet of the earth's
      surface to establish an electric field across the formation.
      Placing the second electrode 216 at a shallow depth below the
      earth's surface may be desirable where space above ground is
      limited.<br>

      A method is provided for recovering oil from a subterranean
      oil-bearing formation. One or more pairs of electrodes are
      inserted into the ground in proximity to a body of oil in said
      formation. A voltage difference is then established between the
      electrodes to create an electric field in the oil-bearing
      formation. As voltage is applied, the current is manipulated to
      induce oxidation and reduction reactions in components of the oil.
      The oxidation and reduction reactions lower the viscosity in the
      oil and thereby reduce capillary resistance to oil flow so that
      the oil can be removed at an extraction well.<br>
      <br>
      ng earth formation, the oil is forced from the formation into a
      producing well under the influence of gas pressure and other
      pressures present in the formation. The stored energy in the
      reservoir dissipates as oil production progresses and eventually
      becomes insufficient to force the oil to the producing well. It is
      well known in the petroleum industry that a relatively small
      fraction of the oil in subterranean oil reservoirs is recovered
      during this primary stage of production.<br>
      <br>
      Some reservoirs, such as those containing highly viscous crude,
      retain 90 percent or more of the oil originally in place after
      primary production is completed. Oil recovery is frequently
      limited by capillary forces that impede the flow of viscous oil
      through interstitial spaces in the oil-bearing formation.<br>
      <br>
      Numerous methods have been proposed for recovering additional oil
      that remains the in oil-bearing formations following primary
      production. These secondary recovery<br>
      <br>
      techniques generally involve the expenditure of energy to
      supplement the expulsive forces and/or to reduce the retentive
      forces acting on the residual oil. A summary of secondary recovery
      techniques may be found in U. S. Patent No. 3,782, 465, the entire
      disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
      <br>
      One secondary recovery technique for promoting oil recovery
      involves the application of electric current through an oil body
      to increase oil mobility and facilitate transport to a recovery
      well. Typically, one or more pairs of electrodes are inserted
      within the underground formation at spaced-apart locations. A
      voltage drop is established between the electrodes to create an
      electric field through the oil formation. In some processes,
      electric current is applied to raise the temperature of the oil
      formation and thereby lower the viscosity of the oil to facilitate
      removal. Other methods use electric current to move the oil
      towards a recovery well by electroosmosis. In electroosmosis,
      dissolved electrolytes and suspended. charged particles in the oil
      migrate toward a cathode, carrying oil molecules with them. These
      methods typically use a DC potential source to generate an
      electrical field across the oil-bearing formation.<br>
      <br>
      Oil recovery methods that utilize electrodes frequently encounter
      problems affecting the quantity and quality of the recovered oil.
      Systems using straight DC voltage typically operate under high
      voltages and currents. In addition, systems using DC current
      consume relatively large amounts of electricity with corresponding
      large energy costs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      With the foregoing in mind, the present invention provides an
      improved method for stimulating oil recovery from an oil-bearing
      underground formation through the use of electric current.
      Electric current is introduced through a plurality of boreholes
      installed in the formation. In systems using only two boreholes, a
      first borehole and a second borehole are provided in the proximity
      of the underground formation. The boreholes are located at
      spaced-apart locations in or near the formation. A first electrode
      is placed into the first borehole and a second electrode is placed
      into the second borehole. A source of voltage is then connected to
      the first and second electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      The second borehole may penetrate the body of oil in the
      underground formation or be located beyond the oil body, so long
      as some or all of the oil body is located between the second
      borehole and the first electrode. The first and second boreholes
      may penetrate the body of oil to be recovered, or they may
      penetrate the formation at a point beyond but in proximity to the
      body of oil.<br>
      <br>
      The first and second electrodes are installed in an electrically
      conductive formation, such as a formation having a moisture
      content sufficient to conduct electricity. A DC biased current
      with a ripple component is applied through the electrodes under
      conditions appropriate to create an electrical field through the
      oil formation. The current is regulated to stimulate oxidation and
      reduction reactions in the oil. As redox reactions occur,
      long-chain compounds such as heavy petroleum hydrocarbons are
      reduced to smaller-chain compounds. The decomposition of
      long-chain compounds decreases the viscosity of the oil compounds
      and increases oil mobility through the formation such that the oil
      may be withdrawn at the recovery well. Electrochemical reactions
      in the formation also upgrade the quality and value of the oil
      that is ultimately recovered. The system can be used with a
      multiplicity of cathodes and anodes placed in vertical, horizontal
      or angular orientations and configurations.<br>

      Sulfur is removed from liquid hydrocarbon oils such as crude oil
      by subjecting a mixture of the oil and an electrolyte to a direct
      current field at a relatively high current and low voltage for
      causing oxidation, reduction or other electrochemical reaction of
      the sulfur or sulfur-containing material enabling ready separation
      and removal of the sulfur from the oil.<br>
      <br>
      Sulfur is removed from liquid hydrocarbon oils such as crude oil
      by subjecting a mixture of the oil and an electrolyte to a direct
      current field at a relatively high current and low voltage for
      causing oxidation, reduction or other electrochemical reaction of
      the sulfur or sulfur-containing material enabling ready separation
      and removal of the sulfur from the oil.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the removal of sulfur from
      hydrocarbon liquids, especially hydrocarbon oils such as crude
      oil.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to reduce the sulfur
      content of hydrocarbon liquids, particularly crude oil.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the invention to provide a process for
      purifying crude oil and other hydrocarbon liquids which is readily
      carried out at relatively low cost.<br>
      <br>
      A particular object of the invention is to provide a process of
      the above type wherein the sulfur content is reduced by
      electrochemical means.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the
      following description and the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      With the above objects in view, the present invention in one of
      its aspects relates to the method of electro-chemically removing
      sulfur from hydrocarbon liquids including sulfur-containing
      materials which comprises mixing the hydrocarbon liquid with an
      ion-producing compound selected from the group consisting of
      inorganic electrolytes and ionizing organic solvents, and
      subjecting the thus obtained mixture to an electrical DC field
      having a voltage in the range of about 2 to 120 volts and a
      current of at least about 0.001 amperes per square centimeter, and
      recovering the hydrocarbon liquid in which the sulfur-containing
      materials have been substantially reduced.<br>
      <br>
      In general, it has been found in accordance with the invention
      that the use of relatively high current at low voltages in the
      electrolyte-oil mixture promotes the oxidation (or reduction, as
      the case may be) of sulfur contaminants in the oil, resulting in
      precipitation or volatilization of sulfur compounds which are
      thereby removed from the oil mixture.<br>
      <br>
      As will be understood, the sulfur components in crude oil may be
      of various types. It is known that the sulfur content of petroleum
      may vary from less than 0.1% to 10% by weight depending upon the
      source. This sulfur may be present as free sulfur, hydrogen
      sulfide, mercaptans, disulfides, cyclic sulfides or thiophenes.
      The present refinery methods for removal of sulfur, such as
      hydro-desulfurization, require the use of relatively cumbersome
      apparatus and expensive processes. The electrochemical process of
      this invention, on the other hand, is a relatively simple
      inexpensive desulfurization method.<br>
      <br>
      In the electrolysis of any particular oil-electrolyte mixture to
      produce an electrochemical reaction in accordance with the
      invention, under the same conditions certain sulfur compounds may
      be oxidized, others may be reduced, some may be precipitated, some
      may be volatilized and others may be deposited on the electrode
      surfaces. From experiments carried out in the course of practicing
      the invention, it appears that oxidation is the predominant
      reaction, and oxidation products such as sulfonic acids and sulfur
      oxides have been identified. The reduction of sulfur compounds has
      been indicated by the production of H2 S volatilized during the
      process.<br>
      <br>
      The removal or reduction of sulfur in accordance with the
      principles of the invention may be carried out using various
      sulfur-containing hydrocarbon liquids or oils mixed with various
      ion-producing compounds. For example, hydrocarbons such as mineral
      oil and crude oil from various geographical sources have been
      satisfactorily treated by the electrochemical process of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      The inorganic electrolyte with which the hydrocarbon liquid may be
      mixed may be in the form of an aqueous solution of a salt or
      alkali base in concentrations high enough to obtain an
      electrically conducting system. Such solutions may contain, for
      example, a salt or base such as sodium chloride, lithium chloride,
      potassium chloride, strontium chloride, sodium nitrate, lithium
      nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate,
      calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, potassium
      hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, and barium hydroxide.<br>
      <br>
      Ionizing organic solvents which may be used in combination with
      the hydrocarbon liquid include methanol, benzene, nitrobenzene,
      toluene, xylene, and glacial acetic acid. Many other inorganic and
      organic compounds will also be found suitable for use in
      practicing the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the electrolysis of the oil-electrolyte mixture is
      carried out in a DC electrical field having a voltage in the range
      of about 2 to 120 volts and a current of between .001 to 25
      amperes per square centimeter, with a preferred voltage range of
      about 2 to 10 volts being used in most cases. The concentration of
      the ionizing compound employed in the mixture will depend mainly
      on the spacing, surface area and configuration of the electrodes.
      For any particular conditions, the amount of the ionizing material
      used should be such as to provide a conductivity which results in
      a voltage of the system in the range set forth above.<br>
      <br>
      The process of the present invention will be illustrated by the
      following examples, it being understood that the invention is not
      intended to be limited thereby. In the experiments described
      below, the electrolysis was carried out in a 100 ml flask equipped
      with two standard platinum electrodes. The anode was a cylinder of
      platinum mesh 1/2" in diameter and 2" long. The cathode was a mesh
      cylinder 13/8" in diameter and 2" long.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE I</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A 43.88 gram sample of crude oil designated Fleisher Lease oil
      containing 6.13% by weight of sulfur was mixed with 54.06 grams of
      distilled water containing 1.08 grams of reagent grade NaOH. The
      mixture, which had a pH of 10, was subjected to electrolysis
      carried out in the above described reaction vessel. The mixture
      was subjected to a DC electrical field of 0.100--0.175 amperes,
      for a total of 64 hours. While holding the current to a maximum of
      0.175 amperes during the run, the voltage varied between 25 and
      200 volts. At the termination of this experiment, it was found
      that the sulfur content in the oil had been reduced to 4.57%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE II</b><br>
      <br>
      A mixture of 7.14 grams of crushed limestone, 49.73 grams
      distilled water, 43.03 grams of No. 6 fuel oil, and 0.48 gram
      Ca(OH)2 and 38.78 grams distilled water was placed in the reaction
      vessel. The mixture separated into an oil layer and water layer. A
      DC current of 1 ampere was passed through the system at 15 volts
      for nearly 12 hours, at which time the current had dropped to 0
      and the voltage rose to 45 volts. The sulfur content in the oil
      layer before the electrolysis began was found to be 0.86%, whereas
      at the end of the experiment the sulfur content was 0.60%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE III</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In this experiment, 46.7 grams of No. 6 fuel oil and 4.55 grams
      calcium hydroxide were added to 76.58 grams distilled water, and
      the mixture was heated to reflux without stirring. A direct
      current of 1 ampere at 9 volts was passed through the solution.
      The current dropped to 0 within 50 minutes. At this time a
      surfactant, available commercially under the name Triton X-100,
      was added to the mixture, and electrolysis was again initiated at
      1 ampere and 20 volts. After 4 hours and 20 minutes the voltage
      had increased to 50 volts at 1 ampere. The system was allowed to
      run overnight, during which time the current dropped to 0.4 ampere
      and the voltage increased to 120 volts. The sulfur content of the
      oil layer before the experiment was 0.86%, and after the
      experiment was found to be 0.51%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE IV</b><br>
      <br>
      To a solution consisting of 92.55 grams distilled water, 0.39 gram
      Ca(OH)2 and 5.7 grams limestone, there was added 38.75 grams No. 6
      fuel oil cut with 10% by weight of pentane to reduce viscosity.
      The system was subjected to electrolysis at an initial current of
      1 ampere and 7 volts. During a period of 6 hours, the current fell
      to 0 and the voltage increased to 75 volts. The sulfur content of
      the oil layer was 0.86% before the experiment and was found to be
      0.49% after the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE V</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A solution of 1.13 grams Triton X-100, 126.83 grams water and
      10.39 grams calcium hydroxide was mixed with 73.95 grams No. 6
      fuel oil. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux and
      electrolysis was started at 1 ampere and 20 volts. Within 2
      minutes the voltage had increased to 120 volts and the current
      dropped to 0.4 ampere. An additional amount of 2.14 grams Triton
      X-100 was added and electrolysis continued at 1 ampere and 20
      volts. After 3 hours the current had dropped to 0.4 ampere and the
      voltage increased to 120 volts. Again, 2.15 grams Triton X-100 was
      added and the electrolysis continued at 0.5 ampere and 120 volts.
      Within 3 hours, the current dropped to 0.2 ampere and the voltage
      remained at 120 volts. Before the experiment the sulfur content of
      the oil layer was 0.86% and after the experiment it was 0.54%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE VI</b><br>
      <br>
      This was a control experiment which was carried out to determine
      whether a reduction in sulfur content in the oil can be achieved
      with a similar mixture is subjected to electrolysis at much higher
      voltages.<br>
      <br>
      A mixture of 122.12 grams distilled water, 10.14 grams calcium
      hydroxide, 4.05 grams Triton X-100 and 73.31 grams No. 6 fuel oil
      was prepared and mechanically agitated for several days. At the
      end of this period, the oil layer was placed in the previously
      described reaction vessel and subjected to a 2000 volt per
      centimeter DC potential for several hours. At the end of this
      period the oil was analyzed and found to contain the same sulfur
      content as the original oil content of 0.86% sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE VII</b><br>
      <br>
      To a mixture of 15 ml methanol and 51.13 grams mineral oil there
      was added 8cc of thiophene. This mixture was subjected to
      electrolysis at 0.1 ampere and 50 volts. The resistance rapidly
      increased to 30 ohms within 56 minutes and the mixture changed
      from an initial colorless condition to a yellow color. Gas
      collected over the reaction mixture indicated SO2 and mercaptans
      were present. The electrolysis was run intermittently for 4 days.
      During this time 85 ml methanol was added to maintain liquid
      level. A total of 8.7 ampere hours of electricity were used.
      During the last two days of operation, the gas evolved from the
      reaction was found to contain formaldehyde.<br>
      <br>
      The inside of the reaction vessel and the stirring bar and cathode
      were covered with a black deposit insoluble in carbon disulfide,
      the total weight of the deposit being 0.30 gram. No deposit was
      detected on the anode.<br>
      <br>
      Analysis of the oil layer showed that initially, prior to
      electrolysis, the sulfur content was 2.30% while the final oil
      layer had a sulfur content of 0.625%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE VIII</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A sample consisting of 8cc thiophene, 46.12 grams mineral oil and
      46.21 grams distilled water containing 1.17 grams sodium hydroxide
      was mixed and electrolyzed at 0.175 ampere and 4 volts for 15.4
      ampere hours. The aqueous layer turned yellow and a gray deposit
      formed on the anode, while a black deposit formed on the cathode.
      A brown deposit formed and floated on top of the liquid phases. At
      the end of the experiment, 42.83 grams of mineral oil, 40.00 grams
      aqueous phase, 0.54 gram deposit on the anode, 1.23 gram deposit
      on the cathode and 0.22 gram brown residue were found. Upon
      standing several days, the oil layer turned sky blue in color. At
      the start of the experiment, the oil layer had 1.24% sulfur
      content, and at the end it had 0.20% sulfur. During the
      experiment, the sulfur content of the aqueous layer had increased
      from 0 to 2.96%.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE IX</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Into the previously described reaction vessel there was introduced
      46.14 grams mineral oil, 47.39 grams distilled water containing
      1.13 gram calcium hydroxide and 8cc thiophene. A total of 12.86
      ampere hours of DC current was passed through the system at 0.2
      ampere and 7 volts. A brown solid phase began to separate from the
      mixture as electrolysis proceeded. The pH of the system was
      adjusted by the addition of 1.66 grams Ca(OH)2 after 8.56 ampere
      hours of operation. Just prior to this addition, the generation of
      gas was noted. At the start of the experiment, the oil layer had
      2.71% sulfur and a pH of 12. At the end of the experiment, the oil
      layer had 0.252% sulfur and the pH was 5.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE X</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To a 50.37 gram sample of mineral oil was added 7.75 cc dibutyl
      disulfide and 43.5 grams methanol. The mixture was electrolyzed at
      0.100-0.150 amperes and 50 volts for 64.5 hours or 9.97 ampere
      hours. During the run no deposits formed on the electrodes and no
      color changes were noted in the mixture. At the start, the oil
      layer contained 3.75% sulfur, and at the end of the experiment it
      contained 2.57% sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      In all of the above experiments the current density of the system
      was about 0.008 amperes/cm@2. As previously indicated, it is
      preferable in accordance with the invention to employ a current
      density of at least 0.001 amperes/cm@2 because it is economically
      impractical to operate at lower current densities, while a current
      density of more than 25 amperes/cm@2 is not feasible due to
      erosion of the anode surface and cavitation on the electrode
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      The Triton surfactant material mentioned in the Examples was used
      to emulsify the oil so as to reduce fouling of the electrodes,
      while at the same reducing the viscosity of the mixture to enhance
      the electrochemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of our experiments, it appeared to be preferable to
      maintain the pH of the mixture at a relatively high level, i.e.,
      8-12, since it appeared that the electro-chemical reaction
      proceeded at a more rapid rate at such a pH level. However, it is
      not intended to limit the process of the invention to mixtures of
      such pH levels, since satisfactory results are obtainable at lower
      pH values. In adjusting the pH by the addition of a base, it is
      desirable to use compounds such as Ca(OH)2 to form insoluble
      sulfur-containing compounds to facilitate the separation and
      removal of these compounds from the mixture.<br>

      Method of using direct current (DC) electrokinetics to enhance oil
      production from carbonate reservoirs The method comprising the
      steps of selecting an underground formation comprising an
      Oil-bearing carbonate reservoir, positioning two or more
      electrically conductive elements at spaced apart locations in
      proximity to said formation, at least one of said conductive
      elements being disposed in or adjacent to a bore hole affording
      fluid communication between the interior of said bore hole and
      said formation, passing a controlled amount of electric current
      along an electrically conductive path through said formation, said
      electric current being produced by a DC source including a cathode
      connected to one of said conductive elements and an anode
      connected to another of said conductive elements, said
      electrically conductive path comprising at least one of connate
      formation water and an aqueous electrolyte introduced into said
      formation, and withdrawing oil from at least one of said bore
      holes.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This invention relates to the use of direct current (DC)
      electrokinetics to enhance oil production from carbonate
      reservoirs.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Carbonate formations occur naturally as sediments of
      carbonate materials, especially calcite (CaCO3) and dolomite
      (CaMg(CO3)2). They are anionic complexes of (CO3)&lt;2- &gt;and
      divalent metallic cations such as calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc,
      barium, strontium and copper, along with a few other less common
      elements. Carbonates form within the basin of deposition by
      biological, chemical and detrital processes and are largely made
      up of skeletal remains and other biological constituents that
      include fecal pellets, lime mud (skeletal) and microbially
      mediated cements and lime mud. A main difference between
      carbonates and silicious soils is that in carbonates chemical
      constituents, including coated grains such as ooids and pisoids,
      cement and lime mud are common, whereas they are not present in
      most siliciclastic sediments. Carbonate reservoirs owe their
      porosity and permeability to processes of deposition, diagenesis
      or fracturing.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Petroleum reservoirs in carbonate formations are porous,
      permeable rock bodies that contain significant amounts of
      hydrocarbons. It has been estimated that as much as 60% of the
      world's oil reserves are present in carbonate reservoirs. However,
      a substantial portion of these reserves is considered
      unrecoverable. Among many factors that have contributed to the low
      recovery rates experienced in these reservoirs, the oil-wettable
      nature of carbonate rock is particularly problematic. Wettability
      is generally referred to as the tendency of one fluid to spread on
      or adhere to a solid surface in the presence of other immiscible
      fluids. A published report of an evaluation of carbonate reservoir
      rock cores obtained from all over the world showed that a vast
      majority of carbonates are oil-wet. Chilingar and Yen, Energy
      Sources, 7(1): 21-27 (1992).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Knowledge of the wettability of reservoir rock is
      important, e.g., for making an informed decision about the use of
      gas injection or water flooding as an appropriate secondary oil
      recovery means. A water flooding application to stimulate oil-wet
      rock would be considerably less efficient than if applied to
      water-wet rock.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Various attempts have been made to alter the wettability
      and thereby provide enhanced oil recovery from carbonate
      reservoirs. One such approach involves chemically-enhanced oil
      recovery from in which a surfactant is used to modify wettability
      of the matrix rock to be more water-wet, as described in U.S. Pat.
      No. 7,581,594. Another technique entails the use of imbibing
      fluids which have the effect of modifying the concentration of
      potential determining ions that influence the surface charge of
      carbonate rock, so as to improve its water-wetting nature. Zhang
      and Austad, Colloids and Surfactants A: Physicochemical and
      Engineering Aspects, 279(1-3): 179-87 (2006). See also U.S. Pat.
      No. 4,491,512.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A number of methodologies have been considered for enhanced
      recovery of high viscosity or “heavy” oil. Low-frequency
      alternating current (AC) heating has been evaluated in Canadian
      heavy oil fields. Electro-magnetic (EM) and radiofrequency (RF)
      induction have been proposed for near well bore heating to reduce
      oil viscosity. Down-hole resistive heaters have also been
      suggested for heating the near well bore reservoir rocks. The
      research and development affiliates of several major oil companies
      have investigated various AC, RF and down-hole heaters for
      enhanced oil recovery. None of these approaches have produced
      consistent results.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Enhanced oil recovery has been achieved by DC electrical
      stimulation. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,877,556, 7,322,409 and
      7,325,604, which are commonly owned with the present application.
      To date, this technique has been shown to be effective in
      formations composed primarily of either sandstone or
      unconsolidated sand.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Insofar as is known, the use of DC electrokinetics for
      hydrocarbon recovery enhancement in a carbonate rock reservoir has
      not previously been proposed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] In one aspect, the present invention provides an efficient
      and effective method of enhancing oil recovery from a carbonate
      reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] This method comprises selecting an underground formation
      comprising an oil-bearing carbonate reservoir, positioning two or
      more electrically conductive elements at spaced apart locations in
      proximity to the formation, at least one of the conductive
      elements being disposed in or adjacent to a bore hole affording
      fluid communication between the bore hole interior and the
      formation, passing a controlled amount of electric current along
      an electrically conductive path through the formation and
      withdrawing oil from at least one of the bore holes. The electric
      current applied in carrying out this method is produced by a DC
      source including a cathode connected to one of the conductive
      elements and an anode connected to another of the conductive
      elements, and the electrically conductive path comprises at least
      one of connate formation water and an aqueous electrolyte
      introduced into the formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In another aspect, the present invention provides a method
      of fracturing an oil-bearing carbonate rock formation by
      subjecting the formation to long term electrical stress.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The invention described herein is believed to be the first
      technically feasible method using electrokinetic phenomena to
      enhance oil recovery from a carbonate reservoir.<br>

            &nbsp;Method for enhancing oil production using electricity</font></b><br>
        <br>
        <div align="left">A method of enhancing oil production from an
          oil bearing formation includes the steps of providing a first
          borehole in a first region of the formation and a second
          borehole in a second region of the formation. A first
          electrode is positioned in the first borehole in the first
          region, and a second electrode is positioned in proximity to
          the second borehole in the second region. A voltage difference
          is established between the first and second electrodes to
          create an electric field across the plugging materials. The
          electric field is applied to destabilize the plugging
          materials and improve oil flow through the formation.<br>
          <br>
          <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The present invention relates generally to oil production, and
          more particularly to a method for enhancing the production of
          oil from subterranean oil reservoirs with the aid of electric
          current.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
          <br>
          When crude oil is initially recovered from an oil-bearing
          earth formation, the oil is forced from the formation into a
          producing well under the influence of gas pressure and other
          pressures present in the formation. The stored energy in the
          reservoir dissipates as oil production progresses and
          eventually becomes insufficient to force the oil to the
          producing well. It is well known in the petroleum industry
          that a relatively small fraction of the oil in subterranean
          oil reservoirs is recovered during this primary stage of
          production. Some reservoirs, such as those containing highly
          viscous crude, retain 90 percent or more of the oil originally
          in place after primary production is completed.<br>
          <br>
          A variety of conditions in the oil-bearing formation can
          impede the flow of oil through interstitial spaces in the
          oil-bearing formation, limiting the recovery of oil. In many
          cases, formations become damaged during the process of
          drilling wells into the formation. Mud, chemical additives and
          other components used in drilling fluids can accumulate around
          the well, forming a cake that blocks the flow of oil into the
          well bore. Drilling fluids can also migrate and accumulate in
          fissures in the formation, blocking the flow of oil through
          the formation. Parrafins and waxes may precipitate at the
          interface between the well bore and the formation, further
          impeding the flow of oil into the well bore. Sediments and
          native materials in the formation can also migrate and block
          interstitial spaces.<br>
          <br>
          Numerous methods have been used to alleviate the problems
          associated with plugging in oil bearing formations. Plugging
          is often addressed by backflushing the well to remove mud from
          around the well. Backflushing the well can consume significant
          time and energy, and has limited effectiveness in unplugging
          areas that are located deep within a formation and away from
          the well. Acidizing the well and flushing the well with
          solvents are also used to alleviate plugging, but these
          methods can create hazardous waste that is expensive and
          difficult to dispose of. As a result, known methods for
          unplugging oil bearing formations leave much to be desired.<br>
          <br>
          In many cases, crude oil is extracted with high concentrations
          of sulfur, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) and other
          compounds that reduce the quality and value of the oil. The
          presence of undesirable compounds in the oil requires
          subsequent processing of the oil, increasing the time and cost
          of production. Therefore, there is a great need to develop oil
          production methods that allow oil to be treated while it is
          being extracted.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The foregoing problems are solved to a great degree by the
          present invention, which uses electrodes to enhance oil
          production from an oil bearing formation. A first borehole is
          provided in a first region of the formation, and a first
          electrode is positioned in the first borehole. A second
          electrode may be placed above ground in proximity to the
          formation. Alternatively, the second electrode may be
          installed in a second borehole. The second borehole may be
          positioned in a second region of the formation, or in
          proximity to the formation. A voltage difference is
          established between the first and second electrodes to create
          an electric field across the formation.<br>
          <br>
          It has been discovered that the method of the present
          invention can be used to improve the condition of the oil
          formation and repair damaged or plugged formations where oil
          flow is impeded by drilling fluids, natural occlusions or
          other matter. The method can also be applied to pre-treat oil
          in the formation as it is extracted from the formation. The
          electric field may be applied and manipulated to destabilize
          occlusions and plugging materials, increase oil flow through
          the formation and improve the quality of the oil prior to and
          during extraction.<br>

          </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
          <br>
          Referring to the Figures in general, and to FIG. 1,
          specifically, the reference number 11 represents a
          subterranean formation containing crude oil. The subterranean
          formation 11 is an electrically conductive formation,
          preferably having a moisture content above 5 percent by
          weight. As shown in FIG. 1, formation 11 is comprised of a
          porous and substantially homogeneous media, such as sandstone
          or limestone. Typically, such oil-bearing formations are found
          beneath the upper strata of earth, referred to generally as
          overburden, at a depth of the order of 1,000 feet or more
          below the surface. Communication from the surface 12 to the
          formation 11 is established through on or more boreholes. In
          FIG. 1, communication from the surface 12 to the formation 11
          is established through spaced-apart boreholes 13 and 14. The
          hole 13 functions as an oil-producing well, whereas the
          adjacent hole 14 is a special access hole designed for the
          transmission of electricity to the formation 11.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention can be practiced using a multiplicity of
          cathodes and anodes placed in boreholes. The boreholes may be
          installed in a variety of vertical, horizontal or angular
          orientations and configurations. In FIG. 1, the system is
          shown having two electrodes installed vertically into the
          ground and spaced apart generally horizontally. A first
          electrode 15 is lowered through access hole 14 to a location
          in proximity to formation 11. Preferably, first electrode 15
          is lowered through access hole 14 to a medial elevation in
          formation 11, as shown in FIG. 1. By means of an insulated
          cable in access hole 14, the relatively positive terminal or
          anode of a high-voltage d-c electric power source 2 is
          connected to the first electrode 15. The relatively negative
          terminal on the power source or cathode is connected to a
          second electrode 16 in producing well 13, or within close
          proximity of the producing well. Between the electrodes, the
          electrical resistance of the connate water 4 in the
          underground formation 11 is sufficiently low so that current
          can flow through the formation between the first and second
          electrodes 15, 16. Although the resistivity of the oil is
          substantially higher than that of the overburden, the current
          preferentially passes directly through the formation 11
          because this path is much shorter than any path through the
          overburden to "ground."<br>
          <br>
          To create the electric field, a periodic voltage is produced
          between the electrodes 15, 16. Preferably, the voltage is a
          DC-biased signal with a ripple component produced under
          modulated AC power. Alternatively, the periodic voltage may be
          established using pulsed DC power. The voltage may be produced
          using any technology known in the electrical art. For example,
          voltage from an AC power supply may be converted to DC using a
          diode rectifier. The ripple component may be produced using an
          RC circuit or through transistor controlled power supplies.
          Once the voltage is established, the electric current is
          carried by captive water and capillary water present in the
          underground formation. Electrons are conducted through the
          formation by naturally occurring electrolytes in the
          groundwater.<br>
          <br>
          The electric potential required for carrying out
          electrochemical reactions varies for different chemical
          components in the oil. As a result, the desired intensity or
          magnitude of the ripple component depends on the composition
          of the oil and the type of reactions that are desired. The
          magnitude of the ripple component must reach a potential
          capable of oxidizing and reducing bonds in the oil components.
          In addition, the ripple component must have a frequency range
          above 2 hertz and below the frequency at which polarization is
          no longer induced in the formation. The waveshape of the
          ripple may be sinusoidal or trapezoidal and either symmetrical
          or clipped. Frequency of the AC component is preferably
          between 50 and 2,000 hertz. However, it is understood in the
          art that pulsing the voltage and tailoring the wave shape may
          allow the use of frequencies higher than 2,000 hertz.<br>
          <br>
          A system suitable for practicing the invention is shown in
          FIG. 2. In this system, borehole 13 functions as an oil
          producing well which penetrates one region 17 of underground
          oil-bearing formation 11. Well 13 includes an elongated
          metallic casing 18 extending from the surface 12 to the cap
          rock 23 immediately above region 17. The casing 18 is sealed
          in the overburden 19 by concrete 20 as shown, and its lower
          end is suitably joined to a perforated metallic liner 24 which
          continues down into the formation 11. Piping 21 is disposed
          inside the casing 18 where it extends from the casing head 22
          to a pump 25 located in the liquid pool 26 that accumulates
          inside the liner 24. Preferably the producing well 13 is
          completed in accordance with conventional well construction
          practice. The pump 25 is selected to operate at sufficient
          pumping head to draw oil from adjacent formation 11 up through
          metallic liner 24.<br>
          <br>
          Access hole 14 that contains first electrode 15 includes an
          elongated metallic casing 28 with a lower end preferably
          terminated by a shoe 29 disposed at approximately the same
          elevation as the cap rock 23. The casing 28 is sealed in the
          overburden 19 by concrete 30. Near the bottom of hole 14, a
          tubular liner 31 of electrical insulating material extends
          from the casing 28 for an appreciable distance into formation
          11. The insulating liner 31 is telescopically joined to the
          casing 28 by a suitable crossover means or coupler 32.<br>
          <br>
          Below the liner 31, a cavity 34 formed in the oil-bearing
          formation 11 contains the first electrode 15. The first
          electrode 15 is supported by a cable 35 that is insulated from
          ground. The first electrode 15 is relatively short compared to
          the vertical depth of the underground formation 11 and may be
          positioned anywhere in proximity to the formation. Referring
          to FIG. 2, first electrode 15 is positioned at an
          approximately medial elevation within the oil-bearing
          formation 11. The first electrode may be exposed to saline or
          oleaginous fluids in the surrounding earth formation, as well
          as a high hydrostatic pressure. Under these conditions, first
          electrode 15 may be subject to electrolytic corrosion.
          Therefore, the electrode assembly preferably comprises an
          elongate configuration mounted within a permeable concentric
          tubular enclosure radially spaced from the electrode body. The
          enclosure cooperates with the first electrode body to protect
          it from oil or other adverse materials that enter the cavity.<br>
          <br>
          It should be noted that FIG. 2 is not to scale, and some of
          the dimensions of the hole 14 and components in the hole are
          exaggerated. For example, the diameter of hole 14 is shown to
          be quite large in comparison to the cable 35 and other
          components. The diameter of the hole 14 may be much closer to
          the diameter of the cable 35. In addition, liner 31 preferably
          has a substantial length and a relatively small inside
          diameter.<br>
          <br>
          Referring now to FIG. 3, a preferred assembly for the first
          electrode 15 is shown. The assembly comprises a hollow tubular
          electrode body 15 electrically connected through its upper end
          to a conducting cable 35 and disposed concentrically in
          radially spaced relation within a permeable tubular enclosure
          16a of insulating material. The first electrode 15 is
          preferably coated externally with a material, such as lead
          dioxide, which effectively resists electrolytic oxidation. The
          assembly preferably includes means to place the internal
          surfaces of the first electrode 15 under pressure
          substantially equal to the external pressure to which the
          first electrode is exposed, thereby to preclude deformation
          and consequent damage to the first electrode. The enclosure
          16a is closed at the bottom to provide a receptacle for sand
          or other foreign material entering from the surrounding
          formation.<br>
          <br>
          Referring again to FIG. 2, the first electrode 15 is attached
          to the lower end of insulated cable 35, the other end of which
          emerges from a bushing or packing gland 36 in the cap 37 of
          casing 28 and is connected to the relatively positive terminal
          of an electric power source 38. The other terminal on the
          electric power source 38 is connected via a cable 42 to an
          exposed conductor that acts as a second electrode 16 at the
          producing well 13. The second electrode 16 may be a separate
          component installed in the proximity of producing well 13 or
          may be part of the producing well itself. In the embodiment
          shown in FIG. 2, the perforated liner 24 serves as the second
          electrode 16, and the well casing 18 provides a conductive
          path between the liner and cable 42.<br>
          <br>
          Thus far, it has been presumed that electrodes 15, 16 are
          located in a formation with a suitable moisture content and
          naturally occurring electrolytes to provide an
          electroconductive path through the formation. In formations
          that do not have adequate capillary and captive groundwater to
          be electrically conductive, an electroconductive fluid may be
          injected into the formation through one or both boreholes to
          maintain an electroconductive path between the electrodes 15,
          16. Referring to FIG. 2, a pipe 40 in borehole 14 delivers
          electrolyte solution from the ground surface to the
          underground formation 11. Preferably, a pump 43 is used to
          convey the solution from a supply 44 and through a control
          valve 45 into borehole 14. Borehole 14 is preferably equipped
          with conventional flow and level control devices so as to
          control the volume of electrolyte solution introduced to the
          borehole. A detailed system and procedure for injecting
          electrolyte solution into a formation is described in the
          aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,782,465. See also, U.S. Pat.
          No. 5,074,986, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated
          by reference herein.<br>
          <br>
          Referring now to FIGS. 1-2, the steps for practicing the
          improved method for stimulating oil recovery will now be
          described. An electric potential is applied to first electrode
          15 so as to raise its voltage with respect to the second
          electrode 16 and region 17 of the formation 11 where the
          producing well 13 is located. The voltage between the
          electrodes 15, 16 is preferably no less than 0.4 V per meter
          of electrode distance. Current flows between the first and
          second electrodes 15, 16 through the formation 11. Connate
          water 4 in the interstices of the oil formation provides a
          path for current flow. Water that collects above the
          electrodes in the boreholes does not cause a short circuit
          between the electrodes and surrounding casings. Such short
          circuiting is prevented because the water columns in the
          boreholes have relatively small cross sectional areas and,
          consequently, greater resistances than the oil formation.<br>
          <br>
          As current is applied across formation 11, electrolysis in the
          capillary water and captive water takes place. Water
          electrolysis in the groundwater releases agents that promote
          oxidation and reduction reactions in the oil. That is,
          negatively charged interfaces of oil compounds undergo
          cathodic reduction, and positively charged interfaces of the
          oil compounds undergo anodic oxidation. These redox reactions
          split long-chain hydrocarbons and multi-cyclic ring compounds
          into lighter-weight compounds, contributing to lower oil
          viscosity. Redox reactions may be induced in both aliphatic
          and aromatic oils. As viscosity of the oil is reduced through
          redox reactions, the mobility or flow of the oil through the
          surrounding formation is increased so that the oil may be
          drawn to the recovery well. Continued application of electric
          current can ultimately produce carbon dioxide through
          mineralization of the oil. Dissolution of this carbon dioxide
          in the oil further reduces viscosity and enhances oil
          recovery.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to enhancing oil flow characteristics, the present
          invention promotes electrochemical reactions that upgrade the
          quality of the oil being recovered. Some of the electrical
          energy supplied to the oil formation liberates hydrogen and
          other gases from the formation. Hydrogen gas that contacts
          warm oil under hydrostatic pressure can partially hydrogenate
          the oil, improving the grade and value of the recovered oil.
          Oxidation reactions in the oil can also enhance the quality of
          the oil through oxygenation.<br>
          <br>
          Electrochemical reactions are sufficient to decrease oil
          viscosities and promote oil recovery in most applications. In
          some instances, however, additional techniques may be required
          to adequately reduce retentive forces and promote oil recovery
          from underground formations. As a result, the foregoing method
          for secondary oil recovery may be used in conjunction with
          other processes, such as electrothermal recovery or
          electroosmosis. For instance, electroosmotic pressure can be
          applied to the oil deposit by switching to straight d-c
          voltage and increasing the voltage gradient between the
          electrodes 15, 16. Supplementing electrochemical stimulation
          with electroosmosis may be conveniently executed, as the two
          processes use much of the same equipment. A method for
          employing electroosmosis in oil recovery is described in <b>U.S.

          incorporated by reference herein. Oil formations in which the
          methods described herein can be applied include, without
          limitation, those containing heavy oil, kerogen, asphaltinic
          oil, napthalenic oil and other types of naturally occurring
          hydrocarbons. In addition, the methods described herein can be
          applied to both homogeneous and non-homogeneous formations.<br>
          <br>
          It has been discovered that the method of the present
          invention can be used to improve the condition of the oil
          formation and repair damaged or plugged formations where oil
          flow is impeded. The method can also be applied to pre-treat
          oil in the formation as it is extracted from the formation.<br>
          <br>
          Referring now to FIG. 4, a method 110 for improving flow
          conditions and pre-treating oil in a formation is shown in a
          block diagram. The method 110 is applicable to a variety of
          well pump installations that draw material from underground
          formations, including oil recovery wells. The method 110
          utilizes electric current to enhance the production of oil
          from an oil-bearing formation and improve the flow
          characteristics within the formation. The improved flow
          characteristics increase the volume of oil that is recoverable
          from the formation. Electric current is also applied to modify
          the properties of the oil in the formation and increase the
          quality of oil recovered. The decomposition of long-chain
          compounds decreases the viscosity of the oil compounds and
          increases oil mobility through the formation such that the oil
          may be withdrawn at the recovery well. Electrochemical
          reactions in the formation also upgrade the quality and value
          of the oil that is ultimately recovered.<br>
          <br>
          The components used in the present method include many of the
          same components described in U.S. patent application Ser. No.
          10/279,431. The system generally includes two or more
          electrodes placed in proximity of the oil bearing formation.
          In systems using only two boreholes, a first borehole and a
          second borehole are provided within the underground formation,
          or in proximity of the underground formation. The first and
          second boreholes may be drilled vertically, horizontally or at
          any angle that generally follows the formation. A first
          electrode is placed within the first borehole and a second
          electrode is placed within or in proximity of the second
          borehole. Alternatively, the second electrode may be
          positioned at the earth's surface. A source of voltage is
          connected to the first and second electrodes. The first and
          second boreholes may penetrate the body of oil to be
          recovered, or they may penetrate the formation at a point
          beyond but in proximity to the body of oil. A voltage
          difference is applied between the electrodes to create an
          electric field through the oil bearing formation.<br>
          <br>
          The method 110 for improving flow conditions and pre-treating
          oil in an underground formation will now be described in
          greater detail. A first borehole is provided in a first region
          of the formation in step 120. A second borehole is provided in
          a second region of the formation in step 130. A first
          electrode is placed in the first borehole in step 140, and a
          second electrode is placed in proximity of the second borehole
          in step 150. A voltage difference is established between the
          first and second electrodes to create an electric field across
          plugging materials in the formation in step 160. The electric
          field is applied across the plugging materials to destabilize
          the plugging materials in step 170.<br>
          <br>
          The method of FIG. 4 may be applied in several ways to improve
          flow characteristics in a formation. For example, if a mud
          cake is deposited on the interface between the well bore and
          the formation, an electric field may be applied to loosen and
          remove the mud. A negative electrode is placed in the well
          bore that is blocked by the mud cake, and the electric field
          is applied across the mud cake. Formation water will can move
          through the well bore interface toward the negative electrode
          under the influence of the electric field. As the water moves
          through the interface, the electroosmotic forces hydrate the
          mud and gradually dislodge the clay from the well bore to
          unblock the well.<br>
          <br>
          The method of FIG. 4 may also be applied to remove plugging
          materials from fissures within the formation. Plugging
          materials may include mud or residue from drilling fluid,
          naturally formed occlusions, or other matter that blocks flow
          of oil through the interstitial spaces in the formation. The
          electrode in the well bore may be negatively charged to draw
          plugging materials into the well bore and out of the
          formation. Alternatively, the electrode in the well bore may
          positively charged to repel and push the plugging materials
          deeper into the formation.<br>
          <br>
          The electric field can be applied alone or in conjunction with
          other techniques for unplugging formations. For example, the
          present method may be used in conjunction with acidizing to
          dissolve and remove clay plugging materials. An unplugging
          acid is introduced into the formation, and an electrode in the
          formation is positively charged. An electric field is applied
          to drive the unplugging acid into the formation until the acid
          reaches the plugging materials. Migration of the acid is
          carried out by electroosmosis, but may be assisted by other
          means, such as well pumping. The electric field may be used to
          drive the acid into regions of the formation that cannot be
          reached through boreholes. If desired, the voltage may be
          increased to impart resistive heating and decrease viscosity
          of the plugging materials. Additives may be introduced into
          the formation to change the electric charge of plugging
          materials. Once the plugging materials are destabilized, the
          formation may be backflushed to remove any remnants or
          byproducts remaining in the formation. One or more well pumps
          may be operated to establish suction pressure in the well and
          draw the destabilized plugging materials into the well.<br>
          <br>
          As noted above, the present invention promotes electrochemical
          reactions that upgrade the quality of the oil being recovered.
          For example, the electric field may be used to remove
          sulfur-containing compounds from crude, thereby improving the
          quality and value of oil as it is recovered. It has been found
          that superimposing a variable AC signal with a frequency
          between 2 Hz and 1.24 MHz on to a DC signal can induce
          oxidation to convert sulfur compounds to sulfates. The
          sulfates tend to remain in the formation as the oil is
          removed. The present invention may also be applied to remove
          polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHS) from crude oil. Operation
          of the electric field to remove sulfur compounds and PAHs may
          take place prior to extraction of oil, or while the oil is
          being extracted. The electric field may be applied for a
          specified period of time. Alternatively, the electric field
          may be applied until the concentration of sulfur compounds
          and/or PAHs is reduced below a predetermined limit.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention can be practiced using a multiplicity of
          cathodes and anodes placed in vertical, horizontal or angular
          orientations and configurations, as stated earlier. Referring
          now to FIG. 5, an alternate system is shown with electrodes
          installed in well casing 113, 114. The well casings 113, 114
          extend in a generally horizontal orientation through an
          oil-bearing formation 111. The relatively positive terminal or
          anode of a high-voltage d-c electric power source 102 is
          connected to the first well casing 113. The relatively
          negative terminal on the power source or cathode is connected
          to the second well casing 114. In this arrangement, well
          casing 113 acts as a cathode producer, and well casing 114
          acts as an anode. Insulating components or breaks 115 are
          placed in each of the well casings 113, 114 so that
          electricity flows between the horizontal sections of the
          casings within the oil-bearing formation 111. Between the well
          casings 113, 114, the electrical resistance of the connate
          water in the formation is sufficiently low so that current can
          flow through the formation between the casings. Although the
          resistivity of the oil is substantially higher than that of
          the overburden, the current preferentially passes directly
          through the formation 111 because this path is much shorter
          than any path through the overburden to "ground."<br>
          <br>
          The present method may include one or more electrodes placed
          above ground, as described earlier. Referring now to FIG. 6,
          an alternate system is shown with a first electrode 215 placed
          below the earth's surface (marked "E") and a second electrode
          216 placed above the earth's surface in proximity to an
          underground oil-bearing formation 211. The first electrode 215
          is installed in a borehole 214 that penetrates the formation
          211. The first electrode 215 is positioned within the
          formation, but may be positioned outside the formation,
          depending on the desired position and range of the electric
          field. The second electrode 216 is placed on the earth's
          surface. By means of an insulated cable in access hole 214, a
          terminal on a high-voltage d-c electric power source 202 is
          connected to the first electrode 215. The opposite terminal on
          the power source 202 is connected to the second electrode 216.
          A voltage difference is established between the first and
          second electrodes 215, 216 to create an electric field across
          the formation 211. It should be noted that the second
          electrode 216 may be installed at a shallow depth just beneath
          the earth's surface to produce an electric field. For example,
          the second electrode may be installed within fifty feet of the
          earth's surface to establish an electric field across the
          formation. Placing the second electrode 216 at a shallow depth
          below the earth's surface may be desirable where space above
          ground is limited. <br>

      [0001] This is a continuation-in part of U.S. patent application
      Ser. No. 10/279,431, filed Oct. 24, 2002, which claims the benefit
      of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/335,701, filed Oct. 26,

      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention relates generally to the production
      of natural gas, and more particularly to a method and system for
      producing natural gas from gas reserves with the aid of electric
      current.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the ocean
      floor and arctic permafrost regions contain several trillion cubic
      feet of methane gas (also referred to as natural gas) in the form
      of methane hydrates. Methane hydrates are clathrate compounds
      which are inclusion complexes formed at high pressures and low
      temperatures, existing as solid crystalline structures. In these
      structures, methane gas molecules are surrounded or included by a
      cage of water molecules. Methane hydrates are typically found on
      the ocean floor in sediments which are stable at depths of
      approximately 300 meters.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] There is increasing interest in the development of methods
      to extract methane gas from formations containing methane
      hydrates. The production of methane gas is viewed as one means for
      lessening global dependency on oil and other fuels containing
      large amounts of carbon. Efforts to increase methane gas
      production are also motivated by an expanding natural gas
      infrastructure and growing interest in natural gas from public
      utility companies. At least one extraction technique, solvent
      injection, has been proposed and tested to extract methane gas
      from methane hydrates. Although solvent injection has shown
      promise, the technique is difficult to apply uniformly through a
      formation, and may not be suitable for deep formations. As a
      result, currently proposed techniques for extracting methane gas
      from methane hydrate formations leave much to be desired.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] In a first aspect of the invention, a system for extracting
      gases from a gas hydrate formation includes a first electrode and
      a second electrode. The first electrode is disposed in proximity
      to a first region of the formation, and the second electrode is
      disposed within a second region of the formation. The second
      electrode is separated from the first electrode by an
      electro-conductive path through the formation. An extraction well
      extends within the formation in proximity to the
      electro-conductive path. The well comprises one or more
      perforations in fluid communication with the formation. A voltage
      source is connected to the first and second electrodes and
      operates to produce a voltage difference across the first and
      second electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one embodiment of the invention, a system includes a
      first electrode in proximity to a first region of a formation
      containing methane hydrates on the ocean floor. A second electrode
      is disposed within a second region of the formation. The second
      electrode is separated from the first electrode by an
      electro-conductive path through the methane hydrate formation. An
      extraction well extends within the formation in proximity to the
      electro-conductive path. The well comprises one or more
      perforations in fluid communication with the formation. A voltage
      source is connected to the first and second electrodes and
      operates to produce a voltage difference across the first and
      second electrodes. Upon operation of the voltage source,
      resistance in the formation causes the voltage difference between
      the electrodes to generate heat energy which is sufficient to
      thermally react with the methane hydrates thereby releasing
      methane gas from the formation. The methane gas is formed at
      elevated pressure, which drives the gas into the extraction well.
      The methane gas may be recovered and stored on a barge or other
      ocean vessel. Once on the barge, the gas may be used to fuel an
      electric generator. Alternatively, the methane gas may be conveyed
      by undersea piping to a facility on land e.g. for distribution.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In a second aspect of the invention, a method for
      extracting gas from a formation containing gas hydrates includes
      the step of placing two or more electrodes in proximity to the
      formation and drilling an extraction well into the formation. The
      extraction well has one or more perforations to connect the
      interior of the well with the formation. A source of voltage is
      connected to the electrodes, and a voltage difference is
      established across the electrodes to produce an electrical current
      through the formation. The current through the formation is
      adjusted to thermally react with the gas hydrates in the formation
      and release gases from the gas hydrates. Gases released from the
      gas hydrates are drawn into the extraction well.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] Referring to the drawing figures in general, and to FIG. 1
      specifically, a system 10 for producing gas from a formation
      containing gas hydrates is shown in schematic form in accordance
      with the present invention. The system 10 is installed in the
      vicinity of a gas hydrate formation 8. Two or more electrodes,
      such as a first electrode 20 and a second electrode 30, are placed
      in or around the gas hydrate formation 8 and connected with a
      voltage source 12. Electric current is applied between the
      electrodes 20, 30 and across the gas hydrate formation 8 to
      produce an electric field 40 across the hydrate formation. The
      electric field 40 is applied to the formation to release gas from
      the gas hydrates. The release of gas from the gas hydrates is
      primarily carried out through resistive heating. The electric
      field 40 gradually produces heat in the formation 8 based on
      electrical resistivity of the sediments and materials in the
      formation 8. As heat is generated, the temperature around the gas
      hydrates increases until the hydrates are destabilized, releasing
      the gas from the hydrate molecules. A gas extraction means 50 is
      placed within the hydrate formation 8 to capture and convey the
      released gas to a gas collection system 60.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The system 10 may be used in a variety of applications to
      produce gas from gas hydrate deposits. For purposes of this
      description, the system 10 will be shown and described in the
      context of methane gas production, with the understanding that the
      invention can be applied to a variety of different gas hydrate
      formations containing varying amounts of methane and other gases.
      The present invention is operable in different formations of
      varying compositions, and may be used for releasing and collecting
      gases other than methane gas. In addition, while this description
      refers to methane gas, it is understood that the gas released from
      a formation will likely contain a mixture of methane gas and other
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention can be practiced using a multiplicity
      of electrodes placed in vertical, horizontal or angular
      orientations and configurations. The arrangement of components in
      a given installation will vary depending on the location and local
      geology of the hydrate formation. As stated earlier, methane
      hydrate formations have been studied in arctic permafrost regions
      as well as in sediment layers on or beneath the ocean floor.
      Hydrate formations may exist as large relatively flat homogeneous
      formations, or may be interrupted by outcrops of non-hydrate
      material. Therefore, the electrodes may be positioned in a number
      of arrangements in or around the formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Referring now to FIG. 2, a system 110 in accordance with
      one embodiment of the present invention is operable to produce
      methane gas from a methane hydrate formation 108 along the sea
      floor. The system 110 includes a high-voltage electric power
      source 112 supported above the formation. The components of system
      110 may be located on land or supported on a ship, rig, barge,
      vessel, or other means in proximity to the formation. In FIG. 2,
      the system is shown on a barge 115. By means of an insulated cable
      122, the relatively positive terminal, or anode, of the power
      source 112 is connected to a first electrode 120. Depending on the
      geology of the sea floor, and the proximity of the methane hydrate
      formation to the sea floor surface, the first electrode 120 may be
      suspended above the sea floor, rest on the sea floor or be
      installed beneath the sea floor through a fissure, crevice or bore
      hole that penetrates beneath the sea floor in proximity to the
      hydrate formation. For purposes of FIG. 2, it will be assumed that
      a significant volume of stabilized methane hydrate is exposed on
      the sea floor in a substantially flat layer, allowing the first
      electrode 120 to rest on the sea floor.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A gas collection well 150 is drilled into the formation 108
      to recover methane gas released from the formation during
      operation of the system 110. The collection well 150 includes a
      perforated metallic liner 151 which extends down into the
      formation 108. The perforated liner 151 has one or more
      perforations that connect the interior of the collection well 150
      in fluid communication with the interior of the formation 108.
      Since the hydrate formation 108 is exposed on the sea floor, the
      liner 151 extends from the top of the well 150 into the formation.
      In hydrate formations that are buried under a layer of overburden
      material, the well 150 may include a solid casing that extends
      through the overburden. The specific construction of the well is
      not germane to the invention, and will largely depend on the
      geologic conditions around the hydrate formation. Preferably, the
      collection well 150 is completed in accordance with conventional
      undersea drilling practices.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The relatively negative terminal on the power source 112,
      or cathode, is connected to a second electrode 130 placed within
      the methane hydrate formation 108. The second electrode 130 may
      have several forms and be positioned in the formation in several
      ways. For example, the second electrode could be lowered through
      large cracks or fissures in the formation. In the preferred
      embodiment, the second electrode 130 is associated with the gas
      collection well 150. The second electrode 130 may be a separate
      component installed inside the collection well 150 or in the
      proximity of the collection well. Alternatively, the second
      electrode 130 may be part of the collection well 150 itself. In
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, the perforated metallic liner 151
      serves as the second electrode 130. An insulated cable 132
      connects the liner 151 with the relatively negative terminal on
      the power source 112. The top portion of the well 150 forms an
      electro-conductive path between the insulated cable 132 and the
      second electrode 130. In this arrangement, an electric field 140
      is generated through the formation 108 when a voltage drop is
      created across the electrodes 120, 130. The gas collection well
      150 may be installed to depths of 500 meters or greater to reach
      the hydrate formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Thus far, the first electrode 120 above the formation has
      been shown connected to the relatively positive terminal, or
      anode, of the power source 112, and the second electrode 130
      within the formation has been shown connected to the relatively
      negative terminal, or cathode, of the power source. There is
      nothing that precludes the first electrode 120 from being
      connected to the cathode of the power source 112, and nothing to
      preclude the second electrode 130 from being connected to the
      anode of the power source, however. Therefore, the electrode in
      the formation may be connected with either terminal of the voltage
      source 112.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The electrical resistance of the sediment in the formation
      is sufficiently low to allow the passage of current through the
      formation between the first and second electrodes 120, 130.
      Although the resistivity of the formation 108 is substantially
      higher than that of the seawater above the electrodes, the current
      passes directly through the formation because this path is much
      shorter than any path through the overlying seawater to "ground."
      In the preferred embodiment, the second electrode 130 is connected
      with an insulating break 153 that substantially prevents short
      circuiting of current up through the well casing.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] To create the electric field 140 and commence resistive
      heating in the formation, a voltage drop is produced across the
      electrodes 120, 130. The voltage may be a straight DC voltage or a
      DC-biased signal with a ripple component produced under modulated
      AC power. Alternatively, the periodic voltage may be established
      using pulsed DC power. The voltage may be produced using any
      technology known in the electrical art. For example, voltage from
      an AC power supply may be converted to DC using a diode rectifier.
      The ripple component may be produced using an RC circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The choice of AC power or DC power depends on many
      variables, and each option has advantages. One advantage of AC is
      that AC systems have less potential for corrosion on the electrode
      than DC. The use of AC also has limitations, including a limited
      effectiveness at deeper depths. Losses in steel well casings
      dissipate energy. This dissipation increases with depth, and will
      typically limit the use of AC to depths of approximately 5,000
      feet below the top of the well. Use of AC can be applied at
      greater depths, but resistive heating may be very limited.
      Therefore, for well casings and liners extending greater than
      5,000 feet, straight DC power is preferable. AC power is desirable
      in shallower well installations, where losses are less of a
      factor.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Where DC power is used to induce destabilization of methane
      hydrates, the process of producing and recovering methane gas may
      be enhanced through electro-osmosis and ion migration. In
      addition, electrochemical reactions such as the production of
      oxygen and hydrogen may assist in the production of methane.
      Electrochemical reactions can also create methanol and ethane
      through oxidation and reduction. The electric potential required
      for carrying out thermal destabilization of methane hydrates will
      vary depending on pressure and temperature conditions at the
      formation, and the size of the desired electric field.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Referring now to FIG. 3, a system 210 in accordance with
      the present invention includes a high-voltage electric power
      source 212 located on a barge 215, and a first electrode 220
      incorporated into the structure of the barge. The first electrode
      220 is connected to a relatively positive terminal, or anode, of
      the power source 212. A gas collection well 250 is drilled into a
      methane hydrate formation 208, similar to the embodiment described
      above. The collection well 250 includes a perforated metallic
      liner 251 which extends down into the formation 208 and serves as
      a second electrode 230. An insulated cable 232 connects the liner
      251 with the relatively negative terminal on the power source 212.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Based on the foregoing, persons skilled in the art will
      understand the advantages of system 210 over prior methods for
      producing gas from gas hydrates. The first electrode 220 is
      integrally connected with the barge 215, while the second
      electrode 230 is a stationary electrode. The position of the first
      electrode can be adjusted by navigating the barge in different
      positions relative to the second electrode 230. By moving the
      first electrode, the position and intensity of the electric field
      can be modified. The ability to move electrodes maximizes the
      range of application of the electric field. Theoretically, the
      position of the field can be adjusted through an angle of up to
      360 degrees around a single stationary electrode. The same
      benefits may be achieved on land by mounting electrodes on
      vehicles. For example, it is anticipated that the present
      invention may be applied in arctic permafrost regions, with
      electrodes mounted on heavy track machines or all-terrain
      vehicles. The ability to reposition the electric field greatly
      reduces the number of bore holes and electrodes that must be
      installed, since an electric field can be applied over a
      relatively large area by maneuvering a small number of electrodes
      around the formation.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Gas may be captured or collected using a variety of piping
      arrangements in accordance with the present invention. In FIG. 2,
      the well 150 is connected to a riser pipe or conduit 152 which
      connects to a storage tank 160 on the barge 115. In this
      arrangement, gas can be collected on the barge and transported to
      shore. The conduit 152 may require special reinforcements or
      materials suitable for withstanding pressures and currents
      associated with deep sea installations. These structural
      reinforcements and materials are generally known and therefore
      will not be described in detail herein. In addition to storing the
      gas on the barge 115, the gas may be used to fuel an electric
      generator 170 installed on the barge. In this type of system, gas
      may be piped from the extraction well into a storage tank on the
      barge, and subsequently fed to a boiler to generate steam.
      Electricity generated on the barge may then be exported to the
      mainland by undersea cables. The gas may also be piped from the
      extraction well directly to land. In FIG. 3, the well 250 is
      connected to undersea piping 252 which transports the gas to a
      bulk storage plant, power generator, or other facility located on
      land.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The flow of oil from an undersea oil-bearing formation to an
      on-shore well is induced by the steps of locating a relatively
      small anode in a cavity at an approximately medial elevation of
      the formation at an off-shore location preferably beyond the
      reservoir of oil, injecting saline water into that cavity, raising
      the electric potential of the anode with respect to a cathode in
      the vicinity of an off-shore well, and withdrawing oil from the
      well.<br>
      <br>
      Crude oil is generally recovered from an oil bearing formation
      initially as a result of gas or other formation pressure forcing
      the oil from the formation into a producing well from whence it is
      pumped to the surface. Such a well of course must penetrate
      directly into the body of oil contained in the formation and there
      is consequent risk that oil under natural pressure will be
      exhausted without control. To preclude or limit such uncontrolled
      exhaust it is desirable that oil be moved below ground to a well
      location remote from the pressurized region or to a well location
      where surface conditions are such that uncontrolled exhaust may be
      better controlled at least temporarily. Even where natural
      pressure does not create the risk of uncontrolled exhaust it may
      often be desirable to move a body of underground oil, whether
      fluid or highly viscous, to a well location where production by
      pumping is less expensive or more convenient than it would be
      directly over the oil body in its natural location.<br>
      <br>
      The several techniques currently used to induce flow of
      underground oil are primarily adapted to secondary recovery of oil
      following primary production and may be of limited effectiveness
      in treating highly viscous oils. A principal such method employs a
      scavenging fluid such as air, gas, water or steam. In such
      methods, however, pressure and/or temperature limitations are such
      that oil flow can be induced only over short distances of the
      order of several hundred feet and without directional control.<br>
      <br>
      Other prior art techniques for improving oil recovery involve
      conducting electric current through the oilbearing strata for the
      purpose of either raising the temperature of the oil by conduction
      heating or controlling oil movement by electro-osmosis. The latter
      is described in US Pat. No. 2,799,641 granted on July 16, 1957
      to&nbsp; Bell whose proposes placing two electrodes in contact
      with the oil at spaced apart locations in an oil-bearing
      formation. Bell teaches that electromotive force must be impressed
      directly on the oil to cause electric current to flow through the
      oil and postulates that the oil is induced to move by
      electro-osmosis toward the cathode. Such a method, of course,
      requires that both the producing well and the anode bore hole
      penetrate directly into the body of oil contained in the
      formation, and there is consequent risk that oil under pressures
      created naturally or otherwise may exhaust through the anode hole.
      <br>
      <br>
      The flow of oil from an undersea oil-bearing formation to an
      on-shore well is induced by the steps of locating a relatively
      small anode in a cavity at an approximately medial elevation of
      the formation at an off-shore location preferably beyond the
      reservoir of oil, injecting saline water into that cavity, raising
      the electric potential of the anode with respect to a cathode in
      the vicinity of an off-shore well, and withdrawing oil from the
      well.<br>
      <br>
      Our invention relates to the production of oil from underground
      oil bearing formations, and particularly to an improved
      electro-thermal method for producing oil from off-shore regions of
      a formation through one or more wells in an on-shore region of the
      formation.<br>
      <br>
      Our earlier application, Ser. No. 855,637, first filed on Sept. 5,
      1969, refiled on Nov. 12, 1970 Nov. 9, 1971 and now existing as a
      continuing application, Ser. No. 196,917 discloses and claims
      broadly an improved method for utilizing unidirectional electric
      current to develop electro-kinetic and thermal driving forces in
      the production of oil. In that application it is pointed out that
      the method has particular utility in the secondary production of
      oil from wells in which natural pressure no longer exists and to
      primary or secondary production where the contained oil is highly
      viscous. The present invention concerns certain improvements in
      the foregoing method whereby it is rendered especially applicable
      to the recovery of oil from undersea or other off-shore oil
      bearing formations, whether or not the contained oil is under
      natural pressure or of high viscosity.<br>
      <br>
      While much has been published about the phenomenom of
      electro-osmosis and its more common practical applications to soil
      drainage and the dehydration of wet ground, we are not presently
      aware that electro-osmosis has been successfully used commercially
      to transport underground oil for secondary recovery from an
      existing well or for recovery at an optional location. There is
      today an urgent need for improved methods of oil recovery from
      fields where primary pressure has been exhausted and from tar
      sands where huge quantities of highly viscous oils exist without
      natural pressure adequate for recovery. Oil bearing strata located
      beneath surface areas especially susceptible to pollution or
      inconveniently located, as beneath a lake, gulf or ocean, present
      a different problem in urgent need of solution.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is a general object of our invention to provide an
      improved electro-thermal method for producing oil from an oil
      containing earth formation through a well penetrating the
      formation at a selectable point in or beyond the body of contained
      oil.<br>
      <br>
      It is a more specific object of our invention to provide an
      improved electro-kinetic method for producing oil from an
      underwater oil bearing formation in a way which does not require
      penetration of the contained oil body at any underwater location.<br>
      <br>
      In carrying out our invention in one form, we suspend an anode in
      a cavity in an underground formation i.e., earth stratum in at
      least a portion of which a body of oil is present. This cavity may
      for example be located at the bottom of a vertical borehole
      extending from the surface of the earth to a predetermined region
      of the oil-bearing formation. The anode cavity is disposed at an
      approximately medial elevation of the proximate region of the
      formation and may penetrate the contained body of oil or lie
      laterally beyond it. The relatively positive pole of a source of
      high-voltage, high-power direct current is connected to the anode
      (e.g., by means of an insulated cable in the anode hole), and the
      other pole of the source is connected to a cathode located at or
      near a well bore which penetrates the formation at a point remote
      from the anode. The well bore may penetrate the contained oil body
      or be located beyond it so long as some or all the oil body is
      located between the well and the anode cavity. The well bore may
      thus penetrate the formation at a selectable point in or near the
      body of oil to be recovered.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the cathode comprises a perforated metal linear in the
      bottom hole of a producing well. The anode is immersed in a
      hydrous electrolyte of a composition having the essential
      characteristics of the connate water present in the oil-bearing
      formation (hereinafter "formation water") which can be supplied
      thereto through the anode hole, and its potential is raised to a
      high level (i.e., 200 volts or more) with respect to the cathode.
      In this arrangement the anode is in essence a point source of
      heat, and the water in the cavity will be efficiently heated above
      ambient to a temperature substantially hotter than 250 DEG F. The
      hydrostatic pressure exerted by the column of water above the
      cavity, augmented by externally imposed pressure if desired,
      subjects the water in the cavity to sufficiently high pressure
      (e.g., 1,000 p.s.i. and up) so that it remains in a liquid state
      at its elevated temperature. The hot pressurized water surrounding
      the anode is saline and thus provides a good electrical conducting
      medium between the anode and the adjacent oil-bearing formation.
      Due to hydrodynamic pressure and electroosmotic flow, the hot
      saline water will move from the cavity in a direction toward the
      producing well, and the resulting pressure and heat fronts
      effectively stimulate the flow of oil in the oil-bearing
      formation. Hydrogen released from the interstitial water by
      electrolysis at the cathode may be absorbed by the crude oil to
      beneficially increase its hydrogen content, and oxygen liberated
      near the anode may unite with the oil in an oxidation process that
      releases useful heat. The anode is constructed of suitable
      material to resist adverse electrolytic reaction.<br>
      <br>
      As will be apparent from the foregoing summary, we are using
      unidirectional electric current and formation water as the
      prinicpal raw ingredients in a new electrothermal method of
      stimulating and directing the flow of oil from known reservoirs.
      These inputs are delivered to the subterranean reservoir where the
      electric energy is converted to thermal energy (heat), mechanical
      energy (electroosmotic movement of the formation water), and
      chemical energy (hydrogeneration and oxidation of the oil) which
      are effective, in combination, to increase the expulsive forces,
      decrease the retentive forces acting on the oil in situ and to
      direct flow of oil to a well in the cathode region. In this manner
      bulk electric power can be efficiently expended to extract more
      oil from existing oil fields than is otherwise practical using
      conventional secondary recovery methods. Furthermore, by using our
      method the number of wells usually drilled to exploit a given
      reservoir may be reduced, and flexibility is provided in location
      of wells relative to the location of an oil deposit. The method is
      applicable regardless of the character of the oil-bearing
      formation (e.g., highly viscous tarsands, oil shale deposits,
      "dead" oil fields or oil under natural pressure whether or not
      highly viscous). Moreover, our method can be successfully
      practiced even though initially there is no oil in the particular
      regions or portions of the formation where the anode hole and
      well, respectively, are located, so long as a reservoir of oil is
      present somewhere between anode and cathode.<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Referring now to FIG. 1, the reference number 11 represents a
      subterranean formation or earth stratum containing a reservoir or
      body of crude oil in a porous oil-bearing medium. Typically such
      oil bearing stratum formations are found beneath the upper strata
      of earth, referred to generally as overburden, at a depth of the
      order of 2,000 feet or more below the surface. Communication from
      the surface 12 to the formation 11 is established through spaced
      apart boreholes 13 and 14. The hole 13 comprises an oil-producing
      well, whereas the adjacent hole 14 can be a special hole designed
      for the transmission of water and electricity to the formation 11.<br>
      <br>
      An anode 15 is lowered through the hole 14 to a medial elevation
      of the proximate region of stratum formation 11. The chamber or
      cavity in the oil sand where the anode is suspended is flooded
      with formation water which preferably is injected through the
      anode hole under fluid pressure in excess of that existing in the
      oil reservoir. In accordance with conventional practice, the
      casing in the hole 14 is sealed in the overburden above the
      formation 11, and the casing head is capped so that any desired
      pressure may be developed.<br>
      <br>
      By means of an insulated cable in the anode hole 14, the
      relatively positive terminal of a high-voltage (at least 200
      volts) d-c electric power source is connected to the anode 15. The
      negative terminal of the same source is connected to a ground
      electrode in the vicinity of the well 13, as to the metallic
      tubing in the producing well which thus constitutes a cathode.
      Between anode and cathode, the electrical resistance of the
      connate water in the oil sand is sufficiently low so that direct
      current can flow through this formation from the anode 15 to the
      lower regions of the producing well 13. The formation is heated
      conductively by electric current passing through it. It is
      believed that most of the voltage drop between the terminals of
      the d-c power source is concentrated near the electrodes. By
      utilizing an anode 15 of small surface area which extends
      vertically for only a small portion of the vertical height of the
      proximate formation 11 and raising the anode potential with
      respect to the cathode to a suitably high voltage, the temperature
      of the pressurized water that surrounds it can be raised to at
      least several hundred degrees Fahrenheit. Thus the water is heated
      and forced into the adjacent oil-bearing formation under the
      pressure developed in the anode hole. The water thus absorbed is
      induced to flow primarily toward the cathode well under the
      applied pressure and the augmenting directional force of
      electroosmosis.<br>
      <br>
      In the foregoing manner, heat is efficiently imparted to the oil
      sand 11. This reduces the resistivity and the viscosity of the oil
      therein and tends to fluidize the same. The heated oil is
      entrained by the hot water and is forced under pressure toward the
      producing well, as is indicated in FIG. 1 by the pointer. As the
      pressure and heat fronts advance toward the producing well, the
      temperature is increased in regions of the sand more remote from
      the anode. Thus the entire reservoir of oil between the anode hole
      14 and the producing well 13 is progressively heated, and the oil
      is forced into the producing well where it is removed by ordinary
      pumping means. The electrolytic action in the oil-bearing
      formation may tend to hydrogenate and thereby upgrade the oil that
      is removed therefrom. The operation of our process continues even
      after oil migrates away from the vicinity of the anode 15, and in
      fact the anode hole 14 can initially be drilled in an oil-dry
      region of the formation 11 beyond the contained body or reservoir
      of oil.<br>
      <br>
      Suitable apparatus for practicing our invention is shown in FIG.
      2, and its construction and operation will now be described. As is
      depicted in this figure, the borehole 13 comprises an oil
      producing well which penetrates one region 17 of the underground
      oil sand 11. The well 13 includes an elongated metallic casing 18
      extending from the surface 12 to the cap rock 23 immediately above
      the region 17. The casing 18 is sealed in the overburden 19 by
      concrete 20 as shown, and its lower end is suitably joined to a
      perforated metallic liner 24 which continues through the bottom
      hole of the well and down to the underburden. A tubing string 21
      is disposed inside the casing 18 where it extends from the casing
      head 22 to a pump 25 located in the liquid pool 26 that will
      accumulate inside the liner 24. Preferably the producing well 13
      is drilled and constructed in accordance with common practices in
      the art, and it operates in the usual manner to withdraw or pump
      from the bottom hole 26 the mixture of oil and water that flows
      therein from the adjacent reservoir 11. Our invention is intended
      to stimulate the flow of that mixture into the producing well 13,
      thereby promoting the recovery of oil from the formation 11.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with our invention, another borehole 14 penetrates
      the oil sand 11 at a region 27 thereof horizontally-spaced from
      the region 17 with which the producing well 13 communicates. This
      borehole provides ingress to the region 27 for the anode 15 and
      for water. While a conventional producing well like the well 13
      could be modified for this purpose, we have illustrated in FIG. 2
      a borehole 14 comprising a special "anode hole" which will next be
      described.<br>
      <br>
      The anode hole 14 includes an elongated metallic casing 28 whose
      lower end is terminated by a shoe 29 disposed at approximately the
      same elevation as the cap rock 23, and as usual this casing is
      sealed in the overburden 19 by concrete 30. Near the bottom of the
      hole a tubular liner 31 of insulating material extends from the
      casing 28 for an appreciable distance into the oil sand 11. The
      insulating liner 31 is telescopically joined to the casing 28 by a
      suitable tubular crossover means or coupler pipe 32. Preferably
      the space between the exterior wall of the liner 31 and the
      surrounding oil sand 11 is packed by high-temperature concrete 33.
      Although shown out of scale in FIG. 2 to simplify the drawing,
      actually, for reasons explained hereinafter, the liner 31 should
      have a substantial length and a relatively small inside diameter.<br>
      <br>
      Below the liner 31, a cavity 34 is formed in the oil sand 11, and
      in this cavity there is an exposed, cylindrical electroconductive
      body comprising the anode 15 supported by a cable 35 which is
      insulated from ground. The anode 15 is relatively short compared
      to the depth of the proximate region of the oil sand (e.g.,
      substantially less than one-half the depth of region 27), and it
      is positioned at an approximately medial elevation in this region.
      For example, if the region 27 were about 100 feet deep, the center
      of the anode would be disposed approximately 50 feet below the cap
      rock 23. (Obviously the vertical dimensions of the formation 11,
      the anode 15, and liner 31, and the cavity 34 have been
      foreshortened in FIG. 2 for the sake of drawing simplicity).<br>
      <br>
      The anode 15 is attached to the lower end of the insulated cable
      35 whoseother end emerges from a bushing or packing gland 36 in a
      cap 37 at the top of casing 28 and is connected to the positive
      pole (+) of an electric power source 38. Preferably the cable 35
      is clamped for support at spaced intervals on a tubing string 40
      which is disposed in the casing 28. The lower section 41 of this
      tubing string, which section extends axially through the liner 31,
      is made of insulating material whereby there is no metal in the
      zone between the anode 15 and the casing shoe 29 except for the
      conductor inside the insulated cable 35.<br>
      <br>
      The negative pole (-) of the electric power source 38 is connected
      via a cable 42 to an uninsulated conductor or electrode in the
      producing well 13. As is shown in FIG. 2, the perforated liner 24
      itself conveniently serves as this electrode (the cathode), and
      the well casing 18 provides a conductive path between the cathode
      and the cable 42. If desired a ground electrode other than the
      well casing but also in the vicinity of the well 13 may be used as
      cathode. More details of the electric power source 38 will be
      explained below in connection with the description of FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      The tubing string 40, 41 in the anode hole 14 conveniently serves
      as a duct for delivering water from the surface 12 down the hole
      to the vicinity of the anode 15. Preferably a pump 43 at the
      surface is used to drive this water from a suitable reservoir 44
      through a control valve 45 and into the upper section 40 of the
      tubing string. The injected water fills the cavity 34 where it is
      subjected to a high pressure (e.g., in the order of 1,000 p.s.i.
      or more) due to the hydrostatic head plus additional pressure
      externally imposed thereon by the pump 43, and it therefore can
      flow from the cavity into the surrounding region 27 of the oil
      sand 11. As is the case in known water flooding practice, the
      apparatus is arranged and operated so as to control the volume
      flow of water as desired.<br>
      <br>
      The resistivity of the bottom hole water will be relatively low
      due to its saline content. While salts will probably diffuse
      therein from the adjacent formation 11, we presently prefer to
      inject electroconductive water from the surface. A slightly saline
      solution having a resistivity of approximately 1,000
      ohm-centimeters or less is suitable for this purpose, it being
      understood that the degree of resistivity is not critical. In
      addition to being electroconductive, the injected water should
      have the proper mix of metal salts and other colloidal matter to
      make it compatible with the native formation 11. This will
      minimize or prevent swelling of certain clays which may be in the
      formation, thereby avoiding any severe reduction in permeability
      of the formation. In oil fields where natural formation water is
      readily available, it is preferable that such water be injected
      into the anode hole 14, thereby to minimize any disturbance to the
      chemical balance of the underground formation. Alternatively,
      surface water could be chemically treated to produce an equivalent
      hydrous electrolyte, i.e., a fluid of a composition having the
      essential characteristics (electroconduction and deflocculation
      properties) of the formation water. In either case, the injection
      water can also be treated if desired with chemical additives which
      have other beneficial affects such as enhancing oil production
      under the influence of the electric fields and current which will
      be present in the formation 11 between the anode 14 and the
      cathode 24.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing it will be seen that a supply of formation
      water (or equivalent) is maintained about and in contact with the
      anode 14. Injecting the water from the surface, by a process of
      regulated flow (see below), ensures that the anode is continuously
      immersed in a pressurized pool of this fluid. The pool of fluid
      surrounding the anode constitutes an electroconductive path
      between this electrode and the adjacent oil sand. If necessary to
      prevent collapse of the walls of the cavity 34, the anode can also
      be surrounded by an inert porous medium such as glass beads or
      coarse sand having more than approximately 10 percent openings. A
      desirable alternative is to dispose both the anode 15 and the
      outlet of the water duct 41 inside a tubular container or basket
      having sidewalls of porous, insulating material, whereby a
      backflow of oil and sand is effectively prevented and the stream
      of injected water is directed over a substantial portion of the
      surface of the anode body before dispersing to the adjacent region
      27 of the formation 11.<br>
      <br>
      In practicing our improved method of stimulating oil recovery, an
      electric potential is applied to the anode 15 so as to raise its
      voltage, with respect to the remote region 17 of the formation 11
      where the producing well 13 is located, to a relatively high level
      (i.e., of the order of several hundred to several thousand volts).
      Consequently current will flow through the formation 11 between
      the anode 15 and the producing well 13. The connate water in the
      intersticies of the oil sand initially provides a path for this
      current, and its temperature is raised thereby. Interstitial water
      typically constitutes only on the order of 15 percent of the
      formation 11 by volume, and the resistance of the conducting path
      through this formation will be much higher than that of the mass
      of saline water which immediately surrounds the anode 15 in the
      cavity 34. Nevertheless, because the current density in these
      conducting media is highest next to the relatively small surface
      area of the anode and decreases as an exponential function of the
      distance (radius) therefrom, a high percentage of the voltage drop
      between the anode and the ground is expected to be concentrated
      near the interface of the water mass and the adjoining
      oil-saturated region of the formation 11. As a result, a great
      deal of electric power dissipates in the vicinity of this
      interface, and the temperature of the pressurized water around the
      anode 15 will be raised appreciably. We contemplate a power input
      of the order of 25 to 1,000 kilowatts or more, which may heat the
      water in the cavity 34 to a temperature substantially in excess of
      250 DEG Fahrenheit. This hot water is maintained in a liquid state
      by appropriately regulating both its temperature and its pressure.
      For example, the hydrostatic pressure of a 2,000 foot column of
      water exceeds 900 p.s.i., and at this pressure water remains
      liquid to approximately 530 DEG F.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted at this point that the vertical column of
      saline water above the cavity 34 will not form a short circuit
      between the anode 15 and the metallic casing 28 of the anode hole
      14. This is because the water column is confined in a long, narrow
      space having a relatively small cross-sectional area. The
      dimensions of the insulating liner 31 through which the water is
      injected are selected so that the resistance of the confined
      water, if measured between the top of the anode 15 and the lower
      end of the casing 28, will be appreciably higher than the
      resistance of the conducting path through the oil sand between
      anode and cathode. Due to its close proximity to the source of
      heat, the bottom part of the insulating liner 31 is adventageously
      made of high-temperature material.<br>
      <br>
      Within the underground formation 11, the temperature of the oil
      regionadjoining the pressurized hot water in the cavity 34 is
      elevated by this source of heat, whereby both the viscosity of the
      oil and the resistivity of the oil bearing sand are reduced. As
      hot oil recedes from the anode 15, more conductive saline water
      fills the vacated space in the porous media. The heat dissipated
      per unit volume of saline water will decrease near the anode where
      the resistivity of the water has decreased due to the temperature
      increase. Thus a heat front advances toward the cathode and behind
      it displaced oil is replaced by hot injected water. Because a
      substantial portion of the impressed unidirectional voltage
      appears at this advancing interface heat is continuously generated
      electrically in the immediate vicinity of the front to maintain
      the action.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, our invention causes a stream of hot water and oil
      to flow in the formation 11 toward the producing well 13. This
      stream is driven by water injected into the anode hole 14, and it
      is guided toward the cathode by electro-osmosis. The latter effect
      can be attributed to a net movement of ions in the interstitial
      water under the influence of a unipolarity field. This
      electro-osmotic motive force supplements applied water pressure in
      the region between electrodes and promotes a migration of heating
      water from the cavity 34 through the porous oil sand to the
      producing well 13. In a given medium the volume flow of water due
      to electro-osmosis depends on the magnitude of current being
      conducted. Because the sand particles in the native formation 11
      are predominantly water wet and because the residual oil tends to
      adhere, by interfacial tension, to the contiguous water film on
      these particles, this electro-osmotic mode of transporting water
      through the capillaries and crevices of the oil sand is
      particularly effective in achieving the desired result of
      transferring heat and motion to the residual oil.<br>
      <br>
      Some of the electric energy supplied to the electrodes in our
      invention will be utilized to liberate hydrogen from the water in
      the pool 26 at the bottom of the producing well 13. This
      electro-chemical action is well known as electrolysis. Because the
      formation 11 is not homogeneous, there are anomalies in its
      conductivity that form a series of local anodes and cathodes
      between the main electrodes 15 and 24. Consequently, hydrogen and
      other gases will be electrolytically released throughout the
      formation. Some of the gasses, such as chlorine, will chemically
      react to form certain beneficial acids which promote formation of
      appropriate porosity and fluid flow in the oil sand. The union of
      hydrogen and warm oil may partially hydrogenate the oil that is
      extracted from the formation 11 thereby improving the grade and
      the value of the recovered oil. Furthermore, the unipolarity
      electric field between the main electrodes may raise the peak
      kinetic energy of mobile charged particles in some areas of the
      underground formation to a sufficiently high level to produce
      fractional distillation and further upgrading of the oil in situ.
      Gasses thus liberated and not absorbed or reacted may accumulate
      in higher strata and develop pressure which supplements other
      forces driving oil toward the well 13.<br>
      <br>
      In the cavity 34 electrolytic action contributes to a hostile
      environment for the anode 15 and associated parts of the apparatus
      disposed at the bottom of the anode hole. In operation oxygen and
      other corrosive gases and chemicals are liberated at the anode.
      Electrolytic action will tend to deplate or consume certain
      positively energized metals. Therefore care should be exercised in
      designing the anode 15 so that its surface, which is the only
      exposed conductor in the bottom of the anode hole 14, will resist
      both chemical and galvanic corrosion.<br>
      <br>
      To ensure a sound mechanical and electrical connection between the
      cable 35 and the anode 15 under the foregoing difficult conditions
      and in the high-pressure ambient at the contemplated depth of the
      anode hole, it is believed desirable that the cable be inserted,
      as by a threaded conducting plug connection, into a recess in the
      anode. The lower section of the cable and the juncture of the plug
      and the anode should then be covered with insulation which has
      adequate dielectric strength and is impervious to oxygen and other
      deleterious chemicals. There is a possibility that a high pressure
      differential between the exterior surface and the interior recess
      of the anode may damage the anode. To protect the interior surface
      of the anode it is desirable to fill any voids in the anode recess
      with suitable high gravity electroconductive liquid and to close
      the recess with a pressure-equalizing seal. The exterior surface
      of the anode body should be the only part of the apparatus from
      which current enters the surrounding saline water, and it is
      resistant to chemical attack and deplating.<br>
      <br>
      An electric power supply suitable for energizing the anode 15 has
      been shown in FIG. 3. The availability of three-phase a-c
      high-voltage service is assumed, and in FIG. 3 this service is
      illustrated symbolically at 60. The high voltage is fed to the
      primary windings of a power transformer 61 through a conventional
      circuit breaker 62 which is equipped with an operating mechanism
      63 for opening and closing the primary circuit on command. The
      secondary circuit of the power transformer 61 is connected to a
      controlled converter which is constructed and arranged to apply
      across the conductors 35 and 42 a unipolarity output voltage of
      controllable magnitude. The illustrated converter comprises an
      adjustable autotransformer 64 in series with a high-power
      rectifier 65. The average magnitude of its output voltage can be
      varied from a few hundred volts to thousands of volts. This can be
      done manually or, if desired, automatically by suitable means well
      known in the pertinent electrical art.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the load on the power supply 38 is expected to vary
      after the anode 15 is first energized. The resistivity of the
      saline water tends to decrease with increasing temperature in the
      formation 11. The presently preferred mode of controlling the
      electric power and water inputs of our process will now be
      explained. The magnitude of current in the cable 35 is regulated
      by suitably adjusting or programming the applied voltage. In this
      way the electric current between anode and cathode can be held at
      a desirable preset level. To prevent excessive heating of the
      anode itself, the electroconductive fluid supplied through the
      anode hole 14 is suitably controlled so as to vary the value of
      its volume rate of flow as a function of the electric energy
      dissipated underground. This can be accomplished, for example, by
      employing appropriate means for controlling the rate of flow of
      the injected fluid in accordance with the product of the magnitude
      of applied voltage and the magnitude of anode-to-cathode current,
      whereby the desired rate of fluid flow is determined by the amount
      of input power. As the input power increases, so does the quantity
      of injected fluid thereby beneficially increasing the cooling
      effect on the anode 15. A maximum pressure override should also be
      provided to prevent excessive underground pressure which might
      fracture the formation 11.<br>
      <br>
      For optimum utilization of the input power without excessive
      heating, it may be desirable to open the circuit breaker 62 for a
      certain interval or intervals of time during which oil can
      continue flowing in the oil-bearing formation due to the energy
      retained therein. If and when the primary circuit is deenergized,
      a low-voltage (e.g., 12 volts) positive bias is preferably
      maintained on the anode 15 to minimize adverse galvanic action in
      the anode hole, and toward this end a battery 66 is connected in
      series with an isolating diode 67 across the output terminals of
      the rectifier 65. To recharge the battery 67, it is connected to a
      conventional battery charger 68 which is coupled to a suitable
      source 69. This positive bias means, which is not our joint
      invention, is more fully described and is claimed by C.H. Titus
      and H.N. Schneider in a copending patent application Ser. No.
      117,488 filed on Feb. 22, 1971 assigned to the assignee of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      It may be advantageous to reverse from time to time the
      unipolarity voltage applied between the cables 35 and 42. Toward
      this end, suitable reversing means is optionally provided. By way
      of example, FIG. 3 shows a polarity reversing switch 70 between
      the rectifier 65 and the cables, with the position of this switch
      being controlled as desired by an associated mechanism 71.
      Ordinarily the reversing cycle would be asymmetrical so that there
      is a net electroosmotic movement of water through the oil sand in
      the direction of the producing well 13. The reactance of the cable
      35 in the anode hole 14 will not seriously impede the flow of
      current through this path so long as either direct current or
      low-frequency reversible current is being supplied. In view of
      these alternative modes of practicing our invention, the terms
      "d-c" and "unipolarity" are meant herein to apply to quantities
      whose direction of influence can be reversed during or after a
      cycle of operation of our process without reducing to zero the
      average influence of the quantity in that direction during that
      cycle.<br>
      <br>
      When our process is operated in either the discontinuous power
      mode or the reverse polarity mode described in the preceding two
      paragraphs, respectively, it is possible to use the anode hole as
      a producing well for extracting oil from the proximate region 27
      of the formation 11. Furthermore, it is possible to use our
      invention to recover oil from a subterranean formation in a
      push-pull fashion where there is only a single borehole
      communicating with the surface of the ground.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 shows an alternative arrangement for joining the two
      sections 40 and 41 of the tubing string in the anode hole 14. In
      FIG. 4 the lowest part of the upper section 40' of the tubing
      string is secured in side-by-side relation to the top part 41' of
      the lower section, and these parts are respectively provided with
      registering slots 70 and 71 which permit the injected water to
      flow from the section 40' into part 41'. The bottom of section 40'
      is closed by a suitable plug 72 as shown. The top of part 41' is
      provided with a packing gland for admitting the cable 35. As is
      shown in FIG. 4, this gland includes cooperating threaded sleeves
      73 and 74 between which the shoulders of a pair of tubular metal
      clamps 75 and 76 are captured. The insulated cable 35 passes
      vertically through this assembly, and its lower portion is
      therefore disposed inside the lower section of the tubing string.
      At an elevation below what is shown in the fragmentary view of
      FIG. 4, the metal part 41' is connected to an insulating tube, and
      the metal clamp 75 is terminated. There are two principal
      advantages of this "Zee" assembly. It protects the cable 35 from
      damage during installation of the anode 15, and it directs the
      injected water around the lower portion of the cable 35 and
      directly over the top of the anode 15 for improved cooling of the
      surfaces of these conductors. The Zee assembly is more fully
      described and is claimed by C.H. Titus and H. N. Schneider in U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,674,912 filed Feb. 22, 1971 and assigned to the same
      assignee as is the present application.<br>
      <br>
      At FIG. 5 we have illustrated schematically a modified form of
      apparatus whereby our invention may be practiced in a particular
      embodiment made available when all or a portion of the reservoir
      of oil in an oil bearing formation lies under a body of water, and
      in particular under saline water, as offshore under the sea. In
      the embodiment there illustrated the earth structure including an
      oil bearing formation 11 is shown in substantially the same manner
      as at FIG. 2 except that part of stratum formation 11 lies under a
      body of seawater 80. At FIG. 5 the anode hole 14 is located in a
      region 27' of the stratum formation 11 which is laterally
      contiguous to but beyond the body or reservoir of oil 81 contained
      in the formation and below an off-shore area of the earth's
      surface. The electric power source 38 and pump 43 associated with
      the anode hole are mounted on a sea platform 82 and the anode hole
      casing 28 extends to the platform.<br>
      <br>
      The water inlet to the pump 43 is shown connected to the seawater
      80 as a supply reservoir, but it will be understood that other
      appropriate sources of water for injection may be used, as
      described heretofore. If seawater is used it may require certain
      chemical additives of the type previously mentioned, but due to
      its accessibility to an offshore anode hole it is to be preferred.
      Use of seawater in an offshore anode region offers the further
      advantage that hydrostatic pressure of the sea itself may be used
      in place of the pump 43 to supply the added pressure required to
      inject water at the anode cavity. To illustrate such a water
      supply source we have shown two water inlet valves 85 and 86
      located on the anode casing 14 at different depths beneath the
      surface of the sea 80. A selected one of these valves may be
      opened (with the pump shut down) to admit sea water at a desired
      pressure to the anode cavity. Any desired number of such inlet
      valves may be provided at different pressure levels.<br>
      <br>
      The producing well 13 at FIG. 5 is shown in an onshore location
      with metal liner 24 electrically connected to ground and through a
      cable 42 to the negative terminal of the d-c supply source 38, as
      at FIG. 2. While this well is shown as penetrating the oil body
      81, it will now be understood that if desired it may be located
      initially beyond the body of oil 81 between the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      In summary it will be seen that we have marshalled a number of
      different forces toward the desired end of efficiently utilizing
      bulk electric power to increase the amount and the value of oil
      extracted from underground reservoirs. While most useful in
      combination, all of these forces do not necessarily have to be
      employed in concert to obtain satisfactory results.<br>
      <br>
      In spite of the high potential contemplated at the anode 15, the
      voltage gradient near the surface 12 of the ground will be small
      or negligible. Therefore our invention can be practiced safely.
      Where necessary, conventional cathodic protection can be used to
      retard corrosion of underground pipe lines, if any, in the
      vicinity of the surface.<br>

          [0002] The invention is related to the well services in
          oil-field industry, particularly, to the methods for
          increasing permeability of a near-wellbore zone of a formation
          by stimulation of a fluid inflow into a wellbore.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          [0003] A stimulation of a fluid inflow into a wellbore is
          required to recover and improve the near-wellbore zone
          filtration characteristics, basically through improved
          permeability of the near-wellbore zone and reduced fluid
          viscosity. Among the most efficient methods of the stimulation
          of fluids' influx from a formation are acid treatment and
          formation hydraulic fracturing (see, for example, V.I.
          Kudinov, Osnovy neftegazopromyslovogo dela ( Foundations of
          Oil and Gas Formation Industry), Moscow, 2005, pp. 428-429).
          Acid treatment and formation hydraulic fracturing enable
          stimulation of a fluid inflow into a wellbore by creating
          high-permeable paths for the fluid inflow into the wellbore
          hereby the selection of a specific treatment method and a
          quality of the works completed are critical for the efficiency
          of the future well operation. Thus, incorrectly performed
          fluid inflow stimulation may, for example, result in the need
          to completely stop the future wellbore operation. To intensify
          the fluid inflow during the matrix treatment and formation
          hydraulic fracturing various liquid and solid chemicals are
          injected into a wellbore. Thus, during hydraulic fracturing
          various substances are injected into a wellbore under large
          pressure which results in cracks in the rock. To prevent a
          closure of the cracks in the rock solid particles are injected
          into the wellbore using a viscous gel—propping agent
          (proppant). Due to high viscosity of the gel the crack becomes
          low-permeable and to improve its permeability, as a rule,
          reverse recirculation is used. To reduce the gel viscosity
          different chemicals—breakers—are added to the solution and,
          when penetrating the formation, they can reduce the gel
          viscosity. The chemicals being added are, as a rule,
          expensive, but not always efficient. Besides, engineers
          normally are not able to impact the breakers' activity after
          the chemicals have been injected into the wellbore. Therefore,
          among the key disadvantages of the existing methods for
          increasing the near-wellbore zone permeability are high costs,
          low speed and inability to monitor the reaction speed after
          the chemicals have been injected into the wellbore.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] The proposed method provides for increased reliability
          and efficiency of stimulating a fluid inflow into a wellbore,
          enhanced speed of stimulating with simultaneous reduction of
          the risk of incorrect performing thereof as well as reduced
          costs.<br>

          <b>SUMMARY</b><br>

          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
          <br>
          [0013] The proposed method is based on applying an electric
          field to a formation in which stimulation of a fluid inflow is
          performed. The effect of the electrical stimulation depends on
          physical parameters of the formation and is determined by
          positioning of electrodes, value and frequency of the electric
          field being created as well as a power of a power supply being
          used. The electric impact causes enhancement of
          physico-chemical processes in the formation and in space
          inside a wellbore during the stimulation of a fluid inflow
          into the wellbore. Thus, for example, the electric field
          causes the appearance of electric currents as well as an
          electro-kinetic, phenomena like electroosmosis or
          electrophoresis. These phenomena result in the motion of
          charged particles and the fluid and therefore result in the
          intensification of current physico-chemical processes.
          Additional application of magnetic field promotes additional
          motion of the charged particles. Extra temperature heating
          also causes the intensification of physico-chemical processes
          in the area being heated through intensification of the
          substances' thermal diffusion. Additional acoustic impact
          using a sound-emitting device also enhances the
          physico-chemical processes due to additional oscillations of
          the particles caused by the sound wave passage. Hereby any of
          the impacts above may be applied locally or directionally
          which enables intensification of the physico-chemical
          processes (such as chemical reaction speed) in the required
          area.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] A system that allows to create an electric field inside
          a wellbore and a formation is shown on FIG. 1 where 1 is a
          current and voltage generator, 2—electrodes connected to the
          current and voltage generator 1, 3—a targeted zone of the
          formation in which stimulation of a fluid inflow is performed,
          chemicals have been injected into this targeted zone 3. For
          creating the electric field different combinations of
          electrodes positioning in the wellbore are possible, but at
          least one of the electrodes should be disposed in the wellbore
          at the level of the targeted zone 3 being treated. The other
          electrode may be located in an adjacent wellbore (see FIG. 1
          a) or on the surface (see FIG. 1 b). The electrodes may also
          be disposed in the wellbore above and below the targeted zone
          3 being treated (see FIG. 1 c). Casings and tubings may also
          be used as electrodes. A source of magnetic field can be
          placed into the wellbore at the level of the targeted zone 3
          being treated. If a sound emitting device and/or a thermal
          heater is used they also can be disposed in the wellbore at
          the level of the targeted zone 3 being treated. Different
          components of the instruments used may be located both on the
          same device and on different and their power may be supplied
          by a cable or by batteries or accumulators.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] As an example, three series of experiments were
          conducted in order to check the feasibility of described
          method. These experiments were carried out at room temperature
          22° C. (72° F.). For the first experiment 750 ml of YF130LGD
          gel was prepared and put into a tank with plane electrodes
          attached thereto. The electrodes were connected to a standard
          power generating unit with AC output of 100V at ̃50 Hz. The
          distance between the electrodes was about 10 cm. After 15
          minutes, only a slight gel destruction near the surface of the
          electrode was observed. That can be a result of local
          temperature increase up to 80° C. (180° F.) near the
          electrodes. The temperature was measured immediately after
          power was off.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] For the second experiment two samples of YF130LGD
          hydraulic-fracture gel were prepared (500 ml each) and 2 g of
          J218 breaker was added to each gel sample. J218 breaker
          concentration for YF130LGD gel destruction is about 10
          pounds/1000 gallons (1,2 kg/m3) that is two times lower than
          for carrying out this experiment. But it should be mentioned
          that the breaker operation temperature range is 52-107° C.
          (125-225° F.), moreover, the breaker is activated by adding
          special chemical catalysts. One sample of the prepared gel
          with the breaker portion was placed into a tank without
          electrodes and thoroughly mixed. The other sample was placed
          into the system with electrodes. After 7 minutes of AC
          applying it was detected that almost all gel (90%) in the tank
          under voltage was destroyed (the gel viscosity reduced to
          water viscosity value). In the tank without AC application
          only 10-15% gel was destroyed. During the second experiment
          the temperature value was 95° C. (200° F.) on the electrodes
          and 35° C. (95° F.) in the centre of the tank after 7 minutes
          of the AC impact.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] The third experiment was performed to prove that at
          high temperatures there will be no gel destructions. For this
          purpose 500 ml of YF130LGD gel mixed with 2 g of J218 breaker
          was prepared and placed into a pre-heated tank, and then into
          an oven at 100° C. (210° F.). After 15 minutes of the
          temperature action destruction of maximum 25-30% of gel was
          noted.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] Comparing the results of electrical field and
          temperature impact in presence of breaker, the advantage of
          the electrical field impact for the gel destruction becomes
          evident.<br>

        <b><b> </b>Method of Removing Hydrocarbons from Soil<br>
        </b><br>
        <div align="left">FIELD: oil pollution removal. SUBSTANCE:
          central and peripheral electrodes are plunged into soil at
          area to be cleaned and voltage gradient between electrodes is
          created. Then, nonpolluting liquid carrier is fed into the
          surface region around central electrode, which carrier moves
          under electroosmosis effect from central electrode toward
          peripheral electrodes and displaces hydrocarbons in soil that
          are removed from peripheral electrodes. As liquid carrier,
          water with pH 9 prepared by cavitation effect or water with pH
          5,5 prepared by heating is utilized. Utilization of water
          taken from bed in oil and gas deposit development is possible.
          EFFECT: enhanced cleaning efficiency due to accelerated
          movement of liquid carrier and reduced voltage gradient on
          electrodes.<br>
          <br>
          A method for cleaning sand from petroleum products is known
          (as. USSR N 1629102, MKI 5: B 03 V 5/00, C 01 B 33/12, pub.
          23.02.91 y. Bul-N-7-analogue.), Including sand treatment with
          an aqueous solution of hydrofluoric acid with a concentration
          of 0.5-2.0% by weight, with a ratio of the mass of solid soil
          to the liquid reagent as 1: (2-6) for 30 minutes.<br>
          <br>
          The main disadvantage of this method is sand treatment with a
          chemical reagent, for neutralization it is necessary to add
          additional reagents and remove the reaction products of these
          reagents, which entails additional economic costs and does not
          increase the ecology of the cleaned sandy soil.<br>
          <br>
          The closest in technical essence to the proposed invention is
          the method for removing contaminated soil (U.S. Patent No.
          5,415,7774 A, MKI 6: B 01 D 61/56, published, ISM, No. 001,
          No. 10, 1996, p. 34 - prototype ), Including immersion in the
          soil on the cleared area of ​​the central and peripheral
          electrodes, the creation of a voltage gradient between them,
          feeding the non-contaminating carrier fluid to the zone
          adjacent to the central one, moving the carrier fluid under
          the effect of the electroosmotic effect between the
          electrodes, displacing the carrier liquid of the contaminated
          Material from the soil to the peripheral electrodes and the
          removal of contaminated material from the latter.<br>
          <br>
          This method is more ecological than the analogue. However, the
          motion of pure carrier fluids of the water type under the
          action of the electroosmotic effect is not intensive, and it
          is further slowed down when the carrier fluid displaces such
          impurities as viscous hydrocarbons such as oil, engine oil and
          the like. Especially large resistance to the displacement of
          the carrier fluid with hydrocarbons occurs in the cold season,
          when the viscosity of the latter increases. Therefore, to
          ensure the movement of the carrier fluid and viscous
          hydrocarbons, it is necessary to maintain a high voltage
          gradient, on the order of 380-500 V, depending on the soil
          structure, which leads to high energy costs and makes this
          method ineffective.<br>
          <br>
          The purpose of the invention is to increase the efficiency of
          soil purification from hydrocarbons by accelerating the
          movement of the carrier fluid and reducing the voltage
          gradient at the electrodes.<br>
          <br>
          The aim is achieved by the fact that in a method for purifying
          soil from hydrocarbons including immersion in the soil on the
          cleaning portion of the central and peripheral electrodes,
          creating between the first and second voltage gradients,
          feeding into the region adjacent to the central electrode not
          contaminating the carrier fluid, Carrier under the action of
          the electroosmotic effect from the central electrode to the
          peripheral electrode, displacement of hydrocarbon from the
          soil by the carrier fluid and their removal from the
          peripheral electrodes, as Carrier liquids use water in which
          the pH is changed to 9 by applying cavitation to it, or up to
          5.5 by heating.<br>
          <br>
          The use of water as the carrier fluid, in which the pH is
          changed to 9, by applying it to cavitation, or up to 5.5 by
          heating, has made it possible to increase the efficiency of
          soil purification at any temperatures without the use of
          chemical reagents and their neutralization.<br>
          <br>
          The Applicant does not know how to purify soils that use water
          as the carrier fluid, in which the pH is changed to 9,
          influencing it by cavitation, or up to 5.5 by heating.<br>

          <br>
          The proposed method for cleaning soil from hydrocarbons is as
          follows.<br>
          <br>
          Due to the action of cavitation, the water molecules
          dissociate into H + and OH- ions. H + ions partially leave the
          liquid phase, and OH- ions accumulate in the latter, raising
          the pH of the water. In Fig. 1 is a graph of the pH change of
          distilled water and fresh water taken from different sources 2
          and 3, depending on the time of action of the cavitation.
          Water with an elevated pH has a high surface activity and has
          high detergent properties.<br>
          <br>
          Such water in contact with hydrocarbons - destroys the viscous
          surface film of hydrocarbons and intensively flushes them from
          the soil; - increases the dynamics of mixing of leachable
          hydrocarbons with them and forms an emulsion, which has a
          small hydraulic and low electrical resistance.<br>
          <br>
          These properties increase the mobility in the soil of the
          formed liquid system (emulsion) under the action of the
          electroosmotic effect, which ultimately leads to a reduction
          of the voltage between the electrodes to 60 V and the cost of
          electricity and, as a consequence, to an increase in the
          efficiency of the method for cleaning the soil of
          hydrocarbons.<br>
          <br>
          When the water is heated, its pH decreases and, as a result,
          its electrical conductivity increases. In Fig. 2 is a plot of
          the pH of water versus its temperature. As the pH of the water
          decreases, the solubility of hydrocarbons in it increases.<br>
          <br>
          Such water when in contact with hydrocarbons - reduces their
          surface tension and viscosity; - forms a mobile electrically
          conductive emulsion.<br>
          <br>
          These properties intensify the joint movement of water with
          hydrocarbons in the soil under the effect of the
          electroosmotic effect from the central electrode to the
          peripheral, which, as a consequence, leads to a decrease in
          the voltage between the electrodes to 60 V and the reduction
          of electricity costs and increases the efficiency of the
          method for cleaning the soil of hydrocarbons.<br>
          <br>
          The proposed method for cleaning soil from hydrocarbons is
          similar in its intensity to methods for cleaning soil using
          chemical reagents such as surfactants with pH 9 and acids pH
          5.5.<br>
          <br>
          However, this method is environmentally friendly, does not
          require additional costs for chemical reagents and for their
          neutralization.<br>
          Compared with the prototype, this method is more effective
          than the prototype for energy costs in 6-7 times.<br>
          [3]<br>
          <br>
          The method can be implemented with the apparatus shown in FIG.
          3. The installation consists of immersed in the soil in the
          cleaning area 1 of the central 2 and peripheral 3 electrodes,
          a water supply nozzle 4, a pump 5 serving to remove water from
          the peripheral electrodes with hydrocarbons, a separator 6 for
          separating water and hydrocarbons, a container 7 with a nozzle
          Venturi 8 and heater 9, a pump 10 for injecting water into the
          nozzles 4 and a Venturi nozzle 8. The separator 6 and the tank
          7 are connected by a pipeline through the water with a check
          valve 11. The container 7 is additionally connected to the
          nozzle 4 by a high-pressure water supply pipe 12 with a pH of
          5.5.<br>
          <br>
          An example of the execution of the method. Water with a
          temperature of 17 ° C, having a pH of 7.4, is supplied by a
          pump 10 from the tank 7 to the Venturi nozzle 8 at a speed of
          30 m / s. The pressure of water flowing through the diffuser
          of the Venturi 8 nozzle is reduced to 2 x 103 Pa. This causes
          cavitation of water. The cavitated liquid re-enters the vessel
          7. The water is cavitated in this manner for 520 s, after
          which the water in the vessel has a pH of 9. The obtained
          surface active water by the pump 10 is fed through the nozzle
          4 to the region adjacent to the central electrode 2. A voltage
          gradient of 60 V is created between the central and peripheral
          electrodes. Surface-active water with pH 9 under the action of
          the electroosmotic effect moves from the central electrode 2
          to the peripheral 3. At the same time, it contacts
          hydrocarbons that pollute the soil, destroys their surface
          film and intensively flushes them from the soil.
          Surface-active water with pH 9 with hydrocarbons forms an
          emulsion that enters the peripheral electrodes 3, from where
          it is removed by pump 5 and fed to separator 6.<br>
          <br>
          In the separator 6, the emulsion is divided into water at the
          bottom and hydrocarbons located at the top of the separator 6.
          The separated water enters the tank 7 through the check valve
          11. The separated hydrocarbons are sent to storage tanks.<br>
          <br>
          The described cycle is repeated until the hydrocarbons are
          completely removed from the soil. The process of cleaning the
          soil with surface active water obtained by cavitation is
          energetically beneficial at soil temperatures above 0oC.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of soil cleaning with a temperature below 0oC from
          hydrocarbons, this water is used with water at pH 5.5, which
          is obtained by heating to 240oC in tank 7 using a heater 9.
          When the water in the tank 7 is heated, the pressure rises to
          3.5 MPa. Under this pressure, water with a pH of 5.5 is fed,
          bypassing the pump 10, via the line 12 through the nozzle 4 to
          the work area 1. Further process of soil purification from
          hydrocarbons is carried out in a similar manner to the process
          described above.<br>

              It is known that when the carrier liquid is saturated with
              air in a ratio of 1: 6 (in our case), air bubbles are
              created in the liquid phase. Under the influence of an
              uneven electric field between the sharpened elements of
              the peripheral electrodes and the central electrode, air
              bubbles align along the lines of force of the field, then
              they elongate along the lines of force and decrease in the
              transverse direction. Compression of a bubble in the
              transverse direction means that compressive forces act
              near its equator. In this case, the air bubble behaves
              like a dielectric, the field inside it is slightly
              distorted. Further, it increases in all directions with

        <br>
        <div align="left">An electro-osmotic method for the production
          of hydrocarbons utilizes in situ heating of earth formations
          having substantial electrical conductivity. A particular

          and the row separation are chosen in reference to the deposit
          thickness to avoid heating barren layers. Electrical power is
          applied at no more than a relatively low frequency between
          respective rows of electrodes to deliver power to the
          formation while producing relatively uniform heating thereof
          and limiting the relative loss of heat to adjacent regions to

          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This invention relates generally to the exploitation of
          hydrocarbon-bearing formations having substantial electrical
          conductivity, such as tar sands and heavy oil deposits, by the
          application of electrical energy to heat the deposits. More
          specifically, the invention relates to the delivery of
          electrical power to a conductive formation at relatively low
          frequency or d.c., which power is applied between rows of
          elongated electrodes forming a waveguide structure bounding a
          particular volume of the formation, while at the same time the
          temperature of the electrodes is controlled.<br>
          <br>
          Materials such as tar sands and heavy oil deposits are
          amenable to heat processing to produce gases and hydrocarbons.
          Generally the heat develops the porosity, permeability and/or
          mobility necessary for recovery. Some hydrocarbonaceous
          materials may be recovered upon pyrolysis or distillation,
          others simply upon heating to increase mobility.<br>
          <br>
          Materials such as tar sands and heavy oil deposits are
          heterogeneous dielectrics. Such dielectric media exhibit very
          large values of conductivity, relative dielectric constant,
          and loss tangents at low temperature, but at high temperatures
          exhibit lower values for these parameters. Such behavior
          arises because in such media ionic conducting paths or layers
          are established in the moisture contained in the interstitial
          spaces in the porous, relatively low dielectric constant and
          loss tangent rock matrix. Upon heating, the moisture
          evaporates, which radically reduces the bulk conductivity,
          relative dielectric constant, and loss tangent to essentially
          that of the rock matrix.<br>
          <br>
          It has been known to heat electrically relatively large
          volumes of hydrocarbonaceous formations in situ. Bridges and
          Taflove U.S. Pat. No. Re. 30,738 discloses a system and method
          for such in situ heat processing of hydrocarbonaceous earth
          formations wherein a plurality of elongated electrodes are
          inserted in formations and bound a particular volume of a
          formation of interest. As used therein, the term "bounding a
          particular formation" means that the volume is enclosed on at
          least two sides thereof. The enclosed sides are enclosed in an
          electrical sense with a row of discrete electrodes forming a
          particular side. Electrical excitation between rows of such
          electrodes established electrical fields in the volume. As
          disclosed in such patent, the frequency of the excitation was
          selected as a function of the bounded volume so as to
          establish a substantially nonradiating electric field which
          was confined substantially in the volume. The method and
          system of the reissue patent have particular application in
          the radio-frequency heating of moderately lossy dielectric
          formations at relatively high frequency. However, it is also
          useful in relatively lossy dielectric formations where
          relatively low frequency electrical power is utilized for
          heating largely by conduction. The present invention is
          directed toward the improvement of such method and system for
          such heating of relatively conductive formations at relatively
          low frequency and to the application of such system for
          heating with d.c.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          For electrically heating conductive formations, it is
          desirable to utilize relatively low frequency electrical power
          or d.c. to achieve relatively uniform heating distribution
          along the line. At low frequency, it is necessary that
          conductive paths remain conductive between the subsurface
          electrodes and the formation being heated. It is also
          desirable to heat the formation as fast as possible in order
          to minimize heat outflow to barren regions. This presents
          certain inconsistent requirements, as fast heating requires a
          large amount of heat at the electrodes, and the resultant high
          temperatures boil away the water needed to maintain the
          conductive paths. On the other hand, if the heating proceeds
          slowly, excessive temperatures leading to vaporization of
          water and consequent loss of conductivity are avoided, but
          there is economically wasteful loss of heat to the barren
          formations in the extended time needed to heat the deposit of
          interest.<br>
          <br>
          It is a primary aspect of the present invention to provide
          compromises to best meet such disparate requirements in the in
          situ heating of earth formations having substantial
          conductivity. A waveguide structure as shown in the reissue
          patent is emplanted in the earth to bound a particular volume
          of an earth formation with a waveguide structure formed of
          respective rows of discrete elongated electrodes wherein the
          spacing between rows is greater than the distance between
          electrodes in a respective row and in the case of vertical
          electrodes substantially less than the thickness of the
          hydrocarbonaceous earth formation. Electrical power at no more
          than a relatively low frequency is applied between respective
          rows of the electrodes to deliver power to the formation while
          producing relatively uniform heating thereof and limiting the
          relative loss of heat to adjacent barren regions to less than
          a tolerable amount. At the same time the temperature of the
          electrodes is controlled near the vaporization point of water
          thereat to maintain an electrically conductive path between
          the electrodes and the formation. A d.c. polarized potential
          is applied to enhance flow of reservoir fluid toward at least
          one preselected electrode.<br>
          <br>
          A waveguide electrical array which employs a limited number of
          small diameter electrodes would be less expensive to install
          than an array using more electrodes but would result in excess
          electrode temperature and nonuniform heating and consequently
          inefficient use of electrical power. On the other hand, a
          dense array, that is, one in which the spacing s between rows
          is greater than the distance d between electrodes in a row,
          would be somewhat more costly, but would heat more uniformly
          and more rapidly and, therefore, be more energy efficient.<br>
          <br>
          A key to optimizing these conflicting factors is to control
          the temperature of the electrodes and the resource immediately
          adjacent the electrodes by properly selecting the deposit gas
          pressure, heating rates, heating time, final temperature,
          electrode geometry and positioning and/or cooling the
          electrodes.<br>
          <br>

          invention will become more apparent from the following
          detailed description, particularly when taken in conjunction

          <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 illustrate a system for heating conductive
          formations utilizing an array 10 of vertical electrodes 12,
          14, the electrodes 12 being grounded, and the electrodes 14
          being energized by a low frequency or d.c. source 16 of
          electrical power by means of a coaxial line 17. The electrodes
          12, 14 are disposed in respective parallel rows spaced a
          spacing s apart with the electrodes spaced apart a distance d
          in the respective rows. The electrode array 10 is a dense
          array, meaning that the spacing s between rows is greater than
          the distance d between electrodes in a row. The rows of
          electrodes 12 are longer than the rows of electrodes 14 to
          confine the electric fields and consequent heating at the ends
          of the rows of electrodes 14.<br>
          <br>
          The electrodes 12, 14 are tubular electrodes emplaced in
          respective boreholes 18. The electrodes may be emplaced from a
          mined drift 20 accessed through a shaft 22 from the surface 24
          of the earth. The electrodes 12 preferably extend, as shown,
          through a deposit 26 or earth formation containing the
          hydrocarbons to be produced. The electrodes 12 extend into the
          overburden 28 above the deposit 26 and into the underburden 30
          below the deposit 26. The electrodes 14, on the other hand,
          are shorter than the electrodes 12 and extend only part way
          through the deposit 26, short of the overburden 28 and
          underburden 30. In order to avoid heating the underburden and
          to provide the power connection, the lower portions of the
          electrodes 14 may be insulated from the formations by
          insulators 31, which may be air. The effective lengths of the
          electrodes 14 therefore end at the insulators 31.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 4 and 5 illustrate a system for heating conductive
          formations utilizing an array 32 of horizontal electrodes 34,
          36 disposed in vertically spaced parallel rows, the electrodes
          34 being in the upper row and the electrodes 36 in the lower
          row. The upper electrodes 34 are preferably grounded, and the
          lower electrodes 36 are energized by a low frequency or d.c.
          source 38 of electrical power. The electrodes 34, 36 are
          disposed in parallel rows spaced apart a spacing s, with the
          electrodes spaced apart a distance d in the respective rows.
          The electrode array 32 is also a dense array. The upper row of
          electrodes 34 is longer than the lower row of electrodes 36 to
          confine the electric fields from the electrodes 36. The
          electrodes 34 extend beyond both ends of the electrodes 36 for
          the same reason. Grounding the upper electrodes 34 keeps down
          stray fields at the surface 24 of the earth.<br>
          <br>
          The electrodes 34, 36 are tubular electrodes emplaced in
          respective boreholes 40 which may be drilled by well known
          directional drilling techniques to provide horizontal
          boreholes at the top and bottom of the deposit 26 between the
          overburden 28 and the underburden 30. Preferably the upper
          boreholes are at the interface between the deposit 26 and the
          overburden 28, and the lower boreholes are slightly above the
          interface between the deposit 26 and the underburden 30.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 6 illustrates a system comparable to that shown in FIGS.
          4 and 5 wherein the array is fed from both ends, a second
          power source 42 being connected at the end remote from the
          power source 38.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate a system comparable to that of FIGS.
          1, 2 and 3 with an array of vertical electrodes. In this
          system the rows of like electrodes 12, 14 are in spaced pairs
          to provide a low field region 44 therebetween that is not
          directly heated to any great extent.<br>
          <br>
          The deposit thickness h and the average or effective thermal
          diffusion properties determine the uniformity of the
          temperature distribution as a function of heating time t and
          can be generally described for any thickness of a deposit in
          the terms of a deposit temperature profile factor c, such that<br>
          c=kt/(h/2)@2<br>
          <br>
          where k is the thermal diffusivity. FIG. 9 presents a curve A
          showing the relationship between the factor c and the portion
          of a deposit above 80% of the temperature rise of the center
          of the deposit for a uniform heating rate through the heated
          volume. Note that at c=0.1, about 75% of the heated volume has
          a temperature rise greater than 80% of the temperature rise of
          the center of the heated volume.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 10 illustrates the heating profiles for three values of
          the factor c as a function of the distance from the center of
          the heated volume, the fraction of the temperature rise that
          would have been reached in the heated volume in the absence of
          heat outflow. Note that where c=0.1 or c=0.2, the total
          percentage of heat lost to adjacent formations is relatively
          small, about 10% to 15%. Where low final temperatures, e.g.,
          less than 100 DEG C., are suitable, c up to 0.3 can be
          accepted, as the heat lost, or extra heat needed to maintain
          the final temperature, is, while significant, economically
          acceptable. FIG. 9, curve B, showing percent heat loss as a
          function of the factor c, shows percent heat loss to be less
          than 25% at c=0.3. On the other hand, if higher temperatures
          (e.g., about 200 DEG C.) are desired to crack the bitumen,
          then higher central deposit temperatures above the design
          minimum are needed to process more of the deposit, especially
          if longer heating times are employed. Moreover, the heat
          outflows at these higher temperatures are more economically
          disadvantageous. Thus a temperature profile factor of c less
          than about 0.15 is required. In general the heating rate
          should be great enough that c is less than 30 times the
          inverse of the ultimate increase in temperature AT in degrees
          celsius of the volume:<br>
          c.ltoreq.0.3(100/.DELTA.T)<br>
          <br>
          The lowest values of c are controlled more by the excess
          temperature of electrodes and are discussed below.<br>
          <br>
          The electrode spacing distance d and diameter a are determined
          by the maximum allowable electrode temperature plus some
          excess if some local vaporization of the electrolyte and
          connate water can be tolerated. In a reasonably dense array,
          the hot regions around the electrodes are confined to the
          immediate vicinity of the electrodes. On the other hand, in a
          sparse array, where s is no greater than d, the excess heat
          zone comprises a major portion of the deposit.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 11 illustrates a grossly excessive heat build-up on the
          electrodes as compared to the center of the deposit for a
          sparse array. In this example row spacing s was 10 m,
          electrode spacing d 10 m, electrode diameter a 0.8 m, and
          thermal diffusivity 10@-6 m@2 /s, with no fluid flow.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 12 shows how the electrode temperature can be reduced by
          the use of a dense array. In this example row spacing s was 10
          m, electrode spacing d 4 m, electrode diameter a 0.8 m, and
          thermal diffusivity 10@-6 m@2 /s, with no fluid flow.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 13 illustrates the effect of decreasing the diameter of
          the electrodes of the dense array of FIG. 12 such that the
          temperature of the electrode is increased somewhat more
          relative to the main deposit. In this example row spacing s
          was 10 m, electrode spacing d 4 m, electrode diameter a 0.35
          m, and thermal diffusivity 10@-6 m@2 /s, with no fluid flow.
          The region of increased temperature is confined to the
          immediate vicinity of the electrode and does not constitute a
          major energy waste. Thus, varying the electrode separation
          distance d and the diameter of the electrode a permit
          controlling the temperature of the electrode either to prevent
          vaporization or excessive vaporization of the electrolyte in
          the borehole and connate water in the formations immediately
          adjacent the electrode.<br>
          <br>
          The electrode spacing d and diameter a are chosen so that
          either electrodetemperature is comparable to the vaporization
          temperature, or if some local vaporization is tolerable (as
          for a moderately dense array), the unmodified electrode
          temperature rise without vapor cooling will not significantly
          exceed the vaporization temperature.<br>
          <br>
          The means for providing water for both vaporization and for
          maintenance of electrical conduction is shown in the drawings,
          particularly in FIG. 3 for vertical electrodes and in FIG. 4
          for horizontal electrodes. As shown in FIG. 3, a reservoir 46
          of aqueous electrolyte provides a conductive solution that may
          be pumped by a flow regulator and pump 47 down the shaft 22
          and up the interior of the electrodes 12 and into the spaces
          between the electrodes 12 and the formation 26. A vapor relief
          pipe 48, together with a pressure regulator and pump 50
          returns excess electrolyte to the reservoir 46 and assures
          that the electrolyte always covers the electrodes 12.
          Similarly, a reservoir 52 provides such electrolyte down the
          shaft 22, whence it is driven by a pressure regulator and pump
          53 up the interior of the electrodes 14 and into the spaces
          between the electrodes 14 and the formation 26. In this case
          the electrodes are energized and not at ground potential. The
          conduits 54 carrying the electrolyte through the shaft 22 are
          therefore at the potential of the power supply and must be
          insulated from ground, as is the reservoir 52. The conduits 54
          are therefore in the central conductor of the coaxial line 17.
          The electrodes 14 have corresponding vapor relief pipes 56 and
          a related pressure regulator and pump 58.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in FIG. 4, electrolyte is provided as needed from
          reservoirs 60, 61 to the interior tubing 62 which also acts to
          connect the power source 38 to the respective electrodes 34,
          36, the tubing being insulated from the overburden 28 and the
          deposit 26 by insulation 64. The electrolyte goes down the
          tubing 62 to keep the spaces between the respective electrodes
          34, 36 and the deposit 26 full of conductive solution during
          heating. The tubing to the lower electrode 36 may later be
          used to pump out the oil entering the lower electrode, using a
          positive displacement pump 66.<br>
          <br>
          In either system, the electrolyte acts as a heat sink to
          assure cool electrodes and maintain conductive paths between
          the respective electrodes and the deposit. The water in the
          electrolyte may boil and thereby absorb heat to cool the
          electrodes, as the water is replenished.<br>
          <br>
          The vaporization temperature is controlled by the maximum
          sustainable pressure of the deposit. Typically for shallow to
          moderate depth deposits the gauge pressure can range from a
          few psig to 300 psig with a maximum of about 1300 psig for
          practical systems. The tightness of adjacent formations also
          influences the maximum sustainable vapor pressure. In some
          cases, injection of inert gases to assist in maintaining
          deposit pressure may be needed.<br>
          <br>
          Another way to keep the electrodes cool is to position the
          electrodes adjacent a reduced field region on one side of an
          active electrode row. This reduces radically the heating rate
          in the region of the diminished field, thus creating in effect
          a heat sink which radically reduces the temperature of the
          electrodes, in the limiting case to about half the temperature
          rise of the center portion of the deposit.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, in the case of vertical arrays,
          pairs of electrodes 12, 14 can be installed from the same
          drift and the same potential is applied to each pair, thus the
          regions 44 between the pairs become low field regions. By
          proper selection of heating rates and pair separation, it is
          possible to control the temperature of the electrode at
          slightly below that for the center of the deposit. The
          thickness of the cool wall region 44 can be sufficiently thin
          that the cool wall region can achieve about 90% of the maximum
          deposit temperature via thermal diffusion from the heated
          volume after the application of power has ended.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 in the case of a horizontally
          enlarged biplate, a nearly zero field region exists on the
          barren side of the row of grounded upper electrodes 34 and a
          nearly zero field region exists on the barren side of the row
          of energized electrodes 36. Such low field regions act as the
          regions 44 in the system shown in FIGS. 7 and 8.<br>
          <br>
          The arrangement of FIGS. 4, 5 and 6 with the upper electrodes
          grounded is superior to other arrangements of horizontal
          electrodes in respect to safety. No matter how the biplate
          rows are energized and grounded (such as upper electrode
          energized and lower electrode grounded, vice versa or both
          symmetrically driven in respect to ground) leakage currents
          will flow near the surface 24 that may be small but
          significant in respect to safety and equipment protection.
          These currents will create field gradients which, although
          small, can be sufficient to develop hazardous potentials on
          surface or near-surface objects 68, such as pipelines, fences
          and other long metallic structures, or may destroy operation
          of above-ground electrical equipment. To mitigate such
          effects, ground mats can be employed near metallic structures
          to assure zero potential drops between any metallic structures
          likely to be touched by anyone.<br>
          <br>
          These safety ground mats as well as electrical system grounds
          will collect the stray current from the biplate array. These
          grounds then serve in effect as additional ground electrodes
          of a line. Leakage currents between the grounding apparatus at
          the surface and the biplate array also heat the overburden,
          especially if the uppermost row is excited and the deposit is
          shallow. Thus biplate arrays, although having two sets of
          electrodes of large areal extent, also implicitly contain a
          third but smaller set of electrodes 68 near the surface at
          ground potential. Although this third set of electrodes
          collects diminished currents, the design considerations
          previously discussed to prevent vaporization of water in the
          earth adjacent the other electrodes must also be applied.<br>
          <br>
          The near surface ground currents are minimized if the upper
          electrodes 34 are grounded and the lower electrodes 36 are
          energized. Also the grounded upper electrodes 34 can be
          extended in length and width to provide added shielding. This
          requires placing product collection apparatus at the potential
          of the energized lower set of electrodes by means of isolation
          insulation. However, this arrangement reduces leakage energy
          losses as compared to other electrodes energizing
          arrangements. Such leakage currents tend to heat the
          overburden 28 between the row of upper electrodes 34 and the
          above-ground system 68, giving rise to unnecessary heat
          losses.<br>
          <br>
          Short heating times stress the equipment, and therefore, the
          longest heating times consistent with reasonable heat losses
          are desirable. This is especially true for the horizontal
          biplate array. The conductors of an array in the biplate
          configuration, especially if it is fairly long, will inject or
          collect considerable current. The amount of current at the
          feed point will be proportional to the product of the
          conductor length l, the distance d between electrodes within
          the row, and the current density J needed to heat the deposit
          to the required temperature in time t. Thus the current I per
          conductor becomes at the feed point (assuming small
          attenuation along the line):<br>
          I=(J) (l) (d) ##EQU1## where<br>
          <br>
          .sigma. is the conductivity of the reservoir and
          joules-to-heat is the energy required to heat a cubic meter to
          the desired temperature. Thus the current carrying requirement
          of the conductors at the feed points is reduced by increasing
          the heat up time t as determined by the maximum allowable
          temperature profile factor c and deposit thickness h. Further,
          making the array more dense, that is, decreasing d, also
          reduces the current carrying requirements as well as
          decreasing l. If conductor current at the feed point is
          excessive, heat will be generated in the electrode due to I@2
          R losses along the conductor. The power dissipated in the
          electrode due to I@2 R losses can significantly exceed the
          power dissipated in the reservoir immediately adjacent the
          electrode. This can cause excessive heating of the electrode
          in addition to the excess heat generated in the adjacent
          formation due to the concentration of current near the
          electrode. Thus another criterion is that the I@2 R conductor
          losses not be excessive compared to the power dissipated in
          the media due to narrowing of the current flow paths into the
          electrodes. Also the total collected current should not exceed
          the current carrying rating of the cable feed systems.<br>
          <br>
          Another cause of excess temperature of the electrodes over
          that for the deposit arises from fringing fields near the
          sides of the row of excited electrodes. Here the outermost
          electrodes (in a direction transverse to the electrode axis)
          carry additional charges and currents associated with the
          fringing fields. As a consequence, both the adjacent reservoir
          dissipation and I@2 R longitudinal conductor losses will be
          significantly increased over those experienced for electrodes
          more centrally located. To control the temperature of these
          outermost electrodes, several methods can be used, including:
          (1) increasing the density of the array in the outermost
          regions, (2) relying on additional vaporization to cool these
          electrodes, and (3) the enlarging the diameter of these
          electrodes. Some cooling benefit will also exist for the
          cool-wall approach, especially in the case of the vertical
          electrode arrays if an additional portion of the deposit can
          be included in the reduced field region near the outermost
          electrodes. Applying progressively smaller potentials as the
          outermost electrodes are neared is another option.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of the biplate array, especially if it extends a
          great length into the deposit, such as over 100 m, special
          attention must be given to the path losses along the line. To
          alleviate the effects of such attenuation, the line may be fed
          from both ends, as shown in FIG. 6. At the higher frequencies,
          these are frequency dependent and are reduced as the frequency
          is decreased. Perhaps not appreciated in earlier work, is that
          there is a limit to how much the path attenuation can be
          reduced by lowering the frequency. The problem is aggravated
          because, as the deposit is heated, it becomes more conducting.<br>
          <br>
          A buried biplate array or triplate array exhibits a path loss
          attenuation .alpha. of<br>
          .alpha.=8.7[(R+j.omega.L)(G+j.omega.C)]@1/2 dB/m<br>
          <br>
          where<br>
          <br>
          R is the series resistance per meter of the buried line, which
          includes an added resistance contribution from skin effects in
          the conductor, if present,<br>
          <br>
          L is the series inductance per meter of the buried line,<br>
          <br>
          G is the shunt conductance over a meter for the line and is
          directly proportional to .sigma., the conductivity of the
          deposit,<br>
          <br>
          C is the shunt capacitance over a meter for the line. Where
          conduction currents dominate, G&gt;&gt;j.omega.c, so that the
          attenuation .alpha. becomes<br>
          .alpha.=8.7[(R+j.omega.L)(G)]@1/2 dB/m<br>
          <br>
          If the frequency .omega. is reduced, j.omega.L is radically
          reduced, R is partially decreased (owing to a reduction in
          skin effect loss contribution) and G tends to remain more or
          less constant. Eventually, as frequency .omega. is decreased,
          R&gt;&gt;j.omega.L, usually at a near zero frequency
          condition, so that<br>
          .alpha.=8.7[(R)(G)]@1/2 dB/m<br>
          <br>
          If thin wall steel is used as the electrode material,
          unacceptable attenuation over fairly long path lengths could
          occur, especially at the higher temperatures where conductance
          G and conductivity .sigma. are greater. If thin walled copper
          or aluminum is used for electrodes (these may be clad with
          steel to resist corrosion), the near zero-frequency
          attenuation can be acceptably reduced so that<br>
          .alpha.l=8.7[(R)(G)]@1/2 (l).ltoreq.2dB<br>
          <br>
          for the single end feed of FIG. 4 and less than 8 dB for the
          double end feed of FIG. 6.<br>
          <br>
          When d.c. power is applied, advantage may be taken of
          electro-osmosis to promote the production of liquid
          hydrocarbons. In the case of electro-osmosis, water and
          accompanying oil drops are usually attracted to the negative
          electrodes. The factors affecting electro-osmosis are
          determined in part by the zeta potentials of the formation
          rock, and in some limited cases the zeta potentials may be
          such that water and oil are attracted to the positive
          potential electrodes.<br>
          <br>
          Electro-osmosis can also be used to cause slow migration of
          the reservoir water toward one of the sets of electrodes
          preferentially. This preferential migration will be toward the
          cathode for typical reservoirs. However, depending upon the
          salinity of the reservoir fluids and the mineralogy of the
          reservoir matrix, the net movement under application of d.c.
          can be toward the anode. Remote ground can be used as an
          opposing electrode to facilitate this. This can be used to
          replenish conductivity in formations around the desired
          electrodes of sets of electrodes by resaturating the formation
          using reservoir fluids. This will permit resumption of
          heating.<br>
          <br>
          In some cases, the presence of water fills the available pore
          spaces and thereby suppresses the flow of oil. Also in the
          case of a heavy oil deposit, influx of water from the lower
          reaches of the deposit may reach the producing electrodes such
          as electrodes 36 (FIG. 6). Therefore, in some cases it may be
          desirable to place a potential onto both sets of electrodes
          34, 36 such that water is drawn away from the array. This may
          be done by modifying the source 38 such that the ground
          electrode array 68 near the surface is placed at a negative
          potential with respect to the entire set of deep electrodes
          34, 36.<br>
          <br>
          D.C. power applied for electro-osmosis can cause anodic
          dissolution of the metal electrodes, and hence, it will be
          preferable to keep the d.c. power levels just high enough to
          cause migration of fluids. Such required d.c. power can either
          be added as a bias to a.c. power which provides the bulk of
          the energy required to heat the formation or be applied
          intermittently.<br>
          <br>
          While the use of electro-osmotic effects to enhance recovery
          from single wells or pairs of wells has been described, the
          employment of the dense array offers unique features
          heretofore unrecognized. For example, in the case of a pair of
          electrodes widely separated, the direct current emerges
          radially or spherically from the electrode. The radially
          divergent current produces a radially divergent electric
          field, and since the electro-osmotic effect is proportional to
          the electric field, the beneficial effects of electro-osmosis
          are evident only very near the electrode. Furthermore, the
          amount of current which can be introduced by an electrode is
          restricted by vaporization consideration or, if the deposit is
          pressurized, by a high temperature coking condition which may
          plug the producing capillary paths. On the other hand, with
          the arrangement of the present invention, the large electrode
          surface area and the controlled temperature below the
          vaporization point allows substantially more d.c. current to
          be introduced. Further, the effects of electro-osmosis are
          felt throughout the deposit, as uniform current flow and
          electric fields are established throughout the bulk of the
          deposit. Thus an electro-osmotic fluid drive phenomenon of
          substantial magnitude can be established throughout the
          deposit which can substantially enhance the production rates.<br>
          <br>
          Further, electrolyte fluids will be drawn out of the
          electrodes which are not used to collect the water. Therefore,
          means to replace this electrolyte must be provided.<br>
          <br>
          Production of liquid hydrocarbons using electro-osmosis can
          also be practiced in combination with conventional recovery
          techniques such as gravity drainage. Electro-osmosis can be
          used to increase the rate of production of liquid hydrocarbons
          by gravity drainage. For example, the polarity of the
          electrode rows shown in FIG. 5 can be so chosen such that
          reservoir water will slowly move toward the upper row of
          electrodes 34. This will cause a simultaneous increase in
          saturation of hydrocarbons toward the bottom row of electrodes
          36. The rate of flow of hydrocarbons toward these bottom
          electrodes 36 is directly proportional to the permeability of
          the formation near the electrodes to flow of hydrocarbons.
          This in turn increases with increase in hydrocarbon
          saturation. Thus, the rate of hydrocarbon production can be
          increased by forcing the reservoir water to move toward the
          upper part of the formation by electro-osmosis.<br>
          <br>
          Although various preferred embodiments of the present
          invention have been described in some detail, various
          modifications may be made therein within the scope of the
          invention.<br>
          <br>
          Several methods of production are possible beyond the unique
          features of electro-osmosis. Typically, the oil can be
          recovered via gravity or autogenously generated vapor drives
          into the perforated electrodes, which can serve as product
          collection paths. Provision for this type of product
          collection is illustrated in FIG. 4, where a positive
          displacement pump 66 located in the lowest level of electrode
          36 can be used to recover the product. Product can be
          collected in some cases during the heat-up period. For
          example, in FIG. 4 the reservoir fluids will tend to collect
          in the lower electrode array. If those are produced during
          heating, those fluids can provide an additional or substitute
          means to control the temperature of the lower electrode. On
          the other hand, it may not be desirable to produce a deposit,
          if in situ cracking is planned, until the final temperature is
          reached.<br>
          <br>
          Various "hybrid" production combinations may be considered to
          produce the deposit after heating. These could include
          fire-floods, steam floods and surfactant/polymer water floods.
          In these cases, one row of electrodes can be used for fluid
          injections and the adjacent row for fluid/product recovery.<br>
          <br>
          In contrast with polarizing the electrodes so as to suppress
          the production of water, the electro-osmotic forces can be
          used as a drive mechanism which exists volumetrically
          throughout the deposit for a fluid replacement type flood. The
          principal benefits of using the electro-osmotic drive in
          conjunction with the electrode arrays discussed here is that
          the volumetric drive can be maintained without excessive heat
          being developed near the electrode or without excessive
          electrolysis as might occur in a simple five-spot well
          arrangement.<br>
          <br>
          The fluids injected at the electrodes can contain surfactants
          such as long chain sulfonates or amines or polymers such as
          polyacrylamides. The presence of surfactants will reduce the
          interfacial tension between the injected fluids and the liquid
          hydrocarbons and will help in recovering the liquid
          hydrocarbons. Addition of polymers will increase the viscosity
          and cause an improvement in sweep efficiency. The applied d.c.
          power can act as the driving force for the migration of fluids
          toward the other set of eIectrodes, whereby the accompanying
          liquid hydrocarbons can be produced along with the drive
          fluid.<br>
          <br>
          The foregoing discussion, for simplicity, has limited
          consideration to either vertical or horizontal electrode
          arrays. However, arrays employed at an angle with respect to
          the deposit may be useful to minimize the number of drifts and
          the number of boreholes. In this case, the maximum row
          separation s is chosen to be midway between the vertical or
          horizontal situation, such that if largely vertical, the row
          separation s is not much greater than that found for the true
          vertical case. On the other hand, if the rows are nearly
          horizontal, then a value of s closer to that chosen for a
          horizontal array should be used.<br>

          <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          The present invention relates generally to the prevention of
          mineral scale deposition in a well bore, and more particularly
          to a method for electrokinetically preventing mineral scale
          deposition in oil well bores with the aid of DC electric
          current.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The waterflood, a secondary enhanced oil recovery
          process/&lt;11&gt; is a simple, low cost, and proven approach
          for pressure maintenance and for driving oil towards a
          production well.<br>
          <br>
          Though initial waterflooding attempts were used to rectify
          plugged wells or casing leaks, the apparent benefits led to
          broader applications &lt;pl&gt;. Waterflood efficiency depends
          on oil viscosity, permeability, wettability, structural
          considerations, uniformity of reservoir rock, and type of
          flood&lt;[2]&gt;. The volume of liquid produced partly
          determines the volume of water required for
          injection&lt;111&gt;. For economic reasons nearby seawater is
          commonly used, where available, as the injection water type to
          save money on water transportation. The mixing of incompatible
          injection seawater and formation water frequently produces
          mineral scale deposits, one of the most significant and costly
          problems encountered in oilfield operations &lt;[3&gt; Water
          flooding operations conducted in the Abu Dhabi oilfields often
          result in the formulation of BaS04, CaS04 and SrS04 deposits.
          The S04&lt;2"&gt; and Ba&lt;2+&gt; ion content in both
          seawater and formation water, respectively, can easily reach
          the solubility product (Ks) causing accumulation of BaS04
          scale on surface and subsurface equipment. This is recognized
          as a major cause of formation damage in production or
          injection wells. Inorganic scale contributes to wear,
          corrosion, and flow restriction, resulting in a decrease of
          oil and gas production. This scale also deposits in downhole
          pumps, tubing, casing, flow lines, heaters, treaters, tanks
          and other production equipment and facilities&lt;131&gt;.
          Barium sulfate (BaS04) scale is among the toughest to remove
          either by mechanical or chemical means. BaS04 is typically
          removed by mechanical tools that involve abrasion, such as
          gauge cutters, nipple brushes and spinning wash tools.
          Chemical removal methods utilizing ethylenediaminetetraacetic
          acid (EDTA) are also available&lt;[3&gt;<br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately, current scale inhibitor applications incur high
          costs due to conventional chemical dissolution. Scale
          inhibitor treatment is limited by its "squeeze efficiency"
          into the formation, which results in limited penetration as
          well as quick consumption in the reservoir. A squeeze usually
          involves the application of pump pressure to force a treatment
          fluid or slurry into a planned treatment zone (Schlumberger
          Oilfield Glossary). The problem is that scale inhibitors do
          not move deeply into the reservoir, hence only a small volume
          can be squeezed before being rapidly consumed. A need exists
          for a new methodology to prevent scale formation which is both
          economical and effective.<br>
          <br>
          While electrically enhanced techniques for promoting oil
          recovery are known, including those described in United States
          Patent Nos. 5,614,077 and 7,325,604, such techniques have not
          been applied in the fashion described herein for preventing
          mineral scale deposits.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          The method of the invention involves the application of
          electrokinetics for mitigating mineral scale formation. In one
          embodiment, the present invention provides an electrokinetic
          method for preventing mineral scale deposition in an oil well,
          having a well bore in fluid communication with an oil-bearing
          formation in which water and positively and negatively charged
          scale-forming species are present. The method comprises the
          steps of:<br>
          <br>
          a) positioning at least one first electrode adjacent to a well
          bore;<br>
          <br>
          b) positioning at least one second electrode at a location
          spaced apart from the first electrode and within electrical
          current conducting proximity of the first electrode;<br>
          <br>
          c) applying a potential difference between the first
          electrode(s) and the second electrode(s) using a direct
          current (DC) power source, the potential difference producing
          an electrical current flow between the first electrode(s) and
          the second electrode(s), whereby the positively charged
          scale-forming species are caused to migrate toward one of the
          first and the second electrode(s), and the negatively charged
          scale-forming species are caused to migrate toward the other
          of the first and second electrode(s). In an aspect of this
          method, the potential difference is applied such that the
          first electrode(s) serves as one or more cathodes and the
          second electrode(s) serves as one or more anodes.<br>
          <br>
          In another aspect of this method, at least one of the
          positively and negatively charged scale-forming species is
          introduced into the formation from an external source such as
          waterflooding. When waterflooding is the source of the
          scale-forming species, the method may be performed using an
          electrically conducting aqueous solution, e.g., a prepared or
          manmade aqueous salt solution, or alternatively, an aqueous
          solution selected from the group consisting of seawater,
          groundwater, surfacewater, and wastewater.<br>
          <br>
          In a further aspect of the method, the positively and
          negatively charged scale-forming species include at least one
          alkaline earth metal ion and sulfate or carbonate ions.<br>
          <br>
          In still a further aspect of the electrokinetic method,
          multiple cathodes are positioned in the vicinity of the well.
          Additionally, multiple anodes may be positioned at locations
          spaced apart from the cathodes and beyond the well, and in
          preferred installations the number of anodes exceeds the
          number of cathodes.<br>
          <br>
          In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides an
          electrokinetic method for preventing mineral scale deposition
          in an oil well, and the vicinity of the well, with the well
          having a well bore in fluid communication with an oil-bearing
          formation in which water and positively and negatively charged
          scale-forming species are present, the method comprising the
          steps of:<br>
          <br>
          a) positioning at least one cathode adjacent to the well bore;<br>
          <br>
          b) positioning a plurality of anodes at a location spaced
          apart from the at least one cathode and within electrical
          current conducting proximity of the at least one cathode,
          wherein the number of anodes exceeds the number of cathodes;<br>
          <br>
          c) applying a potential difference between the at least one
          cathode and each individual anode of the plurality of anodes;
          whereby electrical current flow between the at least one
          cathode and each individual anode of the plurality of anodes
          causes the positively charged scale-forming species to migrate
          toward the at least one cathode, and the negatively charged
          scale-forming species to migrate toward each individual anode
          of the plurality of anodes.<br>
          <br>
          In another aspect, the method further comprises the step of
          providing a switch between the at least one cathode and each
          individual anode of the plurality of anodes, wherein the
          switch is adapted to be opened to interrupt application of the
          potential difference between the at least one cathode and each
          individual anode of the plurality of anodes, or closed to
          apply the potential difference between the at least one
          cathode and each individual anode of the plurality of anodes.<br>
          <br>
          In a further aspect of the method of the invention, the step
          of applying a potential difference between the at least one
          cathode and each individual anode of the plurality of anodes
          further comprises the step of providing a DC power source
          between the at least one cathode and each individual anode of
          the plurality of anodes.<br>
          <br>
          The method described herein is believed to be the first use of
          direct current to prevent scale deposition in a well bore in
          fluid communication with an oil bearing formation. The
          electrokinetic method for preventing scale deposition
          described herein may be categorized as a green technology,
          since there is no water consumption, and no air, water, or
          formation pollution. The technology can be applied without
          depth limitations in situ, thereby making it an attractive
          option in remote or environmentally challenging operating
          locations.<br>
