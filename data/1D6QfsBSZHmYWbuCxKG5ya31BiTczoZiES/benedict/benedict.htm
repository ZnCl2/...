      <br>
      Mellen-Thomas Benedict is an artist who survived a near-death
      experience in 1982. He was dead for over an hour and a half after
      dying of cancer.<br>
      <br>
      At the time of his death, he rose up out of his body and went into
      the light. Curious about the universe, he was taken far into the
      remote depths of existence, and even beyond, into the energetic
      void of nothingness behind the Big Bang. During his experience, he
      was able to learn a great deal of information concerning
      reincarnation. Because of his near-death experience, he was able
      to bring back scientific discoveries. Mr. Benedict has been
      closely involved in the mechanics of cellular communication and
      research dealing with the relationship of light to life called
      Quantum Biology. This research is providing dramatic new
      perspectives on how biological systems work. Mr. Benedict has
      found that living cells can respond very quickly to light
      stimulation resulting in, among other things, high speed healing.
      He is a researcher, inventor and lecturer who holds six U.S.
      patents.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Benedict's NDE is reprinted here by the permission of the
      author's Dr. Lee Worth Bailey and Jenny Yates. Their excellent
      book entitled "The Near-Death Experience: A Reader", published by
      Routledge, New York, in 1996, is highly recommended by the
      webmaster. A portion of his near-death experience also appears in
      P.M.H. Atwater's book, "Beyond the Light".<br>

      <p class="Body">After suffering from a terminal illness, in 1982
        Mellen-Thomas Benedict ‘died’ and for an hour and a half he was
        monitored showing no vital signs. Miraculously he returned to
        his body with a complete remission of the disease – and what may
        be the most inspirational near-death experience story known to
        date.</p>
      <p class="Body">While on the “other side” Mellen journeyed through
        several realms of consciousness and beyond the “light at the end
        of the tunnel”. He was shown during his NDE, in holographic
        detail, Earth’s past and a beautiful vision of mankind’s future
        for the next 400 years. He experienced the cosmology of our
        soul’s connection to Mother Earth (Gaia), our role in the
        Universe, and was gifted with access to Universal Intelligence.</p>
      <p class="Body">Since his near-death experience, Mellen-Thomas has
        maintained his direct access to Universal Intelligence, and
        returns to the light at will, enabling him to be a bridge
        between science and spirit. He has been involved in research
        programs on life after death experiences and has developed new
        technologies for health and wellness. With humility, insight,
        and depth of feeling he shares his experience and insights.</p>
      <p class="Body">He brings back a message of hope and inspiration
        for humanity about Life After Death and Reincarnation delivered
        with a joy and clarity that is refreshing. His depth of feeling
        and passion for life is a gift to be shared.<br>

      The talented research team at iinnLight Technologies, Inc. has
      dedicated more than ten years to the study of LED science with a
      focus on its health and cosmetic benefits. They found that
      activating the body's healing system through the use of LEDs
      provides a gentler way to achieve beneficial results without the
      potentially harmful side effects of lasers.
      <p>iinnLight's advanced LED technology stimulates a series of
        biological responses at the cellular level and releases healing
        enzymes, creating an increase in cellular metabolism. This is
        how the body "rejuvenates" itself. Because iinnLight technology
        uses safe and non-invasive LED light, the therapy is completely
        risk-free and energizes and rejuvenates with every session.<br>

      <strong></strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] This invention relates to illumination of body components
      using light with selected wavelength ranges and selected
      illumination time intervals.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Phototherapy involves generation of light by suitable light
      sources, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) in the visible and
      infrared ranges to provide various benefits for a patient's body.
      The photons produced are absorbed by the body through the skin,
      the eyes and acupuncture points. Connective tissues in the body
      conduct the light to deeper tissues and organs. By taking
      advantage of optical properties of biological tissues, suitable
      wavelengths of light can be delivered to, absorbed by and used by
      the body to activate metabolic functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Treatment of a body using light irradiation requires a
      choice of several important parameters, including wavelength
      range, relative distribution of the wavelengths within the range
      (spectrum), time interval for continuous exposure, time interval
      between two continuous exposures, time rate of energy delivered,
      accumulated energy density for exposures, body component(s)
      irradiated, and many others. Choice of the appropriate parameters
      for a given human or animal subject has proved elusive.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] What is needed is a method and corresponding system that
      provides appropriate illumination for a body component and
      appropriate choice of the relevant parameters and that
      distinguishes between treatments for different medical purposes.
      Preferably, the method and system should provide for, and
      distinguish between, initial treatments and maintenance treatments
      for a given medical condition and should cover a large number of,
      if not all of, conditions that are believed to be treatable using
      illumination.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0006] These needs are met by the invention, which provides
      application of radiation in selected wavelength ranges to selected
      body components using a controlled sequence of exposures. Any two
      consecutive time intervals of continuous radiation exposure are
      spaced apart by a "dark field" time interval whose length is at
      least equal to a threshold value, in order to re-establish a
      randomization of electron transport and distribution resulting
      from application of photons during a continuous exposure interval.
      Radiation is delivered to one or more selected body components,
      and at selected points on a body, using an enhanced focussing
      system that increases the efficiency of delivery of the radiation.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> DESCRIPTION OF BEST MODES OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0014] FIG. 1 illustrates a system 11 suitable for generating and
      delivering radiation to one or more selected body components
      according to the invention. The system 11 includes an electrical
      power source 13 that delivers controllable power to a generator 15
      of electromagnetic radiation in the form of light in the visible
      and near infrared ranges (e.g., with wavelengths [lambda] in a
      range 400 nm&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=950 nm). Optionally, the light
      generated by the radiation generator 15 also may have wavelengths
      in a near-ultraviolet range (e.g., 350 nm&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=400 nm)
      and may have longer wavelengths in a mid-infrared range (e.g., 950
      nm&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=1500 nm), or in selected portions of one or
      more of these wavelength ranges. The radiation generator 15 may be
      a laser, a light emitting diode, an intense incandescent light
      source, an intense fluorescent light source or any other suitable
      intense light source, or a combination of two or more such light
      sources. If the generator 15 provides light in one or more
      unwanted wavelength ranges, one or more filters 17 (optional) may
      be positioned between the radiation generator 15 and the selected
      body component(s) 19 to be treated. The radiation generator 15 may
      produce a single or a few beams of light that are directed toward
      the body component 19, considered as a target. Preferably, the
      radiation generator 15 produces many light beams that are directed
      toward the body component 19. The system optionally includes a
      light focussing mechanism 21 that preferentially directs light
      produced by the radiation generator 15 toward one or more target
      sites 19-tj (j=1, 2, . . . ) On the body component. In some
      situations, the light beams are produced in a pattern surrounding
      a selected body part, such as an arm or a leg, so that the
      selected body part and adjacent body parts are irradiated together
      in a (diffuse) field effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The radiation generator 15 includes a timer 23 that
      activates and deactivates (turns on and turns off) the radiation
      generator during selected exposure time intervals, with any two
      consecutive continuous exposure time intervals having a first
      selected length [Delta]t(exp), separated by a dark field time
      interval having a second selected length [Delta]t(dark). This
      activity (light/dark/light) and its inverse (dark/light/dark) are
      sometimes referred to as a "reciprocating chase." The first
      selected length lies in a preferred range 0.1 sec
      &lt;[Delta]t(exp)&lt;1 sec, and the second selected length
      [Delta]t(dark) is preferably between 0.1 sec and 1 sec.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] A light reflecting mechanism 25 (optional) is positioned
      adjacent to the radiation generator 15 to capture and direct light
      toward the selected body component 19 to couple some or all of the
      generated light that would otherwise have been lost into that body
      component. A light concentrator, condenser or other light
      focussing mechanism 21 (optional) is positioned between the
      radiation generator 15 and the body component 19, to selectably
      concentrate (or to scatter within the body) the generated light on
      and around the body component 19 or selected sites on the selected
      body component.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one mode of operation, a flexible light delivery wrap
      31, illustrated in FIG. 2, is connected to the radiation generator
      15 in FIG. 1 and is wrapped around (a portion of) an arm, a leg, a
      torso, a neck, a head or other body appendage of the patient. The
      light delivery wrap 31 includes a rectangular, triangular,
      polygonal, ovular or other array 33 of light delivery elements
      35(i,j) (i=1, 2, . . . , J1;j=1, 2, . . . , J2; J1&gt;1; J2&gt;1)
      that are individually activated in a timed sequence that may be
      the same, or different, for each light delivery element. In a
      first version, where the array 33 is rectangular or triangular,
      each row of light delivery elements 35(i,j) (i=1, 2, . . . , J1; j
      fixed) is activated and is deactivated as a unit. In a second
      version, where the array is rectangular or triangular, the light
      delivery elements 35(i,j) (i=1, 3, 5, . . . ; j fixed) and 35(i,j)
      (i=2, 4, 6, . . . ; j fixed) are activated and are deactivated as
      separate units. Other patterns for light delivery activation and
      deactivation can also be used, depending upon the effect desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] FIG. 3 illustrates a suitable light delivery pattern, in
      which selected light sources (e.g., light emitting diodes) deliver
      light in three distinct wavelength ranges (1) a moderately broad
      band, centered around [lambda]=550 nm; (2) a moderately broad
      band, centered around [lambda]=637 nm; and (3) a narrow band,
      centered around [lambda]=890 nm, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the light
      sources (1), (2) and (3) provide light in different time
      intervals, with or without a dark field time interval imposed
      between two consecutive irradiation time intervals. FIG. 4A is a
      graphical view of time intervals during which the first, second
      and third light sources (1), (2) and (3) are activated in a
      nonoverlapping manner. FIG. 4B is a graphical view of a second
      version, in which the light sources (1), (2) and (3) are activated
      in selected overlapping time intervals. More generally, N sets of
      independently activatable light sources (N=3 in FIG. 3) are
      provided, and N wavelength ranges are chosen within the visible,
      near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] Each light delivery element 35(i,j) may deliver light in
      one or more selected wavelength ranges, when this element is
      activated, and adjacent light delivery elements may deliver the
      same, or different, wavelength ranges. In a preferred embodiment,
      each light delivery element delivers one or more fixed ranges of
      light wavelengths, such as the ranges 400&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=550 nm
      and/or 600 nm&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=760 nm and/or 800
      nm&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=1500 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 illustrate representative light intensity
      patterns of light activation (exposure interval) and deactivation
      (dark field interval) that can be used for the individual light
      elements 35(i,j) in FIG. 2. In FIG. 5, the light intensity
      I(t;i;j) is (substantially) 0, then rises quickly to a maximum
      value I(max), then decreases monotonically to a lower value I(min)
      over an exposure time interval of length [Delta]t(exp), then goes
      to 0 for a dark field time interval of length [Delta]t(dark), then
      repeats this pattern at least once. In FIG. 6, the light intensity
      I(t;i;j) is (substantially) 0, then rises quickly to a minimum
      value I(min), then increases monotonically to a greater value
      I(max) over an exposure time interval of length [Delta]t(exp),
      then goes to 0 for a dark field time interval of length
      [Delta]t(dark), then repeats this pattern at least once. In FIG.
      7, the light intensity I(t;i;j) rises to a first maximum value
      I(max;1), optionally continues at that level for a first selected
      time interval, falls to a first lower value I(min;1), goes to 0
      for a dark field time interval of length [Delta]t(dark), rises to
      a second maximum value I(max;2), optionally continues at that
      level for a second selected time interval, falls to a second lower
      value I(min;2), then goes to 0. The maximum intensities I(max;1)
      and I(max;2) may be the same or may differ, the minimum
      intensities I(min;1) and I(min;2) may be the same or may differ,
      and one or both of the minimum intensities I(min;1) and I(min;2)
      may be 0. Light intensity patterns other than the patterns shown
      in FIGS. 5, 6 and 7 can also be used here.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Each photon delivered to the vicinity of the body component
      19 (FIG. 1) is intended to produce one or more (preferably many)
      free electrons through photoelectric absorption and/or Compton
      scattering of the photon in its peregrinations through the body
      component and surrounding material. We have found, by analogy with
      the Einstein photoelectric effect in a metallic or crystalline
      material, that the photon energy E must be at least a threshold
      value E(thr), which lies in a range of about 1.3-3.1 eV, depending
      upon the atomic and/or molecular constituents of the selected body
      component and surrounding material, in order to produce at least
      one free electron as the photon undergoes scattering within the
      body. A photon with a wavelength [lambda]=500 nm has an associated
      energy of 2.48 eV, for example, and the wavelength range 400
      nm&lt;=[lambda]&lt;=950 nm corresponds to an energy range 1.31
      eV&lt;=E&lt;=3.10 eV. Not all photons with energies E just above
      the threshold value E(thr) will produce a free electron. A graph
      of average number Navg(E) of free electrons produced for a given
      incident photon energy E might resemble the graph in FIG. 8. This
      graph is similar to a graph of average number of free electrons
      produced by a photon incident on a metallic or crystalline
      material according to the Einstein model.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Another important parameter is the rate r at which energy
      (or photons) is delivered to a unit area (e.g., over 1
      cm&lt;2&gt;) of body surface per unit time (e.g., in 1 sec),
      during an exposure time interval. Our experiments indicate that
      energy density rates r in a range 0.0013
      Joules/cm&lt;2&gt;/sec&lt;=r&lt;=0.02 Joules/cm&lt;2&gt;/sec,
      averaged over a time interval of 5-45 min, is an appropriate range
      for many body components for green light ([lambda] 550 nm), red
      light ([lambda] 637 nm), white light and/or infrared light
      ([lambda] 890 nm). Delivery of energy at a rate lower than about
      0.0013 Joules/cm&lt;2&gt;/sec will have some effect but will
      require much longer radiation application times than a typical
      application time of 5-45 min. Delivery of energy at a rate greater
      than about 0.02 Joules/cm&lt;2&gt;/sec may saturate the body's
      ability to distribute the photon energy and may produce bums,
      ionization or other undesired local sensitization of the body. The
      peak light intensity I(t;i;j), shown in the examples of FIGS. 5, 6
      and 7, will determine, or will be determined by, the energy rate
      r.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Another important parameter is accumulated energy E(accum)
      delivered per unit area for the session in which radiation is
      applied. Our experiments indicate that an accumulated energy
      density range of 2.5 Joules/cm&lt;2&gt;&lt;=E(accum)&lt;=20
      Joules/cm&lt;2 &gt;is an appropriate range for many body
      components. Delivery of accumulated energy density greater than 20
      Joules/cm&lt;2 &gt;may produce burns, ionization or other
      undesired local sensitization of the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 9 schematically illustrates apparatus 90 that can be
      used to practice the invention. A control panel 91 controls the
      exposure time intervals, the dark field time intervals, the
      maximum intensity(ies), the particular intensity pattern(s) to be
      applied, the wavelength or frequency range(s) to be applied,
      target body component(s) and/or other relevant parameters, through
      control panel output signals delivered to a driver module 93. The
      driver module receives timing signals from a timer module 94 and
      receives electrical power (preferably regulated power) from one or
      more voltage sources, 95A and/or 95B, that deliver voltage(s), V1
      and/or V2, or electrical current. At least one of the control
      panel 91 and the driver module 93 includes a computer to process
      information and/or commands needed to provide appropriate light
      wavelengths in the appropriate time intervals according to the
      invention. The driver module 93 delivers power to one or more of a
      left hand/arm exposure pad 97-1, a left foot/leg exposure pad
      99-1, a right hand/arm exposure pad 97-2, a right foot/leg
      exposure pad 99-2 a neck/shoulder(s)/back exposure pad 101, and/or
      a light exposure canopy 103 covering part or all of a patient's
      body, each of which has an optional associated cumulative exposure
      monitor and/or exposure rate monitor connected to the
      corresponding exposure pad or exposure canopy. Optionally, one or
      more of these exposure pads may have its own electrical power
      supply, received directly from the driver module 93. The exposure
      pads are individually controlled and can deliver different (or the
      same) exposure patterns and different (or the same) wavelength
      ranges to target body components associated with the different
      exposure pads, in the same time intervals or in different time
      intervals. In some situations, it is appropriate to provide at
      least two voltages sources, such as V1=5 volts and V2=12 volts.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] We have found that insertion of a dark field time interval
      between two consecutive continuous exposure time intervals is
      useful in allowing the irradiated portion of the body to
      re-establish local equilibrium before the next pulse of photons
      arrives. The time interval required for re-establishing local
      equilibrium appears to vary from 0.1 sec to about 1 sec, depending
      upon variables such as the energy rate r, the accumulated energy
      E(accum) and the selected body component(s) irradiated. If the
      dark field time interval has a length less than [Delta]t(dark)
      (including a situation where no dark field interval is present),
      the additional photons delivered may encounter a body environment
      that is not at or near equilibrium and that "channels" these
      photons in particular directions or into particular reaction
      channels, which is generally undesirable. Where two consecutive
      exposure time intervals are separated by a dark field time
      interval of length at least [Delta]t(dark), the irradiated portion
      of the body is able to re-establish local equilibrium, or
      near-equilibrium, so that most or all photons within a given
      exposure time interval encounter substantially the same local
      environment, and a random or Monte Carlo type of photon scattering
      occurs within the next exposure time interval.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The free electrons thus produced ultimately come to
      equilibrium with the body component and adjacent material within
      the body, by attachment to a atom or molecule that can support
      attachment by another electron or by association with a assembly
      of substantially-free electrons that are weakly bound by the
      general electronic background of the local atomic and molecular
      constituents of the body. These equilibrated electrons have
      transferred substantially all their initial kinetic energy to one
      or more molecules in or adjacent to the body component, thus
      providing energy to promote certain healing processes in the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Phototherapy is the application of light from an artificial
      light source to stimulate or promote one or more therapeutic
      effects in the body of a human being or other animal. Photons from
      the, light source are absorbed by the body through the skin,
      through the eyes and through acupuncture points. Light absorbed
      through one or more acupuncture points is believed to be
      transported especially efficiently along channels, referred to as
      biologically closed electrical paths or "meridians", in the body,
      through a process similar to internal reflection of light in an
      optical fiber (whose refractive index is greater than the
      refractive index of the surrounding body material through which
      such a channel passes. These channels are believed to be
      connective tissue protein fibers having specialized optical
      properties, including refractive indices [eta] that are greater
      than the refractive indices [eta]' of surrounding tissues, organs
      and other body material (wherein [eta]'(avg) 1.4).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Only light in certain wavelength ranges will be transported
      efficiently through these channels. Absorption of light
      transported in one or more of these channels has the potential to
      increase cell metabolism from a depressed state to a normal level.
      Light in the 600-800 nm wavelength range appears to be transported
      with little absorption or scattering within these channels. Sergei
      Pankratov, of the Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine
      in Novosibirsk, Russia, has reported that marked light
      transporting properties of some of these channels, which easily
      transport light into tissues deeper within the body, "Meridians
      Conduct Light", Raum und Zeit, vol. 35(88) (1991) pp. 16-18. A
      terminus on the skin of such a channel often coincide, with an
      acupuncture point identified by Chinese physicians several
      millenia ago. In addition to its optical properties, a light
      transport channel has associated thermal properties, such as heat
      conductivity and heat capacity.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Phototherapy activates cell membranes within the body by
      increasing a membrane's natural electrical charge, sometimes
      referred to as "membrane capacitance." A body's natural
      electromagnetic field ("biofield") aids in organizing molecular
      structures in repair, regeneration and reproduction of cells and
      cell components and serves as a signal communication system in
      regulation of metabolic processes. The biofield may also serve as
      a power grid to provide electrical and/or chemical energy to drive
      and control biochemical and biphysical enzyme reactions that are
      part of a metabolic process. One such process is: (1) receipt and
      conversion of light in a channel; (2) activation of cell enzymes;
      and (3) enhanced production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from
      the activated enzymes, as the primary energy source for a body.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] One researcher, Tiina Karu has determined that light
      absorption by cellular structures enhances a number of
      cell-related activities: cell replication, cell metabolism,
      protein synthesis, ATP production, mitochondria replication,
      phagocytosis, and photodissociation of oxygenated hemoglobin (The
      Science of Low-Power Laser Therapy, Gordon and Breach, 1998,
      "Photobiology of Low Power Laser Effects", Health Physics, vol.
      56, May 1989). Karu has also found that absorption of light
      affects tissue-related activities, including: capillary formation,
      parasympathetic nervous system stimulation, increased endorphin
      release, increased production and release of adrenal steroids,
      reduction in pain and in inflammation, reduction of tissue edema,
      immune system stimulation, enhanced fibroblastic production and
      collagen synthesis, and accelerated healing of wounds.<br>
