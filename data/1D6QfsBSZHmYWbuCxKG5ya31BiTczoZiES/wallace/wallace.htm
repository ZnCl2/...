      <p>It is now nearly 10 years since Henry Wallace was granted a
        pair of US Patents (# 3,636,605 and 606) on what was initially
        written off as a crazy science fiction notion --- a machine to
        generate an anti-gravity field. But in the interim, Professor
        Eric Laithwaite of Imperial College, London, has achieved both
        fame and notoriety by arriving independently at a similar
        theory. </p>
      <p>According to Wallace’s patents, bodies made of carefully chosen
        materials generate an energy field when placed in rapid relative
        motion. This field is not electromagnetic and was christened by
        the inventor as a Kinemassic Forcefield. If this kinemassic
        field is made to undulate, a secondary gravitational field is
        produced which can neutralize gravity. </p>
      <p>In one kinemassic machine a pair of wheels of brass alloy, like
        gyroscopes, are mounted in close-fitting air gaps between
        massive structural supports formed from steel. The wheels are
        driven to a high speed of rotation by jets of compressed air or
        nitrogen. The inventor claims that, at speeds of about 20,000
        rpm, polarization of the spin nuclei of the alloyed metal
        occurs. If one wheel is balanced on a knife edge, it will start
        to oscillate under the influence of the other. If the spinning
        wheels are rotated abut another axis, a secondary gravitational
        field is created which reduces the wheels’ weight. If a
        sufficiently strong field is created, it can generate localized
        areas of gravitational shielding and thus provide an effective
        propulsion force. </p>
      <p>Although the Wallace patents were initially ignored as cranky,
        observers believe that his invention is now under serious but
        secret investigation by the military authorities in the USA. The
        military may now regret that the patents have already been
        granted and so are available for anyone to read. </p>

      <p>Based on the assumption of your interest, following are
        descriptive explanations of two of the many facets of the
        kinemassic field force (KF) energy: one micro, the second, macro
        in form. Acquainting you with just the first (micro) of these
        facets, I believe, will establish the reality of the KF to you
        although other facets --- in addition to these two ---
        convincingly exist not the least of which are the quantitative
        test data associated with, for example, the KF permeability
        experiments. </p>
      <p>Einstein believed that a force field could be generated from
        the mass dynamic interaction of bodies in relative motion.
        Quoting from the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i> (15th Ed.,
        Macropedia, Vol. 8, p. 289): "Field theories of gravity,
        Einstein’s general relativity being an important example, also
        predict specific corrections to the Newtonian force law, the
        corrections being of two basic forms: (1) When matter is in
        motion, additional gravitational fields (analogous to the
        magnetic fields produced by moving electric charges) are
        produced; also, moving bodies interact with gravitational fields
        in a motion-dependent way...". Sometime after Einstein’s death,
        this predicted field --- a mathematical expression --- was
        posthumously termed "protational". Einstein was said to have
        been distressed that, experimentally, this predicted force field
        energy apparently could never be realized --- and therefore
        verified --- since calculations indicated that the maximum mass
        densities of available hardware, needed for "matter in motion"
        (mass dynamic interactions), would hypothetically generate field
        forces so infinitesimal as to be many orders of magnitude below
        measurable levels. Platinum (Pt) --- with a density of p = 21.45
        gm/cm<sup>3</sup> --- was thought to be the most viable hardware
        candidate. </p>
      <p>The KF reasoning is quite clearly believed to have stolen a
        march upon the existing field theories of gravity; a march of
        utmost importance regarding concepts of experimental hardware.
        This preceding statement especially applies to the maximal
        attainable density needed for the measurable interaction of
        "matter in motion"; the neutron possesses, for example, a
        density of close to 3.5 x 10^14 gm/cm^3. </p>
      <p>Quoting again from the <i>Ency. Brit.</i> (Special Suppl. 1976
        Brit. Book of the Year, p. 62) as regards awarding of the 1975
        Nobel Prizes, L. James Rainwater, one of three Nobel laureates
        for Physics that year, wrote a paper associated therewith of
        which the following excerpt applies: "...observed that the
        greater potion of nuclear particles form an inner nucleus while
        other particles, which are all in constant motion at tremendous
        velocities, affect the other set of particles...". For reasoning
        which is not included here but which is set forth in US Patents
        # 3,626, 605 and # 3,626,606, the KF moment of the odd-A
        nuclide’s unpaired nuclear particle (either proton or neutron)
        possesses its salient KF force energy moment --- the same energy
        interaction ongoing between the nuclear, shell-configured
        particles just quoted from L. J. Rainwater --- available for
        experimental measurement by means of, for example, the various
        apparatus described in these two basic patents. </p>
      <p>Consider the magnitudes of density enhancement between the
        nucleon (N) --- e.g., neutron (n) --- and platinum (Pt): </p>
      <p>3.5 x 10<sup>14</sup> / 2.145 x 10<sup>1</sup> = 1.6 x 10<sup>13</sup>
      </p>
      <p>In order to more emphatically portray this thirteen orders of
        magnitude increase in density, one may compare 30 million years
        with one minute of time. The unpaired N, collectively, of the
        odd-A nuclide is the viable hardware available for
        experimentally measuring the interaction of... matter in
        motion... as regards the KF force energy. </p>
      <p>Although it is an extreme example, a 100-pound bar of beryllium
        (Be) possesses 11.1 pounds of unpaired nuclear particles
        interacting, in part, with an additional 11.1 pounds of paired
        nuclear particles --- via mass imagery. Consequently, 22.2
        pounds of spinning, orbiting, vibrating particles --- "all in
        constant (relative) motions at tremendous velocities..." and
        with particles densities in the order of 3.5 x 10<sup>14</sup>
        gm/cm<sup>3</sup> --- are available in laboratory apparatus
        where 100 pounds of Be are utilized. It is noted that Be should
        preferably be utilized within the apparatus of USP # 3,636,605
        since Be’s nuclear relaxation time --- from its polarized state
        --- may be of several day’s duration; Be may well have valuable
        future application comparable to certain metallic elements, and
        their alloys, utilized for permanent magnet structures within
        the realm of electromagnetism. </p>
      <p>Because these unpaired nucleons, of the odd-A nuclides, possess
        external angular momenta (the respective momenta of paired
        nucleons internally cancel), it has experimentally been
        determined that the imposing of an applied axis of rotation to
        odd-A nuclide matter causes spin polarization such as occurs
        with the Barnett Effect concerning the spins of unpaired
        electrons within ferromagnetic matter. The means, therefore, are
        at hand for generating a KF force as the Barnett Effect
        apparatus has been available for generating a magnetomotive
        force (mmf). </p>
      <p>The KF force moment, by itself, has not yet proven sufficiently
        energetic, however, to be capable of generating, en masse, a
        measurable KF field by this imposed axis of rotation technique.
        Unlike the concept and apparatus, utilized in the Barnett
        Effect, the field enhancement method of adding the parameter of
        KF permeability --- by means of field circuit structure
        fabricated of odd-A nuclide matter --- created a KF intensity of
        sufficient magnitude for unpaired N polarization and, hence, for
        measuring with a resulting accuracy, as determined by
        probability standards (where any ratio achieving a value of 20:1
        is not a result of false test readings) of one billion to one. </p>
      <p>Regarding field permeability, a KF structure which is composed
        of odd-A nuclide matter --- for example, of aluminum, copper,
        vanadium, cobalt, etc. --- bears a parallel with ferromagnetic
        field circuit structures, as respects electromagnetism, in that
        the former structure is, in part, of unpaired electrons. No
        doubt that the relatively few people, knowledgeable in the area
        of nuclear physics, would judge the KF moment, associated with
        an unpaired nucleon of an odd-A nuclide, too weak (if indeed
        they accepted the moment’s existence --- it constitutes a
        salient rupture (as defined by KF reasoning) of the atomic
        nucleus and is believed composed of a component of the nuclear
        binding force --- to interact with the ambient and near-ambient
        unpaired nucleons of the adjacent atomic structure. This
        judgment would be based on the energy-interaction distance
        capabilities of the strong interaction filed; it is thought to
        be of the order of 10<sup>-13</sup> cm. However, this energy
        ---composed of both the pairing and longer-range binding forces
        --- has only been measured in the MeV energy range; only 15 KeV
        is believed necessary --- via KF reasoning --- for interatomic
        KF moment interaction. This KF moment consists of a modified
        pairing (short-range) force energy. The binding force, holding
        this unpaired nucleon within its nucleus, essentially consists
        of the longer-range force energy. </p>
      <p>Whereas the magnitude of the magnetic field --- for a given
        magnetomotive force (mmf) --- can be increased many
        thousand-fold by the application of a magnetically-permeable
        field structure --- ferrites exhibit increases exceeding a
        factor of 80,000 --- it is presently unknown what the KF
        increase in magnitude is due to the KF permeability present
        within various matter for a given KF mmf equivalent. However,
        this KF magnitude increase has been shown to be manifold from
        the results of KF permeability tests and KF circuit shunt tests.
        KF ambient air-gap tests have also demonstrated the preference
        of the KF for odd-A nuclide matter in contrast to vacuum, air
        and even-even nuclide matter; a KF probe has measured
        diminishing KF energy, up to 11.5 cm away from an experimental
        apparatus’s field circuit air-gap, in proportion to distance
        from the air-gap, during Qualitative Testing. </p>
      <p>The preceding paragraphs, then, provide a descriptive
        explanation of those experimental techniques which make it
        possible to incorporate and utilize matter in laboratory
        apparatus --- for generating mass dynamic interactions --- with
        densities some 1.6 x 10<sup>13</sup> times greater than thought
        possible by Einstein and others. </p>
      <p>As this KF explanation evolves from the micro to the macro
        condition, it is appropriate to note that matter possesses two
        properties germane to this writing. There are two mass
        properties related to all matter: the quiescent property of
        weight and the dynamic property of inertia. The weight property
        relates to the gravitational mass since the mass of a body is
        regarded as the generator of the gravitational field. The
        inertial property is that property of a body by which the body
        will remain at rest, or in the same straight line or direction,
        unless acted upon by some external force. When that external
        force action is applied, an equal and opposite force reaction
        concomitantly occurs, as conceived by Newton. According to KF
        reasoning, this inertial property exists because of the KF
        presence, and this force reaction is the force reaction of the
        secondary, time-variant gravitational field induced by the
        kinemassic field made time-variant. </p>
      <p>The macro presence of the KF, in contrast to the micro presence
        --- the latter as taught in the two US Patent publications
        referred to above --- has its awareness emerge from the
        following quotations found in the 4th edition of <i>Van
          Nostrand’s Scientific Encyclopedia</i>, as follows: "Mach
        Principle --- The inertial property of matter is a measure of
        the total matter in the universe and its total relative motion,
        the kinemassic field being the universal field stress medium
        required for the communicating of, and for the inherent presence
        of, this inertial property. Accordingly, when in its inertial
        state, a body’s kinemassic field is unvarying with time but, in
        its accelerative state, a body’s kinemassic field is
        time-variant, and so gives rise to an induced, time-variant,
        secondary gravitational field which exhibits its presence as a
        vector force in opposition to the body’s acceleration as defined
        by Newton’s Laws of Motion". </p>
      <p>Consider the following example of the macro KF in which it
        would seem --- per the Mach Criterion --- to be contrary to the
        methodicalness of Nature for the KF not to be present: Release a
        one-pound hardened steel ball which is suspended 10 feet above a
        hardened steel plate --- the two bodies having a mutual
        Coefficient of Restitution of 90% --- thus the steel ball
        rebounds to a height of 9 feet above the plate. Our present
        acceptance of physics recognizes the following statements to be
        true: While statically suspended, the ball possesses 10
        foot-pounds of energy because of the gravitational field; when
        released, the ball is in a state of acceleration and, because of
        this, is in the process of transforming it gravitational
        potential energy into kinetic energy; at the precise moment of
        impact between ball and plate, the ball has completed this
        energy transformation with almost 100% efficiency; after impact,
        elastic deformations of ball and plate occur; because of the 90%
        Coefficient of Restitution, there exists 0.9 x 10 ft lb, or 9
        foot-pounds, of conservative potential energy stored within the
        maximally deformed ball-plate system; this potential energy
        storage is possible because of the stressing of the
        electromagnetic fields responsible for the crystalline
        structural integrity of solid matter; as the ball, in its
        rebound state, just clears the plate surface, the
        electromagnetic field potential energy storage is mostly
        transformed to kinetic energy (the total non-conservative energy
        transformation of one foot-pound appears as thermal energy loss
        which results in a temperature increase within ball and plate);
        immediately, the kinetic energy begins an energy transformation
        back into 9 foot-pounds of gravitational field potential energy,
        the cycle completing itself only when the ball and plate
        separate to a 9-foot distance. </p>
      <p>The point that is made here concerns the relationship between
        energy states and the energy fields associated wth these energy
        states during this cycle of energy transformations. Kindly note:
        of all these energy states, only the kinetic energy state has no
        inherent, essential field associated with it, according to the
        current teachings of physics. This unrecognized field, this
        missing link, this source of an empty niche, the filling of
        which is required for energy/field symmetry, a field needed for
        both rational and linear kinetic energies --- if Nature’s
        orderliness is to be kept --- is the kinemassic field. </p>
      <p>In accordance, then, with that KF statement --- in part,
        similar to the Mach Principle noted above --- when a body is in
        its inertial sate, only the kinemassic field is present:
        however, when a body is in an accelerative state --- including
        linear acceleration, angular velocity (radial acceleration), and
        angular acceleration --- the kinemassic field becomes
        time-variant thereby inducing an associated, secondary,
        time-variant gravitational field as well. </p>
      <p>Although straight-line motions and linear velocities are taught
        as acceptable states of matter, these concepts may prove to be a
        handicap in truly understanding Nature since the earth
        continually accelerates towards the sun which, in turn, is in a
        continuing state of acceleration towards the center of our
        nebula which, in turn, is in a state of deceleration with
        respect to the expanding universe. A path or ray of light could
        be considered not to represent a straight line due to the
        gravitational field gradients filling space. No orbit is truly
        circular. The warped deviations of the near-ellipsoidal orbits
        of earth satellites tells us much about the earth’s pear-shaped
        configuration. And so it may be reasoned that so-called straight
        lines, or curved displacements, are, in reality, extreme
        examples of curved lines, or curved displacements, possessing
        near-infinitely long, and curvy, radii; correspondingly, bodies
        traveling at extremely miniscule accelerations respectively. A
        geodesic line is the path followed by a particle upon which only
        gravitational and inertial forces act. An example of such a path
        is that traveled by a spacecraft towards the outer regions of
        out planetary system. Such a path is te straightest path
        possible in a 4-dimensional space-time continuum. </p>
      <p>Before reviewing the main thoughts expressed in this writing,
        it seems that further clarification should be given regarding
        acceleration of matter by various means. </p>
      <p>A distinction is made as to the several modes available for the
        accelerating of mass according to gravitational field theories
        and hypotheses. The equivalence Principle is stated in several
        ways but its essence teaches that the greater the weight
        property, of one body to another, the proportionately greater is
        the inertial property of the first body to the other. Hence all
        bodies, great and small, accelerate equally within the same
        gravitational field gradient. Qetvos first demonstrated this
        principle experimentally. Currently this equivalence has been
        found to hold true to the eleventh order of magnitude. </p>
      <p>If matter is accelerated by electromagnetic fields --- both
        static and DC magnetic fields included --- it is regarded as in
        its accelerated state. But if matter is accelerated by the
        gravitational field, theories consider that it remains in its
        inertial states of rest or translation although, if such matter
        were released above the surface of the earth at our approximate
        latitude, bith it and the earth would acclerate towards one
        another at a combined acceleration of 32.17 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>.
      </p>
      <p>Kinemassic field reasoning provides for accelerated relative
        motions even though two bodies are, for example, in translatory
        motions of constant velocities. Therefore a body may be at rest
        in its relationship to the motion-averaging of universal
        relative motion --- with respect to that spatial matter, still
        within KF communication either because of the curvature of space
        or, alternatively, because of not exceeding the velocity, viz.,
        of electromagnetic propagation --- but still be in an
        accelerative state of motion with respect to a local second body
        which also is in its inertial rest state also with respect to
        inertial space. Bodies, in these so-called inertial states ---
        although experiencing distinct local relative motions --- are
        reasoned to be centered within the sphere of the universe’s
        total relative motion. This concept is more easily grasped if
        the inertial state is that one of rest. Here the vector
        summation, of this total relative motion, is zero, when measured
        by an observer located at the position of the sphere-centered
        body in its rest state, as would the gas molecules within a
        gas-filled chamber when the chamber is held at a zero
        temperature gradient. When in its inertial state of translation,
        the body remains sphere-centered because of the curvature of
        space as a mite would remain centered on the surface of a
        sphere, as it moved about in an imaginary, so-called
        3-dimensional universe of space-time. </p>
      <p>One final distinction is presently worth citing. The same
        edition of <i>Van Nostrand’s Scientific Encyclopedia</i>
        earlier referenced (p. 973), under Gravitation and Gravity:
        "Einstein’s Equivalence Principle makes no distinction between
        gravitation and centrifugal force...". Providing this statement
        is quoted correctly by Van Nostrand, then a further difference
        exists between this field theory of gravity and the KF reasoning
        in the respect that the KF reasoning makes a distinction between
        the gravitational field force and the centrifugal/ centripetal
        force pair arising from radial acceleration: this distinction
        concerns the differences in the characteristics of the two force
        gradients. For all practical purposes, the earth’s gravitational
        field force gradient diminishes exponentially --- to the second
        power --- as elevation is gained along a local vertical above
        the earth. The centrifugal force, acting on a spinning body’s
        particles, diminishes linearly along a radial line of approach
        to the body’s axis of rotation. </p>
      <p>In review then --- as regard the macro state of the KF from an
        inertial point of view --- all matter is in an accelerative
        state of universal relative motion. Consequently, when based on
        the foregoing reasoning, the kinemassic field is everywhere, in
        its time-variant state, continuously inducting tie-variant
        gravitational fields. The kinemassic field provides the
        explanation for, and is the cause of, the inertial property of
        matter. When matter is accelerated --- that is: when the
        kinemassic field is made time-variant --- this time variance
        causes induction of a secondary, time-variant gravitational
        field; its physical presence is mechanically felt as that F =
        Mdv / dt force reaction so well expressed by Newton’s second and
        third laws of motion as stated by Harvey E. White in <i>Classical





          and Modern Physics</i>: Second Law --- The rate at which
        momentum of a body changes is equal to the force acting and
        takes place in the direction of the straight line in which the
        force acts. Third Law --- "to every action force there is always
        an equal and opposite reaction force". </p>
      <p>Briefly, in closing, unpaired nucleons are reasoned to not only
        possess spin axes and magnetic moments but also kinemassic
        moments . This hypothesis seemingly is borne out by the actual
        testing of polarized odd-A nuclide matter, in which field forces
        --- probed/sensed up to 11.5 cm from the apparatus’ field
        circuit test air gap --- were measured and determined not to be
        of electromagnetic or gravitational energies. Because these
        bodies of matter are 1.6 x 10<sup>13</sup> more dense than
        platinum and because their mass dynamic interactions are
        comprehended as naturally occurring within atomic nuclei, the
        measuring of such matter interactions within experimental
        laboratory apparatus was deemed worth trying to measure. The
        important concept of field permeability was incorporated within
        the apparatus and, as was experimentally verified, success
        depended upon the utilization of permeable field circuit
        structure in order to provide sufficient field enhancement for
        detection and measurement. This micro KF then is to be
        identified in its macro form and, as briefly reviewed in the
        preceding paragraph, provides the surprising insights that the
        inertial forces of mass acceleration arise from induction of a
        secondary gravitational field via a time-variant kinemassic
        field, the kinemassic field providing the inertial property of
        matter. </p>

          for generating a time variant non-electromagnetic force field

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The method for generating
          such time variant force fields including the steps of
          juxtaposing in field series relationship a stationary member
          of spin nuclei material, and a member capable of assuming
          relative motion with respect to said stationary member also
          characterized by spin nuclei material; initiating relative
          motion by rotation of said one member with respect to the
          other, which rotational motion may occur both about an axis
          within the plane of said other member and about an axis
          perpendicular thereto; whereby the rotational motion of said
          one member about the axis perpendicular to the plane of said
          other member results in the dual interaction of the angular
          momentum property of said other member thereby resulting in a
          dynamic interaction field arising through gravitational
          coupling which dynamic interaction is further characterized by
          its non-electromagnetic nature and its mass-proximity and
          relative motion dependency; the rotation of said one member
          about the axis within the plane of said other interaction
          field within said other member which in turn gives rise to a
          secondary time-variant gravitational field in the surrounding
          space.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          relates to an apparatus and method for generating a
          time-variant force field due to the relative motion of moving
          bodies; which force field exhibits itself in the form of an
          induced secondary gravitational force. As such, this invention
          constitutes a continuation-in -part of an application field
          Nov. 4, 1968 by the same inventor, entitled Method &amp;
          Apparatus for Generating a Dynamic Force Field and bearing
          Ser. No. 773,116 (US Patent #3,626,606).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the practice of the
          present invention it has been found that when bodies composed
          of certain material are placed in relative motion with respect
          to one another there is generated an energy field therein not
          heretofore observed. This field is not electromagnetic in
          nature; being by theoretical prediction related to the
          gravitational coupling of relatively moving bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The initial evidence
          indicates that this non-electromagnetic field is generated as
          a result of the relative motion of bodies constituted of
          elements whose nuclei are characterized by half integral
          "spin" values, the spin of the nuclei being associated with
          the net angular momentum of the nucleons thereof. The nucleons
          in turn comprise the elemental particles of the nucleus; i.e.
          the neutrons and protons. For the purposes of the present
          invention the field, generated by the relative motion of
          materials characterized by a half integral spin value, is
          referred to as a "kinemassic" field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be appreciated that
          relative motion occurs on various levels, i.e., there may be
          relative motion of discrete bodies as well of the constituents
          thereof including, on a subatomic level, the nucleons of the
          nucleus. The kinemassic force field under consideration is a
          result of such relative motion, being a function of the
          dynamic interaction of two relatively moving bodies including
          the elemental particles thereof. The value of the kinemassic
          force field created, by reason of the dynamic interaction of
          the bodies experiencing relative motion, is the algebraic sum
          of the fields created by reason of the dynamic interaction of
          both elementary particles and of the discrete bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a closed system
          comprising only a stationary body, the kinemassic force, due
          to the dynamic interaction of the subatomic particles therein,
          is zero because of the random distribution of spin
          orientations of the respective particles. Polarization of the
          spin components so as to align a majority thereof in a
          preferred direction establishes a flux field aligned with the
          spin axes of the elementary particles. The present invention
          is in part comprised of an apparatus for polarizing its spin
          nuclei material, while additional means are provided to induce
          an alternating or undulating effect in the kinemassic field so
          generated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly, a primary
          object of the present invention concerns the provision of
          means for generating a time-variant kinemassic field within a
          permeable field body due to the dynamic interaction of
          relatively moving bodies and the relative motion of said
          generating means with respect to the permeable field body.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The kinemassic force field
          finds theoretical support in the laws of physics, being
          substantiated by the generalized theory of relativity.
          According to the general theory of relativity, there exists
          not only a static gravitational field but also a dynamic
          component thereof due to the gravitational coupling of
          relatively moving bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This theory proposes that
          two spinning bodies will exert force on each other. Heretofore
          the theoretical predictions have never been experimentally
          substantiated; however, as early as 1896, experiments were
          conducted on stationary bodies placed near large, rapidly
          rotating masses. The results of these early experiments were
          inconclusive, and little else in the nature of this type of
          work is known to have been conducted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is therefore another
          object of the present invention to set forth an operative
          technique for generating a measurable time-variant force field
          due to the gravitational coupling of relatively moving bodies.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In carrying out the present
          invention, means are provided to enable the relative
          rotational motion of a first member with respect to a
          stationary member positioned in close proximity thereto; the
          construction of one embodiment of the first member being such
          as to enable portions thereof to assume rotational motion
          about an axis perpendicular to the plane of said stationary
          member. The effect of the rotation of said member about the
          axis perpendicular to the plane of the stationary member is to
          establish a kinemassic force field in the nature of that
          referred to in the aforementioned co-pending application of
          the same inventor. The rotation of said member about the axis
          lying within the plane of said stationary member results in an
          undulation of the dynamic interaction field within said field
          members which in turn induces a secondary time-variant
          gravitational field in the surrounding space.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly, another more
          specific object of the present invention concerns a method of
          generating a non-electromagnetic force field due to dynamic
          interaction of relatively moving bodies and for utilizing such
          force field to further generate a secondary gravitational
          field.</font> </p>

          features of novelty which characterize the present invention,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before getting into a
          detailed discussion of the apparatus and the steps involved in
          the practice of the present invention, it should be helpful to
          and understanding if the present invention of consideration is
          first given certain defining characteristics thereof, many of
          which bear an analogous relationship to electromagnetic field
          theory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A first feature is that the
          kinemassic field is vectorial in nature. The direction of the
          field vector is a function of the geometry in which the
          relative motion between mass particles takes place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second significant
          property of the kinemassic field relates the field strength to
          the nature of the material in the field. This property may be
          thought of as the kinemassic permeability by analogy to the
          concept of permeability in magnetic field theory. The field
          strength is apparently a function of the density of the spin
          nuclei material comprising the field circuit members. Whereas
          the permeability in magnetic field theory is a function of the
          density of unpaired electrons, the kinemassic permeability is
          a function of the density of spin nuclei and the measure of
          magnitude of their half integral spin values. As a consequence
          of this latter property, the field may be directed and
          confined by interposing into it denser portions of desired
          configuration. For example, the field may be in large measure
          confined to a closed loop of dense material starting and
          terminating adjacent a system wherein relative motion between
          masses is occurring.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further property of the
          kinemassic force field relates field strength to the relative
          spacing between two masses in relative motion with respect to
          one another. Thus, the strength of the resultant field is a
          function of the proximity of the relatively moving bodies such
          that relative motion occurring between two masses which are
          closely adjacent will result in the generation of a field
          stronger than that created when the same two relatively moving
          bodies are spaced farther apart.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As mentioned above, a
          material consideration in generating the kinemassic force
          field concerns the use of spin nuclei material. By spin nuclei
          material is meant materials in nature which exhibit a nuclear
          external angular momentum. This includes both the intrinsic
          spin of the unpaired nucleon as well as that due to the
          orbital motion of these nucleons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the dynamic
          interaction field arising through gravitational coupling is a
          function of both the mass and proximity of two relatively
          moving bodies, then the resultant force is predictably
          maximized within the nucleus of an atom due to the relatively
          high densities of the nucleons plus the fact that the nucleons
          possess both intrinsic and orbital components of angular
          momentum. Such force fields may in fact account for a
          significant portion of the nuclear binding force found in all
          of nature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been found that for
          certain materials, namely those characterized by a half
          integral spin value, the external component of angular
          momentum thereof will be accompanied by a force de to the
          dynamic interaction of the nucleons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the so-called
          kinemassic force which on a sub-macroscopic basis exhibits
          itself as a dipole moment aligned with the external angular
          momentum vector. These moments are of sufficient magnitude
          that they interact with adjacent, or near adjacent, spin
          nuclei field dipole moments of neighboring atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This latter feature gives
          rise to a further analogy to electromagnetic field theory in
          that the interaction of adjacent spin nuclei field dipole
          moments gives rise to nuclear domain-like structures within
          matter containing a sufficient portion of spin nuclei
          material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As in electromagnetic field
          theory, in an unpolarized sample the external components of
          angular momentum of the nuclei to be subjected to a kinemassic
          force field are randomly oriented such that the material
          exhibits no residual kinemassic field of its own. However,
          establishing the necessary criteria for such a force field
          effects a polarization of spin components of adjacent nuclei
          in a preferred direction thereby resulting in a force field
          which may be represented in terms of kinemassic field flux
          lines normal to the direction of spin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fact that spin nuclei
          material exhibits external kinemassic forces suggests that
          these forces should exhibit themselves on a macroscopic basis
          and thus be detectable, when arranged in a manner similar to
          that for demonstrating the Barnett effect when dealing with
          electromagnetic phenomena.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Barnett effect a long
          iron cylinder, when rotated at high speed about its
          longitudinal axis, was found to develop a measurable component
          of magnetization, the value of which was found to be
          proportional to the angular speed. The effect was attributed
          to the influence of the impressed rotation upon the revolving
          electronic systems due to the mass property of the unpaired
          electrons within the atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an apparatus constructed
          in accordance with the foregoing principles it was found that
          a rotating member such as a wheel composed of spin nuclei
          material exhibits a kinemassic force field. The interaction of
          the spin nuclei angular momentum with inertial space causes
          the spin nuclei axes of the respective nuclei of the material
          being spun to tend to reorient parallel with the axis of the
          rotating member. This results in the nuclear polarization of
          the spin nuclei material. With sufficient polarization, an
          appreciable field of summed dipole movements emanates from the
          wheel rim flange surfaces to form a secondary dynamic
          interaction with the dipole moments of spin nuclei contained
          within the facing surface of a stationary body positioned
          immediately adjacent the rotating member.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the stationary body,
          composed of suitable spin nuclei material, is connected in
          spatial series with the rotating member, a circuitous form of
          kinemassic field is created, the flux of which is primarily
          restricted to the field circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If now means are provided to
          periodically reverse the direction of rotation of the wheel
          with respect to the facing surfaces of the stationary body
          positioned in immediate proximity thereto, then the resultant
          time-varying kinemassic field generates or induces an
          accompanying time-varying secondary gravitational field in the
          space immediately surrounding. That is to say, if the
          time-varying kinemassic field is made to undulate typically
          sinusoidally, there will be induced an accompanying undulating
          secondary gravitational field, which is phase-related to the
          kinemassic field. In this respect the induced secondary
          gravitational field is generated in a manner analogous to
          electromagnetic induction theory.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By properly configuring the
          undulating kinemassic field, the resultant secondary
          gravitational field may be essentially restrained to or
          confined within an enclosed space. Although numerous geometric
          configurations may be proposed, the necessary conditions are
          established in the preferred embodiment of the present
          invention by enclosing the kinemassic field generating
          apparatus, including the rotational members and at least a
          portion of the stationary member thereof, within an enclosure,
          the material portions of which obey the rules concerning
          kinemassic permeability.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The kinemassic field when so
          configured, will shield the enclosed space both with respect
          to the secondary gravitational field induced therein and with
          respect to the ambient gravitational field caused by the earth
          and other cosmic bodies, existing externally of the shielded
          space. The undulating kinemassic field, which gives rise to
          the enclosed secondary undulating gravitational field, is
          effective in reducing the quantity of flux lines within the
          space surrounded by the undulating kinemassic field
          contributed by the ambient gravitational field, thus reducing
          the mutual force of gravitational attraction acting between
          this structure and the earth or other cosmic bodies dependent
          upon their relative contribution to the local gravitational
          flux density.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is well known that nature
          opposes heterogenous field flux densities. If the normal local
          flux density contributed by the earth and the other cosmic
          bodies within the space occupied by and surrounded by the
          undulating kinemassic field permeable structure were added to
          by the forcibly enclosed flux of the induced secondary
          undulating gravitational field, this enclosed flux density
          would be in opposition to nature. Although the induced
          secondary undulating gravitational field would cause an
          undulating variation of the cosmic or primary gravitational
          field flux lines of force to penetrate within the kinemassic
          field permeable structure, if this undulation were sinusoidal,
          for example, the RMS or 0.707 value of peak reduction in
          mutual gravitational attraction would apply.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Means for increasing the
          relative magnitude of the undulating kinemassic field is
          effected by positioning a mass circuit within the induced
          secondary field space. The mass circuit in linking with the
          undulating kinemassic field circuit results in an increase in
          the kinemassic field and in the same sense effectively
          intensifies the primary gravitational field shielding. A
          partial parallel can be found in electromagnetic field theory,
          where it is known that a shorted secondary turn enhances iron
          saturation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mass circuit located in
          the induced secondary field space need not be comprised of
          material having a spin nuclei characteristic; rather, it is
          more important that this mass circuit have high mass density.
          A further desirable characteristic if this mass circuit is
          that it have a capability for mass flow with respect to the
          undulating kinemassic field structure. Mercury has the desired
          combination of properties and while other materials may be
          used, mercury is the most effective thus far known.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As indicated above, the
          effective result of generating a secondary undulating
          gravitational field within the space enclosed by the
          undulating kinemassic field is a relative reduction in
          apparent weight of the kinemassic field permeable structure,
          with respect to its apparent weight without such an undulating
          kinemassic field. The explanation of this phenomenon may be
          readily conceived as caused by the generation of a field force
          vector anti-parallel in direction to the local gravitational
          field force vector. If the shielding is sufficiently effective
          to reduce the density of gravitational field flux lines within
          the shielded space to the equivalent of the ambient flux lone
          density, there will be no net local distortion of the
          gravitational field flux line pattern in the space enclosed by
          the kinemassic field configuration. Without distortion of the
          local flux line pattern the two bodies cease to mutually
          attract and, in effect, become weightless, one with respect to
          the other.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although similar in result,
          the technique for effecting the state of weightlessness in the
          present invention differs from conventional apparatus for
          achieving such a state of weightlessness. The latter, in
          general, utilize the force of radial acceleration to
          effectively "balance" the gravitational forces acting on a
          body.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The relative magnitude of
          the undulating kinemassic force field and the kinemassic
          permeability characterizing the associated structure are both
          influential in determining the effective shielding of the
          kinemassic field permeable structure. If the shielding is
          sufficiently effective so as to reduce the primary
          gravitational field flux line density within the enclosed
          space to less than that of the ambient, the distortion of the
          local gravitational field flux line pattern of reduced flux
          density would result in the anti-parallel field force vector
          magnitudes exceeding that force of the kinemassic field body's
          initial weight, i.e., the effective weight of the kinemassic
          field permeable structure absent the generated undulating
          kinemassic field. This condition would effectively endow the
          kinemassic field structure with a negative weight
          characteristic. As a consequence, the two bodies, that is the
          kinemassic field body and the earth or other cosmic body,
          would experience relative motion separating one another along
          the local primary gravitational field flux lines unless acted
          upon by other forces.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The hardware required to
          generate and sustain such an undulating kinemassic field is in
          part comprised of components which continue to retain a
          "non-field-energized" weight during the period of field
          generation. Therefore, the ambient gravitational field flux
          line pattern within the structure will simultaneously
          experience zones of both reduced and increased densities. It
          is the average density of all the zones that determines the
          magnitude of the anti-parallel field force vector in its
          opposition to the ambient gravitational field force vector.
          Bodies located within the shielded space enclosed by the
          undulating kinemassic field will lose their weight with
          respect to the body earth in direct proportion to the
          reduction of ambient gravitational field flux lines which are
          common to it and the body earth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As a consequence of the
          above, the shielding which results in a reduction of mutual
          attraction between bodies screened by the shielding effected
          by the undulating kinemassic force field does not violate the
          principle of equivalence. Thus, two free bodies of different
          masses, located within the shielded space, will fall within
          this space toward or away from the earth with equal
          accelerations. Also, the force of mutual gravitational
          attraction of two or more bodies located within the shielded
          space will be unaffected by the various degrees of shielding
          although their freefall acceleration toward one another will
          be affected.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the foregoing
          discussion, it will be appreciated that both for the purpose
          of detecting the kinemassic field forces operative in the
          present invention, and for transforming such forces into
          energy for doing useful work, several basic apparatus elements
          are necessary. First apparatus is needed to enable masses to
          be placed in relative motion to one another; which relative
          motion may occur in two mutually orthogonal directions. In
          order to maximize field strength the apparatus should be
          capable of generating high velocities between the particles in
          relative motion. Furthermore, the apparatus should be
          configured so that the proximity of the particles which are in
          relative motion is maximized. The necessity of using
          relatively dense material comprising half integral spin nuclei
          for the field circuit portion of the apparatus has already
          been stressed. These and other features are discussed in
          greater detail below in explanation of the drawings depicting
          an implementation of the invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In considering the drawings,
          reference will first be made to the general arrangement of
          components shown in Figures 1 and 2. As viewed in Figure1, the
          equipment is mounted upon a stationary base comprising a
          horizontal structural element 11 which rests upon poured
          concrete pilings not shown or other suitable structurally
          rigid material. It should be made clear at the outset that the
          stationary base although not a critical element in its present
          form nevertheless serves an important function in the subject
          invention. Thus, the stationary base acts as a stabilized
          support member for mounting the equipment and, perhaps more
          significantly, the horizontal portion thereof is of such
          material that it tends to localize the kinemassic force field
          to the kinemassic force field generating apparatus proper.
          This latter feature is discussed in more detail below. The
          surface uniformity of the horizontal structural element 11
          also facilitates the alignment of equipment components. In the
          reduction to practice embodiment of the present invention, a
          layer of shock-absorbing material, not shown, was interposed
          between the stationary base and the floor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shown mounted on the
          horizontal structural element 11 is the kinemassic force field
          generating apparatus indicated generally as 10, the lower
          portion of which is referred to as the lower mass member 12.
          The lower mass member 12 is not to be confusingly associated
          with the mass circuit mentioned above as being positioned in
          the space experiencing the secondary gravitational field. The
          nature and specific identity of the latter mentioned mass
          circuit will be more fully explained in connection with the
          explanation of Figure 7.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An upper mass member 13 is
          positioned in mirrored relationship with respect to member 12
          and separated somewhat to provide two air gaps therebetween.
          The lower and upper mass members 12 and 13 function as field
          circuit members in relationship to a generator 14 and a
          detector 15 positioned with respective one's of two said gaps.
          The spatial relationship of the generator 14, the detector 15
          and the mass members 12 and 13 is such as to form a kinemassic
          force field series circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All of the material members
          of the field circuit are comprised of half integral spin
          material. For example, the major portion of the generator 14,
          the detector 15, as well as the upper and lower mass members
          13 and 12 are formed of a particular brass alloy containing
          89% copper of which both isotopes provide a three-halves
          proton spin, 10% zinc, and 1% lead as well as traces of tin
          and nickel. The zinc possesses one spin nuclei isotope which
          is 4.11% in abundance and likewise the lead also contains one
          spin nuclei isotope which is 22.6% in abundance. In order to
          gain an estimate of apparatus size, the upper mass member 13
          has an overall length of 56 m and a mass of 43 kilograms.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be seen that, by
          far, the constituents of the mass members a re such as satisfy
          the criteria of half integral spin nuclei material for those
          apparatus parts associated with the field and the use of
          non-spin nuclei material for those parts where it is desired
          to inhibit the field. Accordingly, all support or structural
          members, such as the horizontal element 11 consist of steel.
          The iron and carbon nuclei of these structural members are
          classed as no-spin nuclei and thus represent high relative
          reluctance to the kinemassic field. Supports 1 are provided to
          accommodate the suspension of the upper mass member 13. The
          supports 16 are of steel the same as the horizontal support
          element 11. The high relative reluctance of steel to the
          kinemassic field minimizes the field flux loss created in the
          field series circuit of mass members 12 and 13, the generator
          14 and the detector 15. The loss of field strength is further
          minimized by employing high-reluctance isolation ridges at the
          point of contact between the lower and upper mass members 12
          and 13, and the structural support members 11 and 16.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shunt losses within the
          apparatus were, in general, minimized by employing the
          technique of minimum mass contact; the use of low field
          permeability material at the isolation bridges or structural
          connections; and avoiding bulk mass proximity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A number of techniques were
          developed for optimizing the isolation bridge units including
          Carboloy cones and spherical spacers. As is depicted more
          clearly in Figures 3,4,and 5, the structural connection unit
          ultimately utilized consisted of a hardened 60° steel cone
          mounted within a setscrew and bearing against a hardened steel
          platen. The contact diameter of the cone against the platen
          measured approximately 0.007 inch and was loaded within
          elastic limits. Adjustment is made by means of turning the
          setscrew within a mated, threaded hole.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 2 is presented in
          rather diagrammatic form; however, the diagrammatic
          configuration emphasizes that it consists of a rotatable
          member corresponding to the generator 14 of Figure 1 which is
          "sandwiched" between a pair of generally U-shaped members
          corresponding to the lower and upper mass members 12 and 13 of
          Figure 1. The wheel of the generator 14 is mounted for
          rotation about an axis in the plane of the drawing. The
          generator assembly is also shown as being mounted for rotation
          about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the drawing;
          however, the generator assembly may alternatively be oriented
          to rotate in the plane of the drawing. When member 14 is
          rotated rapidly with respect to the U-shaped member 12 and 13,
          a kinemassic field is generated which is normal to the plane
          defined by the rotating member and within the plane of the
          drawing. As such, it may be represented in the drawing of
          Figure 2 as taking a generally counter-clockwise direction
          with respect to the field series circuit members.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring once more to
          Figure 1, it is seen that support for the generator unit 14 is
          provided by way of a support assembly 17, also fabricated of
          steel components. The support assembly 17 is in turn clamped
          to the horizontal structural element 11 by way of bracket
          assemblies 18.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector 15 is of
          similar configuration to the generator assembly 14, the
          exception being that the detector assembly is mounted for
          limited rotation about the axis normal to the plane of the
          paper. The limited rotational capability is effected by a
          knife-edge mounting 19 more clearly discernable in Figures 3A
          and 3B. As will become more readily apparent from the
          discussion of the operation of the embodiment of Figure 1
          which follows, the knife-edge mounting enables a slow
          sinusoidal oscillation of the detector assembly about its
          knife-edge axis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A pair of light-emitting and
          light-sensing elements 20a and 20b respectively are shown in
          Figure 1 in operative relationship to the generator and
          detector assemblies 14 and 15. The function of the
          light-generating and light-sensing members 20a and 20b is to
          measure the rate of spin of the generator and detector wheels
          respectively. For this purpose every other quadrant on the rim
          surface is painted black. Accordingly, light directed at the
          rim of the wheel will be reflected by the unpainted surfaces
          into light-sensing cells associated with a rate-sensing
          circuit of conventional design. Since the rate-measuring
          circuit forms no part of the present invention it has not been
          depicted in the actual drawing nor is it the subject of
          further explanation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Compressed air or nitrogen
          is used to drive the generator and detector wheels. In this
          respect the compressed gas is directed against turbine buckets
          21b cut in the rim of wheel 21 of both the generator and
          detector assemblies and such buckets are more readily
          discernible in Figures 3, 4, and 5.the compressed gas is
          supplied to the generator and detector assemblies by way of
          air supply lines 28a and 28b.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figures 3, 4 and 5 present
          details of the generator and detector assemblies of Figures 1
          and 2. In particular, these figures disclose the relationship
          between a freely rotatable wheel 21, a bearing frame 22m and a
          pair of pole pieces 23. The bearing frame 22 is of structural
          steel, and functions to spatially orient the three generator
          parts without shunting the generated field potential as well
          as to maintain this orientation against the force moment
          stresses of precession.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Positioning of the generator
          wheel 21 with respect to the cooperative faces of the pole
          pieces 23 is effected by way of the bearing frame upon which
          the generator wheel is mounted. In this respect the
          high-reluctance isolation bridges mentioned with respect to
          Figures 1 and 2 are herein shown as set screws 24 which are
          adjustably positioned to cooperate with hardened steel platens
          25. The set screws 24 are mounted on the pole pieces 23 and
          are adjustably positioned with respect to steel platens 25
          cemented to the bearing frame 22 with respect to the interface
          surfaces 23a of the pole pieces 23.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the implementation of the
          present invention the air gap formed between the generator
          wheel rim flanges and the stationary pole pieces 23 was
          adjusted to a light-rub relationship when the wheel was slowly
          rotated; as such this separation was calculated to be 0.001
          centimeter for a wheel spin rate of 28,000 rpm due to the
          resulting hoop tension. In the drawing of Figure 3 the spacing
          between the pole pieces 23 and the generator wheel rim flange
          has been greatly exaggerated to indicate that in fact such a
          spacing does exist.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator wheel 21
          utilized in the implementation of the present invention has an
          8.6 cm diameter and an axial rim dimension of 1.88cm. The rim
          flange surfaces 21a which are those field emanating areas
          closely adjacent the surfaces 23a of the pole pieces 23, are
          each 29.6 square cm. The rim portion of the wheel has a volume
          of 55.7 cubic cm neglecting the rim turbine slots 21b.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator wheel 21 and
          an associated mounting shaft 26 are mounted of the bearing
          frame 22 by means of enclosed double sets of matched high
          speed bearings 27.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shaft members 30 carry
          suitable bearing members 31 for rotatably mounting the
          generator assembly with respect to a second axis. The support
          assembly 17 of Figure 1 is partially represented in Figure 3,
          and as noted above provides the mounting means for positioning
          the generator assembly 14 with respect to the lower and upper
          mass members 12 and 13.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reference is now made to
          Figures 3A and 3B which disclose a portion of the detector 15
          of Figure 1 including the knife-edge mounting 19 of Figure 1.
          Adjusting means 32 are shown connected to the bearing frame
          22a of the detector assembly 15 by means of a disc-like member
          33. Attached to the lower portion of the disc 33, and depicted
          in the end view of the detector assembly of Figure 3B, is
          shown a second adjusting member 34, which in combination with
          equivalent members 32 and 34 mounted on the other end of the
          detector assembly, provide means for symmetrically aligning
          the detector assembly within the gap provided by the lower and
          upper mass members 12 and 13. This further means that the
          knife-edge assembly is mounted so that the knife-edge axis is
          coincident with the geometric axis of the detector assembly.
          At the same time, the center of mass of the detector assembly
          is located below the geometric center of the detector assembly
          thereby providing a righting moment to the assembly due to the
          asymmetry of the mass center with respect to the knife-edge
          axis. The adjusting means 32 is shown as bearing against the
          support assembly 17, thereby, in combination with the
          knife-edge mounting at either end of the detector assembly,
          providing an effective four point suspension for symmetrically
          positioning the detector assembly 15 within the end poles of
          the upper and lower mass members.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figures 1, 2 and 3 the
          detector assembly 15 is shown in three different positions. As
          will become apparent from the discussion of the operation of
          the subject system which follows, the facility to so
          reposition the detector assembly is necessary to demonstrate
          its operative capabilities. Accordingly, the bearing frame 22a
          is rotatably mounted with respect to the disc 33 by means of a
          bearing surface interfacing the frame 22a with the shaft 35,
          the latter being affixed to the face of the disc 33.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Proceeding now to the
          explanation of the operation of the embodiment of the
          invention thus far disclosed, it will be appreciated that in
          accordance with the theory of operation of the present
          apparatus when the generator wheel is made to spin at rates
          upwards of 10 to 20 thousand rpm, effective polarization of
          spin nuclei within the wheel structure gradually occurs. This
          polarization gradually gives rise to domain-like structures
          which continue to grow so as to extend their field dipole
          moment across the interface separating the rim 21 from the
          pole pieces 23. Secondary dynamic interaction of gravitational
          coupling increases the field flux lines around the kinemassic
          force generating assembly, thus resulting in ever increasing
          total nuclear polarization of half integral spin nuclei.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The non-electromagnetic
          forces so generated within the subject apparatus are primarily
          channeled through the high-kinemassic permeability material
          defining the series field circuit of the apparatus. The fact
          that the high speed rotatable wheels of both the generator and
          detector assemblies are capable of being positioned in a
          series aiding or series opposing relationship, facilitates the
          determination of the effective influence of the energies
          generated in one on the other.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector, when carefully
          balanced on its knife-edges as shown in Figures 3A and 3B,
          exhibits an oscillation period of 11 seconds. When the wheels
          are energized a stiffening action is induced due to the
          reaction of the compressed gas impingement against the wheel
          bucket 21b, since the jet nozzle is fixed with respect to the
          apparatus base. This results in a reduction of the oscillation
          period to approximately 6 seconds. A light image not shown is
          directed against the mirrored face of the knife-edge 19 and
          reflected onto a calibrated wall screen. Measurements were
          taken with the apparatus so operative, which measurements
          established the oscillatory extremes of the reflected light
          beam for a pole-aligned relationship of the spinning generator
          and detector wheels. The results of one such set of
          measurements are recorded in Figure 6. Therein, the x's and
          dots represent extremes in deviation while the large circles
          represent the mean thereof. The mean was in turn used to
          establish a null line to be compared with a similar null line
          derived from pole-opposed orientation of the generator and
          detector wheels. As a result, a displacement from equilibrium
          of approximately 13 arc minutes is shown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to minimize the
          shift of the null line, the field circuit polar relationship
          of the generator and detector poles was reversed every30 or 40
          minutes from a relation of poles aligned, to poles opposed, to
          poles aligned. An average null shift of 26 arc minutes is
          indicated in Figure 6. That the interaction between generator
          and detector was in fact accountable for the recorded results
          was demonstrably supported when the upper mass member was
          raised so as to create two air gaps one cm in length
          respectively. Predictably, the disruption to the field circuit
          continuity resulted in the failure of the apparatus to
          register a shift in the null lines upon reversal of the poles.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reference is now made to
          Figure 7 which discloses an apparatus constructed in
          accordance with the principles of the present invention for
          generating a time-variant secondary gravitational field. This
          apparatus is a mere modification of the apparatus in Figures 1
          and 2 wherein one detector assembly 15 has been removed and
          supplementary means are provided to mechanically implement the
          rotation of the generator assembly 14 about the axis
          perpendicular to the pane of the paper. These supplementary
          means are in the nature of an auxiliary motor 36 having a
          drive pulley 38 adapted to spin the generator assembly 14
          about an axis normal to the plane of the drawing and
          coincident with that of the shaft 30. The shaft 30 carries a
          pulley 40 which is driven by the motor and pulley assembly
          36-38 by way of a conventional drive belt 42. The wheel 21 of
          the generator assembly 14 is driven in the manner outlined
          above, namely by means of a source of compressed air not
          shown.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The supporting assembly
          depicted in Figure 7 in partially sectioned form as member 44,
          is in reality the equivalent of the series mass circuit of
          Figures 1 and 2, inverted or turned inside out so s to form a
          shield for the kinetic field generating apparatus. Included as
          part of the supporting assembly is member 44A which is
          provided to position the generator assembly 14 in the
          discontinuity formed in the mass circuit. The kinemassic field
          generated within the apparatus of Figure 7 upon energization
          of the wheel 21 is directed in an enveloping fashion about its
          generator, being confined in general to the shell. The cross
          sectional thickness of the shell along equipotential lines
          must be equal in order to ensure a homogenous field within the
          structure. If now the spin rate of the wheel 21 is made to
          vary, or if the generator assembly 14 is made to rotate about
          the axis defined by the shaft 30, a time-variant secondary
          gravitational field is induced in the toroidal space 46.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The secondary gravitational
          field undulates in a sinusoidal manner with the undulating
          kinemassic field confined to the series mass circuit. Since
          the kinemassic field in the dense mass circuit 44 has been
          restricted through permeability, into an enveloping shell
          about the generator 14, it follows that the induced undulating
          secondary gravitational field is likewise restricted to the
          enclosure 46 as the flux lines of both fields must interlink.
          In accordance with the analogous electromagnetic field theory,
          the kinemassic field flux lines and the secondary
          gravitational field flux lines interlink in such manner that,
          as the kinemassic field alternates, these interlinking loops
          decay and build up in alternate vector directions in proper
          phase relation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A hollow ring member 48 is
          positioned within the toroidal space 46 and supported thereby
          a series of fine steel wire spokes 50 secured to the ring and
          the outer portion of the inverted core housing 44 preferably
          along points of equipotential of the kinemassic field. Within
          the hollow ring 48 is contained a dense fluid such as mercury
          depicted in Figure 7 generally as member52. Alternatively, the
          ring-fluid combination may take the form of a single solid
          mass. In the latter event the mass circuit would be supported
          on bearings facilitating its rotation about an axis common to
          the axis of the generator 21 in order to permit mass flow or
          rotation of the mass circuit under the influence of the
          alternating secondary gravitational field. The shielding
          effected by the design considerations of the toroidal shell 44
          with respect to the primary gravitational field reduces the
          inertial parameter of mass acceleration within the toroidal
          space 46 in proportion to the ambient gravitational shielding
          effect. With reduced inertia there will be an appreciable
          rotational flow displacement of the mass circuit 48-52 fore
          ach half cycle of the induced secondary gravitational field,
          thereby further strengthening the coupling effected between
          the effective field forces, i.e., the primary gravitational
          field, the kinemassic field and the secondary gravitational
          field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Consider now that the
          apparatus of Figure 7 is energized such that the wheel 21
          spins about its axis creating a uniformly distributed
          kinemassic field throughout the entire field circuit referred
          to generally as that encompassed within the inverted core
          housing 44. As the generator assembly 14 is energized to
          rotate about the axis passing through shaft 30, a uniformly
          distributed alternating kinemassic field is established
          throughout the field circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The presence of the
          undulating kinemassic field produces a shielding effect within
          the inverted housing effectively restricting the induced
          secondary gravitational field while at the same time tending
          to shield or force out the flux due to the ambient
          gravitational field. As the spin rates of the wheel and the
          generator assembly about their respective axes are increased,
          there results a stronger undulating kinemassic force field of
          higher frequency. The spin rates may be so varied that a mean
          gravitational flux line density within the apparatus of Figure
          7 exists which is equivalent to the primary
          gravitational&nbsp; flux line density, i.e., that due to the
          earth and other cosmic bodies. This condition establishes a
          state of weightlessness or zero gravitational force of
          attraction with respect to other masses such as earth. For
          that particular value of gravitational field gradient.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the spin rates of the
          wheel and the generator assembly are further increased there
          results a "bowing-out" or spreading of the gravitational flux
          lines within the immediate proximity of the apparatus of
          Figure 7 so as to result in a lesser flux line density, thus
          resulting in the propulsion of the apparatus along the local
          gravitational field lines of force in a direction
          diametrically opposed to the local gravitational field force
          vector.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of the nature of the
          interaction of the primary gravitational field, the secondary
          gravitational field forces will continue to act upon the
          apparatus as it passes into lesser gravitational field
          gradients; however, it will do so with diminishing magnitudes
          until the local gravitational flux line density about the
          apparatus of Figure 7 is no longer effectively diminished
          thereby. The energy required to propel a vehicle powered by an
          engine, such as is described above, is accounted for by the
          way of the gravitational filed potential energy gained by such
          a vehicle as it passes to areas of lesser gravitational field
          intensities. Energy input into this engine would appear as the
          product of torque and rotational values about the spin axes of
          both the wheel and the generator assembly, and especially
          about the latter axis which is responsible for alternating the
          kinemassic field and thereby generating the secondary
          gravitational component.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As was mentioned above in
          explanation of the embodiment of Figures 1 and 2, the wheel 21
          and the generator assembly 14 are mounted so as to be
          rotatable in mutually orthogonal directions. It was further
          mentioned that such orthogonal rotation is not an absolute
          necessity, it being only necessary that relative motion be
          established between the wheel 21 and the stationary pole
          pieces 23. The generator assembly is made to rotate thereby
          effecting an undulation in the kinemassic field flux in the
          associated mass circuit. Figure 7A and 7B disclose a variation
          of the apparatus of Figure 7 which satisfies the basic
          requirements outlined above while at the same time providing
          certain advantages not available in the aforementioned
          structure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this respect Figures 7A
          and 7B disclose an embodiment wherein the spin axis of the
          equivalent wheel structure 21 and the generator assembly 14
          are concentric thereby eliminating precessional forces present
          in the embodiment of Figure 7 due to the rotation of the
          respective members about the two mutually orthogonal axes. The
          absence of precessional forces permits a close tolerance to be
          established between the cooperating faces of the wheel
          structure 21, the pole pieces 23 and the mass circuit 44.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The embodiment of Figures 7A
          and 7B is also to be preferred to that of Figure 7 in that the
          design of the generator assembly of the former permits the
          energization of the independently rotatable members 21 and 23
          by means of a single motor 36 differentially geared so as to
          effect the rotation of the wheel 21 at a speed in excess of
          that of the generator assembly, and as indicated, in a reverse
          direction thereto.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also indicated in the
          embodiment of Figures 7A and 7B is the orientation of the flux
          within the mass circuit, the latter being constructed
          preferably of bismuth. It should be understood that the
          direction of flux within the mass circuit reverses with each
          reversal in orientation of the equivalent pole pieces 23 due
          to the rotation of the generator assembly 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be apparent from the
          foregoing description that there has been provided an
          apparatus for generating time-variant kinemassic forces due to
          the dynamic interaction of relatively moving bodies. Although
          in its disclosed application the time-variant kinemassic force
          has been described in relation to its function in generating a
          secondary gravitational force, it should be readily apparent
          that other equally basic applications of these forces are
          contemplated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, in addition to
          providing an effective propulsion technique, the principles of

          generating localized areas of gravitational shielding for
          housing medical patients for which such weight reductions
          would be beneficial. In addition, the principles may be
          adapted to laboratory use, as for example the analysis of the
          effects of a sustained reduction of "g" value upon astronauts

and
method






          for generating a non-electromagnetic force field due to the
          dynamic interaction of relatively moving bodies through
          gravitational coupling, and for transforming such force fields
          into energy for doing useful work.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Description</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The method of generating
          such non-electromagnetic forces includes the steps of
          juxtaposing in field series relationship a stationary member,
          comprising spin nuclei material further characterized by a
          half integral spin value, and a member capable of assuming
          relative motion with respect to said stationary member and
          also characterized by spin nuclei material of one-half
          integral spin value; and initiating the relative motion of
          said one member with respect to the other whereby the
          interaction of the angular momentum property of spin nuclei
          with inertial space effects the polarization of the spin
          nuclei thereof, resulting in turn in a net component of
          angular momentum which exhibits itself in the form of a dipole
          moment capable of dynamically interacting with the spin nuclei
          material of the stationary member, thereby polarizing the spin
          nuclei material in said stationary member and resulting in a
          usable non-electromagnetic force.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to an
          apparatus and method for use in generating energy arising
          through the relative motion of moving bodies and for
          transforming such generated energy into useful work. In the
          practice of the present invention it has been found that when
          bodies composed of certain material are paced in relative
          motion with respect to one another there is generated an
          energy field therein not heretofore observed. This field is
          not electromagnetic in nature; being by theoretical prediction
          related to the gravitational coupling of moving bodies.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The initial evidence
          indicates that this non-electromagnetic field is generated as
          a result of the relative motion of bodies constituted of
          elements whose nuclei are characterized by half integral
          "spin" values; the spin of the nuclei being synonymous with
          the angular momentum of the nucleons thereof. The nucleons in
          turn comprise the elemental particles of the nucleus; i.e.,
          the neutrons and protons. For purposes of the present
          invention, the field generated by the relative motion of
          materials characterized by a half integral spin value is
          referred to as a "kinemassic" force field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be appreciated that
          relative motion occurs on various levels; i.e., there may be
          relative motion of discrete bodies as well as of the
          constituents thereof including on a subatomic level, the
          nucleons of the nucleus. The kinemassic force field under
          consideration is a result of such relative motion, being a
          function of the dynamic interaction of two relatively moving
          bodies including the elemental particles thereof. The value of
          the kinemassic force field, created by reason of the dynamic
          interaction of the bodies experiencing relative motion, is the
          algebraic sum of the fields created by reason of the dynamic
          interaction of both elementary particles and of the discrete
          bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For a closed system
          comprising only a stationary body, the kinemassic force, due
          to the dynamic interaction of the particles therein, is zero
          because of the random distribution of spin orientations of the
          respective particles. Polarization of the spin components so
          as to align a majority thereof in a preferred direction
          establishes a field gradient normal to the spin axis of the
          elementary particles. The present invention is concerned with
          an apparatus for establishing such a preferred orientation and
          as a result generating a net force component capable of being
          represented in various useful forms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly, the primary
          object of the present invention concerns the provision of
          means for generating a kinemassic field due to the dynamic
          interaction of relatively moving bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further object of the
          present invention concerns a force field generating apparatus
          wherein means are provided for polarizing material portions of
          the apparatus so as to reorient the spin of the elementary
          nuclear components thereof in a preferred direction thereby
          generating a detectable force field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The kinemassic force field
          finds theoretical support in the laws of physics, being
          substantiated by the generalized theory of relativity.
          According to the general theory of relativity there exists not
          only a static gravitational field but also a dynamic component
          thereof due to the gravitational coupling of relatively moving
          bodies. This theory proposes that two spinning bodies will
          exert force on each other. Heretofore the theoretical
          predictions have never been experimentally substantiated;
          however, as early as 1896, experiments were conducted in an
          effort to detect predicted centrifugal forces on stationary
          bodies place near large, rapidly rotating masses. The results
          of these early experiments were inconclusive, and little else
          in the nature of this type of work is known to have been
          conducted.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is therefore another
          object of the present invention to set forth an operative
          technique for generating a measurable force field due to
          gravitational coupling of relatively moving bodies.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another more specific object
          of the present invention concerns a method of generating a
          non-electromagnetic force field due to the dynamic interaction
          of relatively moving bodies and for utilizing such forces for
          temperature control purposes including the specific
          application of such forces to the control of lattice
          vibrations within a crystalline structure, thereby
          establishing an appreciable temperature reduction, these
          principles being useful for example in the design of a heat
          pump.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The foregoing objects and
          features of novelty which characterize the present invention
          as well as other objects of the invention are pointed out with
          particularity in the claims annexed to and forming part of the

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before getting into a
          detailed discussion of the apparatus and steps involved in the
          practice of the present invention it should be helpful to an
          understanding of the present invention if consideration is
          first given to certain defining characteristics, many of which
          bear an analogous relationship to electromagnetic field
          theory. A first feature is that the kinemassic field is
          vectorial in nature. The direction of the field vector is a
          function of the geometry in which the relative motion between
          mass particles takes place.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second significant
          property of the kinemassic field relates the field strength to
          the nature of the material in the field. This property may be
          thought of as the kinemassic permeability by analogy to the
          concept of permeability in magnetic field theory. The field
          strength is apparently a function of the density of the spin
          nuclei material comprising the field circuit members. Whereas
          the permeability in magnetic field theory is a function of the
          density of spin nuclei and the measure of magnitude of their
          half integral spin values. As a consequence of this latter
          property, the field may be directed and confined by
          interposing into it denser portions of desired configuration.
          For example, the field may be in large measure confined to a
          closed loop of dense material starting and terminating
          adjacent a system wherein relative motion between masses is
          occurring.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further property of the
          kinemassic force field relates field strength to the relative
          spacing between two masses in relative motion with respect to
          one another. Thus, the strength of the resultant field is a
          function of the proximity of the relatively moving bodies such
          that relative motion occurring between two masses which are
          closely adjacent will result in the generation of a field
          stronger than that created when the same two relatively moving
          bodies are spaced farther apart.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As mentioned above, a
          material consideration in generating the kinemassic force
          field concerns the use of spin nuclei material. By spin nuclei
          material is meant materials in nature which exhibit a nuclear
          external angular momentum component. This includes both the
          intrinsic spin of the unpaired nucleon as well as that due to
          the orbital motion of these nucleons.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the dynamic
          interaction field arising through gravitational coupling is a
          function of both the mass and the proximity of two relatively
          moving bodies, then the resultant force field is predictably
          maximized within the nucleus of an atom due to the relatively
          high densities of the nucleons, both in terms of mass and
          relative spacing, plus the fact that the nucleons possess both
          intrinsic and orbital components of angular momentum. Such
          force fields may in fact account for a significant portion of
          the nuclear binding force found in all nature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has been found that for
          certain materials, namely those characterized in a half
          integral spin value, the external component of angular
          momentum thereof will be accompanied by a force due to the
          dynamic interaction of the nucleons. This is the so-called
          kinemassic force which on a submacroscopic basis exhibits
          itself as a field dipole moment aligned with the external
          angular momentum vector. These moments are of sufficient
          magnitude that they interact with adjacent, or near adjacent
          spin nuclei field dipole moments of neighboring atoms.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This latter feature gives
          rise to a further analogy to electromagnetic field theory in
          that the interaction of adjacent spin nuclei field dipole
          moments gives rise to nuclear domain-like structures within
          matter containing sufficient spin nuclei material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although certain analogies
          exist between the kinemassic force field and electromagnetic
          field theory, it should be remembered that the kinemassic
          force is essentially non-responsive to or affected by
          electromagnetic force phenomena. This latte condition further
          substantiates the ability of the kinemassic field to penetrate
          through and extend outward beyond the ambient electromagnetic
          field established by the moving electrons in the atomic
          structure surrounding the respective spin nuclei</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As in electromagnetic field
          theory, in an unpolarized sample, the external components of
          angular momentum of the nuclei to be subjected to a kinemassic
          force field are originally randomly oriented such that the
          material exhibits no residual kinemassic field of its own.
          However, establishing the necessary criteria for such a force
          field effects a polarization of the spin components of
          adjacent nuclei in a preferred direction thereby resulting in
          a force field which may be represented in terms of kinemassic
          field flux lines to the direction of spin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fact that spin nuclei
          material exhibits external kinemassic forces suggests that
          these forces should exhibit themselves on a macroscopic basis
          and thus be detectable, when arranged in a manner similar to
          that for demonstrating the Barnet effect when dealing with
          electromagnetic phenomena.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Barnett effect a long
          iron cylinder, when rotated at high speed about its
          longitudinal axis, was found to develop a measurable component
          of magnetization, the value of which was found to be
          proportional to the angular speed. The effect was attributed
          to the influence of the impressed rotation upon the revolving
          electronic systems due to the mass property of the unpaired
          electrons within the atoms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the apparatus constructed
          in accordance with the foregoing principles it was found that
          a rotating member composed of spin nuclei material exhibits a
          kinemassic force field. The interaction of the spin nuclei
          angular momentum with inertial space causes the spin nuclei
          axes of the respective nuclei of the material being spun to
          tend to reorient parallel with the axis of the rotating
          member. This results in the nuclear polarization of the spin
          nuclei material. With sufficient polarization, an appreciable
          field of summed dipole moments emanates from the wheel rim
          flange surfaces to form a secondary dynamic interaction with
          the dipole moments of spin nuclei contained within the facing
          surface of a stationary body positioned immediately adjacent
          the rotating member.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the stationary body,
          composed of suitable spin nuclei material, is connected in
          spatial series with the rotating member, a circuitous form of
          kinemassic field is created; the flux of which is primarily
          restricted to the field circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Having now further defined
          the substantiating theory giving rise to the kinemassic forces
          operative in the present invention, reference is now made to
          the aforementioned drawings depicting in general an apparatus
          embodying the defining characteristics outlined above.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the foregoing
          discussion, it will be appreciated that for both the purpose
          of detecting and exploiting the kinemassic field, several
          basic apparatus elements are necessary. First, apparatus is
          needed to enable masses to be placed in relative motion to one
          another. In order to maximize field strength the apparatus
          should be capable of generating high velocities between the
          particles in relative motion. Furthermore, the apparatus
          should be configured so that the proximity of the particles
          which are in relative motion is maximized. The necessity of
          using relatively dense material comprising half integral spin
          nuclei for the field circuit has already been stressed. These
          and other features are discussed in greater detail below in
          explanation of the drawings depicting an implementation of the
          invention, primarily for detection of the kinemassic field.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In considering the drawings,
          reference will first be made to the general arrangement of
          components, as particularly shown in Figures 1 and 2. As
          viewed in Figure 1, the equipment is mounted upon a stationary
          base comprising a horizontal structure element 10 which rests
          upon permanent pilings of poured concrete 11 or other suitable
          structurally rigid material. It should be made clear at the
          outset that the stationary base although not a critical
          element in its present form nevertheless serves an important
          function in the subject invention. Thus, the stationary base
          acts as a stabilized support member for mounting the
          equipment, and perhaps more significantly, the horizontal
          portion thereof is of such material that it tends to localize
          the kinemassic force field to the kinemassic force field
          generating apparatus proper. This latter feature is discussed
          in more detail below. The surface feature is discussed in more
          detail below. The surface uniformity of the horizontal
          structure element 10 also facilitates the alignment of
          equipment components. In the reduction to practice embodiment
          of the present invention a layer of shock-absorbing material
          (not shown) was interposed beneath the stationary base and the
          floor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shown mounted on the
          horizontal structural element 10 is the kinemassic force field
          generating apparatus indicated generally as 20, the lower
          portion of which is referred to as the lower mass member 12.
          An upper mass member 13 is positioned in mirrored relationship
          with respect to member 12 and separated somewhat to provide
          two air gaps therebetween. The lower and upper mass members 12
          and 13, respectively, are formed of a particular brass alloy
          containing 89% copper, of which both isotopes provide a
          three-halves proton spin, 10% zinc, and 1% lead, as well as
          traces of tin and nickel. The zinc atom possesses one spin
          nuclei isotope which is 4.11% in abundance and likewise the
          lead also contain one spin nuclei isotope which is 22.6% in
          abundance. In order to gain an estimate of apparatus size, the
          upper circuit member has an overall length of 56 centimeters
          and a mass of 43 kilograms.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be seen that the
          constituents of the mass members are such as satisfy the
          criteria of half integral spin nuclei material for those
          apparatus parts associated with the fields and the use of
          non-spin material for those parts where it is desired to
          inhibit the field. Accordingly, all support or structural
          members, such as the horizontal structural element 10, consist
          of steel. The iron and carbon nuclei of these structural
          members are classed as no-spin nuclei and thus represent high
          relative reluctance to the kinemassic field. Supports 16 are
          provided to accommodate the suspension of the supper mass
          member 13. The supports 16 are of steel the same as the
          horizontal support element 10. The high relative reluctance of
          steel to the kinemassic field minimizes the field flux loss
          created in the field series circuit of mass members 12 and 13,
          the generator 14, and the detector 15. The loss of field
          strength is further minimized by employing high-reluctance
          isolation bridges at the points of contact between the lower
          and upper mass members 12 and 13, and the structural support
          members 10 and 16.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shunt losses within the
          apparatus were, in general, minimized by employing the
          technique of minimum mass contact; the use of low field
          permeability material at the isolation bridges or structural
          connections; and avoiding bulk mass proximity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A number of techniques were
          developed for optimizing the isolation bridge units including
          Carboloy cones and spherical spacers. As is depicted more
          clearly in Figures 3,4,and 5, the structural connection unit
          ultimately utilized consisted of a hardened 60° steel cone
          mounted within a setscrew and bearing against a hardened steel
          platen. The contact diameter of the cone against the platen
          measured approximately 0.007 inch and was loaded within
          elastic limits. Adjustment is made by means of turning the
          setscrew within a mated, threaded hole.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 2 is presented in
          rather diagrammatic form; however, the diagrammatic
          configuration emphasizes that it consists of a rotatable
          member corresponding to the generator 14 of Figure 1 which is
          "sandwiched" between a pair of generally U-shaped members
          corresponding to the lower and upper mass members 12 and 13 of
          Figure 1. The wheel of generator 14 is mounted for rotation
          about an axis lying in the plane of the drawing. When member
          14 is rotated rapidly with respect to the U-shaped members 12
          and 13, a kinemassic field is generated which is normal to the
          plane defined by the rotating member and within the plane of
          the drawing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As such, it may be
          represented in the drawing of Figure 2 as taking a generally
          counterclockwise direction with respect to the field series
          circuit members.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Referring once more to
          Figure 1, it is seen that support for the generator unit 14 is
          provided by way of a support assembly 17, also fabricated of
          steel components. The support assembly 17 is in turn clamped
          to the horizontal structural element 10 by way of bracket
          assemblies 18.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment of the
          present invention depicted in Figures 1 and 2, the lower and
          upper mass members 12 and 13 are fashioned into conical
          sections terminating in conical pole faces 12a and 13a in the
          area of the detector 15. This configuration tends to maximize
          the flux density in this area.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For isolation purposes, a
          curtain of transparent plastic material 19 is positioned so as
          to geometrically bisect the detector portion of the field
          circuit from the generator portion thereof. The function of
          the transparent curtain is to provide a degree of thermal
          isolation between the generator and detector units. Although
          not actually shown in Figure 2, the transparent curtain is of
          H configuration and forms a vertical plane normal to the plane
          of the drawing and symmetrically positioned with respect
          thereto.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Not shown in the drawings
          are a tunnel of transparent material and a film of flexible
          plastic material which surrounds the detector 15 and
          associated equipment and thus serve to further stabilize the
          temperature conditions, thereby diminishing the adverse
          effects due to thermal gradients.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before proceeding with the
          explanation of the operation of the apparatus disclosed in
          Figures 1 and 1, a more detailed description of certain
          portions of the structure will be given.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figures 3, 4, and 5 present
          the generator assembly 14 of Figures 1 and 2 in greater
          detail. In particular, these figures disclose the relationship
          between a freely rotatable wheel 21, a bearing frame 22, and a
          pair of pole pieces 23. The bearing frame 22 os of structural
          steel, and functions to spatially orient the three generator
          parts without shunting the generated field potential.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Positioning of the generator
          wheel 21 with respect to the cooperative faces of the pole
          pieces 23 is effected by way of the bearing frame upon which
          the generator wheel is mounted. In this respect the
          high-reluctance isolation bridges mentioned with respect to
          Figures 1 and 2 are herein shown as setscrews 24 which are
          adjustably positioned to cooperate with hardened steel platens
          25. The setscrews 24 are mounted on the pole pieces 23 and are
          adjustably positioned with respect to steel platens 25
          cemented to the bearing frame 22 so as to facilitate the
          centering of the generator wheel 21 with respect to the
          interface surfaces 23a of the pole pieces 23.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the implementation of the
          present invention the air gap formed between the generator
          wheel rim flanges and the stationary pole pieces 23 was
          adjusted to a light-rub relationship when the wheel was slowly
          rotated; as such this separation was calculated to be 0.001
          centimeter for a wheel spin rate of 28,000 rpm due to the
          resulting hoop tension. In the drawing of Figure 3 the spacing
          between the pole pieces 23 and the generator wheel rim flange
          has been greatly exaggerated to indicate that in fact such a
          spacing does exist.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator wheel 21
          utilized in the implementation of the present invention has an
          8.6 cm diameter and an axial rim dimension of 1.88cm. The rim
          flange surfaces 21a which are those field emanating areas
          closely adjacent the surfaces 23a of the pole pieces 23, are
          each 29.6 square cm. The rim portion of the wheel has a volume
          of 55.7 cubic cm neglecting the rim turbine slots 21b.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The generator wheel 21 and
          an associated mounting shaft 26 are mounted of the bearing
          frame 22 by means of enclosed double sets of matched high
          speed bearings 27.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Compressed air or nitrogen
          is used to drive the generator wheel by means of gas
          impingement against turbine buckets 21b cut in the wheel rim.
          The compressed gas is supplied through the supply line 28 and
          emanates from the air jet tube 29. Rate of spin is sensed by
          light rays reflected from the rim. For this purpose every
          other quadrant on the rim surface was painted black.
          Accordingly, light directed at the rim of the wheel will be
          reflected by the unpainted quadrants into light-sensing cells
          associated with a rate-measuring circuit of conventional
          design. Since the rate-detecting means form no part of the
          present invention they have not been depicted in the actual
          drawing.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shaft members 30 carry
          suitable bearing members 31 for rotatably mounting the
          generator assembly with respect to a second axis. The support
          assembly 17 of Figure 1 is partially represented in Figure 4,
          and, as noted above it provides the mounting means for
          positioning the generator assembly 14 with respect to the
          lower and upper mass members 12 and 13.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before proceeding to an
          explanation of the operation of the generator assembly with
          respect to the apparatus of Figure 1, reference is made to
          Figures 6 and 7 which disclose an enlarged view of the
          detector 15. The lower and upper mass members 12 and 13 are
          given a conical configuration so as to maximize kinemassic
          densities in the area of the working air gap, within which the
          detector is positioned. Figure 7 represents a sectional view
          taken across the working air gap, showing the projection of
          the conical surface of the upper mass member onto the
          corresponding surface of the lower mass member. Although
          symmetrical in shape, the projection of the conical surface of
          the upper mass member onto the corresponding surface of the
          lower mass member has been slightly reduced for purposes of
          illustration. In the subject apparatus the two conical brass
          pole faces 12a and 13a form a working air gap measuring 0.114
          cm across. Each disc shape pole face measures 0.71 square cm
          in area.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector or probe 15 is
          of indium arsenide and is inserted in the detector air gap
          with a spacing from either pole face of 0.02 cm, the target
          thickness measuring 0.07 cm. Both indium and arsenic possess
          100% isotope abundance of half integral spin nuclei; arsenic
          nuclei consist of one isotope of three halves proton spin,
          while indium nuclei are of two isotopes, both being
          nine-halves proton spin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A second probe of similar
          semi-conductor material 15a is shown in Figure 6 as being
          positioned in close proximity to the first detector. Both
          probes 15 and15a are shown mounted on a boom 15b which is
          shock-mounted by means not shown. Shock mounting of the
          components is important due to the relatively close spacing
          between the probe and conical pole faces. Lateral displacement
          of the second probe from the vicinity of the working air gap
          measured as 25 cm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although not critical to the
          overall theory of the present invention, the selection of a
          semi-conductor probe of the nature heretofore described and
          the effective results realized through the positioning of the
          probe 14 and the associated probe 15a with respect to the
          working air gap between the conical pole faces as well as the
          manner in which signals measured by the two probes is
          correlated, are important to an understanding of the forces
          involved. In this respect it is important to realize that the
          first and second semi-conductor probes were differentially
          connected in terms of electrical output and are
          polarity-sensitive to magnetic field measurements. Together
          the two probes constitute a differential magnetic probe for an
          FW Bell Gaussmeter. As conventionally used, such probes
          provide a measure of the magnetic field intensity from both AC
          and DC sources, via the Hall Effect. The Hall Effect is a well
          known phenomenon whereby a potential gradient is developed in
          a direction transverse to the direction of current flow within
          a conductor when the conductor is positioned in a magnetic
          field. It should be clearly understood, however, that no
          magnetic field phenomenon is associated with the present
          invention. Thus the lateral voltages which are measured in the
          present arrangement are not Hall voltages. This statement is
          substantiated by the explanation that follows, clearly
          establishing the absence of any hall voltage indicative of
          magnetic fields. In this respect, the two probes are
          differentially connected for magnetic field measurements to
          eliminate errors due to ambient magnetic field changes whereas
          they are additively connected for sensing changes in thermal
          vibration of crystal lattices. Although polarity sensitive to
          the magnetic field, the differential magnetic probe is not
          polarity-sensitive to changes in thermal vibration of crystal
          lattices.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fact that the probes are
          polarity-sensitive with respect to magnetic field but not with
          respect to the direction of crystal lattice vibrations means
          that when the probes are reversed with respect to polarity any
          discernable difference in the output readings might be
          attributed to a magnetic field induced into the system by the
          rotating wheel. Inasmuch as the field conductive portions of
          the apparatus are comprised predominantly of brass which is a
          paramagnetic material, no appreciable magnetic field should be
          detected. This in fact corresponds to the actual results in
          that no measurable difference in magnetic flux was recorded
          when the polarity of the probe was changed. It is thus
          possible to realistically discount magnetic fields as
          influencing operating results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As seen in Figure 7, the
          detector 15 has associated therewith two pairs of contacts 32
          and 33, the first of which represents current contacts
          connected in turn to a source of constant current 34 of
          conventional design. The second set of contacts 33 are voltage
          contacts connected to detect any potential gradient transverse
          to the direction of current flow within the detector. The
          meter 36 represents means for detecting such potential
          differences and may be in the form of a very sensitive
          galvanometer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A thermocouple 35 is
          positioned in close proximity to the detector 15 to monitor
          the temperature thereof. Temperature differences, such as
          recorded by the thermocouple 35, are used for purposes of
          providing correction figures to the test results. A similar
          thermocouple is used in conjunction with the second detector
          15a, as well as with the upper mass member particularly in the
          area of the generator wheel. Thermocouples are used for
          temperature monitoring since the energy change of their
          conducting electrons, by which they sense temperature change,
          are not measurably affected by the kinemassic field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Proceeding now to an
          explanation of the operation of the subject invention, it will
          be appreciated that in accordance with the theory of operation
          of the present apparatus when the generator wheel is made to
          spin at rates upwards of 10 or 20 thousand rpm, effective
          polarization of spin nuclei within the wheel structure
          gradually occurs. This polarization gradually rises to
          domain-like structures which continue to grow so as to extend
          their field dipole moment across the interface separating the
          rim 21 from the pole pieces 23. Secondary dynamic interactions
          of gravitational coupling between respective dipoles increase
          the field flux lines around the apparatus field circuit, thus
          resulting in ever-increasing total nuclear polarization of
          half integral spin nuclei.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The non-electromagnetic
          forces so generated within the subject apparatus are directed
          to the working air gap within which is positioned the
          semi-conductor probe 15. Therein the kinemassic forces are
          constructively used to reduce the vibrational degrees of
          freedom of the crystal lattice structure, resulting in a
          change of its electrical conductivity property. More
          specifically, the kinemassic field, due to the dynamic
          interaction of the gravitational coupling of the mass
          components of the wheel in relation to the stationary portions
          of the pole pieces in immediate proximity therewith, is
          restricted to the relatively high permeability material
          comprising the lower and upper mass members, and is
          concentrated at the working air gap by means of the conical
          pole pieces. Inserted in the air gap is the probe of
          semiconductor spin nuclei material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Control circuitry connected
          to two of the four contacts on the semiconductor probe 15 is
          designed to maintain a constant current flow across these
          contacts. At the same time the ambient temperature of the area
          surrounding the equipment is permitted to increase. In fact
          the increase in ambient temperature is initiated well in
          advance of the initiation of rotation of the generator wheel
          giving rise to the non-electromagnetic kinemassic force field.
          The constant increase in temperature is meant to mask out
          otherwise positive and negative temperature variations
          resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio of measurement.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In light of the gradual and
          constant increase in temperature of both the equipment and
          ambient conditions surrounding the equipment, it might be
          expected that the thermal vibrations of crystal lattice of the
          semiconductor probe would likewise increase. In actuality, a
          measurable decrease in crystal lattice vibrations is detected
          within the semiconductor probe. The actual measurements
          recorded are in terms of nanovolts of meter movement, and
          correspond to a decrease in lateral voltages measured across
          the semiconductor probe. These values can only be accounted
          for by an effective polarization of the spin nuclei of the
          lattice structure due to the polarizing effects of the applied
          kinemassic force field. The polarization results in a change
          in the specific heat property of the crystal material, which
          in turn reflects itself as an increase in electrical
          conductivity measurable by the galvanometer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Reference is now made to
          Figure 8 which discloses in graphical relationship the results
          achieved by various test arrangements of the semiconductor
          probe with respect to the subject apparatus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the interpretation of the
          graphical relationships of Figure 8 it should be understood
          that corrections for temperature variations have already been
          applied. These temperature corrections account for the heat
          applied to the system, as well as that due to the change in
          specific heat property of the apparatus due to frictional
          heating, as well as that due to the change in specific heat
          property of the apparatus, principally the brass members die
          to their relative bulk. The later component represents a
          positive contribution to the ambient temperature due to the
          decrease in degrees of freedom of the crystal lattice
          structure of the spin nuclei material when subjected to the
          kinemassic force field. The above mentioned heat factors
          result in the increased temperature of the brass members of
          the apparatus; these increases being monitored by way of
          thermocouples positioned in proximity to the kinemassic field
          generating apparatus, member 35 of Figure 7 being an example
          thereof.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Curve 1 of Figure 8
          represents a static test conducted over a period of 150
          minutes, values being recorded at 3 minute intervals which was
          standard procedure for the entire test series. Information
          gathered in respect to curve 1 was useful in determining
          compensating factors for ambient temperature changes. In curve
          1 as well as each of the other curves of Figure 8, the
          ordinate values measure a level of thermal vibration, in
          nanovolts of meter movement, of InAs lattice structure against
          time in which ambient temperature change of the two probes has
          been quantitatively compensated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Curve 2 represents a portion
          of a standard test run, the portion shown being the active
          portion of the curve, i.e., that portion of the curve for
          which measurable results were recorded due to the spinning of
          the generator wheel. Not included in curve 2 are measurements
          taken during a 78-minute pre-energizing thermal calibration
          period typical of the initial portion of each test run
          conducted. The pre-energizing thermal calibration period is
          effected in order to illustrate the ambient temperature
          compensation of the probes and as such is similar to that of
          the static test of curve 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The first 45 minutes of the
          indicated 150 minute test period of curve 2 represents the
          time during which the continuity of the negatively sloping
          curve prior to, during and following the time interval of the
          wheel returning to its no-spin state, and subsequently (an
          indication of a return toward thermal equilibrium percentage
          distribution of spin angular moment) is consistent with the
          explanation advanced above concerning the force field
          generated due to the dynamic interaction of relatively moving
          bodies. It should be noted with respect to curve 2 that
          separate test runs conducted some 6 weeks apart tend to
          corroborate the independent test results. The results of the
          two separate tests are superimposed in curve 2. These two
          tests, in addition to being spaced in time, were spaced many
          test runs apart. The two test results further establish the
          repeatability of the operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The change in thermal
          vibration of the InAs crystal lattice for the test run of
          curve 2 is approximately equivalent to an11° C reduction in
          probe temperature. This figure has been substantiated by
          computer studies. The computer has also been used to
          statistically analyze the test data and establish the
          probability of error in terms of the information recorded. In
          this respect the results of the computerized study indicate a
          probability of error of 1 in 1 billion. Since any ration in
          excess of 1 in 20 eliminates the probability of chance
          occurrence, the results obtained in the present instance
          should be above reproach.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to substantiate the
          distance dependency of the gravitational coupling force due to
          the dynamic interaction of relatively moving bodies it was
          predicted that increasing the separation between the generator
          rim flange 21a and the cooperating surface of the pole pieces
          23a should measurably reduce the results obtained. The results
          obtained when this separation was increased to 0.006 cm
          appears in curve 3. A comparison of these results with those
          of curve 2 seemingly substantiates the conclusion that upon
          widening the gap a lessening of the dynamic interaction due to
          gravitational coupling between the spinning wheel and the
          stationary pole piece actually occurs.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The data of curve 4 was
          taken with the air gap separation of the wheel to pole piece
          established at 0.001 cm as in the arrangement of curve 2;
          however, the duration of wheel spin was decreased from 45
          minutes to 30 minutes. Curve 2 results are shown superimposed
          on the solid line of curve 4. The relative magnitudes of
          curves 2 and 4, when so contrasted with their respective wheel
          spin periods, would appear to indicate a degree of half
          integral spin nuclei polarization saturation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Curve 5 depicts the results
          achieved by way of a shunt test wherein two lead bars were
          secured to the stationary brass bodies of the generator
          assembly so as to measure the effect of shunting the field at
          zones of maximum field potential. As contrasted with the
          results of curve 2, superimposed thereon, a statistically as
          well as visually significant difference is associated with the
          experimental results which, realistically, may be attributed
          to the shunting effect. The statistical study mentioned above
          substantiates the distinguishable nature of the data groups
          resulting in curves 2 and 5.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Curve 6 depicts the results
          of a test run in which the field permeability has been
          eliminated by removal from the test apparatus of the upper
          mass member and the two detector conical pole faces. The lower
          mass member has also been adjusted downward to as to rest on
          the horizontal structural element 10. At the same time the
          spatial relationship between the generator assembly and the
          two differentially connected probes was not altered. As may be
          observed from the curve 6, there occurred no change in the
          thermal vibration of the InAs crystal lattice. The plot
          scatter observable during the 45 minutes wheel spin period is
          attributable to increased temperature gradients which
          developed between the probes and the respective thermocouples
          in the absence of the various filed circuit member thermal
          masses.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further experimental results
          are available to substantiate the heretofore stated
          conclusions concerning the operating characteristics of the
          subject apparatus. In this respect reference is made to the
          copending application of the present inventor entitled Method
          &amp; Apparatus for Generating a Secondary Gravitational Force
          Field, field Nov. 4, 1968 and bearing Serial No. 773,051, the
          subject of which concerns an apparatus for establishing a
          time-variant kinemassic force field.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It will be apparent from the
          foregoing description that there has been provided an
          apparatus for generating and transforming kinemassic forces
          due to a dynamic interaction field arising through
          gravitational coupling of relatively moving bodies. Although
          in its original application the kinemassic force has been
          applied to the reduction of thermal vibrations in the lattice
          structure of a crystal, it should be readily apparent that
          other more significant uses of these forces are contemplated.

          well be applied to any system in which bodies are
          non-responsive or only partially responsive to conventional
          forces such as electromagnetic force fields. Thus, the present
          invention should have particular applicability to the
          stabilization of plasma particles, pursuant to controlled
          thermal nuclear fusion, or in the governing of temperatures
          and thermal energies within matter.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          pertains to manipulation of atomic nuclear structure so as to
          modify the state of an energy transfer medium, and utilization
          of the modified medium. More particularly, the invention
          pertain to effecting reorientation of nucleons of a material
          whose spin number (1) is half-integral, and imposing the
          effect of such orientation on a medium adapted to do
          productive work.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the past century great
          strides have been made in harnessing the three degrees of
          translational movement of electrons in the electromagnetic
          regime. Very little if anything has been done to utilize the
          inertial regime comprising the relatively massive nucleons,
          and particularly the three degrees of rotational freedom
          thereof, one of which is preempted by nuclear spin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In my US Patent # 3,626,606,
          I demonstrated how, by applying a rotational force to material
          whose nuclear spin number (I) is half-integral, a
          reorientation can be achieved in the nuclear structure. In my
          US Patent # 3,626,605, I demonstrated how a time variant may
          be imposed on the output resulting from such reorientation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It immediately becomes
          evident that there are potentially many, many uses of these
          reoriented nucleons. In all probability, techniques will be
          found which t some extent parallel those employed for
          utilization of the electron in the electromagnetic field, and
          it becomes clear that the thus reoriented nuclear structure
          may lend itself to such uses as modification of the
          gravitational field acting on a body so as to alter its
          gravitational attraction toward another body, separation of
          isotopes by distinguishing between nuclei according to their
          nucleon content, generating of gravity waves for communication
          and other energy transfer, stabilizing of plasma and
          maintenance of plasma density for controlled nuclear fusion,
          possible harnessing of cosmic gravitational energy in addition
          to utilization in many, many other fields.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For purposes of
          demonstration the utilization of the inventio0n in heat pumps
          will be explained. For brevity, material whose spin number (I)
          is half-integral will be referred to hereafter as "spin nuclei
          material". As in US Patent # 3,626,605 and 3,636,606, the
          generated field will be referred to as a "kinemassic field".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Spin Values (I) for the
          isotopic forms of the elements are well known and may be found
          in tabular form, for example, "The NMR Table, 5th Edition"
          published by Varian Associates of Palo Alto, CA. Typical among
          substances in elemental form having such half integral spin
          values are beryllium with a neutron spin of I - 3/2, aluminum
          with a proton spin of I = 5/2, chlorine of which both isotopes
          provide proton spins of I -3/2, vanadium (useful for alloys)
          of which one isotope of 99.76% abundance provides a proton
          spin of I = 7/2, cobalt with a proton spin of I - 7/2, copper
          of which both isotopes provide spin of I = 3/2, and bromine of
          which both isotopes provide spins of I = 3/2. These chemical
          elements and others of half integral spin values may be
          alloyed together as well as to elements possessing no-spin and
          integral spin nuclei provided quantity percentages of such
          additional elements are small.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In US Patent # 3,626,606 it
          was explained that the kinemassic force resulting from this
          dynamic interaction of relatively moving bodies of spin nuclei
          material can be utilized for temperature control purposes
          including the specific application of such kinemassic forces
          to the control of lattice vibrations within a crystalline
          structure thereby establishing an appreciable temperature
          reduction, these principles being useful, for example, in the
          design of a heat pump.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The half-integral spin
          nucleus of this spin nuclei material is characterized by
          possession of an odd nucleon, either neutron or proton, which
          is consequently unpaired. The remainder of the nucleons of
          such a half-integral spin nucleus are acted upon by both the
          short-range force and the weaker long-range force which
          together constitute the nuclear binding force. The unpaired
          nucleon is acted upon only by the weaker long-range force and
          it is the energy of the absent short-range force
          characterizing the half-integral spin nucleus contained
          therein due to their absent short-range force nuclear energy
          causing an available, responsive energy, this polarization
          resulting in a diminishing of the lattice vibrations within
          said crystalline structure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The kinemassic field may be
          utilized in static form for reducing the specific heat of such
          spin nuclei material. Establishing of this static field energy
          within said atomic structure effectively reduces its specific
          heat capacity concomitantly causing a controlled temperature
          increase therein due to the presence of the substance's
          enthalpy content. Concomitantly there is caused to occur a
          decrease of temperature which is possessed prior to
          application of the static field energy. This below-ambient
          temperature is caused by the now-reduced enthalpy content
          which resulted from the heat flow away from the substance
          which had occurred when it contained the static field energy.
          As a consequence heat now flows back into this substance from
          the ambient substance of higher temperature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is provided for in this
          invention that the substance, with its controllable specific
          heat property, be capable of physical transport from one
          spatial location to another. However, for the following
          explanation these locations will be limited to two in number.
          For both spatial locations, the ambient substance possesses an
          adequate thermal conductivity property. If now the static
          field energy is caused to be present within the transportable
          substance of controlled variable specific heat property, when
          at the first of these spatial locations but removed from this
          substance when it has been transported to the second of these
          locations, it is evident that heat flow from the transportable
          substance into the ambient substance will always occur at the
          first location identified by the presence of the static field
          energy and that heat flow from the ambient substance into the
          transportable substance will always occur at the second
          location identified by the absence of the static field energy.
          It is then apparent that the transported substance of spin
          nuclei material alternately and cyclically experiences
          temperature changes such that, at the designated first
          location, its temperature exists at a value higher than that
          of the temperature of the ambient substance and also, at the
          designated location, that its temperature exists at a lower
          value than that of the temperature of the ambient substance.
          This one-way heat flow from the transported substance into the
          ambient substance of the designated first location in
          combination with the one-way heat flow from the ambient
          substance of the designated second location into the
          transported substance, this dual heat flow phenomenon, then
          constitutes a heat pump.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although several techniques
          are known for altering specific heat, such as changing the
          density of a gas, the technique utilized in this invention
          concerns the limiting of the degrees of freedom of particle
          vibration of a substance by means of a static energy field.
          More specifically, consider the thermal vibration of a crystal
          structure. The assembly of atoms bound together by local
          atomic forces, composing a crystal lattice, is capable of

          solid-state heat pump. As disclosed in Figures 1 and 2,
          housing 1 encloses a duct system 2. Air or other fluid is
          conducted through inlet 3 and into blower 4. Air under
          pressure emerging from blower 4 is conducted to manifold 5
          where it is divided into two air streams, one of which flows
          through lower duct 6 to reduced-temperature heat flow zone 7
          and then to exhaust outlet 8. The other stream of air from
          manifold 5 flows upwardly through upper duct 9 to
          increased-temperature heat flow zone 10 and then to exhaust
          outlet 11.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The kinemassic force, which
          is utilized in accordance with the invention to effect the
          desired heat flow is generated in a kinemassic generator rotor
          20. Portions of an upper field circuit segment 21 and a lower
          field circuit segment 22 are juxtaposed to rotor 20 to form
          therewith a part of a kinemassic field circuit. At the
          increased temperature heat flow zone 10 a heat flow is
          effected with air or other fluid as hereinafter described.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To achieve this heat flow,
          an enthalpy transfer ring 25 is rotatable on a shaft 26 driven
          by a belt 27 through a pulley 28 mounted on said shaft 26.
          Said belt 27, in turn, is driven by a pulley 29 mounted on a
          shaft 30 forming a part of a gear reduction assembly 31.
          Blower 4 is driven by blower motor 32 which is also connected
          to a rotor shaft 33 (Figure 3) and worm gear 34 through a worm
          wheel 35 which is integral with a second worm gear 35 which is
          integral with a second worm gear 34a which, in turn, drives a
          worm wheel 35a connected to shaft 30.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As seen in Figure 3 the
          kinemassic generator rotor 20 includes a generator drive motor
          40 which, in the present embodiment, is shown as an inside-out
          electric motor having shaft 41 mounted integrally on upper
          field circuit segment 21. The motor may, for example, be a
          hysteresis type motor and driven by a solid stage
          frequency-controlled source.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The outer housing 42 of
          drive motor 40 is adapted to rotate and has integrally mounted
          thereon a cylindrical generator rotor member 43 formed of spin
          nuclei-containing material. Drive motor 40 is adapted to
          rotate cylindrical generator rotor member 43 at extremely high
          rates of rotation. The kinemotive force generated is a direct
          function of rate of rotation, so that it is desirable to
          achieve the highest rate of rotation compatible with the
          permissible stresses in the system. These stresses vary with
          the physical size and proportions of said cylindrical
          generator rotor member 43 and the material of which it is
          composed. Such rates of rotation can range from approximately
          30,000 rpm to values of 100,000 rpm or greater, the lower
          limit preferably being in the neighborhood of 50,000 rpm.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Cylindrical generator rotor
          member 43 is formed with a flat pole face surfaces identified
          as generator lower pole-face 44 and generator upper pole-face
          45 at its lower and upper ends respectively which are
          juxtaposed to flat pole face surfaces identified as lower
          field pole-face 46 and upper field pole-face 47 forming a part
          respectively of lower field circuit segment 22 and upper field
          circuit segment 21. It is essential to maintain air gaps of
          minimum width between pole face surfaces 44, 46 and between
          pole face surfaces 45, 47 in order to provide maximum
          kinemassic field permeability as well as to optimize the
          secondary interaction of kinemassic field generating.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The upper and lower field
          circuit segments 21 and 22 are formed of spin
          nuclei-containing material and each terminates adjacent
          enthalpy transfer ring 25 as upper enthalpy transfer pole-face
          48 and lower enthalpy transfer pole face 49, respectively. The
          pole faces 48 and 49 are cylindrical surface segments and are
          equal in surface area. As seen in Figures 1 and 2, these
          respective pole faces 48 and 49 so encompass a portion of
          enthalpy transfer ring 25. In order to minimize reluctance,
          the respective air gaps formed by pole faces 48 and 49 and the
          juxtaposed portion of enthalpy transfer ring 25 should be of
          minimum air gap width.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Enthalpy transfer ring 25 is
          provided with a multiplicity of enthalpy transfer surfaces
          which may be in the form of tubular channels 55 which, in
          part, function to increase the enthalpy transfer surface area
          resulting in greater heat flow between the enthalpy transfer
          ring 25 and an enthalpy transfer fluid which is caused by
          blower 4 to flow through duct 9, through these tubular
          channels 55 and then to exhaust outlet 11. The tubular
          channels 55, only a few typical ones of which are shown, have
          a second function of reducing the cross-sectional area of a
          kinemassic field circuit in the increased-temperature heat
          flow zone 10 in order to increase the flux density within the
          permeable portion of ring 25 within zone 10 while imparting a
          minimum increased reluctance to the overall field circuit.
          This increased flux density within the permeable portion of
          ring 25 within zone 10 results in greater reduction of the
          specific heat of ring 25 within zone 10. The tubular channels
          55 may be variously configured and distributed to achieve the
          foregoing results.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">End plate 60 may be
          accurately pinned then bolted to circuit segments 21 and 22 to
          maintain the air gaps in position and to support segment 22.
          Also, connecting block 61 is provided at an intermediate
          position between segments 21 and 22 for the same purpose.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operation, after the

          blower 4 to manifold 5 where it is subdivided into a lower
          stream flowing through duct 6 and an upper stream flowing
          through duct 9.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The enthalpy transfer ting
          25, which rotates at a suitably low speed, for example, 1 rpm,
          will undergo a reduction in specific heat in any given portion
          and then under the influence of the kinemassic force extending
          between pole faces 48 and 49. The air passing through upper
          duct 9 will be forced through those tubular channels 55 which
          are at the instant in the increased-temperature heat flow zone
          10 adjacent pole pieces 48 and 49 with the result that the air
          will experience a temperature rise occurring in said given
          portion of enthalpy transfer ring 25 due to the reduction of
          its specific heat arising from the polarization of its spin
          nuclei under the influence of the kinemassic force, whereby
          the air which emerges from exhaust outlet 11 will possess a
          temperature higher than its temperature possessed when it
          previously flowed through duct 9.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As enthalpy transfer ring 25
          continues to rotate, so that said portion thereof departs from
          the spin nuclei polarizing effect of the kinemassic field flux
          lines of zone 10, the specific heat will increase again to its
          normal value thereby causing the temperature of said given
          portion to drop below that value existent prior to entering
          zone 10 because of the reduced enthalpy now contained therein.
          The lower stream of air is forced from duct 6 through those
          tubular channels 55 in the reduced-temperature heat flow zone
          7 with the result that said given portion of enthalpy transfer
          ring 25, due to its changed state of increased specific heat,
          will absorb heat from the ambient flowing air, as said given
          portion of ring 25 reaches zone 7, the result being that the
          air emerges from outlet 8 with a temperature lower than that
          temperature possessed when it was flowing through duct 6. IT
          will be noted, as can be seen from Figure 2, that the
          increased-temperature heat flow zone 10 is offset, with
          respect to the vertical, from reduced-temperature heat flow
          zone 7, this offsetting being desirable for optimum
          coordination of the specific heat reduction and recovery times
          respectively of the chosen material forming ring 25 in its
          passage into and from the zone 10. The positions and
          configuration of zones 7 and 10 may be varied depending on the
          specific heat properties of the material forming ring 25.</font>

          inlet duct 3', best shown in Figure 5, which leads air to a
          rotary blower 4' mounted on rotor shaft 33' driven by blower
          motor 32' through, but bypassing, a drive unit 31' which may
          be, if desired and as shown, in the form of a harmonic drive

          driven by blower motor 32' through drive unit 31' in
          counter-rotation to rotary blower 4'. While the rate of
          rotation of rotary blower 4' is preferably between 1745 and
          3500 rpm, the rate of counter-rotation of enthalpy transfer
          ring 25' is relatively slow, for example, one to several rpm.
          A reduced-temperature duct 6' for leading cooled air from the

          similar side baffle (not shown), the width of duct 6' being
          sufficient to snugly overlap enthalpy transfer ring 25'.
          Similarly, an increased-temperature duct 9' for leading heated
          air from the system to an exhaust 11' is formed by upper
          baffle 9a, lower baffle 9b, side baffle 9c, and another side

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kinemassic generator rotor
          20' is provided for generating the desired kinemassic force.
          As seen in Figures 5 and 5A, the rotor 20' includes a

          "inside-out" type having a stationary shaft 41' on which is
          mounted a winding 41a. The drive motor 40' may be powered by a

          pole-face surfaces 44', 47' and between pole-face surfaces
          45', 46' in order to provide maximum kinemassic field circuit

          string end describing the involute surface of the channel.
          Such an involute channel in conjunction with the
          counter-rotating relation between blower 4' and enthalpy
          transfer ring 25' serve to enhance the enthalpy transfer
          effect between involute surface and the fluid due to the
          surface impingement arising from the angular paths required of
          the fluid particles. More important, the involute channels 55'
          permit a uniform cross-section of field permeable material
          distribution from inner radius to outer radius of the enthalpy
          transfer ring 25' while also causing the kinemassic field flux
          density increase described for the first embodiment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in Figure 4, the
          periphery of blower 4' is partially surrounded by fixed
          shrouds 5a and an adjustable shroud 5b adapted to control the
          amount of air flowing into ducts 6' and 9'. The adjustable
          shroud 5b is attached by bolt and slot connections to the
          housing of blower 4'. The adjustable shroud 5b is integral
          with inlet sleeve 5c as shown in Figure 5B in parallel
          perspective. Inlet sleeve 5c is designed to concentrically
          nest, in a rotatable sliding relation, within inlet duct 3' as
          shown in Figure 5. Flange 5d of inlet sleeve 5c possesses an
          arc slot 5e of a sufficient number of angular degrees that, in
          conjunction with a bolt stud 5f secured to housing 1' and
          extending through arc slot 5e in combination with wing nut 5g,
          adjustable shroud 5b can be fixed in any required angular
          orientation so as to apportion the air flow in cooperation
          with shrouds 5a into ducts 6' and 9'.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In operation air under
          pressure emerging from blower 4' is divided into two air
          streams by means of the shrouds 5a and 5b. One air stream
          flows directly into a reduced-temperature enthalpy transfer
          zone 7' and then through reduced-temperature duct 6' to
          exhaust 8'. The second air stream flows directly into
          increased-temperature enthalpy transfer zone 10' and then
          through increased-temperature duct 9' to exhaust 11'. The
          fixed shrouds 5a are carefully positioned for directing the
          air into the two enthalpy transfer zones 7' and 10'. The
          number of involute channels 55' which are effective at any one
          time to pass air through enthalpy transfer zones 7' and 10'
          can be adjusted by varying the setting of movable shroud 5b.
          By adjusting said shroud 5b so as to reduce the air flow rate
          through the reduced-temperature enthalpy transfer zone 7',
          while simultaneously increasing air flow rate through the
          increased-temperature enthalpy transfer zone 10', a lesser
          amount of enthalpy will be transferred out of said ring within
          the increased-temperature enthalpy transfer zone 10', thus
          resulting in a gradually increasing enthalpy deficit in
          enthalpy transfer ring 25'. This will then cause the mean
          temperature of the enthalpy transfer ring 25' to reduce until
          there is no longer an imbalance between the rate of enthalpy
          introduced and the rate of enthalpy removed from enthalpy
          transfer ring 25'. Thus, there is provided a self-stabilizing
          system since the temperature difference between the ambient
          temperature air, arriving through inlet duct 3' into the
          involute channels 55' within the increased-temperature
          enthalpy transfer zone 10', and the surface temperature of the
          involute channels 55' will diminish as the average temperature
          of the enthalpy transfer ring 25' reduces.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The extremes of temperature
          difference of enthalpy transfer ring 25', occurring between
          the maximum existent in those involute channels 55' located in
          enthalpy transfer zone 10' and the minimum existent in those
          involute channels 55' located in the enthalpy transfer zone
          7', not only are dependent upon their temperature values above
          0° K as reflected by the average temperature of enthalpy
          transfer ring 25', but also by the particular half-integral
          spin nuclei utilized in the enthalpy transfer ring 25'. These
          temperature differences are therefore limited and consequently
          determined by the temperature at which self-stabilization will
          occur as exemplified by that state where the temperature of
          the air or other fluid entering inlet duct 3' is of the same
          value as that temperature of the involute channels 55' located
          in the enthalpy zone 10'. That temperature at which
          self-stabilization occurs can be significantly lowered by
          returning to inlet duct 3', by means of commonplace ducting
          and therefore not shown, a portion of the lower temperature
          air leaving reduced-temperature duct 6' to exhaust 8'. Thus
          the average temperature of enthalpy transfer ring 25' can be
          lowered to a value considerably greater than that temperature
          difference existent in enthalpy transfer ring 25' between its
          maximum and minimum values at any moment of time.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is therefore significant
          to note that a reduction of the enthalpy transfer ring 25 or
          25' mean temperature of from 70° to 35° F represents a
          reduction of only 6.6% with respect to 0° K and that this
          technique of heat pumping via cyclic changing of a material
          specific heat by way of the kinemassic field force is not
          restricted to a narrow temperature range as is the case in the
          conventional heat pump with its narrow limits of
          temperature-pressure parameters required for boiling and
          condensing states. For example, the temperature difference
          between the inflowing air or other fluid entering inlet duct
          3' and the outgoing air or fluid leaving exhaust 8' can thus
          be increased by adjusting the blower motor movable shroud 5b,
          or by other equivalent controls, so as to reduce the air or
          fluid rate of flow through those involute channels 55' located
          within the reduced-temperature enthalpy transfer zone 7' and
          simultaneously increasing the air or fluid rate through those
          involute channels located within the increased-temperature
          enthalpy transfer zone 10' while causing the temperature of
          the outgoing air or other fluid of exhaust 8' to be
          progressively lowered by means of the reintroduction of a
          portion of this reduced-temperature air or other fluid of
          exhaust 8' back into the inlet duct 3'.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conversely, if it is desired
          to increase the air or fluid temperature difference between
          the inflowing air or fluid entering inlet duct 3' and the
          outgoing air or fluid leaving increased-temperature duct 9'
          while progressively increasing the temperature of the outgoing
          air or other fluid of exhaust 11', the blower motor movable
          shroud 5b is adjusted so as to reduce the air or fluid flow
          rate through the increased-temperature enthalpy transfer zone
          10' and simultaneously increasing the air or fluid flow rate
          through the decreased-temperature enthalpy transfer zone 7'
          while reintroducing a portion of this increased-temperature
          air or other fluid of exhaust 11' back into inlet duct 3',
          this resulting in a mean temperature increase of the enthalpy
          transfer ring 25'.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Blower motor movable shroud
          5b may also be adjusted by a temperature-responsive servo
          drive system of conventional design and therefore not shown,
          which is temperature sensitive to the air or other fluid
          leaving exhaust 8' or to that of an enclosure, whose
          temperature is being controlled by this air or other fluid,
          thus providing an especially effective means of removing
          enthalpy from a solid or fluid through a broad temperature
          range. Such a conventional servo system can also be applied to
          the air or other fluid leaving exhaust 11' or elsewhere that
          temperature feedback is possible in order more effectively to
          establish and control elevated temperatures. Where system
          performance is closely repeatable, a simple time-controlled
          mechanism may be substituted for either servo system
          application in driving the blower motor movable shroud 5b.</font>

          shown in Figures 10, 11 and 12 a modified kinemassic force
          generator system is shown to demonstrate advantages to be
          gained by the presence of additional, usable spin nuclei
          material at lesser inner diameters occupied by the generator
          drive motors 40 and 40' in the other embodiments and by
          increasing in the axial direction the length of the generator
          rotor 20", such increase being possible without adding to the
          centrifugal force on the material forming the generator rotor
          20" thereby causing a kinemotive force of greater magnitude to
          occur for a given set of air gaps formed between a generator

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It has thus been
          demonstrated how the energy characterizing the half-integral
          spin nucleus can be utilized in a heat pump by altering the
          degrees of freedom of the crystal lattice structure. It is
          interesting to note that the assembly of atoms bound together
          by local inter-atomic forces to make up this crystal lattice
          structure is capable of vibration in a large number of
          independent normal modes about the static equilibrium
          configuration. In these vibrations is stored a large portion
          of the enthalpy of the solid, and hence the vibrations are
          believed to make the major contribution to the specific heat.
          The vibrational energy is quantized so there is recognized to
          be some zero-point motion even at 0° K.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the inventive concept
          has been specifically demonstrated as applied to utilization

          characterizes the half-integral spin nucleus in fact provides
          a generally usable new tool for producing interactions among
          atomic structures and is in no way limited or restricted to
          such use in heat pumps or similar devices.</font> </p>
