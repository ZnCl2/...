      <br>
      Ukranian inventor, Profesor Bolotov. has developed a cold fusion
      system that utilizes the transmutation of zirconium (in the form
      of zirconium oxide) into other elements to produce energy. He
      claims that with one version of his system, sixty watts of input
      could result in twenty kilowatts of output.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      PESN breaks a story about this technology, bringing it to public
      awareness ( March 25, 2011 )<br>
      <br>
      A demonstration of this technology was held on March 25, 2011. It
      was witnessed by Prof. Pawlak Halina-Kruczek of the University of
      Technology and Dr. Hanna Bartoszewicz-grumbles of the Institute of
      Power Engineering, Warsaw. In the demo the cold fusion reactor
      (the size of a table top) was pulsed with a nanosecond pulse
      generator. These pulses of electricity went into the cell which is
      filled with a "liquid metal." This produced a certain kind of
      electrical arc in the liquid metal which fills the cell. In this
      demonstration one hundred watts of input produced three hundred
      watts of pure electrical output plus heat. The inventor claims it
      seemed both observers were satisfied.<br>
      <br>
      <b> How it Works</b><br>
      <br>
      The cold fusion reactor (the size of a table top) is pulsed with a
      nanosecond pulse generator. These pulses of electricity go into
      the cell which is filled with a "liquid metal." This produces a
      certain kind of electrical arc in the liquid metal which fills the
      cell. The result is electricity and heat.<br>
      Costs<br>
      <br>
      A license for the technology costs 15 million euro.<br>
      <br>
      A device capable of 200 kW of output would cost ten thousand euro
      to build.<br>
      <br>
      This technology transmutes zirconium oxide into iridium and
      palladium to produce energy. Zirconium is relatively inexpensive
      (not as cheap as nickel).<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      On March 30, 2011, the following comment was posted:<br>
      <br>
      Waldemar Mordkovitch is an engineer, constructor and spokesperson;
      but the real inventor is Professor Bolotov.<br>
      <br>
      Mordkovich is writing in Polish, he is Polish, but the device is
      in Ukraine and he is now in Ukraine. He doesn't work in any
      university, and presentation took place few days ago so scientists
      don't know this. Maybe they know Bolotov ? Early works on this
      item started in 1960s or 70s(if I'm not wrong) but Soviet Patent
      Office as well as Soviet Science Academy didn't want to admit that
      anything of that kind could exist.<br>
      <br>
      They put forth the theory of an atom based on existence of new
      particle called "electrino" ( http://www.electrino.pl/2.3.html )<br>

      Various private websites in the internet present Boris Vasilowich
      Bolotov (sometimes just Boris Bolotov or B.A. Bolotov) as some
      kind of universal academic genius, "Ukrainian Einstein", as a
      spiritual healer and author, inventor or "nutrition academic". He
      was not only a scientist, but a physicist, chemist and biologist
      at the same time. He is said to have made about 600 inventions.
      Usually he gets attributed the title of a "professor", but a
      possible academic background is never mentioned. He is also
      credited with having invented various therapies of amazing success
      in the medical field, such as a treatment with pegs. In particular
      he is said to have succeeded in developing an anti-aging treatment
      allegedly allowing the replacement of "old" body cells with new
      ones. As a chemist, Bolotov will be credited with the discovery of
      one-hundred new chemical elements, none of them recorded on the
      regular periodic tables of chemistry. This and allegations of
      quackery against him in his opinion are merely based on his
      resistance against the political situation in the Soviet Union for
      which he was suppressed.<br>
      <br>
      Bolotov describes himself as a member of a "Ukrainian Peace
      Council" which appears to be in a relationship with the Moon cult.
      Bolotov also mentions a "True World Academy of Sciences" which is
      apparently responsible for selling Bolotov's inventions. Some of
      Bolotov's inventions are:<br>
      <br>
      Transmutation of radioactive waste; Cold fusion of metals and
      minerals; Production of organic foods on the basis of "enzymatic
      fermentation"; Manufacture of mineral colours from waste;
      Transformation of organic oil residues, waste paper and wood;
      Elektrosmogprotection ; A method of modulation of solar and
      stellar light to transmit messages ; Alternative methods for the
      prevention of cancer, viral infections, frostbite, and more. <br>

      Besides Bolotov, a Polish engineer Waldemar Mordkovitch is

      For 15 million Euro, he is prepared sell a license for the secret

      <div align="center"><big><b>A New Approach to "Cold Fusion" / LENR
            from the Ukraine</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      From out of the Ukraine in Eastern Europe comes Professor Boris
      Bolotov and his engineer Waldemar Mordkovitch with a very
      different approach to fusion. Its still table top in size, runs at
      low, for fusion standards to date, quite cool temperatures and is
      reported to make electricity directly skipping over the heat step
      for power generation. The new fusion candidate uses the
      transmutation of zirconium, in zirconium oxide form on to other
      elements to produce energy.<br>
      <br>
      For the demonstration the table top sized cold fusion reactor was
      pulsed with a nanosecond pulse generator. The pulses of
      electricity went into the cell filled with a “liquid metal.” This
      produced a kind of electrical arc in the liquid metal. During the
      demonstration reports have it that one hundred watts of power
      input produced three hundred watts of pure electrical output plus
      excess heat.<br>
      <br>
      Bolotov's work appears to be based on earlier Russian research
      which documented methods to transmute various elements. The
      Bolotov transmutation method apparently releases some potentially
      dangerous radiation, which the team is working to quench. Another
      way in which the zirconium transmutation of Bolotov differs from
      the nickel transmutation of Rossi, is that the Bolotov approach
      produces electricity directly -- without the need to produce heat
      energy as an intermediary.<br>

      ...Observers see a connection that Professor Bolotov might be
      building upon the work of a group of Russian scientists who own a
      patent entitled “Silicon Extraction Method.”&nbsp; In the patent
      they document a method of producing transmutations of various
      elements.<br>
      <br>
      The waste materials are quite valuable.&nbsp;&nbsp; The products
      from the fusion are said to be large quantities of rare palladium
      and iridium.&nbsp; Both elements of cost over a thousand dollars
      an ounce, about 28 grams.<br>
      <br>
      More tantalizing is the report that the Ukraine team is working
      with a Korean group for ways to quench the radiation.&nbsp; The
      tantalizing has dual meaning; both that some kind of atomic
      activity is taking place and that the zirconium path might not be
      so inherently safe as the nickel based Rossi Reactor....<br>

      output mixture confirm the formation of silicon during nuclear
      transformation (transmutation) of aluminum and phosphorus.<br>
      <br>
      1 -- Silicon extraction method includes extraction of
      high-pressure elemental silicon from chemical elements of aluminum
      and phosphorus by application of electric current with density of
      more than 10^11 amps/m^2 to the mixture of crystalline matters
      containing oxygen, aluminum and phosphorus, which differs as
      follows: batch mixture undergores preliminary preparation by
      adding copper and zinc and the subsequent joint alloying.<br>
      <br>
      2 -- The method described in Para. 1 which differs as follows:
      copper and phosphorus are alloyed according to the percentage
      ratio: 82% copper and 18% phosphorus.<br>
      <br>
      3 -- The method described in paragraph 1, which differs as
      follows: copper and phosphorus are alloyed under the temperature
      not greater than +1050 C.<br>
      <br>
      4 -- The method described in Para. 1, which differs as follows:
      after alloying copper and phosphorus, up to 30% aluminum is
      infused to the total volume of copper.<br>
      <br>
      5 -- The method described in para. 1, which differs as follows:
      after the copper-phosphorus-aluminum alloy is obtained, zinc in
      the amount of 1-15% from the total volume of alloy is infused.<br>
      <br>
      6 -- The method described in para. 1, which differs as follows:
      after the molten mass has cooled down, silicon is extracted by
      dissolving in nitric acid with the subsequent drying until silicon
      powder is formed.<br>
      <br>
      Useful model belongs to the methods of obtaining elements, in
      particular silicon which may be used to obtain new materials.<br>
      <br>
      There are known methods of obtaining silicon by the carbothermal
      restoration of silicon earth-containing material, subsequent
      refining, and infusion of alloying additives in the converter,
      feeding it into the holding furnace, sawing of melted silicon with
      inert gas, removal of powder from the pulverizing jet and
      subsequent separation from the inert gas (1).<br>
      <br>
      There is a known method of electro-thermal extraction of silicon
      (2) and its alloys in ore electrical furnaces.<br>
      <br>
      This methods involves supplying of current from the power source
      to the electrodes, submersion into the batch, starting of the arc
      under the layer of batch materials, renewal and output of silicon
      from the furnace: in this case, a current fed to the primary
      output electrodes of the power source is being straightened while
      current of the same polarity coming from the secondary output
      electrodes of the power source is being fed to the electrodes, and
      then after the arc is started, current goes through the batch
      mixture and furnace hearth and fed to the secondary output
      electrodes of the opposite polarity.<br>
      <br>
      There is a known method of smelting silicon (3) in the ore thermal
      furnace which allows to increase the percentage of its yield from
      the raw materials. Silicon is being smelted in the 3-electrode
      furnace with carbothermal restoration of batch mixture containing
      silcon earth. During smelting, each 1.5-2 hours a mixture of
      carbon-containing reducing agents and quartzite is input into the
      intra-electrode space in the correlation which ensures mass
      correlation in the mixture C:SiO2 = 0.5-0.75.<br>
      <br>
      There are known methods of obtaining elemental silicon, based on
      the restoration of silicon oxide by carbon-containing matters upon
      the following reaction:<br>
      <br>
      SiO2 + 2C &gt; Si + CO.<br>
      <br>
      However, the main deficiencies of the aforementioned silicon
      extraction methods is high power consumption and labor content of
      chemical and physical process involved in the production
      technology, which leads to the increased cost of the end products
      and also large amount of production waste which significantly
      deteriorates ecological situation on the territory and affects
      human health.<br>
      <br>
      The closest method of achieving technical result is the method of
      obtaining compact silicon of other crystalline modification by
      treating regular silicon&nbsp; under the pressure less than 20 MPa
      (4). All technologically used methods of extracting elemental
      silicon are based on the extraction of silicon-containing oxide
      materials in the process of restoration, carbothermy<small>. </small><span
        style="font-weight: bold;">This method is based on the
        transformation (transmutation) of other chemical elements of
        aluminum and phosphorus into elemental silicon.</span><br>
      <br>
      Transformation is achieved by the electric current passing through
      the mixture of crystalling substances containing main elements,
      Al, P with density of the electric current no less than 10^11
      A/m^2.<br>
      <br>
      The goal of the proposed useful model is improvement of silicon
      extraction technology as a result of reduction of power
      consumption and labor content by selecting such chemical and
      physical processes during its production which would have allowed
      to obtain new technical result and more ecological production
      process.<br>
      <br>
      Thas task is resolved as follows: silicon is obtained from
      chemical elements of aluminum and phosphorus by application of
      electric current with density no more than 10^11 A/m^2 to the
      batch mixture, from crystalling matters containing oxygen,
      aluminum, and phosphorus; in order to increase the output of
      silicon copper and phosphorus are preliminary alloyed according to
      the percentage ration of 82% copper to 18% (not more) of
      phosphorus under the temperature not greater than +1050 C., and
      after alloying of copper and phosphorus, up to 30% of aluminum is
      infused to the total volume of copper. After the
      copper+phosphorus+aluminum molten mass is obtained, zinc in the
      amount of 10-15% from the total volume of molten mass is infused.
      After the molten mass has cooled down, it is dissolved in nitric
      acid with the subsequent drying until silicon poweder is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Thus obtained silicon represents
        the product of apotropous modification of silicon isosters as a
        result of nuclear transformation of aluminum phosphide into
        chemically pure silicon.</span><small><br style="font-weight:
          bold;">
      </small><br>
      Test analysis showed that<span style="font-weight: bold;"> this
        type of silicon is quite inert substance which cannot be
        dissolved in hydrochloric, sulfuric, etching and other tyres of
        acid and even in nitro-hydrochloric acid (aqua regia). It is not
        dissolved in the fluxes of such metals as aluminum, copper,
        iron, and others, does not form alloys with them, does not
        oxidize under the temperature of 3000 C., and does not form
        carbides.</span><br>

      appearance of silicon powder after the multiple magnifying by

      Technical result of the proposed useful model is broadening of the
      arsenal of technical means, namely extraction for the first time
      of silicon of high-pressure crystalline modification from other
      chemical elements in conditions of regular atmospheric pressure...<br>
      <br>
      Energy mass analyzer EMAL-2 was used for the purpose of mass
      spectroscopic analysis of the output mixtures and products of
      transformation upon the method of determination of silicon in the
      fraction-less sample evaporation mode and registration on photo
      film after division of the flow of ions. Peaks of silicon isotope
      ions were observed in the mass spectraa of the product:
      single-charge 28, 29, 30 and double-charged 14, 14.5, and 15 with
      relative intensiveness, which corresponds to the master sample of
      silicon. Trace quantities of silicon were found in the mass
      spectra of the output mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Roentgenograms were recorded on the x-ray diffraction meter DRON-4
      SiK a-monochromatic radiation and compared the roentgenograms of
      the output mixture, product and the product residuum after acid
      treatment. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Results obtained for the product
        comparing to the output mixture confirm the formation of silicon
        during nuclear transformation (transmutation) of aluminum and
        phosphorus. Gravimetric analysis showed the presence of 18% of
        silicon in the product obtained.</span><small><br>
      </small><br>
      The experiments conducted by the authors showed that silicon is
      formed from other chemical elements of the output mixture with
      density of the electric current less than 10^11 A/m^2 is
      discovered by the analysis methods described above.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon obtained upon the proposed method may be used in the
      production of&nbsp; lacquer and paint and in heat-insulating
      materials, electronics, optics, and jewelry, to process natural
      minerals and stone, in npolishing and grinding pastes and

      [ 0002] The object of the invention - capital reduction of energy
      costs , cleaning intensification ( phytoactivity ) of the soil and
      getting friendly products.<br>
      <br>
      [ 0003 ] This is achieved by the fact that <i>predlagaemyysposob</i>
