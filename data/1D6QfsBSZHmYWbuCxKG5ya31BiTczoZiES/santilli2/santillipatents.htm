      A method and apparatus for producing usable heat by fusion of two
      atoms within a vessel filled with a gas. The fusion is performed
      under pressure within an electric arc between two electrodes
      within the vessel. The electron clouds of the atoms are deformed
      into a toroidal shape by a magnetic field of the electric arc,
      thereby exposing the nuclei of both atoms. Upon such exposure, a
      trigger such as a sudden change in the arc or a sudden increase of
      pressure in the vessel forces the nuclei of the atoms to fuse,
      producing a new atom. Selection of the gas, the electrodes, as
      well as the operating power, pressure and flow through the arc
      results in the production of energy that is greater than the
      electric energy consumed by the arc. Heat produced by the fusion
      is used for the production of electricity or other commercial use.<br>

      An application for a recycler includes a pressure and temperature
      resistant metal vessel that is filled with a liquid. Within the
      vessel is at least one submerged electric arc between a pair of
      carbon base electrodes powered by either a DC or AC current. The
      vessel has mechanical systems that maintain and optimize the
      electric arc. The electric arc produces a combustible gas. The
      liquid is pumped through a bore in one or more of the electrodes,
      delivering the liquid directly to the location of the arc, thereby
      reducing or eliminating any ignition of the gas by the arc.<br>

      An electrolyzer which decomposes distilled water into a new fuel
      composed of hydrogen, oxygen and their molecular and magnecular
      bonds, called HHO. The electrolyzer can be used to provide the new
      combustible gas as an additive to combustion engine fuels or in
      flame or other generating equipment such as torches and welders.
      The new combustible gas is comprised of clusters of hydrogen and
      oxygen atoms structured according to a general formula HmOn
      wherein m and n have null or positive integer values with the
      exception that m and n can not be 0 at the same time, and wherein

      Reactors (108) for the total recycling of contaminated liquid
      waste, which produce a clean burning combustible gas, usable heat,
      and solid precipitates, a main feature being that a total of the
      available energy in the combustible gas and in the produced heat
      is greater than an electric energy needed to operate the
      apparatus. The latter feature is called commercial over-unity, and
      essentially establishes the capability of the new reactors to tap
      energy from the liquid molecules in full conformity with the
      principle of conservation of the energy. Different embodiments
      include the over-unity recycling of automotive antifreeze and oil

      Apparatus and process for the production of a clean burning
      combustible gas by using electric arc. The electrodes (154, 170)
      used in the invention have several configurations. The process
      reduces the production of carbon dioxide, hence increases cost
      efficiency and the life of the electrodes (154, 170). The
      combustible gas is composed of stable magnetically bonded clusters
      of molecules and atoms that are detectable in conventional mass
      spectrometric detectors, yet such clusters remain unidentifiable
      by the computer search among all known molecules and have no
      infrared signature other than those of the conventional molecules

      clean production of a clean burning liquid fuel called MagneFuel,
      which method is based, first, in the production of a combustible
      gas via submerged electric arcs between carbon-base electrodes
      from crude oil, oil-base, or water-base liquid waste and then
      passing the combustible gas via a high pressure pipe into a tower
      for the catalytic liquefaction, whereby the sum of the heat output
      in the production of the combustible gas and that for its
      catalytic liquefaction is sufficient for the process to be
      self-sustaining, that is, capable to produce its own electricity.
