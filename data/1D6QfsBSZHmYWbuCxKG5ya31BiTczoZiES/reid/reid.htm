        crystal units developed and manufactured by Marcus Reid in the
        Institute of Vacuum Energy with the objective to find out which
        energy those battery-like devices could be powered by. The tests
        have been fully documented on a German web site "Das Geheimnis

      <p>* Investigations with a gamma spectrometer <br>

        * Magnetic response <br>
        * Load tests <br>

        * Possible relationship to solar bursts </p>
      <p>In no case there was any hint that the crystal unit would
        receive input energy from any known energy source like energetic
        particles, magnetic energy or heat energy. Especially all
        investigations on electromagnetic waves and temperature were
        done with extrem effort and as thoroughly as possible. </p>
      <p>Whereas during the last months the source of energy, which
        power the crystal units, were in the center of investigation. Up
        to now it was not possible to find a known input energy-form. It
        is now the objective to develop and confirm more and more
        powerfull devices. Therefore the investigations will focus on
        investigating all kinds of relationships that will provide us
        with some better insight into the technology. </p>

        about the work of Marcus Reid with this incredible claim. It
        sounds similar to the Free Energy Chip being tested in Leon,
        Guanajuato, Mexico which I hope to check out soon. Don't be put

        such low levels and can be SCALED UP to produce much more! -

        thoroughly investigated best to my knowledge some multiple
        battery-like devices that deliver a continuous energy output
        without any energy input which would be visible to my (current)

      <p>Especially all investigations on electromagnetic waves and
        temperature were done with extrem effort and as thoroughly as
        possible. Crystal units can be reproduced by everyone who is
        interested in those devices. It is an aluminium cylinder where
        Sodiummetasilikat (Na2SiO3) is melted in and brought to
        crystalisation. Here is a shematic view of a crystal unit...The
        mentioned compounds are converted, during a chemical reaction,
        into a crystaline form. Crystal unit in comparison to a battery,
        R14 NiMH Accu 2900 mAh which currently run against each other
        with a load of 1 mA. It is expected that the NiMH Accu will
        break down latest after delivering 2900 mAh in about 100 days
        whereas the crystal unit was operated for more than six years
        already without any energy in but with a continuous current out
        (different device, the picture shows a 6 weeks old crystal
        unit). We have observed that these units decline in power during
        the first few weeks or month, but then for some reason, stop
        decreasing at some stage, most likely due to water evaporation.
        Even continuing dead shorts over several years (4-years is
        longest test) can not kill these units. The power decrease in a
        battery for example, is during the first phase rather small, and
        then towards the end, quite abrupt. So the power progress, in a
        battery and the crystal unit, is just contrarious.<br>

      The following article is a summary of the research of a new kind
      of energy generator called the crystal cell. Research in the past
      has shown that the crystal cell can produce permanent electric
      energy over a long period (since 1999).<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2) Basic Construction</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The crystal cell consists of a metal cylinder, which is filled
      with a specific silicate. Due to a chemical reaction, the silicate
      mixture is being converted into another material composition.
      Within the metal cylinder is another metal electrode.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This material was analysed with x-ray diffraction. This was done
      by Dr. Frank Lichtenberg at the Institute for Physics at the
      University of Augsburg. The analysis has shown that the solid
      material consists by a large part of XXXX, and a silicate
      compound. Further analysis with EDX has confirmed the data. The
      compounds, which are between the minus and plus pole have a large
      resistance in the megaohm range. It is known that these materials
      do not show ion conduction at room temperature. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3) Metrological Data</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The idea of the crystal cell originated in the year 1999 and was
      initially pursued only till the middle of the year 2000. The
      crystal cells which were produced at that time release only very
      little electrical power (1mW at 23 degrees, weight approximately
      900 g). The question regarding it´s working principle could not be
      answered without detailed tests based on measurement technology.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Dipl. Ing. Eckhard Kantz, Dr. Hans Weber and Dr. Dieter
      Staschewski have independently been testing several crystal cells
      on the basis of measurement technology. The findings of these
      tests are very encouraging and confirm the initial assumption,
      that the crystal cell is a new kind of energy generator. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      For further research to find its working principle, it was also
      necessary, to explain whether it is not a quite common
      electrochemical reaction.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Test data.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The following test data must be understood in the overall context.
      In the chart (Fig. 1) below, the heating of a load resistor can be
      seen. The chronological progression of the chart moves from the
      right hand side towards the left hand side.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Orange: Voltage of the crystal cell<br>
      Blue: Temperature of the crystal cell<br>
      Purple: Temperature of the load resistor<br>
      <br>
      Above in the chart (Fig. 1) one can notice the prevailing 4-hour
      load cycle (with 312 ohm) of the crystal cell, followed by a
      4-hour self charging phase. One can not only perceive from the
      chart, that the crystal cell again and again recharges
      automatically on its own, but also, that the unit does not
      discharge completely. Electric energy is being permanently
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      In the load resistor, first of all, an intense heating is noticed
      (peak), which corresponds to the discharge course of the crystal
      cell. The temperature curve of the load resistor is shown highly
      compressed in the vertical, in reality it would be about 5 meter
      high (0.4 degree Kelvin) The measurement shows movements of a
      1/1000th of a Kelvin. According to the power output of approx.
      1mW, one would expect (depending on the working principal) a
      cooling or heating of the crystal cell in the range of several
      milli Kelvin but an increase or decrease of temperature is not
      observed. In newly produced (since 2005) smaller and more powerful
      crystal cells the temperature movement was measured in a
      resolution of 1/10 000th of a Kelvin. In these crystal cells a
      greater change of temperature was expected, but also no clear
      direction of change in temperature was observed. The data suggests
      that the electric energy of the crystal cell is not being drawn
      from the environmental temperature. <br>
      <br>
      In the chart below (Fig. 2) an overall view shows that the self
      recharging voltage increases faster, than the discharge voltage
      decreases over time. Therefore a slight increase in the released
      energy occurs during the first weeks after connecting the load.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 2</span><br

      </center>
      <br>
      In the chart (Fig. 3) the device is under a permanent load for a
      period of one week. One can notice, that the power released after
      7 days is slightly greater than on the first day, after the
      crystal cell has run in. <br>
      <br>
      The upper thick line in the chart (purple) shows the temperature
      progression of the crystal cell. The curve (white) lying below,
      represents the voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The power measurements were done with a two point measuring
      technique and a resistor. Using the voltage, we have then
      calculated the current. In this case the measuring approach is
      precise; we have repeated it using a 4 point measuring technique
      and a different load. The measuring equipment and the test
      resistor have been calibrated.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the crystal cell is very sensitive to temperature
      changes. For example, the power at 23 degrees Celsius is
      approximately 1mW and at 38 degrees Celsius at 4mW, which
      corresponds to a 4-times increase in power. Bigger or smaller
      cells have a different temperature coefficient.<br>
      The tests have revealed that the optimum operating temperature is
      approximately at 35 degrees Celsius. Above this temperature, the
      power increases slowly and below this temperature, it drops
      quickly. <br>
      <br>
      Various crystal cells have been short-circuited rigorously in the
      past simply with a wire. The longest short-circuit lasted
      approximately for 4 years (2001  2005), which did only result in
      a small decrease in power. However, in the beginning right after
      production, the crystal cells decrease in power, but after a while
      stabilize. After a certain period the crystal cells do not show
      any decrease in power anymore. The first crystal cells are working
      now since 1999. At least since the year 2005 these cells show no
      decrease in power anymore. Precise measurements where only
      re-established in 2005. So if a load is being connected to the
      crystal cell after it has run in a slight increase in power of
      approx: 5% can be observed. It doesn´t make any difference if the
      crystal cell is under load (for e.g. short circuit) or not, the
      power progression curve over time is the same. &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 4</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>

        <p><img src="image3QJ.JPG" height="300" width="600"></p>
      </center>
      <br>
      During the observation of the crystal cell it was established,
      that in addition to the dc. voltage, a broad-band radio signal is
      present (Fig. 4). The (grey) curve is shown at the bottom of the
      chart. It can be seen, that the signal changes to other clear
      defined values, depending on the temperature and/or on the power
      output. The frequency amplitude moves against the temperature
      curve, which means, that at a greater temperature a weaker
      frequency signal is obtained. Before the test, the crystal cell
      was shielded from all possible outside radio frequency signals. <br>
      So when more energy is extracted due to a greater temperature, the
      amplitude of the radio signal decreases. Normally one would
      expect, due to the increase of the temperature energy, a greater
      amplitude. But after the temperature starts to rise, it takes
      several minutes until the radio signal amplitude suddenly drops to
      a lower value. Right after the signal has dropped, a faster
      increase in electric power is observed. Therefore it is assumed,
      that the generated power of the crystal cell is connected to the
      reduction of the amplitude of the radio signal. The temperature
      just seems to act as an agent which enables the extraction of
      energy from another source of energy. So the actual source of
      energy could be connected to the amplitude of the radio signal and
      then by reducing the amplitude, the crystal cell then converts
      this energy to generate a direct current. <br>
      <br>
      These findings also correlate with the fact why we have not
      observed a change in temperature of the crystal cell when putting
      it under load as shown on page 3 and 4. <br>
      <br>
      The frequency of 245 MHz was selected as a measuring or test
      frequency, because daily solar measuring values are published on
      the Internet. A correlation with solar bursts, have not been
      found. <br>

      In Fig. 5 the purple line at the bottom of the chart shows a
      resonance effect at 968 mV. The thin gray line is the voltage. The
      purple line is an amplification of the permanently ongoing changes
      in amplitude of the voltage. The crystal cell is under load with a
      1088 Ohm resistor and generates thereby a permanent voltage of 920
      to 980 mV at room temperature. Due to temperature changes in the
      laboratory the voltage changes slightly with time. When the
      voltage moves through the 968 mV line then the amplitude of the
      signal is slightly stronger. It doesnt matter if the temperature
      and voltage moves up or down through the 968 mV line, the
      resonance effect is always the same. The same effect is observed
      (not shown in Fig. 5) when the voltage moves through the 938 mV
      line. Then the amplitude of the signal decreases. This behaviour
      shows that there is a connection between a specific temperature /
      voltage and the amplitude of the voltage movement signal.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Dipole flipping phenomena within
        crystal cells.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Crystal cells can abruptly change their polarity when they are
      connected (+ to - and  to +) with another battery or a voltage
      source (6 volts) for a few seconds. If right after such a charging
      procedure the crystal cell is being left alone without a load,
      then it takes several seconds until the cell changes its polarity
      again into the correct direction and then it recharges on its own
      to normal power specifications within several minutes. <br>
      <br>
      Another interesting observation is the recharge behaviour
      especially in newly manufactured crystal cells under permanent
      load. When a small crystal cell is under permanent load with a 1 k
      Ohm resistor it produces for example 1,000 volts. When this
      crystal cell is then being short circuited for one second, then
      right after the short circuit the voltage has decreased for
      example to 0,985 volts. Then the crystal cell starts recharging
      (still under load with 1 k Ohm) on its own again. After several
      seconds the crystal cell reaches to its normal voltage of 1,000
      volts, but then it mysteriously charges further up to around 1,035
      volts. Another few minutes later this voltage decreases again to
      1,000 volts and then stays there. This observation indicates
      together with other measurements that it is more efficient to draw
      the energy from the crystal cell in a pulse like fashion. See
      below: Wall clock!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 6</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <center> </center>
      <br>
      The crystal cell was also tested with regard to the release of
      gamma rays. See chart (Fig. 6). In comparison to the normally
      available rays any increased values were not found.<br>
      <br>
      Again the crystal cell was tested for the effect of magnetic
      fields, likewise without any findings.<br>
      <br>
      In a further test of the crystal cell in a Faraday cage, any
      change in the electrical power released was not established. The
      crystal cell was also shielded from elf.-em. waves and tested far
      away from any electric transmission line. No change in power could
      be observed. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The power output from certain crystal cells sometimes show at the
      same time small changes, which are not related to changes in
      temperature. It is currently not known why this is so. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In many occasions it was observed, that if the quality of the
      contact between the wire and the aluminium cylinder and / or the
      copper electrode is not very well, the ambient voltage rises
      suddenly up to several volts. The greatest ambient voltage
      measured in this way was at 9 volts. Even when a load resistor is
      attached a small increase in voltage and power output can occur
      when this contact is not very well. <br>
      <br>
      Connecting crystal cells in parallel does not work too well.
      Connecting the cells in series, works better but also not as good
      as with chemical batteries. It is assumed that the cells have to
      be made exactly the same otherwise one cell has a dipole flipping
      effect onto the other one.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changing load response</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      A crystal cell showed in past experiments a considerable inertia
      related to the voltage after changing the load condition. In order
      to receive meaningful results for a UI- characteristics, an
      experiment was conducted with a changing load condition for every
      7 minutes. Only the almost balanced voltage in the end of the
      cycle was taken into account for generating subsequently an
      amperage-voltage characteristics chart.<br>
      <center> </center>
      <br>
      The changing load was generated by four resistors of different
      values: <br>
      <br>
      1568 Ohm <br>
      794 Ohm <br>
      380 Ohm <br>
      194 Ohm <br>
      <br>
      Combining one or multiple resistors in subsequent periods leads to
      a greater or smaller load in 16 steps.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      The chart shows, that the crystal cell behaves mainly like a
      current source, especially in the second half (part of the chart
      which is on the right hand side) where the load was increased from
      a minimum load to a maximum load. Once the resistance is so small,
      that the voltage drops from 1,3 volts (ambient voltage) down to
      1,0 volts, the current has already reached its maximum amperage of
      1,2mA. From then on, the resistor can steadily be brought down to
      0,1 Ohms, which of course will also lead to a steady voltage drop
      down to nearly zero. No matter for which further value one
      decreases the resistance, the current will always stay the same at
      1mA. Even at a continuing dead short, the meter will show a
      constant 1,2mA. The excess amperage in the first half when the
      load was increased, is possibly a result of a non-balanced
      situation in the end of a 7-minute cycle, or it may also belong to
      the set of dynamic effects experienced within crystal cells. It
      must be mentioned that common electromagnetic systems show their
      optimum performance when driving down the voltage by 50%. So the
      optimum performance of the crystal cell should be at 0,65 volts. <br>
      <br>
      Usually common electromagnetic energy conversion systems show
      their optimum operation mode, when their inner resistance is the
      same as within the load. Since the optimum operation mode for the
      crystal cell is achieved by using a 1 kilo Ohm resistor, the inner
      resistance of the crystal cell should also be at 1 kilo Ohm. But
      the inner resistance of the crystal cell shows a flexible nature.<br>
      The chart in Fig. 7 reveals that the inner resistance of the
      crystal cell changes when the load moves from a smaller to a
      greater load and the other way around. In the middle of the chart
      the load has it´s greatest value. When attaching a small load, the
      crystal cell firstly behaves like a common voltage source with an
      inner resistance of approx. 300 Ohm. After, when the load is being
      increased the crystal cell has a dynamic inner resistance of about
      1,6 kilo Ohms and behaves like a current source. In this section
      this is so, because the current and the voltage changes with the
      same algebraic sign. <br>
      <br>
      Then when moving from a greater load to a smaller load the current
      stays relatively constant and an inner resistance of about 100
      kilo Ohm is obtained. So in this section we also find a current
      source characteristic. This means that the crystal cell changes
      its inner resistance by 60 fold, when changing from a smaller to a
      greater load and the other way around. <br>
      The resistance of the silicate compound is at 4 mega Ohm when
      measured with a measuring gage directly on the silicate material.
      Taken together these findings show that the energy conversion
      processes within the crystal cell have a complex nature. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cyclic self recharge behaviour</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The chart below shows a 7 min. self recharge and a 7 min.
      discharge cycle. The blue line represents the movement of the
      recharge and discharge voltage. Especially from the first half of
      the chart it becomes clear, that the crystal cell recharges in a
      periodic way. This behaviour indicates again, that the produced
      electric power is connected to resonance effects within the
      polycrystalline silicate compound. The bump in the self recharge
      curve after 120 seconds demonstrates, that the crystal cell
      suddenly recharges much faster for a few seconds. This indicates
      that the polarisation is being built up everywhere within the
      crystal cell at the same time. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fig. 8</span><br

      <br>
      The chart above shows a discharge cycle of a crystal cell, moving
      from the right hand side to the left hand side. The chart reveals
      that the discharge progression suddenly comes to a halt, then
      increases for about 1 hour and after that continues to decline.
      The discharge characteristic shows that the crystal cell is no
      typical capacitor, because in that case one would expect a linear
      discharge curve right down to zero. <br>
      <br>
      A similar curve is observed, when the crystal cell is in a self
      recharge mode. After disconnecting the load the voltage first
      increases quickly, then slows down and comes to a halt. Then the
      voltage decreases and after about an hour this process comes again
      to a halt. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
      </span>
      <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;<br>
      </div>
      If there was a self recharge function due to an aluminium air or
      corrosion battery effect, then the curve should also go up in a
      linear way because the power would built up from the inner surface
      of the aluminium cylinder and then move to the inside of the
      crystal cell. But the recharge curve characteristic, indicates
      that the crystal cell recharges everywhere within the crystal cell
      simultaneously. This observation suggests, that if the
      polarisation is being built up from throughout the crystal cell,
      it suddenly comes to an overcharge situation, because the
      potentials suddenly start pressing from everywhere at the same
      time. But this over-potential cannot be held up (probably due to a
      small conductivity) so then the voltage drops down to a value
      which corresponds to a dynamic equilibrium between the permanent
      self recharge power and the (conduction based) potential discharge
      mechanism. It is assumed, that this is the mechanism how the
      crystal cell self regulates its ambient voltage. <br>
      <br>
      Crystal cells have an ambient voltage between 1,1 volts up to 1,5
      volts when using the&nbsp; same electrode
      materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;




      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The chart below (also moving from the right hand side to the left
      hand side) shows two self-recharge curves. The load during the
      discharge cycle is at 312 Ohm. The duration of a single self
      recharge and a single discharge cycle is 5 hours. Different
      recharge - discharge times and different resistor values result in
      differing recharge - discharge curve characteristics.<span

      The chart below shows a dead-short discharge measurement of the
      crystal cell with a similar discharge characteristic as shown in
      Fig. 9. This measurement was done in the year 2000, about one year
      after the production of the crystal cell. In the beginning, after
      the production of the crystal cell, it had a dead short current of
      1mA. Today this crystal cell has a dead short current of 1mA at 23
      degrees Celsius, which leads in this case also to a power of 1mW.
      This power output has an absolute constant value at least since
      2005. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The following information

      <br>
      Dr. Staschewski has researched the effects of the self-generation
      of potentials within agate stones and other dielectric materials
      and is also investigating the nature of the crystal cells.<br>
      <br>
      The chart below shows, that the discharge behaviour (and recharge
      behaviour, not shown in the chart below) within agate stones is
      similar to the crystal cells. <br>

      This effect is explained as such, that when the voltage drops at
      the electrodes right after connecting the load resistor, the
      polarisation firstly decreases only within the contact area of the
      electrodes. Now more current can flow from the inside of the agate
      stone to the electrodes so the inner polarisation can get through
      to the edges more easily. Therefore a rising voltage and power
      released is observed. After some time, this process comes to a
      halt and then the power decreases again, because the agate stone
      has discharged everywhere within the material. This process shows
      the special nature of the internal energy storing characteristic
      within agate stones and crystal cells.<br>

        crystal cells during the year 2006 - 2007.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Even if we have basically excluded possible electrochemical
      effects as shown above, all possible aspects of operation must be
      discussed. There is still the possibility that a very weak
      aluminium-air battery or corrosion battery effect is involved
      which is at work in addition to another possible mode of
      operation, especially in the beginning during the first days after
      the production of the crystal cell. Crystal cells also work, when
      sealing them from the surrounding air, but in theory it might be
      possible, that the aluminium receives its oxygen from the silicate
      compound. We know that some cells show a yellowish layer in the
      inner side on top of the aluminium surface, indicating a slightly
      greater concentration of aluminium hydroxide. This was also
      analyzed with x-ray powder diffraction. In some of the newly
      produced crystal cells (since 2006) we have also observed a thin
      gray layer (about 0,5  1 mm thick) which is directly attached to
      the inner surface of the aluminium cylinder. On top of that gray
      layer is a yellow coloured region (approx. 1-3 mm thick). The gray
      and yellow materials have developed in this particular case during
      the production of more than 4Wh over a period of about 6 months
      (Size baby C). This observation shows a corrosion effect.<br>
      <br>
      April 2009: new analysis from independent researchers have shown,
      that electrochemical effects play no significant role. See
      independent survey reports! <br>
      <br>
      What clearly speaks against an electrochemical reaction due to an
      aluminium corrosion battery effect in the beginning, right after
      the production of the crystal cell, is that the recharge behaviour
      as shown in Fig.10 is much more distinctive in the early phase.
      Therefore we have come to the conclusion that the visible chemical
      reaction (corrosion) does not participate in the generation of
      electric energy. So the decrease of power after several months has
      to do with a destructive impact due to a corrosion effect (like in
      solar cells), rather than a discharge effect in the sense of an
      electrochemical discharge reaction. <br>
      <br>
      The below chart shows the performance of a newly produced crystal
      cell over a period of 545 days. We received 7,2Ah. and 5,8Wh. from
      the crystal cell, which is more than twice as much as within a
      Nickel Metal Hydride Battery of the same size. This power curve
      decreases with time and then stabilizes after about 2 years. <br>

      A crystal cell after 6 months, producing approx. 4Wh. The total
      weight of the crystal cell is 85g., diameter 30mm, hight 50mm.
      Ambient voltagevoltage 1,23v. Max. power output: with a <br>
      1 k.Ohm resistor approx. 1volt, which is 1mW, at ? 23°C.
      <p>For the calculation, the author reduced the weight of the
        crystal cell from 85g. to 50g. leading to a power of 120Wh/kg
        crystal cell. This was done, because also at the end of the
        test, most of the aluminium was not used up. Before the
        manufacturing process the crystal cell container weighs approx.
        37g. After the manufacturing process and before the test
        started, the container weighs approx. 35g., meaning that about 2
        g of aluminium have dissolved into the silicate mixture
        compound. The best crystal cells (Size C) have produced more
        than 6Wh up to now. Therefore it was calculated, 6Wh and 50
        grams, which leads to 120Wh/kg of the crystal cell. </p>
      <p>From our view, even if there is a small aluminium corrosion
        effect involved, the corrosion should cease over time. There are
        crystal cells, which were manufactured in the Year 1999. One of
        these cells (approx. 900 grams) is working now since August 2005
        without a noticed decrease in power. The power output is only at
        1 milli Watt at 23 degrees Celsius, but considering the time and
        the total energy output since 1999 of approx. 150 watt hours, we
        assume that possible electrochemical effects have stopped a long
        time ago and that the electric energy, which is being produced
        today, has no electrochemical origin. It may be mentioned, that
        150 watt hours at that size means, that this crystal cell has
        far excelled the best modern commercial batteries. Here it also
        has to be considered, that a part of the weight is due to the
        aluminium cylinder and may be subtracted. </p>
      <p>We found that most crystal cells, new and old, do not show any
        corrosion on the inner side of the aluminium cylinder. </p>

      <p>This crystal cell was manufactured in the year 1999 and is
        larger in size, approx. 900g. The total amount of energy,
        produced between September 1999 and December 2006, is in the
        above shown cell approx. 60Wh. This is more than the energy
        density of a comparable re-chargeable Nickel Metal Hydride
        battery. This observation indicates that the flow of electric
        energy within the crystal cell does not necessarily cause the
        production of a gray layer. </p>
      <p>The manufacturing process of the old and big crystal cells is
        different to the manufacturing process which is being applied
        today. </p>
      <p><b>4) Possible operating mode</b> </p>
      <p>The theoretical starting point presented here, is a first
        attempt to describe the possible method of function of the
        crystal cell. <br>
        The regularity of a crystal lattice facilitates it to manifest
        a group of virtual photons, which normally lie below the
        recognisable or detectable threshold, temporarily in their
        summary power. The properties of semiconductors integrated in
        the crystal unit, facilitate the absorption of these energy
        portions available temporarily by electrons and electron holes
        and consequently a continuous removal of useful energy from the
        crystal unit. </p>
      <p>One of the ideas involved, with the help of a polycrystalline
        material, in which suitable semiconducting properties had been
        integrated, is to reach a material state, in which the electrons
        can move easily, due to vibratory motion caused by temperature
        and XXXXX. Due to the simultaneous availability of the
        semiconducting properties, it is possible to influence the
        movement of the electrons and to direct them into a specific
        direction like in a Feynman rachet. A related experiment, a
        Reciprocal or Inverse Heating Spiral has already been carried
        out successfully. </p>

      <p>In a next step the author suggests to get the test data checked
        once again from a recognised institution. If the test findings
        till now prove to be well-founded, there should be no obstacle
        for further development. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, the undersigned was successful during
        spring of 2006, to reduce the size of the crystal cells to the
        commercial battery size Baby C, while receiving the same power
        output of approx. 1milli Watt. This has led to a volume  power
        increase by approximately 10  times compared to the cells which
        were produced during 1999 and the year 2000. The total produced
        energy in the new cells over 17 months, is around 6 watt hours
        at room temperature (approx. 23ºC), which is more than twice as
        much as in a re-chargeable Nickel Metal Hydride battery of the
        same size. Therefore we believe that several very low current
        devices could be equipped with crystal cells, in which batteries
        have to be replaced after about 1-year or later. Therefore, in
        view of the author, an extensive market segment could be served
        already today. </p>
      <p>The development of the crystal cell till now has reached a
        level which is very promising. Without the cooperation of the
        physicist Dr. Frank Lichtenberg and Dipl. Ing. Eckhard Kantz,
        with who in the course of time a team of colleagues has
        developed, this would not have been possible. They are gladly
        available in the future, as well for further research work. </p>
      <p>The objective of the further research is first of all to find
        the exact working principle with a suitable increase in power.
        This work would however, far exceed our financial resources. </p>
      <p>The undersigned, therefore, is looking for partners and
        investors, who would like to be involved in the further research
        and development with subsequent commercialization of the crystal
        cell. </p>

      <p><b>Comment on the crystal cell</b> </p>
      <p>Since half a year I am privately involved in the research work
        of Mr. Marcus Reid on the so-called crystal cell. I have seen
        two of such cells and opened one of them to analyze some of its
        inner material by x-ray powder diffraction. To me the research
        work by Mr. Marcus Reid and Mr. Eckhard Kantz seems trustworthy.
        In my opinion, the release of electrical energy from the crystal
        cell represents an interesting and potentially new phenomenon.
        Therefore I recommend an extension of the research and
        development work. </p>

      <p><b>Annual Review of the Research into Crystal Cells</b> </p>
      <p>In August 2005, I became aware of the description of crystal
        cells on the Internet, which should provide a continuous energy
        flow. As an engineer for power systems, I was interested in the
        question, from where this energy flow should come, which was
        observed by Marcus Reid during a period of over 5 years. I am
        thankful to Marcus Reid for the opportunity given to me to test
        the prototypes of these crystal cells thoroughly according to my
        choice, up to the intentional application of destructive
        measurements (tests), in order to plumb the boundaries of the
        crystal cells. </p>
      <p>I have completed a training from the Technical University in
        Wroclaw/Poland in the Department of Mechanical Engineering and
        Power Systems, which was made possible for me in the former GDR
        in the framework of a study abroad programme. Topic of my
        dissertation was the Mathematical Modelling and the Process
        Analysis of Steam Generators (Heat Exchangers) between the first
        and the second cycle of an Atomic Power Plant with 1360 MW
        thermal power (WWER-440). During an overall eight years of my
        work in an atomic power plant, I have co-developed programmes
        for the optimum operation of atomic power systems, used these
        programmes and was in charge and looked after the continuous
        operation of these programmes. </p>
      <p>My starting point in the research into crystal cells was the
        question, which type of energy transformation or conversion
        takes place in the cells. According to my education and
        training, I always assume that Energy can neither be created
        nor destroyed, but can be transformed from one energy form into
        another energy form. </p>
      <p>As a summary of almost one year of research work, I can say
        that, with the means and resources available to me, any
        conventional energy form could not be detected as a source of
        the crystal energy cell. In the process, I have carried out
        below mentioned tests in detail. </p>
      <p>The first main point was the investigation and testing of
        electromagnetic influences. </p>
      <p>From the detected magnitude of the energy released of about one
        milliwatt, it was thought that perhaps the crystal cell acts as
        an antenna and absorbs the energy from the nearby radio sets or
        transceivers and due to the integrated semiconductor&nbsp;
        structures could convert it into the direct current. This
        assumption has been proved wrong with certainty, after a crystal
        cell was operated for several months in a Farady cage under full
        electromagnetic shielding, which has not affected in any
        measurable manner on the energy release. In these tests,
        however, sporadic noise increases in the high frequency range
        have been detected, which particularly at high temperature
        variations undoubtedly appeared with more than 3 dB high noises
        and which due to the above mentioned full electromagnetic
        shielding inevitably must be due to the&nbsp; internal processes
        or actions in the crystal cell. A further testing of these noise
        increasing events is recommended, however, first of all, any
        direct correlation to a possible energy source is not seen,
        whose determination, however, was a main topic. </p>
      <p>At last, however, this can not be completely ruled out, as
        well, at the present state of the research. </p>
      <p>The second main point in the investigation was the issue,
        whether the possible cause for the energy release was due to
        nuclear transformations or conversions. As far as I know, this
        is always linked with emissions, which should be proved in a
        gamma spectrometer. In a 16-hour long test, it was revealed that
        the crystal cell does not show any type of emissions of energy
        quanta or particles, which would stand out in a noticeable
        manner from the activity background. On the basis of this
        finding, the nuclear transformations or conversions as source of
        the energy were ruled out again. </p>
      <p>Subsequently the influence of the switching on and switching
        off of magnetic fields on the initial power was tested. This
        corresponds in the system theory to the excitation of an unknown
        system for determination of a transmission factor or transfer
        coefficient from one input signal to an output signal. In the
        measurings (tests) magnetic fields up to a strength of&nbsp; 0.7
        milli Tesla were applied, however, on their switching on and
        switching off, there was not any measurable influence on the
        power of a crystal unit, which can be attributed to the magnetic
        field. The magnetic field measurings (tests) were made only for
        a short period of a few minutes due to heating of the object
        being measured (tested) due to the considerable thermal power of
        the magnetic spools in combination with a big temperature
        coefficient of the crystal cell output power. A confirmation or
        certification of the measuring (test) using a cooling system for
        temperature stabilisation in combination with the application of
        higher magnetic field strengths, would be a logical conclusion
        for confirmation or relativity of the findings till now. </p>
      <p>Special attention was paid to the power characteristics of
        crystal cells in order to find out, whether the crystal cells,
        like the most common energy sources, can be
        described/represented as a current source or voltage source with
        an internal resistance. For that a crystal cell was loaded
        stepwise with different resistances and the resultant current
        values and voltage values were determined after an initial
        transient phenomenon of a couple of minutes. Particularly within
        the stepwise discharging phase of the crystal cell it became
        clear, that a crystal cell releases a constant current in a wide
        load range. An optimum power operation can be achieved through
        the use of an as big as possible load resistor, in which the
        current flow corresponds just to the maximum current of the
        crystal cell. </p>
      <p>Presumably the special emphasizing short-circuit behaviour of
        crystal cells is closely connected with the power behaviour. On
        my first visit to the research laboratory of Marcus Reid, it was
        demonstrated to me, how a crystal cell after several years of
        short-circuit automatically charged within a few minutes. In
        several own short-circuit tests carried out over a period of a
        couple of days and weeks my assumption was confirmed that the
        crystal cell, a few minutes after cancellation of a
        short-circuit, returns back to original power characteristics. </p>
      <p>More accurate tests of this automatic charging by means of
        cyclic load tests provided the indication that after switching
        off a load, an exponential approximation of the voltage in the
        unloaded state releases for several minutes, whereby this
        process can have a sudden voltage-increase after a few seconds
        up to a few minutes, linked with highly increased noises of the
        voltage during this increase phase. </p>
      <p>A very large influence on the initial power can be proved due
        to the temperature. Just a few degrees increase in temperature
        over the ambient temperature increases the initial power to
        double. </p>
      <p>In an experiment carried out intentionally as destructive
        measuring (test), the power of a crystal cell could be increased
        by ten times compared to the power measured (tested) at an
        ambient temperature of about 21oC. However, above 60oC a sudden
        fall in power occurred, which was obviously irreversible in
        nature and which continued to be available even after the
        cooling of the crystal unit to an ambient temperature. By
        observing the power of the affected crystal cell in the next
        weeks a certain recovery effect was noticed, however, till
        today, the original performance or efficiency has not been
        achieved. </p>
      <p>All tests carried out till date lead to the conclusion that
        there is an energy source in the crystal cells, which can not be
        explained with any of the technical systems known till now. A
        continuation of the tests using efficient measuring (testing)
        techniques, therefore, seems to be a reasonable offer, which
        will not satisfy unexplainable phenomena permanently. As quite
        often in the history there are enigmas. The crystal cell also
        poses an enigma, initially, which can be solved, however, by
        suitable and carefully carried out tests in future, with
        certainty. In my personal opinion, it could be useful to set-up
        measuring arrangements (experimental tests), which prove the
        influence of quantum mechanical phenomena on the power or
        performance of crystal cells. As far as I know, physicists agree
        that in the fluctuations at quantum plane, an enormous energy
        reservoir is present, which, however, for local application of
        the second law of thermodynamics, can not be made available. My
        assumption is that the atomic arrangement in the crystal lattice
        of a crystal cell is possibly successful in producing a
        non-local energy flow, which makes it necessary to use a much
        broader application of the second law of thermodynamics,
        possibly in the scale of the entire universe. </p>
      <p>I confirm, that I consider it to be necessary to continue
        research into the crystal cells until final clarification about
        their working principle, in view of the chance to discover an
        energy source unutilized till now. Not least, the withdrawal or
        removal of several ampere-hours of electric charge and several
        watt-hours of electric energy during the experiments, without
        putting-in in advance visible energy in the crystal cells being
        tested, is in favour of the assumption, that here we could be
        dealing in a worthwhile direction of research for alternative
        energies. </p>
      <p>When this would be confirmed in the future, then&nbsp; the
        crystal cell like solar cells and wind turbines, would be viewed
        as a technical device for removal of energy from an open system,
        whereby the type and the character of the open energy system
        would be required to be explained through further tests and
        particularly through theory in the field of Physics. In this
        case the crystal cell would agree with my profound conviction,
        that energy can only be transformed from one energy form in to
        another energy form, in accordance with all laws of Physics
        known till date. </p>
