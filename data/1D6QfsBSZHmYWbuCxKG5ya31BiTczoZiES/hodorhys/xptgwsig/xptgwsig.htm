      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Abstract:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Present-day communications
          systems largely make use of vector type radiation fields,
          i.e., electromagnetic waves, to convey information between
          distant points at the speed of light. Scalar type radiation
          fields, such as the gravitational field, however, might
          eventually be useful to convey information essentially
          &#8216;instantly&#8217; according to the author&#8217;s theories. With the
          development of very sensitive scalar type field detectors by
          the author, it is now possible to demonstrate some effects
          which appear to be attributable to such scalar fields. Several
          simple experiments which illustrate some of these points are
          described. These should provide a starting point for further
          experiments and investigations into these effects by the
          inquisitive experimenter and the open-minded private
          researcher.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A field in physics may be
          defined as a region in space which is under the influence of
          some &#8216;effect&#8217;, typically an electric, magnetic, or
          gravitational field. This field consists of interlocking
          closed loops of electric and magnetic lines of flux, and thus
          are vector type fields, as whirlpool fields. Such fields must
          therefore be described in terms of vectors, since a magnitude
          and direction is necessary to fully describe such fields. The
          theory of electromagnetism has been highly developed along
          these lines and thus is now useful in many aspects of high
          technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Less understood is the
          theory of fields which are conservative in nature and thus can
          be described in terms of magnitude alone. Such fields are
          called scalar fields. A common example of such a field is
          temperature, even though the gradient of such a scalar field
          will be vectorial. The gravitational field is also a scalar
          field and the gradients in this field are also vectorial. Less
          well-known are the conservative or scalar aspects of electric
          and magnetic fields. A scalar electric field is realized when
          the field is generated by the application of a voltage between
          two parallel plates, i.e., atypical parallel plate capacitor.
          An example of a &#8216;curl-free&#8217; or scalar field (conservative) in
          magnetism is seen in the H-fields which emanate from the end
          of a bar magnet into the space just beyond it. Such a field is
          scalar for only a short distance, however,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar fields of the
          electric, magnetic and gravitational type have interesting
          properties compared to their vector field counterparts. For
          example, scalar fields easily penetrate ordinary matter, while
          the gradients of such fields can also interact with matter.
          The scalar fields emanating from the end of the bar magnet,
          for example, can easily penetrate a thick material mass,
          provided the mass is non-magnetic and thus cannot support
          induced fields which can counter the penetrating field
          components. Therefore, while these properties of scalar fields
          could provide a basis for a new communication system, proper
          methodology will have to be developed for the generation and
          detection of such signals before the system cold become
          viable. Effort and progress in these aspects are being made.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A major step forward in the
          possibility of effecting scalar signal communications has been
          made with the development of very sensitive scalar field
          detectors by the author (Ref. 1) These detectors are presently
          being used in a wide range of applications by the author,
          including such facets as gravitational signal astronomy,
          gravity field measurements, l/f noise cancellation, Hooke&#8217;s
          Law type scale error-corrections, esoteric energy detection,
          and many other used. Discussed in this brief article will be
          the potential for using scalar fields, e.g., gravitational
          fields, in possible methods for communication or signaling
          purposes.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar Field Detector:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The scalar field detector
          used by the author in the experiments described in this
          article is very simple and is shown in <b><a href="#fig1">Figure
              (1)</a></b>. It is&nbsp; l/f noise type detector and uses
          a Cmos op-amp which operates with a 1.5 volt supply. The unit
          is assembled in an aluminum box with self-contained batteries
          and the output is brought out with a filter type feedthrough
          in order to eliminate possible response to RF type ambient
          signals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Shown in <b><a href="#fig2">Figure

              (2)</a></b> is a simple audio amplifier which may be used
          with this detector. The readily available 386 IC has a gain of
          200 times and provisions are made for headphone use also.
          Small telephone amplifiers or mini-amplifiers are commercially
          available which make suitable ready-built audio amplifiers.
          The author used a mini-amplifier available from Radio Shack
          (#277-1008) for these tests with good results. The headphone
          jack is desirable for headphone listening to the many scalar
          signal sounds generated naturally in the universe and/or by
          man. Headphone listening also facilitates the detection of
          some of the weaker scalar field effects to be noted in these
          experiments.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar fields of the
          gravitational type are generated profusely in the universe and
          are detectable with the simple circuit of <b><a href="#fig1">Figure
              (1)</a></b>. The unit will respond to the individual
          impulses of gravity gradients as a &#8216;noise spectrum&#8217; which can
          be heard with the audio amplifier or displayed as &#8216;grass&#8217; on
          the oscilloscope. Careful listening to the audio signal
          response will also reveal, not only &#8216;noise&#8217;, but also some
          coherent response and &#8216;musical&#8217; tones as well. These will be
          considered later.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Man-made scalar
          gravitational signals are largely due to oscillating masses or
          rotating asymmetric masses. A translation of mass will also
          generate &#8216;signal&#8217; which are due to perturbations of an
          apparent standing-wave pattern in the universe&#8217;s background
          radiation which is believed to have been created by the
          various processes in the universe. (Ref. 2)</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Local weak scalar signals of
          the &#8216;pure&#8217; electric type or the &#8216;curl-free&#8217; magnetic type may
          be generated with the circuits shown in <b><a href="#fig3">Figure
              (3)</a></b>. These signals have been detected at about 75
          feet, the maximum lab distance available. However, they are at
          about the same level as the background radiation and thus are
          somewhat difficult to ascertain within the general background
          responses. The use of different pulse rates for these
          generators helps to properly identify the correct scalar
          signal. In general, low pulse rates must be used with these
          signals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scalar signals of the pure
          electric field type are generated mainly by charge impulses
          which are divorced from any accompanying magnetic components.
          The curl-free magnetic modes utilize parallel magnetic fields
          (H-fields) generated near the pole of a magnetic source field
          (in loose terms, a magnetic monopole). Scalar fields o the
          electric type can also be generated by special coil
          configurations in which the magnetic component (but not the
          electric components) is cancelled. These configurations are
          under consideration by the author.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Experimental Tests</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Listening to the sounds of
          scalar signals being detected by the detector of <b><a
              href="#fig1">Figure (1)</a></b> on headphones can be quite
          impressive. Adjust the amplifier sound level for best response
          to the particular sound being studied. Of particular interest
          are some of the &#8216;musical&#8217; sounds which appear to come from the
          same points in our Galaxy on a daily basis. At the author&#8217;s
          location at about 42o N. latitude, these sounds seem to
          originate in the Perseus and Auriga regions of our galaxy.
          Perhaps some of these signals might be extraterrestrial
          intelligence signals, thus those experimenters interested in
          SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) may want to
          investigate this aspect of this detector.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector is also
          extremely sensitive to modulations of the ambient
          gravitational field by local mass translations (Ref. 2). The
          so-called microwave background radiation (MBR) appears to have
          a standing-wave pattern structure in the universe which has a
          &#8216;wavelength&#8217; of about 0.25 centimeter, corresponding to the 3o
          K black-body temperature for this radiation. The local
          translation of mass affects this structure as a rather intense
          perturbation which appears as a strong &#8216;rushing&#8217; sound in the
          detector audio output. The experimenter may best observe this
          effect by slowly waving his arm back and forth at about a 1-2
          Hz rate so as to establish a strong &#8216;resonance&#8217; effect and
          then stops this movement at some peak swing. He will then note
          that this resonance effect will continue for many minutes,
          even hours, or until the coherent effect is destroyed by some
          other gravitational effect, such as your own beating heart, or
          by oscillating a mass, starting with large excursion which are
          then tapered down to a standstill. That these modulations are
          truly due to mass in motion, can be seen by oscillating a
          pendulum, or rolling a mass. These devices will disturb the
          vacuum, i.e., the gravitational background, independently of
          any human action. This effect will drop off with the square of
          the distance as with all scalar signals. The author has
          detected the oscillation of a pendulum 150 feet away which
          appeared to have the same response in detected intensity as
          when the pendulum was only 5 feet away.&nbsp; Therefore, such
          signals could have very extended ranges.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An interesting experiment
          can be performed with this pendulum, which is a two pound
          weight suspended from a six foot height with a light weight
          string. Set the pendulum in motion with about a five foot arc
          length. Adjust the detector volume for a good response to this
          swinging disturbance of the vacuum, i.e., the universe. Now
          take the detector along in your car. Notice that the response
          remains about the same intensity even when the detector is
          inside the car. Now drive slowly to a distance of about one
          mile from the site of the pendulum. You will notice that the
          pendulum response will fall off with the distance (probably at
          the l/r<sup>2</sup> rate), but will still be noticeable at the
          one mile distance. As you return, you will notice that the
          response will continually increase in level and will have the
          original amplitude when you have returned to the site.
          However, most likely, the pendulum has stopped its
          oscillations by this time, but the disturbance in the universe
          remained! This effect appears to be typical of scalar signals
          or gravitational perturbations in this universe.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is one drawback,
          however. Scalar signals, once generated, tend to propagate
          continually until dissipated or over-ridden in some way.
          However, the perturbations can be encoded, e.g., if a gravity
          signal is pulsed at some rate, the pulse rate will be
          maintained. For example, if the 5 Hz LED scalar signal
          generator shown in <b><a href="#fig3">Figure (3)</a></b> is
          pulsed on every 5 seconds, the gravitational field will be
          excited with 5 Hz pulses every 5 seconds even if the original
          excitation has ceased. It appears that gravitational
          communications will probably require some sort of pulse-code
          modulation which can defeat the continuing propagation
          characteristics of the vacuum. The buzzer scalar source of the
          type shown in <b><a href="#fig3">Figure (3c)</a></b> can
          apparently do this to some extent. The strong desired scalar
          signals from the diode CR<sub>1</sub> appear to be followed by
          a &#8216;cancellation&#8217; pulse, either from the scalar H-field shown,
          the g-field generated by the armature, or possibly some
          remaining E-field pulse at the breaker points. These fields
          may act in such a way that the desired &#8216;buzzing&#8217; scalar
          signals are strongly transmitted, but they are not strongly
          repeated, i.e., the repeating pulses appear to be way, way
          down in level. Therefore, it was possible to transmit low
          speed Morse Code signals by these means. While some brief
          tests were made a ta distance of about 200 feet, the range is
          probably much greater than that, even though a very low level
          (1.5 volt) buzzer source was used. Perhaps the early radio
          experimenters with their &#8216;spark gap&#8217; induction coil
          transmitters were really using scalar &#8216;waves&#8217; in addition to
          EM waves in their systems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also interesting to
          note that it seems that maximum energy excitation takes place
          at about the 1-2 Hz rate. This appears to be a natural
          resonance frequency either as an earth resonance or as a
          universe resonance effect. Lightning stroke induced HV scalar
          signals also appear to be a good source for these very low
          frequency excitations (Ref. 3). There is room for much
          research here.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Psychic effects?</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are many sources for
          gravitational perturbation excitations at the local level. For
          example, a good 1-2 Hz resonance can be established by simply
          pressing the thumb and first finger together at this rate.
          When a good rate is established, cease the excitation with the
          fingers. The modulation will now continue at this same rate.
          Now think hard to slow down this rate: the rate will slow
          down! Relax and the rate will return to the original
          excitation! Are these psychic effects or are they a control of
          time? Or are they related to unconscious heart beats of muscle
          tensions as if nerve impulses are scalar in nature? I will
          leave it to the reader to perform the experiment and decide
          for himself. That these effects are apparently real is seen in
          that the experiment can be recorded on tape and stored.</font>
      </p>
