<p><b>I. Remarks on the IA-type of GW Detector, Circuit #10,000-B</b>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>A.</b> Preliminary tests
of the instrumentation amplifier type (IA) GW detector circuit #10,000-B
indicated that the signals "heard" on this unit are <u>very much alike</u>
those heard on Geiger Counters! This seems to imply that perhaps radioactivity
effects might be "set off" by these GW signals?

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>B.</b> Some speculative
thoughts on this:

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">1. Possibly the GW signals
present at each zenith-nadir line on earth generate the "impulses" needed
to "excite" the radioactivity events?

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">2. The type of signals being
"heard" on the IA-type detector at this location should also be available
at every other individual zenith-nadir line on earth!

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">3. Each individual "impulse"
is a rhysmonic vector force and thus should easily be physically located
well within the realm of an atomic nucleus.

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">4. The energy of such rhysmonic
impulses could thus be possibly transferred to certain atomic nuclei which
are momentarily unstable to enable the observed radioactivity. This should
be possible since we know that GW signals also react with matter (mainly
nuclei) to cause the observed gravity acceleration and the reaction in
these capacitive detection elements. The actual process needed for the
radioactivity, however, requires further study.

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>II. Conclusions</b>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">This appears to be a viable
area for further study investigation and it could turn out to be of great
importance. It would be nice of a few of you could try the experiment and
see if you could confirm my observations here. When time permits I will
try some other devices and continue some studies here also.

<p><b>Note 1:</b> Input device <u>must</u> be current generator. Will coils
work here? Evaluated with capacitors over range of 0.1 uF to 3000 uF works
okay here.
<p><b>Note 2:</b> LP filter is now raised to a cutoff of about 100 Hz.
<p><b>Remarks:</b>
<p>(1) Circuit #10,000-B is constructed within an <u>aluminum box</u> but
the detector "device" input is brought out in pin jacks -- to facilitate
test of other devices.
<p>(2) Used matched 10k resistor in the buffer stage (best CMMR).
<p>(3) Circuit swings +/1 around 0 volts; set control was added to enable
use with positive input chart recorders.
<p>(4) Circuit is basic instrumentation amplifier.
<p>(5) Circuit is <u>very</u> sensitive (large outputs).</blockquote>
