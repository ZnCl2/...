<div class="MsoNormal">
<blockquote>The basic GW detector unit, #75, as described in the January
1989 issue of R-E’s Electronic Experimenter handbook, is generally used
in a linear mode of operation, with a rather fast moving chart recorder
speed on a typical pen-type chart recorder. In the gravimeter mode, the
various cosmic signals, e.g., the density "shadows" of distant masses,
or the "impulses" of the more distant cosmic events, show up as "modulations"
of the earth gravity field as measured at the site of the detection unit.
On the moving chart paper these signals would appear as "wiggles" above
and below the average value of the g-field and thus as variations in the
dc levels of the detector output. These responses reveal the presence of
novae, supernovae, galaxy structures, black holes, etc., as is described
in the many simple articles by the writer.</blockquote>

<div class="MsoNormal">
<blockquote>Bill Ramsay reported to me in August that in a special experiment
he undertook where he coupled a type #75 detector to a Rustrak 288 recorder
unit, he serendipitously noticed many "embedded forms" in the scatter plot
of the data points as recorded by the general system shown in <b><a href="#cnote1h">Figure
(1)</a></b>. The writer has since obtained a Rustrak 288 unit (courtesy
of Bill Pendergast) and was able to verify the embedded forms seen by Bill
Ramsay. To this writer, however, the forms appeared to be very similar
to the images of the large and superclusters of galaxies as was noted by
the optical astronomers. Therefore, an attempt was made to understand how
the system of <b><a href="#cnote1h">Figure (1)</a></b> could result in
what appeared to be very much a two-dimensional image of a small sector
of our universe as "drift scanned" by the rotation of the earth. This Note
will report on some of these thoughts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These rugged little units are relatively low cost and had served
many monitoring applications in the past. Thus many units are still available
at small cost ($20-40) in some surplus outlets. Many are used by amateurs
in radio astronomy applications. They are also useful in this application
--- at least for the early stages of development.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The typical Rustrak unit is simply a 1 mA meter movement in
which the needle pointer is free to move as in any other D’Arsonval meter
movement. There is no friction as seen in some pen-type recorder units.
The typical Rustrak unit has a chart speed of 1/2" or 1" per hour, a very
slow chart speed. The chart drive motor also drives a nylon gear which
keeps a spring-loaded bar mechanism off the meter pointer and the chart
paper until after a 2-second delay, and then allows the spring-loaded bar
to "slam" the needle against a roller-backed pressure-sensitive chart paper
so as to create a dot (or data point) on the chart paper. The needle position
at that moment is dependent on the analog output signal from the detector
section. The typical #75 GW detection circuit, using a bipolar IC, has
an output on the order of 1 to 3 volts, depending on the sensitivity and
gain levels. However, a diode offset section can be used to eliminate most
of this dc level and thus one can look at only the dc variations, which
could be in the order of 0 to 100 mV. The Rustrak meter (1 mA at 100 ohms)
is used directly as a 0-100 mV meter, no multiplying resistor is needed.
The detector gain control may be used to center the response on the chart
paper. Thus, as the chart paper moves, say at 1/2" per hour, the meter
output is sampled at the 2-second rate. This creates a "scatter plot" of
some 1800 data points per hour. Under these conditions there is much correlation
between the GW "shadow" densities and the scatter plot of data points,
giving rise to the "forms" seen in these scans. Since dense masses will
tend to appear as "holes" or bare spots in the scatter plot, i.e., the
images are negative, that is, the chart record high density mass as white,
and low density mass as black.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To understand just how the Rustrak detection system may be
operating, we need to review the GW detection system itself. Basically,
the GW detector (the input capacitor in the #75 unit) is a scalar field
detection unit. Its basic response is to the earth’s g-field at the zenith-nadir
line location of the capacitor. If there were no other scalar fields present
in this line other than the earth g-field, the unit would develop a constant
output voltage if the g-field remained constant. However, the universe
is replete with many scalar signals due to such cosmic events as novae,
supernovae, as well as gravity "shadows", i.e., density variations due
to the presence of massive structures in the universe. Scalar signals which
are completely parallel, i.e., in a direct line with each other, will interact
algebraically, e.g., increase or decrease the scalar potential, depending
on the polarity of the potentials. In rhysmonic cosmology, the universe
is basically Euclidian in structure, thus the scalar vectors are essentially
straight-line vectors over the entire range of a finite universe. Thus
those vectors will interact with the electron-ion structure of the dielectric
of the detector capacitance, mainly with the ionic portion. Therefore,
the variations in the g-field will result in variations in the E-field
of the capacitor, and thus could be coupled out as current variations in
the circuitry. In theory, this interaction would be between one g-field
vector and one electron-ion pair in the capacitor. Thus the interaction
"beam diameter" is basically only on the order of an atomic dimension or
so, a very fine resolution, indeed. In practice, the intersection will
be between may g-field vectors and many electron-ion pairs, thus the "beam
size" will be due to a finite area and volume of the capacitor dielectric,
but still a very, very small size. While some VLA type radio astronomy
"telescopes" may be able to resolve, say a dime, at a distance of 50 miles
or so, the GW "telescopes" should be able to resolve less than a pinpoint
at twice the distance! Thus GW techniques may have much potential as a
"new window" to the universe. The sketches of <b><a href="#cnote1k">Figure
(2)</a></b> and <b><a href="#cnote1l">Figure (3)</a></b> should make these
points clearer.</blockquote>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-right:.5in;mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:
auto">
<blockquote>A simplified view of the capacitor detector is given in <b><a href="#cnote1k">Figure
(2)</a></b>. The detector capacitor here is a 2200 uF (10 volt) electrolytic
capacitor having a rolled section of about 0.5" in diameter and 0.75" length.
Experiments have shown that only the center portion of these capacitors
are "active" in these detections, in this case about a 0.25" portion. Normally,
in the linear type detections, the capacitor orientations are disregarded.
However, in the Rustrak application, the capacitor is oriented with its
long axis in the north-south direction. The reason for this is that the
Rustrak application will not only respond to the zenith-nadir line, but
also to the small angle formed by the active portion of the capacitor along
the meridian position. We do not have to worry about responses along the
latitude line, i.e., the east-west line, at the observing position since
the earth’s rotation will effectively cancel out such responses. This will
be explained in a future Note. <b><a href="#cnote1k">Figure (2)</a></b>
is largely self-explanatory, while <b><a href="#cnote1l">Figure (3)</a></b>
tried to give you an idea of the GW response "sector width" of the two-dimensional
plots seen with this Rustrak system.</blockquote>

<p><b>Figure 2: A Simplified Presentation of Rustrak Scanning </b>~ Remarks:
(1) The detector capacitor is already "pre-polarized" with the polarization
a function of the capacitor geometry. For tubular capacitors, the earth
g-fields will interact with only a small segment of the capacitor as depicted
here. If the capacitor were oriented in the East-West direction, the tighter
radial E-fields would show less interaction. (2) As the capacitor "drift-scans"
with the earth’s rotation, the detector will respond to a smaller sector
of the universe as determined by the angle B-O-C. A larger active capacitor
section would thus scan a proportionately larger sector of the universe.
(3) Cosmic events are continually modulating the many g-field vectors along
the meridian line in sector B-O-C. There is no interaction seen in the
vector along a latitude line. (4) In the simple Rustrak tests, the "fast"
novae and supernovae type responses are used as a "sweep frequency" to
move the Rustrak needle above and below a reference line (which is the
zenith-nadir line A-O) shown here. During these sweeps, the cosmic responses
are still superimposed on the Rustrak needle responses. As the needle sweeps
across this sector, the 2-second meter "slam" will reflect the charge conditions
in the capacitor for the particular g-field vector which is in line with
that needle position. For example, a very dense GW "shadow" at such a position
will result in a fast needle movement at that position, increasing the
odds that the slam will "miss" such a spot -- leaving a "bare" spot as
a sign of dense mass. (5) In practice, the GW detector will respond to
signals above and below the earth, as well as strong signals well off the
zenith-nadir line (on the meridian); thus further analysis of the responses
are required. The responses are further "confused" in that the earth in
its cosmic journey will "vector scan" a slightly different sector of the
universe daily. Only the <u>very dense</u> structures will tend to "repeat"
on a daily basis. (6) The use of novae for the sweep frequency will result
in purely random sweeps -- thus the response should be free of"artifacts".
Use of circuit "oscillations" or injected signals as sweps would probably
result in "artifacts" here.

<p><br>
<p><b>Figure (3): Some Thoughts on the Rustrak "Scan Sectors"</b>
<p><b>Conclusions:</b> (1) use similar math for distance further out in
the universe. (2) While the "active" section of the 2200 uF capacitor may
be somewhat larger than the assumed 0.25", the sectors scanned in these
experiments are <u>very narrow</u>! This would explain why the daily scans
are so much different! The earth's movement in the cosmos would result
in monitoring different sections of the universe on a daily basis, and
only the very dense structures might "repeat" daily. Most structures "seen"
are <u>very deep</u> in space. There is room for much research here in
terms of detector geometry and sampling techniques!</blockquote>

Since they were exploratory tests, they may not be the ideal tests, but
they should be able to illustrate some of the points noted here.</blockquote>

was made with the system seen in <b><a href="#cnote1h">Figure (1)</a></b>.
Back-to-back diode pairs are generally used in the diode off-sets since
the detectors are usually biased with dual power supply voltages and thus
could have plus and minus output polarities. If the output is only a single
polarity, single diodes of the proper polarity could just as well be used.
In this particular test, a three diode (pair) section was used to enable
an increased signal output which could be still recorded in the chart paper.
The responses were with a 10 Hz LP filter and will be considered in the
next section.</blockquote>

and <b><a href="#cnote1o">Figure (4c)</a></b> were made with a MOS-type
detector unit which operated at 1.5 volts. This unit had an input jack
which enabled insertion of other detection capacitors (or devices) for
special tests. In these two tests, a 15,000 uF 925 volt) electrolytic capacitor
was used as the detection device in order to check out the theory that
the "sector width" in the Rustrak system was dependent upon the length
of the active portion of the detector capacitance. The 15,000 uF capacitor
was approximately 1" in diameter and 2.25" in length -- giving an active
length in the order of 0.75" or three times that seen with the 2200 uF
capacitor. In Figure (4b), a two-section diode offset pair was used as
well as a 10 Hz LP filter. In Figure (4c), the two-section diode offset
was eliminated and a x2 inverting gain stage was added to drive the output
levels to fill the Rustrak chart paper with responses. The LP filter was
changed to 1 Hz to limit these responses to the more local cluster of galaxies.
These responses are also considered next.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The resolution of the Rustrak system, e.g., the size of the
"embedded forms" or the universe "structures" is independent of the scan
"sweep" frequencies or amplitudes, and even the chart speed, but is dependent
upon the LP filtering used. As the LP filter cutoff frequency is increased,
the unit will respond to the more distant universe structures, and thus
show up more structures and finer details in the larger structures. However,
the overall resolution is also limited by the slow sampling time of 2 seconds
and the finite size of data points, the size of the Rustrak "dot".
<p>The larger capacitor does show a wider "sector view" of the universe
due to the larger active section of the capacitor, but to take advantage
of this, the system gain should be able to expand this sector over the
entire chart range. The scan of <b><a href="#cnote1n">Figure (4b)</a> </b>has
the wide sector width of the 15,000 uF capacitor, but the low system gain
and the use of a 10 Hz filter has "compressed" all this data in but a small
section of the chart. Thus the scan is very much like an overexposed photograph
--- much of the data (dots) are overlapped, leading to an essentially over-scanned
data plot. In <b><a href="#cnote1o">Figure (4c)</a></b>, the sweep amplitude
was increased to somewhat over the Rustrak chart size (it was preset correctly,
but the amplitude increased in some way when the actual run was made).
However, even here, the use of a 1 Hz LP filter illustrates very well,
the somewhat larger structure sizes expected to be seen with the more "local"
superclusters!</blockquote>
