              An Alternative Determination for the Velocity of Light</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>I. Introduction ~</b> </p>
      <p>The nature of light and its velocity has always been a somewhat
        controversial subject and remains so to some extent even today.
        The disputed pointes of view are well-known to most readers of
        New Energy news and thus they will not be extensively considered
        here. However, some of the more salient points will be briefly
        stated ere as a prelude to a discussion of an alternate method
        of determining the velocity of light in the vacuum. </p>
      <p>Primarily, light is presently considered to be a wave motion in
        terms of electromagnetic theory, but it is also considered as an
        energy unit or photon in quantum theory. The aspects compliment
        each other; for example, the wave theory is generally applied to
        interactions between light signals, while quantum theory is used
        for light energy interactions, such as the photoelectric effect.
        Presently, the velocity of light is considered as absolute, <i>i.e</i>.,
        independent of the velocity of the source or the observer. Also
        the physical motion of any material body can never exceed the
        velocity of light. The velocity of light also serves as a
        connection between mass and energy as is noted in the well-known
        relation E = mc<sup>2</sup>. The velocity of light appears in
        many physical relations, especially those relating to the
        various fundamental constants of nature. Thus, the determination
        of the true value of this velocity is of utmost importance in
        physics and in cosmology in general. </p>
      <p><b>II. Experimental Determinations of the Velocity of Light ~</b>
      </p>
      <p>The first crude measurement (of importance) of the velocity of
        light was made by Roemer in 1675 in an experiment where he noted
        a change of time for the observance of the eclipsing of the moon
        Io by the planet Jupiter. The velocity determined here was in
        the order of 2.2 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec using the best
        parameters available to him at that time. However, since that
        time many more precise experimental measurements were made, as
        summarized in the 1983 paper by Pipkins and Ritter (1). Most of
        these determinations were in the order of 3 x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec, with the average being around 2.9979 x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec. The more recent measurements made around 1973 or so,
        gave a value of 2.9979245 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec, and this was
        the accepted value at that time. This generally remains the
        present day value, as given in some dictionaries of science (2)
        and the book <i>Gravitation</i> by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler
        (3). </p>
      <p>It should be noted that most of the above experimental
        measurements of the velocity of light were made in the presence
        of gases, primarily air and possibly water vapor, and thus does
        not truly represent the velocity in vacuum. However, the error
        introduced is considered to be very minimal. Here. However, I
        will consider the accepted value to be 2.99792 x 10<sup>10</sup>
        cm/sec, out to five decimal places only, so as to be of the
        sameorder of magnitude as for some of the other determined
        constants which will be used in the alternate calculations.
        Before doing so it is necessary to digress a bit to explain the
        nature of Planck&#8217;s Natural Units, which are basic to these
        determinations. </p>
      <p><b>III. Planck&#8217;s Natural Units (PNU) ~</b> </p>
      <p>Max Planck published in 1914 a curious aside in his book <i>The

          Theory of Heat Radiation</i>. I first became aware of this
        aside in 1959, when Dover Publications released a reprint of
        this volume (4). Planck suggested that experimentally determined
        universal constants could be used to &#8220;establish units of length,
        mass, time, and temperature, which are independent of special
        bodies or substances, which necessarily retain their
        significance for all times and for all environments, terrestrial
        and human or otherwise, and which may, therefore, be described
        as &#8216;natural units&#8217;&#8221;. Planck chose the constants h, his Planck
        constant, C, the velocity of light in vacuum, and G, the
        gravitational constant. Planck expressed the numerical values of
        these constants in the CGS system of units,<i> i.e.</i>,
        centimeters, grams, and seconds. By choosing the natural units
        so that each of the above constant assumes the value unity, he
        obtained the natural units: </p>
      <p>Length = L* = ( G h / C<sup>3</sup> )<sup>&frac12;</sup> <u>~</u>
        3.99 x 10<sup>&#8211;33</sup> cm </p>
      <p>Time = T* = ( G h / C<sup>5</sup> ) &frac12; <u>~</u> 1.33 x
        10 <sup>&#8211;43</sup> sec. </p>
      <p>Mass = M* = ( C h / G ) &frac12; <u>~</u> 5.37 x 10<sup>&#8211;5</sup>
        gm </p>
      <p>Using the data available to him at that time. </p>
      <p>A paper by McNish which appeared in May 1959 (5) seemed to
        relish the potentials stated by Planck but expressed concern
        about the uncertainty of arriving at a sufficiently accurate
        value for the gravitational constant. However, it occurred to me
        at that time that these natural units could perhaps be the
        dimensions of the aether, but pressures of earning a living and
        raising a family delayed my looking into this further at this
        time. However, in 1975 I was able to devote a few months to
        further studies in cosmology, primarily a fresh look at the
        nature and structure of space/time, the so-called aether. I was
        encouraged by reports on a &#8216;structure&#8217; for the vacuum as was
        given by Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (MTW) in their book (3).
        Especially interesting to me was their revision of Planck&#8217;s
        natural units (PNU), using the reduced Planck Constant, <strike>h</strike>,
        rather than h, since this was in agreement with my own
        &#8216;structuring&#8217; of a stationary aether. This I had reported later
        in my monograph, <i>Rhysmonic Cosmology</i>, which I released
        in 1985 (6). As a result, the PNU now became: </p>
      <p>L* <u>~</u> 1.6161 x 10<sup>-33</sup> cm </p>
      <p>T* <u>~</u> 5.3906 x 10<sup>-44</sup> sec. </p>
      <p>M* <u>~</u> 2.1765 x 10<sup>-5</sup> gm </p>
      <p>Where the calculations were carried out to the most probable
        fourth decimal place, using </p>
      <p>C <u>~</u> 2.9979 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec </p>
      <p>G <u>~</u> 6.6732 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/gm sec<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p><strike>h</strike> ~ 1.0546 x 10-27 gm cm<sup>2</sup>/sec </p>
      <p>where these values were averaged from the references cited
        here. Since C, G, and <strike>h</strike> can eventually be
        experimentally determined to higher orders of accuracy, the
        Planck Natural Units will also be determined more accurately in
        the future. </p>
      <p><b>IV. Application of PNU to the Velocity of Light ~</b> </p>
      <p>In Rhysmonic Cosmology (6) the velocity of light in vacuum was
        predicted to be due to a matrix-type structure from the vacuum.
        Here, electromagnetic effects were the result of a propagation
        factor, C*, could be called the Planck Velocity, and was equal
        to L* / T*. Substituting in the more recent determinations of
        the Planck natural units, </p>
      <p>C* = L* / T* = 2.99794 x 10<sup>10</sup> cm/sec, </p>
      <p>Which also is the experimentally determined velocity of light.
        It is surprising that this connection has not been mentioned by
        the quantum theorists (as far as I know) and especially by MTW.
        Therefore, it seems to me that the PNU really do describe the
        structure of the aether. In the above relation it is seen that
        the velocity of light would be constant in an undisturbed
        aether. The only way the velocity could change is if L* changes
        (which is possible in the presence of matte where the velocity
        would be reduced), or if T* changes, which some experiments
        could ascertain). </p>
      <p><b>V. The PNU and Dimensional Analysis ~</b> </p>
      <p>Since PNUs appear to describe the very structure of a
        stationary aether they may be truly fundamental units. As such,
        one can refine the experimentally determined fundamental
        constants with dimensional formula analysis. Two examples are
        give: </p>
      <p><strike>h</strike> ~ 1.0545 x 10<sup>-27</sup> gm/sec<sup>2</sup>
        (from experiment) </p>
      <p>The numerical value of h can be determined from PNU thus, </p>
      <p>h* = gm cm2/sec = M* L*2 / T* ~ 1.05449. </p>
      <p>Therefore, </p>
      <p><strike>h</strike> <u>~</u> 1.05449 x 10<sup>-27</sup> gm cm<sup>2</sup>/sec
(from

        PNU). </p>
      <p>Also, </p>
      <p>G <u>~</u> 6.673 x 10<sup>-8</sup> cm3/gm sec2 (from
        experiment, Ref. 1) </p>
      <p>G* = cm<sup>3</sup>/gm sec<sup>2</sup> = L*3 / M* T*<sup>2</sup>
        <u>~</u> 6.6736 </p>
      <p>Therefore, </p>
      <p>G <u>~</u> 6.6736 x 10<sup>-10</sup> cm<sup>3</sup>/gm sec<sup>2</sup>
        (per PNU). </p>
      <p>This technique was verified for many known constants, but with
        one notable exception: the value of, e, the quantum of charge. </p>
      <p>e <u>~</u> 4.803 x 10<sup>-10</sup> (gm cm<sup>3</sup>/sec<sup>2</sup>)
        <sup>1/2</sup>&nbsp; (from experiment). </p>
      <p>Dimensionally, </p>
      <p>e* = (gm cm<sup>3</sup> / sec<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup> = (M*
        L*<sup>3</sup> / T*<sup>2</sup> )<sup>1/2</sup> = 5.6226 </p>
      <p>Thus, </p>
      <p>e <u>~</u> 5.6226 x 10<sup>-10</sup> (gm cm3 /sec<sup>2</sup>
        )<sup>1/2</sup> (per PNU). </p>
      <p>Note that the PNU determined value of e is about 11.7 times
        larger than the classical experimentally determined value. This
        also explains why the so-called reciprocal fine structure
        constant, 1 / alpha, where e<sup>2</sup> is used, becomes the
        value 11.7 2 or approximately 137. Thus, thus PNU determination
        of e questions the experimentally determined value of e, the
        quantum of charge. </p>
      <p><b>VI. Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>The methods of Rhysmonic Cosmology (6) were basically used in
        the determination reported herein (with support from PNU and
        MTW). This material appears to confirm that there is a
        stationary aether, having a definite structure and very high
        energy content, probably related to the PNU and its many
        derivatives. The further study of this structure should interest
        many reader of <i>New Energy News</i> (NEN) and may possibly
        provide some clues to a more direct &#8216;extraction&#8217; of the latent
        energy in space/time. As reported in NEN, this energy source
        might have been tapped in some past and current experimental
        tests. To unambiguously do so may provide the total energy needs
        of mankind in the future without polluting the earth. The writer
        hopes that many readers will consider the possibilities allude
        to herein. </p>
