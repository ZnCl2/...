<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Impulse Gravimeter Circuit #1500
was fabricated in a plastic box 1.5" x 2.5" x 5" in size but with an aluminum
cover plate. All operating controls are brought out on this panel, as well
as an output jack and a small (1.5" square) tuning-type meter used to give
an indication of the output pulses developed by this unit. The unit was
primarily designed to demonstrate the gravitational ‘impulses’ and ‘shadows’
generated by the numerous Newtonian-type gradients developed in this universe.</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Meter is approx +/- 1.5 volts;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) Meter as obove reads impulses;
place 470 uF to 21,000 uF capacitor (or higher!) across input for use as
g-field gravimeter;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) Meter will read <u>up</u> or
<u>down</u> scale for increase in g-field, depending on which side of zero
scale the off-set is placed;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) Detector sensitivity (Gain) is
controlled with SW<sub>1</sub> for high or low gain;</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(5) SW<sub>2</sub> is on-off; SW<sub>3</sub>
is filter on-off.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Circuit:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The circuit used in this unit is
a typical electronic-type gravimeter but has had the parameters adjusted
for this particular application. The detector section (IC<sub>1</sub>)
is typical, but the sensing capacitor, C<sub>in</sub>, and the feedback
resistance, R<sub>f</sub>, have been made very large to: (1) increase the
basic sensitivity (gain) for the unit, and (2), to keep the input resonances
very much below 1 Hz, so as to avoid the many ELF ‘resonances’ seen in
the universe. Two levels of sensitivity (gain) are available with the switch,
SW<sub>1</sub>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The output of the detector is fed
directly to an amplifier stage (IC<sub>2</sub>) having a gain of about
10x. The ICs are J-FET input op-amps with high slew rates and input impedances
and thus are well-suited for this application. An off-set control is included
to enable the shifting of the unit’s operating point to either side of
the zero unit. This enables operation of the unit with a choice of pulse
polarity, e.g., the negative mode of operation will allow an increase in
the detected value of the earth’s g-field to read up-scale on the meter.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The internal low-pass filter is fixed
at about 10 Hz in the cut-off frequency for a good response to the gravitational
signals from the Local Supercluster Group of Galaxies, as well as our own
Milky Way Galaxy. This filter can be cut out if you wish to follow the
more remote events in the universe. The built-in 1.5 volt voltmeter (a
tuning meter) is not calibrated, but is used to determine the proper operating
point and levels for use with an external calibrated meter, a strip chart
recorder, or even a computer unit.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation of this unit is quite simple:
Turn on the power supply and allow the unit a minute or so to stabilize.
Set the off-set control to its mid-position. Place the sensitivity (gain)
control to its low position and the filter to its off position. The gravitational
signals should be quite apparent as fairly rapid meter excursions. Switch
the gain control to its high position and the excursions should now be
more pronounced. The actual output voltages may now be read on an external
voltmeter or the strip chart recorder unit. Use the off-set control to
properly position the response on the meter or the recorder unit. The output
polarity can be reversed with the of-set control or by actually exchanging
the output leads. The experimenter should become adept at using this unit
in very short order.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While this unit was primarily intended
for response to fairly rapid ‘universe’ gravitational responses, it may
also be used as a g-factor gravimeter by loading the output with a capacitor
of about 21,000 uF to 100,000 uF, to increase the output time constant
to such a long time that the unit would respond only to the very slow changes
in the earth’s g-field levels. With the judicious selection of the operating
parameters it should be possible to set the unit to a reading of (32) on
the meter scale and have this conform to the value of 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>,
or possibly (98) to conform to the value of 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup> . The
unit can thus be made into a direct reading gravimeter for many purposes.
This type of operation will disclose to the experimenter the subtle changes
in the earth’s gravity which are affecting our weather patterns!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While the current requirements for
this unit are low, for best results the experimenter should ensure that
‘good’ batteries are used. This unit is a good introduction to the new
field of gravitational astronomy. Good experimenting to all!</font>
