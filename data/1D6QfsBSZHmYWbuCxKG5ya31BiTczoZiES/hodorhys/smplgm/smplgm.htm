      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravimeters (gravity meters)
          are devices which measure the averaged acceleration of the
          earth&#8217;s gravity field. Such instrumentation is best known for
          its use in determining changes in the earth&#8217;s gravity field
          which may be due to variations in buried masses in the earth.
          Such mass density variations could indicate the presence of
          oil or mineral deposits and thus gravimeters are used in
          prospecting. Most such gravimeters are but specialized
          sensitive scale systems in which the position of a fixed mass
          as a function of gravity field variations can be suitably
          recorded. However, in order to minimize spurious responses due
          to local vibrations, temperature changes, winds, etc.,
          complicated suspension methods are employed making such
          instruments much too costly for the average electronic
          experimenter-scientist. Described here, however, are a number
          of simple gravimeters, both mechanical and electronic in
          design, which can easily be built by the average electronic
          experimenter. While the units are sensitive enough for
          prospecting purposes, the amateur scientist may be more
          interested in observing gravity variations which are believed
          to be due to extraterrestrial gravitational effects. A number
          of repeatable variations are described and possible sources
          for these variations are given. Moreover, a number of other
          applications for the gravimeter are also described which
          should interest the experimenter. It is hoped that this
          material will foster increased interest in gravity and
          gravitation by the young experimenter-scientist who will be
          the foundation of our future scientific community.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravitation, per se, is a
          well-known force which is experienced by all people. Many see
          it in the actions of falling bodies, but especially notice its
          effect on their very own bodies as their weight. The force is
          unique in that while it is a matter of common everyday
          experience, it yet remains quite an enigma with respect to its
          true nature. Many also realize that the force of gravity is
          related to an object&#8217;s mass, e.g., if one has more body mass,
          one is &#8216;heavier&#8217;, and that such &#8216;heaviness&#8217; can be measured by
          scale systems. But how such gravity fields interact with mass
          remains very much a mystery to mankind even though many
          theories have been advanced to explain that effect. Foremost
          among these have been the relations as developed by Newton and
          Einstein, but those relations really only &#8216;describe the
          effect&#8217; and do not explain the true nature of gravitation. Yet
          such explanations are useful in providing a basis for a study
          of the earth&#8217;s gravity field.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity Defined:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The effect where bodies
          apparently &#8216;attract&#8217; each other is quantitatively summed up in
          the law of Universal gravitation as developed by Newton. Here,
          the force of attraction between two bodies, m, M, separated by
          a distance r is given by:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">F = Gm M / r<sup>2</sup>,</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where G is the so-called
          gravitational constant and has a value of about 6.67 x 10-8 if
          the centimeter-gram-second (CGS)system of units are used. The
          gravitational field at any point is given by the force exerted
          on a unit mass at that point. The field intensity at a
          distance r from a point mass m is thus Gm/r<sup>2</sup> and
          acts toward m. The gravitational potential V at that point is
          the work done in moving a unit mass from infinity to that
          point against the field. Therefore,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">V = -Gm/r</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And it is a scalar quantity
          measured in ergs per gram when the CGS units are used. While
          Newtonian gravity is describable as an &#8216;attraction&#8217; between
          two masses as depicted in <b><a href="#9d">Figure (1a)</a></b>,
          Einstein gravity is visualized as a curvature or warping of
          space and time around a massive body and us usually depicted
          as shown in <b><a href="#9e">Figure (1b)</a></b>. However,
          here we will be more concerned with the earth&#8217;s gravity field
          as defined by the &#8216;weight&#8217; of an object.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Weight Defined:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In its simplest terms,
          weight is generally defined as the force with which a test
          body is attracted toward the center of the earth. In terms of
          Newton&#8217;s Law this becomes:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Force = Weight = W = mMG / R<sup>2</sup>
          ,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Where m is the test mass, M
          is the mass of the earth, R is the radius of the earth, and G
          is the gravitational constant. This weight will be in poundals
          (using English units) and in dynes (using metric units). The
          above equation may be simplified to:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">W = mg , where g = MG / R<sup>2</sup>
          .</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The value of g is a measure
          of the acceleration of the earth&#8217;s gravity field (free fall)
          near the earth&#8217;s surface and is generally considered to be
          constant at a particular location on earth. Thus this relation
          is similar to the familiar F = ma seen in mechanics. The value
          of g is in the order of 32 ft/sec2 or 980 cm/sec2. Since
          weight depends upon the amount of mass and the acceleration of
          gravity, a definition of a standard weight would require the
          fixation of this mass amount and also a location on earth
          where this weight was determined. By international convention,
          the standard mass is the International Prototype Kilogramme
          and is represented by a platinum-iridium standard preserved
          near Paris, France. Other secondary standards, based upon this
          primary standard, are located in other countries as well.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dependency of Weight on
            Geographical Location:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It can be seen from the
          above equations that weight on earth is dependent on the earth
          mass, M, the earth radius, R, and the gravitational constant,
          G. The earth mass may be assumed constant and if the
          gravitational constant is assumed constant, then the earth
          radius is the only variable. Its value depends upon one&#8217;s
          latitude position and height with respect to the surface of
          the earth. The radius of the earth is about 15 miles less at
          the poles than at the equator. In addition, centrifugal forces
          due to the earth&#8217;s rotation can reduce the &#8216;pull&#8217; of gravity,
          being greatest at the equator and zero at the poles.
          Therefore, when consideration is taken of these factors, a ton
          weight (2000 lbs) that is first measured at sea-level at the
          north pole will be found to weigh about 7 lbs less at
          sea-level at the equator. Also, for example, the value of g at
          Paris, France, is about 32.184 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>, while the
          value of g at New Orleans USA would be about 32.129 ft/sec<sup>2</sup>,
          or about 0.17% less. While the overall mass of the earth is
          assumed to be constant, there may be localized variations in
          earth density which can and do affect the value of g locally
          and thus the weight. For example, the presence of a salt dome
          (which can signify oil deposits) may reduce the value of g
          above such a deposit, while &#8216;heavy ore&#8217; deposits may
          significantly increase the value of g as depicted in <b><a
              href="#9f">Figure (2)</a></b>. Also, it will be shown
          later that the gravitational constant, G, may not really be
          constant in that it can be affected by certain &#8216;cosmological
          events&#8217;, both as very short term effects as well as somewhat
          longer term effects. Thus the accelerating factor, g, may vary
          at any particular location, and such variations may actually
          be measurable with devices which can be termed gravity meters
          or gravimeters.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Mechanical Gravimeters:</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravity meters, presently,
          fall into two general classes of devices of a mechanical
          nature, but the author will later describe gravimeter devices
          which are of an electronic nature. Present day mechanical
          gravimeters are mostly either of the pendulum type or the
          sensitive balance scale type.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Pendulum Gravimeters</i>:
          These systems have been used to obtain the most accurate
          determinations of the value of g at a particular location. It
          is shown in its most simple form in <b><a href="#9g">Figure
              (3a)</a></b>. Here, a small bob (weight) is suspended from
          a point by a light thread. The period of oscillation for small
          amplitude swings is determined by the formula T = 2 pi x
          square root of l/g, where l is the length of the thread and g
          is the acceleration of free fall. Thus g is simply determined
          here for any particular location. The most accurate
          measurements are made with specially protected torsion-type
          pendulums, such as was used in the many Cavendish type
          experiments in the past.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Balance Scale Gravimeters</i>:
          These are, in effect, simply very sensitive spring balances in
          which the change in weight of a fixed mass is measured. It is
          shown in its simplest form in <b><a href="#9h">Figure (3b)</a></b>.
          A somewhat practical form of this type of gravimeter is
          provided by a well-made postal scale which reads but a maximum
          of 8 ounces. Such a scale should be able to read to the
          nearest 0.01 ounce. That such a scale is a valid gravimeter is
          seen in <b><a href="#9i">Figure (3c)</a></b> where the unit
          responded to a major cosmic mass structure which always
          appears in the Leo region of the celestial sphere. Note the
          diurnal repeatability as seen with this simple device. More on
          this later. Some digital type scales (based on Hooke&#8217;s Law,
          e.g., springs) may also serve as simple gravimeters.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Practical mechanical
          gravimeters should respond only to the actual vertical
          variations in the value of g. Commercial gravimeters of this
          type are constructed so as to not only limit lateral movements
          due to winds, temperature variations, vibrations, etc., but
          also to provide for an electrical-type readout rather than a
          purely mechanical readout so that the variations could be
          electrically scored and/or displayed on some recorder unit.
          Therefore, these types of gravimeters are generally quite
          complicated and expensive, and thus beyond the means of the
          average amateur scientist. A depiction of a possible unit of
          this type is given in <b><a href="#9j">Figure (4a)</a></b>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A more practical mechanical
          gravimeter for the amateur scientist is shown in simplest form
          in <b><a href="#9k">Figure (4b)</a></b>. This is a typical
          spring balance system, but the &#8216;spring&#8217; of this system is a
          conductive compressible foam material, such as that which is
          used to safely ship very static-sensitive integrated circuits.
          Here, any variations in weight will appear as variation in
          compression of the foam and thus as variations in the
          resistivity of the material. The resistance can be directly
          measured with an ohmmeter, preferably one of the digital type.
          That such a device is a viable gravimeter for the amateur
          scientist is seen in <b><a href="#9l">Figure (4c)</a></b>
          where the response of the unit to what may have been a
          super-nova type event in the celestial sphere was recorded.
          More on this later. The experimenter may wish to try different
          sizes of foam as well as reference weights for different
          sensitivity to gravity events. The amateur scientist is also
          cautioned to remain within the elastic limits of the foam
          material.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><i>Practical Electronic
            Gravimeter</i>: The circuit shown in <b><a href="#9m">Figure
              (5a)</a></b> is extremely simple but it contains the three
          elements of the electronic gravity meters as developed by the
          author. These are (1), a detector section, (2), a low-pass
          filter section, and (3), the output meter. The detector
          section has been designed around a readily available low cost
          programmable operational amplifier, the TLC271 device. The
          unit operates at about 1 mA of current from a single 9-volt
          self-contained battery supply. This op-amp has extremely high
          input impedance and low output bias and off-set currents. It
          is operated with the non-inverting input off-set to
          approximately the midpoint of&nbsp; the battery supply,
          primarily to enable the output voltage to remain near the
          center of the 0-10 volt output meter scale. Some limited
          positioning of this operating point is provided by the
          calibration control, R3, so as to set a reference point for
          any series of measurements. Such off-set operation also
          enables the unit to respond to AC variations in the g-factor
          as well as the averaged DC component. The AC component is due
          to certain cosmic gravity impulses while the DC component
          largely reflects the relatively steady flux due to the earth&#8217;s
          gravity. Therefore, the detector output is passed through a
          very low cut-off low-pass filter to smooth out (filter or
          integrate) these AC variations and thus this unit is truly a
          gravity meter or gravimeter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The detector section (IC<sub>1</sub>)
          is operated as a current-to-voltage converter device of very
          high gain due to the use of a very large feedback resistance,
          RF. The Newtonian-type gravity impulses which are superimposed
          upon the earth&#8217;s averaged gravity field will develop small
          currents from the 400 uF electrolytic input capacitor, C<sub>1</sub>,
          due to a gravity induced &#8216;polarization process&#8217; in the
          dielectric material of the capacitor. The more rapid current
          variations may be due to such factors as cosmic novae and
          supernovae, but the longer term variations are largely caused
          by the presence of large density variations in certain masses
          which may be in line with the detector capacitor and the
          earth&#8217;s gravity field. In other words, when such dense masses
          are located on the detector&#8217;s meridian position (i.e., the
          great circle on the celestial sphere which runs on a
          north-south line through the zenith), the density variations
          are superimposed upon the earth&#8217;s gravity flux and thus are
          detectable with this device as changes in the DC output
          levels. Density variations of nearby masses are detectable as
          well as extremely dense remote masses such as astronomically
          distant &#8216;black hole&#8217; structures. Thus this electronic-type
          gravimeter has extreme sensitivity without the problems of
          most mechanical type units.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For use as a g-factor
          measuring device (which is the role which we are considering
          here), the output of the unit is heavily filtered by the low
          pass filter made up of resistor, R<sub>4</sub>, and capacitor,
          C<sub>2</sub>. Capacitor C<sub>2</sub> used here is a small
          0.1 farad unit which was primarily intended for use as a
          keep-alive voltage unit for short term power supply failures
          for Cmos devices in computer units. It is available from radio
          Shack. Thus this gravimeter will respond only to the very
          slowly changing variations in the earth&#8217;s gravity field. To
          summarize: Capacitor, C<sub>1</sub>, is an almost ideal
          current generator (excited by the earth&#8217;s gravity flux) which
          is coupled to an operational amplifier configured as a
          current-to-voltage converter. This is an almost lossless
          current measuring scheme where the output voltage is
          proportional to the product of the input current and the
          feedback resistance. Thus the output voltage can be reasonably
          high even with the very low picoampere currents developed by
          gravity flux in the input capacitor detection element.
          Linearity is assured as the open circuit of the capacitor
          maintains the input terminal voltages to the op-amp near
          virtual ground, but slightly current biased by the
          gravity-induced polarization. The output voltage is read on
          the built-in voltmeter, but may also be couple out to an
          external meter or a recording device such as a computer or
          strip chart recorder by means of jack, J<sub>1</sub>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although the current drain
          for the unit is low, an on-off switch is provided to conserve
          battery power during non-use periods. It must be remembered
          that due to the long time constant of the output filter, the
          unit must be allowed several minutes to stabilize after
          turn-on. While the unit is best constructed within a metal
          enclosure to avoid possible RF interference (RFI), the author
          found that the presence of the input protective networks
          within the op-amp device tended to suppress such RFI
          responses. Thus the prototype unit was constructed in a
          plastic box and no RFI problems were experienced.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Electronic Gravimeter
            Performance:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While good performance as
          gravimeters may be obtainable from properly constructed and
          operated mechanical-type devices, the sensitivity of such
          units to external effects such as local vibrations or other
          movements generally limits their use to the amateur scientists
          lab area unless proper safeguards are used. The electronic
          gravimeter, however, does not suffer from any of these
          limitations and can be used anywhere, especially if a god
          grade of well-damped output meter is used. For a somewhat
          faster response to some gravity level variations, the amateur
          may want to reduce the value of the output filter capacitor.
          Perhaps a second 0.1 farad capacitor could be connected across
          one of the capacitors to short it out if the longer time
          constant filter is desired. In this way, two levels of output
          integration will be available, e.g., with 0.1 farad in the
          filter circuit, or with 0.05 farad in the filter circuit.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Therefore, it is recommended
          that the amateur scientist who wishes to enter this
          fascinating study of the earth's gravity field, begin by
          constructing the electronic gravimeter shown in <b><a
              href="#9m">Figure (5a)</a></b>. A typical diurnal
          variation in the measured g-factor is shown in <b><a
              href="#9n">Figure (5b)</a></b>. This particular gravimeter
          had an extra stage of DC amplification in order to better
          emphasize the DC variations on a strip chart recorder unit. As
          can be seen here, the earth's gravity flux varied about +/- 2%
          over a 24 hour period. These variations have been noted on <u>all</u>
          gravimeters built by the author (including mechanical-type
          units) and have been related by the author to the masses
          represented by two very large structures in our universe. One
          is the Milky Way Galaxy, our home galaxy, which is also
          optically visible to the unaided eye. The other structure,
          which was originally but a conjecture in the mind of the
          author, has since been consistently confirmed by several
          gravimeters. This is apparently a gigantic Super Galaxy System
          which forms the main body of our universe. It appears to have
          a spiral structure quite similar to the Milky Way galaxy. As
          the earth rotates on its axis, the response of the detector
          varies as the unit 'scans' a different meridian with this
          rotation. The scanning &#8216;beam&#8217; size here is essentially equal
          to the volume of the active portion of the dielectric in the
          detection capacitor element, C<sub>1</sub>. Thus the
          gravimeter has extreme resolution. The presence of dense
          masses in line with the detector-meridian position will
          &#8216;modulate&#8217; the g-factor levels, very much like translucent or
          opaque objects can also modulate the transmission of light
          beams in its path. A gravimeter using a heavily filtered
          (integrated) output is thus able to follow the slow changes in
          earth gravity levels due to &#8216;shadows&#8217; introduced by our own
          Galaxy masses (due to its close proximity), and also the slow
          changes caused by the Super Galaxy masses (due to its
          over-riding concentration of masses). If the variation due to
          our Galaxy is made much more apparent as shown by the dotted
          line response in <b><a href="#9n">Figure (5b)</a></b>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the dense structures
          in the universe are &#8216;seen&#8217; on a daily basis, the response
          shown in <b><a href="#9n">Figure (5b)</a></b> is shown
          extended for a 48 hour period in <b><a href="#9o">Figure 6</a></b>.
          Plotted in this way, the response illustrates very well a
          cosine-type variation which also correlates very well with a
          cosine-type variation in the microwave background radiation
          levels which have been determined by a number of experimental
          astrophysicists in the past. These evaluations strongly
          suggest that the so-called microwave background radiation is
          but the heating manifestation of the gravitational impulse
          background in the universe and thus the two are one and the
          same. Thus this may be an alternate explanation of the
          background radiation rather than the so-called Big Bang

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Applications of
            Gravimeters:</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The experimenter or amateur
          scientist may by now be asking the question: but of what use
          are these gravimeters? The answer to that is that there are a
          great many applications once the amateur has gotten a firm
          understanding of the earth&#8217;s gravity and how it is affected.
          One very common application has already been mentioned. That
          is its use in mineral and oil exploration, i.e., prospecting.
          Generally, very expensive mechanical-type gravimeters are used
          by the professionals here, but the amateur prospector should
          be able to use this electronic gravimeter effectively in such
          an application. It has sufficient sensitivity to respond to
          earth gravity changes introduced by bending one&#8217;s own body
          over the unit! Allowing for the long time constant for the
          unit, a reduction in g-factor in the order of 1% can be
          observed! Based on this observation, it should be possible for
          a submerged submarine to determine the presence of a surface
          vessel directly above it by purely passive methods, and thus
          of some use in the military.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another possible use for the
          gravimeter device, especially the more sensitive and faster
          responding units, are as a navigation aid device. For there
          are fixed dense masses in the universe, such as the Galaxy
          Centers shown in <a href="#9n">Figure (5b)</a>, and many,
          many others, which will appear on the gravimeter&#8217;s meridian
          position on a daily basis. Thus, the longitudinal position of
          a submerged submarine can be determined by this gravitational
          method. The celestial sphere does not have to be observed
          visually, and the depth of the sea waters has no effect on
          this response.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another very important
          effect is that the gravity levels on earth may have a direct
          effect on the upper stratosphere jet stream patterns and thus
          could affect our weather patterns. As shown in <b><a
              href="#9n">Figure (5b)</a></b>, the gravity flux
          variations are now about +/- 2% daily. Prior to about December
          5, 1986, the gravity flux variations were only about +/- 1%!
          Gravity flux changes due to a Milky Way Galaxy Center &#8216;event&#8217;
          noted December 6, 1986 (where a possible supernova-type event
          had generated a new very deep &#8216;black hole&#8217; (?) and accretion
          ring structure there) and a possible new Super Galaxy Center
          &#8216;event&#8217; on march 14, 1988 (which also appeared to increase the
          depth of the &#8216;black hole&#8217; there), may have been responsible
          for the increase in variations from 1% to 2%. These increased
          variations in the levels of the earth&#8217;s gravity are believed
          to be (in part) responsible for much of the most unusual
          weather conditions seen world-wide in recent months and years,
          as well as an increased potential for earthquakes in unstable
          regions of the earth.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another use for such
          gravimeters has been in the detection of the many supernova
          events occurring in this universe. Such events are best
          detected with reduced filtering in the output of the detector
          units. Presently, the author is concerned with the possible
          demise of the star Betelgeuse in the constellation of Orion.
          The Galaxy Center event of December 6, 1986 apparently
          triggered another very strong supernova event which appears to
          lie on the same meridian as Betelgeuse. Since gravitational
          impulses are essentially instantaneous, the optical, i.e.,
          electromagnetic effects, from a possible demise of Betelgeuse
          will not reach us for about 300 years, since Betelgeuse is
          about 300 light years away from us. However, if such an event
          did indeed occur, then we are in for one &#8216;helluva visual
          supernova&#8217; at that time!</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another application for the
          electronic gravimeter is to provide a correction signal to
          ordinary scales based on Hooke&#8217;s Law mechanisms, i.e.,
          springs. These errors are introduced by the earth gravity flux
          variations seen in <b><a href="#9n">Figure (5b)</a></b> and
          appear on most such scale systems, including the most common
          digital-type bathroom scales. Many consumers complain of the
          weight variations they see on such scales --- they are real
          variations, but do not imply that one&#8217;s body mass is changing
          that rapidly! The author has demonstrated that such scale
          errors are correctable with gravimeters fed-back to the
          electrical readout of such units. However, these &#8216;errors&#8217;
          should bring home to the amateur scientist the reality of
          these variations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are a great many other
          applications for gravimeters, especially the electronic
          versions, which will not be discussed here, but will come to
          the amateur researcher with increased understanding of the
          earth&#8217;s gravity as well as gravitation in general.</font> </p>
