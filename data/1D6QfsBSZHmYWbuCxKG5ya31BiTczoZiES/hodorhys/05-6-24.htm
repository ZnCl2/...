      </p>
      <p><b>Background</b> </p>
      <p>The methods of Rhysmonic Cosmology have resulted in the
        development of some gravitational &#8216;wave&#8217; detectors which have
        proven to be useful in a number of applications. Many such uses
        have been released to you over the years. A most useful
        application was in the detection of passive and active events
        occurring in the Universe in real time! One such detected event
        occurred at our Galaxy Center (along with others there since)
        which appear to have affected the Earth&#8217;s weather patterns! The
        strong scalar-type fields, (i.e., the gravity &#8216;winds&#8217;) may have
        primarily affected out jetstream patterns? Another event may be
        the HAARP experiments going on in Alaska now, which might also
        be affecting weather conditions on Earth? These two events could
        be as important (or even more so) in causing global warming on
        Earth (noticed primarily in the last decade of the 20th century)
        as is the release of greenhouse gases into the upper
        atmosphere&nbsp; (which is presently considered the prime
        suspect in the cause of global warming). Global warming is
        apparently real and has been verified in a number of ways, both
        directly and indirectly, e.g., as in the gradual disappearance
        of the Arctic Ocean ice packs! Therefore, it behooves us to look
        at other possible causes more closely. Here, further
        consideration will be given to the scalar-type fields (i.e.,
        gravity winds), which were discovered by rhysmonic detection
        techniques, as possible cause of global warming! </p>
      <p><b>Galaxy Center Events</b> </p>
      <p>While gravitational signal astronomy methods were developed
        long before the release of my Monograph, they were emphasized
        after the release of my Monograph. Some amateur radio
        astronomers became interested in this method and I was
        developing the observational techniques for our Galaxy Center
        (since they were quite repeatable) as a guide for the. It was
        during these tests that I observed a most remarkable event there
        in early December 1986! There was a supernova-type event there
        on about 12-6-86 which resulted in a new and very deep Black
        Hole there as well as very strong gravity winds. I issued a C.
        Note (12-10-86) to a very few colleagues to document this
        discovery and I predicted then that the event would most likely
        affect weather conditions (climate) on Earth for many years to
        come! </p>
      <p>I had also kept informing the National Science Foundation
        shortly thereafter, but was probably being ignored since I never
        heard back from them! I also made a general Press Release on
        3-12-87 trying to publicize the significance of this event but
        that evidently was also ignored! On 6-4-91, I observed the event
        that the new black hole at the Galaxy Center had suddenly
        disappeared (actually, I may have caught it in the act!), again
        causing strong gravity winds which were possibly affecting the
        Earth&#8217;s weather patterns (climate). These events also seemed to
        precede other Earth effect, such as increased earthquakes,
        tornadoes, hurricanes, and other strange weather patterns
        world-wide! All these actions were reported to you in paper,
        article and C. Notes (6-23-91 and 7-29-91 for example). To
        summarize briefly, I was convinced that these events were
        changing our climate, but I was reporting them to you mainly!
        But when I tried to report them to our nation (and thus the
        world), it was not heeded! However, the reports now speak for
        themselves; the global warming accelerated since about December
        1986! </p>
      <p><b>HAARP Testing</b> </p>
      <p>Another event which had the potential to alter our weather
        patterns were the HAARP tests (which were also started in that
        same time period of the last decade of the 20th century?) The
        use of large-area scalar-type fields (which the HAARP tests at
        low frequencies would really be) would also generate similar
        gravity wind effects and thus could also affect the Earth&#8217;s
        weather patterns (primarily by affecting the jet stream
        patters!). Moreover, those tests could be weather
        manipulations?? Whether of not HAARP was doing this, I could not
        determine. However, I strongly suspect that the scalar-type
        fields arriving here in the general vicinity of New York City
        area (now at about 74.2 Kc, a rhysmonic frequency) are being
        focused here by the HAARP program, since they are times to the
        work-week hours of Alaska! These signals may also be picked up
        by any AM radio (in this area) when they are being sent by
        HAARP. Their purpose here is unknown, but such testing (?) over
        a large population group (as in this area) might have
        questionable ends? Especially, when such transmittions also blot
        out some local radio stations! </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>1. Much more on these topics are covered directly (or
        indirectly) in my many releases to you. Some releases may bow be
        found on the Internet. I have not been actively monitoring the
        Universe in recent years mainly due to the lack of chart paper
        for my vintage chart recorder), and some other circumstances of
        change that have developed here. So I really don&#8217;t know what has
        been going on into the Universe in recent times. Perhaps, some
        other radically new events had occurred, but we will never know
        unless monitoring has been continuous! We need many new
        observers here. </p>
      <p>2. While the HAARP tests could certainly affect (control)
        weather patterns and thus climate, it may only be a secondary
        effect compared to the role played by our Universe itself,
        especially by our Galaxy Center with its effect on unstable
        nearby stars. Perhaps, the star Betelgeuse may have gone
        supernova with event of 12-6-86 ! </p>
      <p>3. The real problem here is that we may have some control over
        the greenhouse gases and also the HAARP experiments, but there
        is no way we control massive events in the Universe, such as
        nearby Novae and Supernovae, or the massive events which were
        detected at our Galaxy Center. </p>
      <p>4. Again, this material has been quickly handwritten and is not
        very well organized. It is for your interest and possible
        concerns. In any event, global warming (at this time) is for
        real!! Thus, the Earth residents must also be concerned. We
        tried here to offer some alternate explanations for the cause
        and you consideration. </p>
