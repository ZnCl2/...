      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        There are but three long-range rhysmonic "field" effects and
        these are more commonly known as the electrical, magnetic, and
        gravitational "forces" of physics. There are also two
        short-range aspects, known as the nuclear forces of physics, but
        these will not be considered here. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        relationship between these three aspects of the long-range
        rhysmonic forces can be depicted as shown in <b>Figure (1)</b>.
        There, electricity and magnetism are shown as forming the base
        of a triangle formed by these forces since these fields are
        fairly well understood and their vector field interactions (as
        electromagnetic effects) are also fairly well understood.
        However, rhysmonics shows that even here there are some aspects
        which are not well understood (or even recognized) by the
        conventional scientist. Gravitation is a more fundamental aspect
        (and thus shown as the apex of this triangle of forces), but it
        is also not well understood by conventional science. The scalar
        aspects of electric and magnetic fields is even less understood
        by the conventional scientist, while the scalar interaction of
        gravity with the scalar electric field and the scalar magnetic
        field is not even recognized by most conventional scientists.
        20th century science and technology was largely based on
        electromagnetism, but 21st century science will include
        electrogravitic and magnetogravitic interactions, and thus will
        create much new technology which may even surpass the present
        day electromagnetic technology. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        scalar fields (potentials) can add or subtract algebraically,
        even in the directed vector form, such as the earth&#8217;s gravity,
        provided the components lie in the same direction. For example,
        the earth&#8217;s static electric field and gravitational field are
        both directed toward the center of the earth. In a small region
        near the earth&#8217;s surface the fields may be considered parallel
        fields having a vertical orientation. Therefore, these fields
        can interact with locally created scalar fields and thus lead to
        new processes, energy sources, as well as levitation, or
        anti-gravity mechanisms. Simple experiments which illustrate
        these various interactions will now be briefly considered. </p>

      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scalar "flux" lines in rhysmonics are directed rhysmonic vectors
        and have a reality since they are dynamic effects in the
        rhysmonic structure which makes up this universe. They are
        similar to the "lines of force" imagined by Faraday and Maxwell,
        and are much the same as depicted in some conventional electric
        and magnetic theory, e.g., the electrostatic and magnetostatic
        flux lines. Therefore, the interaction of gravitational flux
        with local scalar flux as shown in <b>Figure (2)</b> is very
        similar to the interaction of electric and magnetic flux lines
        as shown in <b>Figure (3)</b>, since they are really the same
        entities. Thus g-fields, E-fields, and H-fields are but
        different aspects of rhysmonic flux fields. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        pure scalar field structure of the universe is not directly
        "observable" since that structure exists as a "perfectly
        balanced" structure, with the rhysmonic vectors "canceling" each
        other&#8217;s energies. However, the scalar flux gradients as shown in
        <b>Figure (2)</b> and <b>Figure (3)</b> are "observable" as
        scalar interaction with matter when observed with the proper
        instrumentation. For example, the scalar flux due to the earth&#8217;s
        g-field is simply observed as the presence of "weight" in a
        given mass, which is accelerated by this scalar flux field. The
        instrumentation required here is but a simple scale system.
        However, other interactions may be more subtle and thus require
        special instrumentation as will be briefly considered in this
        brief. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; To
        aid the reader in visualization, the flux gradients shown in <b>Figure

          (2)</b> and <b>Figure (3)</b> are depicted as flowing from
        (+) to (-). It would be interesting to ascertain if the earth&#8217;s
        g-field and E-field flux are really one and the same? </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        While there are many types of scalar signals developed in this
        universe (as well as man made), emphasis in this short note will
        be on only a few of these effects. These will now be illustrated
        with simple scalar field generation and detection methods. </p>

          Generation</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>Figure 4 ---
          Basic Generation of Scalar Fields</b> </p>

      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scalar fields have been shown to be just the electric, magnetic,
        and gravitational aspects of the basic rhysmonic structure of
        the universe. Thus their basic generation involves but these
        three aspects and all scalar field generating systems can be
        reduced to one of the basic methods shown in <b>Figure (4)</b>.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scalar E-fields are related in some way to the presence of
        charge as was shown in <b>Figure (3)</b>. A somewhat uniform
        scalar E-field can be generated by charging the plates of a
        simple parallel plate capacitor as shown in b. The intensity of
        this field can be made variable, either by varying the voltage
        across the plates, the spacing between the plates, or the
        permitivity of the dielectric material between the plates. In
        essence, the gradient of the potential is due to an excess of
        rhysmonic density at the (+) end of the gradient as compared to
        the (-) end of the gradient. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scalar H-fields (curl-free fields) are related to moving charges
        (mainly electrons) and may be generated by certain permanent
        magnet configurations, as well as certain current-carrying coil
        configurations. A simple way of generating scalar H-fields is
        with a solenoidal coil configuration as shown in <b>Figure (4b)</b>.
        The intensity of this flux is a function of the current and the
        number of turns in the coils, as well as the coil geometry. An
        interesting aspect here is that the flux remains constant if the
        driving voltage is kept constant, but the number of turns in the
        coil are increased. This results in an apparent paradox in that
        the input power needed to produce a certain flux decreases as
        the number of turns, i.e., the wire length increases. This is
        due to the little realized aspect that the flux generated is a
        function of the drift velocity of the electrons developing this
        flux. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scalar g-fields are due to the shielding action of masses in
        this universe as decribed in rhysmonic cosmology. The shielding
        action creates a net flux in the rhysmonic cosmology. The
        shielding action creates a net flux in the rhysmonic structure
        as depicted in <b>Figure (4c)</b>. This flux, of course, has
        been determined by Newton and found to be a function of the
        masses, the spacing between the masses, as well as the universal
        rhysmonic structure which is expressed by the gravitational
        constant, G. The net gravity flux or gradient is also variable
        with a net change in any of the parameters. </p>

          Detection</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">A. Premises </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Scalar field detection essentially involves the inverse of the
        generation process shown in <b>Figure (4)</b>. The polarization
        effects in a capacitor as shown in <b>Figure (4a)</b> is a very
        effective detector of scalar fields of all types, E-, H-, and
        g-fields, and is briefly discussed in a simple detection system
        below <b>(Figure 5)</b>. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        solenoidal H-field generator shown in <b>Figure (4b)</b> may
        also be used in detection in that an incoming scalar flux in tis
        coil may drive a small electron flow (current) in that coil.
        While interactions with flux between coils have been used ever
        since the days of Faraday, and especially by Tesla, the
        interaction of coils with the gravitational flux will be further
        considered briefly in the section on magnetogravitic effects. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        detection of gravitational flux, of course, has always been
        noted in scale systems of various types. Sensitive Hooke&#8217;s Law
        scale systems have been used as gravimeters for some time now.
        Here, as depicted in <b>Figure (4c)</b>, the action of a
        gravitational flux on a small mass, m<sub>1</sub>, due to the
        shielding action of a much larger mass, m<sub>2</sub>, which is
        usually the mass of the earth, may be determined if the small
        mass is supported by some restoring force (usually a spring). If
        the restoring spring is made of a compressible conductive foam
        material, variations in the resistance of the foam will follow
        the variations in "weight" of the test mass, m<sub>1</sub> ,
        which may be due to variations in the earth&#8217;s g-fields due top
        various effects. Such a detector is highly responsive to g-field
        variations since these affect the scalar fields at the nuclear
        level, but response is very poor or even non-existent for the
        scalar E- and H-fields. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; The
        capacitor element of <b>Figure (4a)</b> (or any other device
        which can develop polarization "currents" with scalar field
        interaction), may be used in the very simple detection system
        shown in <b>Figure (5)</b> below. The unit operates primarily
        as an electrogravitic device. Here, a scalar flux may "charge"
        the capacitor to some averaged dc value which may also have ac
        variations superimposed due to fluctuations in the scalar flux.
        Thus, this detector responds to all three variations in the
        scalar fields, but has been especially useful in simple
        gravitational signal astronomy systems. </p>

        weight. When the H-fields are in the same direction as the

        level1 lfo2; tab-stops:list .75in">(1) When a voltage is applied
        to a very long wire solenoid as shown in <b>Figure (12)</b>,
        only a small current flows due to the high resistance of this
        coil. (as per Ohms Law). However, the magnetic flux developed by
        such a coil can be very large due to the increased drift
        velocities of the electrons in the coil under such conditions.
        The magnetic field is a function of the drift velocity of the
        electrons as was mentioned in section III-A-3. When the voltage
        which sustains this drift velocity, and thus the magnetic stress
        in the vacuum, is suddenly cut of, the energy which was stored
        in the "magnetic stress" in the vacuum is returned to the
        circuit as a driving emf and will appear as a high voltage
        across the coil. In addition, some g-field energy (that was
        "displaced" from the solenoid by the initial "charging" of the
        magnetic stress field by the current flow in the solenoid) is
        also returned to the solenoid. Thus at least two times the
        initial energy supplied to the solenoid is returned: the
        original energy that was supplied, plus the energy which is
        essentially "extracted" from the gravitational field of the
        Earth! In actual tests, proper control of the experiment has
        shown that the energy "extracted" by this type of process can be
        many times the original expenditures! </p>
      <p>(2) Such interactions have been demonstrated by many classical
        physicists in the past. Faraday and others have demonstrated the
        effects of inductors having indications of such properties.
        Notable among the classical experimenters was Nikola Tesla, who
        was a pioneer in demonstrating such effects with his "magnifying
        transformer" and also in his Tesla coils. Some modern
        experimenters, including the writer, have also demonstrated many
        such type reactions. Highly publicized demonstrations have been
        made by Joe Newman due to his patent problems. However, while
        Newman&#8217;s demonstrations are valid, they are the result of the
        above effects and not any extraction of energy from mass as he
        claims, at least in the writer&#8217;s opinion.</p>

      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">This very simple
        experiment demonstrates the interaction of all three long range
        "forces" in this universe. These aspects have been noted by
        several classical period researchers in the past as well as some
        more recent experimenters, e.g., John Searl of England, but
        their efforts have been largely ignored. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>Premises</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(1) The rim of the
        plastic element is charged negatively, either by induction or
        just the spinning action itself. The test assembly is mounted
        atop a sensitive, non-magnetic Hooke&#8217;s Law type of scale. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(2) With a clockwise
        (CW) rotation of the plastic element, the electrons on the rim
        are carried around by the rim at high velocities and thus are,
        in effect, a strong electrical circuiting current which thus
        creates a very intense magnetic field (H-field) in the central
        region of the disc. The H-field flux is directed <u>down</u>,
        in the same direction as the g-fields and thus are "attracted"
        by the g-fields. Therefore, the rotating element&#8217;s weight is
        apparently reduced. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(3) With
        counterclockwise (CCW) rotation, the rim "current" is reversed
        and thus the direction of the H-fields in the center region are
        now <u>up</u> and thus they oppose the g-fields. Therefore, the
        element&#8217;s "weight" is now apparently increased. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(4)&nbsp;&nbsp; Such
        aspects have been noted by many earlier researchers, especially
        in experiments with electrostatic field generating devices. The
        more recent applications by researchers such as John Searl have
        resulted in levitation and high energy "extraction", and thus
        have been used to possibly explain "flying saucers" in a way.
        However, these experiments and the explanations were never
        received kindly by conventional science and thus have been
        largely ignored and even suppressed! The writer believes that
        many of these experiments are valid and will eventually lead to
        new transportation methods. Efforts in these aspects are
        increasing all the time. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>VIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Gravitational Signal Astronomy</b> </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">These aspects have
        been released by the writer in a number of brief articles, some
        of which have been published, and many others not yet published.
        Gravitational signal astronomy has been most productive and some
        possibly profound effects have been noted, not only affecting
        our knowledge of the universe, but even the quality of our life
        here on Earth. Some brief notes on this technique are now
        presented here: </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(1) Gravitational
        "fluctuations" in the universe are best detected as modulations
        in the signal output of a GW detector of the type shown in <b>Figure
          (5)</b>. The scalar gravity signals interact with the Earth&#8217;s
        g-fields (or E-fields) which are directed toward the center of
        the earth. Thus the variations which are located on the
        observer&#8217;s <u>meridian</u>, and especially in his zenith, are
        best detected. It can be shown that the earth&#8217;s rotation
        effectively cancels response from the other directions. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(2) The beam "width"
        of the detector is essentially equal to the area of the active
        portion of the detector element, and thus may be only in the
        order of a square inch, typically. Thus the resolution of the
        detector is extreme, much finer than most other detection
        systems, be it scalar or electromagnetic in nature. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Detection from directions other than the meridian also are
        possible. Two examples are given here: </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(a) When large
        masses line up with the observer&#8217;s position, e.g., as in a solar
        eclipse, the gravitational "shadows" will also fall on the
        observer&#8217;s position. </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">(b) "Stacked Array"
        GW detection systems could enhance detection in a particular
        direction. Such arrays may also enhance the detection of objects
        located on the observer&#8217;s meridian but off the zenith. These
        arrays could be terms "Gravity Signal Telescopes". </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>IX. Conclusions</b>
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">The notes contained
        in this Brief were directed primarily at those colleagues of the
        writer who have shown interest in the rhysmonic cosmology
        methodology. The simplicity of the experiments should enable the
        interested experimenter or researcher to easily verify these
        various aspects. The researcher may come up with other simple
        tests, while the writer will disclose many others later on.
        Meanwhile, good luck with your experimentations! </p>
