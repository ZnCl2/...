<p><b>A. Recent GW Signal Scans:</b>
<p>The recent spate of bad weather in the USA and elsewhere is quite unexplained
in conventional science. In the past we had associated some ‘strange’ weather
with unusual GW signal responses. We decided to look into this since we
noted:
<p>1. A noticeable increase in the l/f background noise on the various
GW detector units in recent months. This was also accompanied by some unusual
variations in the averaged earth g-fields.
<p>2. It was also noticed that the unusual weather patterns and the earthquake
in Japan appeared to be centered around the 40<sup>o</sup> to 42<sup>o</sup>
N. Latitudes. This is also the general area of the Cygnus region of the
sky --- a known very active region optically and gravitationally!
<p><b>B. Initial ‘Look’:</b>
<p>We began our ‘look’ by running a continuous 5-day 2-D scan of our meridian
with Circuit #75 coupled to a Rustrak recorder. The purpose of this test
was to see if we could ‘see’ any obvious repeating ‘structures’ in this
scan period. Since each scan covers a slightly different region of the
universe each day, only very strongly repeating structures were liable
to repeat. Such a repeating structure seemed to occur at about RA of 19
hours and 20 minutes, and since it was always in the center of our scan
sector, the probability was that it was in our zenith, i.e., in the Cygnus
region! With the 2-second sampling rate of the Rustrak recorder, it is
at best crude, but a definite structure appeared at this location on each
approximately midnight scan, where this region was in our zenith! It is
hard to see this structure, but when the chart is held at the correct distance
it can stand out as a dark center with a white ring around it. It presently
appears to possibly be two black holes (?) in orbit around each other,
as the scans seem to change relative positions each day. Two scans from
this test are shown in <b><a href="#cnote8a">Figure (1)</a></b>.
<p>This same region was also ‘fast’ scanned with the Esterline-Angus recorder
unit, using the same experimental setup. This is also shown in <b><a href="#cnote8a">Figure
(1)</a></b>. Here it also appears to be possibly two black holes in close
orbit. We have termed this structure Cygnus ‘H’ and will follow it further
as time permits.
<p><b>C. Retest of the Galaxy Center:</b>
<p>The last ‘look’ we made of the Galaxy Center using the ‘fast’ scan was
better than a year ago. At that time, the GC ‘hole’ had apparently ‘evaporated’
and only showed a very faint trace of its once magnificent ‘depth’. Shown
in <b><a href="#cnote8c">Figure (2)</a></b> is the most recent scan of
this region. It seems to show that mass is recollecting there but it is
far from being a black hole yet. We will resacn again in about 6 months.
<p><b>D. Retest of Geminga:</b>
<p>There has been some reference to a soft gamma pulsar in Gemini. We had
observed a black hole structure in this region for the past several years.
However, our structure appeared at an RA of around 7 hours and 20 minutes,
and the recent scan of this area shows our to be alive and well!
<p><b>E. Conclusions:</b>
<p>The preliminary tests given here appear to show that GW signal astronomy
techniques are alive and well also, and it is sad that they are not being
more aggressively used --- we could learn more about our universe, and
also, note that these signals are now, in real time, and are affecting
our Earth as well as the universe in ways which are not explainable in
conventional science. If these effects are responsible for our Midwest
floods, there is little we can do about it, but at least we may know why!!!

<p><b>(a)</b> Note: This scan was made under the same conditions as that
shown in Figure (2) Note of 7-19-1993. The dense mass now collecting at
the Galaxy Center again still does not appear to qualify as a 'black hole'
yet. The pen of the recorder was drying out -- an attempt to refill it
resulted in the 'blotting' seen above. Also note the corrected time in
this scan; the time on 7-19-1993 was corrected for EST in the wrong direction!

<p><b>(b)</b> Note: This scan confirms that the structure of Cygnus 'H'
may be a double 'black hole' structure which is rotating fairly rapidly
(possibly only several days for a complete orbit). This will show up with
the variation in the peaks of the structure. Note the interesting multi-supernovae
at X. This also appears to occur often!
<p><b>Figure (2): Recent Re-scans ~</b><b></b>
<p><b>(a)</b> Fast 'scan' of the Galaxy Center (GC) as seen under Earth
on the morning of 7-19-1993. The GC seems to be recollecting mass but does
not seem to be a 'black hole' yet. As usual, many supernovae (SN) are 'caught'
in this region.

<p><b>(b)</b> Fast 'scan' of the original 'Geminga' in Gemini. This 'black
hole' has been 'seen'with no apparent change for at least the past 5 years.
When time permits, we will see if we can spot the 'hole' which may be responsible
for the soft gamma ray 'pulsar' reported in Gemini!
