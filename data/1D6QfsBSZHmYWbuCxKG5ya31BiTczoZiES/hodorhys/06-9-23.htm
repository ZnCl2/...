        <p><b>( 9-23-2006 )</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>A. Background</b> </p>
      <p>The history of science is replete with serendipitous
        observations, some of which were heeded, but many were not! An
        example of a heeded observation was that of Oersted in the
        action of a current in a wire on a nearby compass needle. This
        was followed by many other researchers, mainly by Faraday in his
        experimental researches. Theoretical credence was given to
        Faradays work by Maxwell. Tesla applied the basic principles to
        practical use, mainly in motors and generators. Thus a simple
        observation had led to the development of an electromagnetic
        theory which has since been applied in other ways and created
        many new industries! </p>
      <p><b>B. Some Rhysmonic Serendipities.</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Gravitational &#8216;Wave&#8217; Detectors</b> </p>
      <p>The initial GW experiment was made to possibly observe local
        inertial effects on a capacitor which drove a very high gain IC
        amplifier circuit. A series of tests indicated the feasibility
        of such testing. Many tests were made with an audio amplifier as
        well as a meter in the output. However, when using a shielded
        large 10 uF in one test, perturbations were duly noted, but also
        strange pulsed ringing effects&#8217; continued even though the
        perturbations were halted! I was awed by these low frequency
        (quite melodious) rings and it almost felt like the universe was
        responding to my testing! Further tests proved that these
        &#8216;signals&#8217; were external to my environment and they were not
        shieldable! This led to the development of many other circuits
        which later proved the signals to be but longitudinal &#8216;scalar
        type waves&#8217; being developed by the universe itself, truly a
        serendipitous discovery! </p>
      <p><b>2. 2-D Type GW Signals</b> </p>
      <p>Bill Ramsay, a colleague and avid experimenter, built one of my
        early GW detector units and coupled it to a Rustrak chart
        recorder, to see how the signals would record. Fortunately, the
        Rustrak recorder uses a D&#8217;Arsonval meter unit where the freely
        moving coil and pointer are used to plot data points on the
        chart at a slow scan and coupling rate. Bill had expected to see
        a random scatter plot due to these signals but was surprised to
        also see &#8216;embedded figures in the scatter plots! I repeated his
        test and confirmed the embedded figures as being very similar to
        photos of dense astronomical bodies obtained by optical means!
        This, this appeared to be two-dimensional (2-D) views of a
        narrow segment of our Universe (on the meridian) as scanned by
        our rotating Earth! This was eventually confirmed in many
        controlled observations. Thus 2-D Gravitational Astronomy was
        &#8216;born as a result of Bills curiosity, i.e., serendipitously! </p>
      <p><b>3. Sub-Audio GW Signals</b> </p>
      <p>With the response in (2) above showing useful GW information
        retrieval, Bill decided to couple a function generator to the
        Rustrak recorder unit to see what&nbsp; (if anything) the chart
        recorder would produce. I may be wrong but I believe Bill may
        have arbitrarily decided to start with a frequency of 0.05 Hz
        and the triangular wave function. It may have been fortunate to
        do so for (1) the 0.05 Hz frequency could possibly be stabilized
        by any line voltage leakage present, and (b), the triangular
        wave would be synchronized to the clock rate of the motor
        driving the chart. The unit&#8217;s tuning capacitor could possibly
        act as the GW detector in this case? </p>
      <p>Bill initially saw the random scatter plot he expected to se,
        but then decided to let the test run longer (overnight). To his
        surprise, the Rustrak unit developed beautiful Lissajous-type
        patterns at random times overnight! Further tests by Bill (and
        others) led to the conclusion that what was being detected was
        the very slow GW-type interactions between the various
        components of our Solar System! Serendipity again! </p>
      <p><b>C. Tesla&#8217;s Magnifying Transmitter</b> </p>
      <p>It was recently reported that Tesla may have arrived at his
        magnifier coil system also serendipitously! (Ref. 1). It seems
        that Tesla, in running one of his many tests, may have placed
        another similar coil system in the area (for some other
        reason?). Tesla may have also been surprised to see great
        activity in the so-called extra coil! Much of his later tests
        would use the extra coil to develop much higher output levels,
        thus the name magnifier coil! It is interesting to note here
        that Tesla operated at 50 Kc, 100 Kc, 130 Kc, and 150 Kc, all
        Rhysmonic resonant frequencies! (Ref. 2). I know that there are
        many explanations for the extra coil performance by more
        knowledgeable researchers in this area. However, I have strong
        conviction that Rhysmonics will provide another plausible reason
        for the increased performance of the extra coil. I will pursue
        that when I have more time available. </p>
      <p><b>Conclusions</b> </p>
      <p>(1) Any abnormal observations (not explained by any present
        theory) should never be dismissed or ignored! </p>
      <p>(2) Such dismissal or ignoring by establishment researchers
        will only delay but not hinder the final development of new
        concepts or mechanisms useful to mankind! </p>
      <p>(3) Especially in this time of global warming and conflicts
        over current energy sources (e.g., oil), open minds are needed
        to solve the energy problem. Present day energy sources are a
        source of pollution (thus global warming?) as well as a waste of
        valuable resources. We need a source of energy which relates to
        nature and thus is renewable i.e., inexhaustible). Such sources
        will be developed (found) only if open minds prevail! I believe
        Rhysmonic approaches will be quite useful here. I will have even
        more on this in the future. </p>
