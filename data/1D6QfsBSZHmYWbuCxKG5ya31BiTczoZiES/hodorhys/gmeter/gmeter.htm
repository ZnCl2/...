<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Astrophysicists have been attempting
to detect the elusive quadrupole-type gravity signals produced by Einstein
without unequivocal success thus far. However, Newtonian-type gravitational
force field gradients have actually been detected for many years now as
noise in electronic devices. The simple electronic-type of gravimeter described
here greatly amplifies electronic noise and resolves it into meaningful
displays on an analog meter or a strip chart recorder unit. The inquisitive
and interested electronic experimenter can thus enter at low cost into
an exciting exploration of our universe in terms of these gravity signals,
especially if a strip chart recorder unit or a computer is used to store
and display the tremendous amount of information present in these data.
The author hope that many will opt to do so.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Gravimeters (or gravity meters)
are used to measure the relative strength of a gravitational field at some
particular location for a number of reasons. One very common reason is
to determine the possible presence of large underground mass anomalies
which, in turn, could signify the presence of potential mineral, oil, or
gas deposits. The commercial gravimeters used in many of these evaluations
are generally both very expensive and also very delicate apparatuses. However,
the electronic experimenter may construct a very simple low-cost electronic-type
gravimeter (patent pending) which is highly portable, rugged, and yet extremely
sensitive to even minor variations in the earth’s gravitational field.
Therefore, it will not only indicate variations in gravity which are due
to cosmic-generated gradients and even the presence of astronomically-distant
very dense masses which may happen to lie on the instantaneous astronomical
meridian position of the gravimeter. The meridian position as defined here
is essentially the same as the geographical longitude of the location of
the gravimeter unit.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Newtonian gravitational force field
gradients, i.e., scalar field type gradients, have been noted by the author
for many years now (Ref. 1). Simple detectors of the electronic type (Ref.
2) and the spring scale type (Ref. 3) have been used in these detections.
The electronic version to be considered here is extremely simple requiring
but a few readily available electronic components which may be easily assembled
by the average electronic experimenter or amateur scientists. It should
be of special interest to amateur astronomers in either optical or radio
astronomy as well as to many professional astrophysicists.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">How It Works</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The circuit for these particular
demonstration units is given in <b><a href="#fig1">Figure (1)</a></b>.
One version uses a single low-cost Cmos type operational amplifier device
(a dual section unit) which can work well with but a low level 1.5 volt
battery supply. The low current drain of the op-amps should enable long
life from the small alkaline AAA cells used to internally power this unit.
The second version is similar in design but uses the more generally available
low cost bipolar-type of operational amplifier devices. The operation of
the Cmos unit will be described in detail here. However, the bipolar unit,
while quite similar, requires some component value changes as well as a
higher power supply voltage. These changes are noted in the <b><a href="#parts">Parts
Lists</a></b> for these units.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the Cmos version, Newtonian gravitational
force field gradients interact with the electron-ion structure of the dielectric
in the 1000 uF input capacitor, C<sub>1</sub>, to generate small current
fluctuations from that capacitor and these fluctuations will reflect the
gravity gradients being intercepted by that capacitor. Section IC<sub>1</sub>
of the op-amp is operated in the current-to-voltage conversion mode and
the small input current fluctuations from capacitor C<sub>1</sub> are converted
to much higher voltage fluctuations. The sensitivity of this stage is controllable
by the high resistance feedback resistor R<sub>1</sub>. Output from the
detector section IC<sub>1</sub>, is then coupled out through a gain control
potentiometer, R<sub>2</sub>, to drive a conventional inverting amplifier,
IC<sub>2</sub>, which has about a 20x voltage gain. An offset control,
R<sub>6</sub>, in the non-inverting input of IC<sub>2</sub> is used to
establish the operating position of the averaged gravity-induced output
levels on the analog display meter, M<sub>1</sub>. The display meter is
a 100 uA meter operated as a 0-1 volt voltmeter in conjunction with the
series resistor, R<sub>5</sub>. Capacitors C<sub>3</sub> and C<sub>4</sub>
form part of a low-pass filter network (utilizing R<sub>5</sub> also) to
establish a time constant for integration of the meter response to the
gravity fluctuation signals. A very long time constant, i.e., a very low
cut-off frequency for the LP filter, is used to largely measure the averaged
gravity levels, while the shorter time constants are used to monitor the
more rapidly varying responses of the more distant astronomical events.
The switch SW<sub>2</sub> provides for three levels of integration. A DPST
switch, SW<sub>1</sub>, is used to interrupt the common return leads of
the dual power supply used <u>separately</u> while in the off position.
This is necessary to avoid the small battery drain that would occur of
a SPST switch were used here. The output jack, J1, provides for an output
to any external device such as an external meter, an audio amplifier. A
strip chart recorder, or a computer, if desired. To avoid possible RFI
problems, the unit should be fabricated in a Faraday type shielded enclosure.
A simple aluminum box enclosure containing the entire circuitry, including
the battery supply, should be adequate for most observing locations.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Testing the Unit</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After the electronic experimenter
has checked out his circuit components and the circuit wiring, the 1.5
volt batteries may be inserted into their holders. Keep the power switch,
SW<sub>1</sub>, <u>off</u> at this time. Turn the sensitivity (feedback)
control, R<sub>1</sub>, to its mid-position, the gain control, R<sub>2</sub>,
to its minimum position, the offset control, R<sub>6</sub>, to its mid-position,
and the integration switch, SW<sub>2</sub>, to the off position. Now turn
on the power switch and if the unit is operating properly a meter deflection
near center scale should be noted. Center the pointer with the offset control,
R<sub>6</sub>. The offset control is very sensitive and should be adjusted
carefully. Now slowly increase the gain control about one-quarter turn.
If no indications are seen on the display meter, or if the meter goes off
scale, the input capacitor may have an excessive residual charge on it.
This charge should leak off in a minute or so but may be discharged more
rapidly by turning down the sensitivity control down to its shorted position
momentarily, and then returning it to the mid-position again. Since the
integration switch, SW<sub>2</sub>, had been set to its fastest response
time, rapid fluctuations should now be seen on the analog meter output,
that is if good components were used and the circuit wiring was correct.
The fluctuations may now be better centered on the display meter with the
offset control and their amplitudes adjusted to suitable levels with the
gain control. Do not increase the gain to the point of overdrive or to
the point where there will be a tendency to low frequency "oscillations"
which will be sustained by occasional high level fluctuations from the
cosmos. Notice the varied and wide amplitude ranges of the display!</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the integration switch in its
off position, the unit largely responds to the rapid fluctuations due to
distant cosmic events. With the switch in the Lo position, it will respond
mainly to closer cosmic events and this position may also be used to determine
the averaged gravity field levels, especially if even a longer integration
time is used, e.g., the output shunt capacitance is increased more. When
the integration switch is in the Hi position, the unit will respond to
many interesting events in our own galaxy region as well as the Local Group
of galaxies. The reason for this type of response is that the resolution
of the detector "beam" is extremely fine, since the aperture for this detection
system is essentially the active area of the capacitor, C1, and that may
be only in the order of &frac14; to &frac12; inch in diameter. Thus this
fine beam sweeps the meridian position of the detector as a function of
the rotation of the earth. Simple geometry shows that such a fine beam
would sweep across some distant objects more rapidly than it would do so
for some <u>similar</u> but much nearer object. Thus the difference in
response times.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Typical Responses</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since these fluctuations are a function
of time, they are best displayed on a strip recorder unit running at about
a chart speed in the order of 2 to 4 inches per minute. A high input impedance
strip chart recorder unit must be used with the Cmos device detector unit,
but a low impedance strip chart recorder unit could be used with the bipolar
detector unit, e.g., a D’Arsonval meter type unit. In both cases, the output
voltage could range between 0 volts and about 1.5 volts. Some typical responses
as seen on a strip chart recorder are shown in <b><a href="#fig2">Figure
(2)</a></b>. Experimenters who lack a strip recorder or a computer may
try to follow some of the slower responses by hand recording the output
data being received when the unit is operated with very long integration
times. Even here, the experimenter can expect to observe" some local cosmic
events of the type shown in Figure (2). However, recording the data by
hand can be quite tedious and very difficult at best.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Briefly stated, some of the cosmic
events detectable with these units are cosmic events which were predicted
by the astrophysicists but not yet detected by them, primarily because
most of these astrophysicists are still looking for the elusive quadrupole-type
gravity signals which were predicted by Einstein. However, these units
detect the <u>longitudinal</u> gravitational force field gradients of the
Newtonian-type (which were not supposed to exist, <u>incorrectly so</u>,
in terms of the presently prevailing relativity theories!). Therefore,
the interested electronic experimenters, amateur scientists, as well as
the professional researchers, now have a golden opportunity to enter into
a low-cost exploration of our universe using the proven techniques briefly
disclosed here.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many of the active astronomical
events detectable with these units appear to be novae and supernovae. Novae
are believed to be stars which lose much of their outer layers in a nuclear-type
explosion. These events are detectable (and quite often) since the rapid
expansion of the star’s outer mass causes a Newtonian force field gradient,
which, of it happens to lie on the detector’s meridian position, causes
a superposition of fields on the earth’s gravity field, and thus results
in a measurable change in the earth’s gravity field. Supernovae are believed
to be large stars which "implode" to a neutron star or black hole type
of structure, and then "blasts" off much of their volume and atmosphere.
The response as detected by these units shows both the implosion <u>and</u>
the explosion of the event. After a massive supernova event, the neutron
star or black hole type of structure, i.e., a very small, very dense mass,
is generally seen at that location, often accompanied by what the astrophysicists
have termed an accretion ring. The units also detect what appear to be
very dense masses but without an accretion ring. These may be very old
black holes which have since lost their accretion rings.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Bipolar Detection Unit</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The bipolar device detection unit
is very similar to the C-mos device unit described above, but requires
some component value changes as well as the power supply change as shown
in the <b>Parts Lists </b>[below]. These changes were made in order to
essentially duplicate the responses as seen with the Cmos device unit.
The bipolar device unit works well with an internal 9-volt battery supply.
Most experimenters may prefer to use the bipolar device op-amps since they
are more generally available. The author uses the bipolar device design
to drive his D’Arsonval meter type strip chart recorder unit.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The experimenter is cautioned here
that while the basic design of these detectors is very simple, components
and devices do vary. The experimenter may wish to try several electrolytic
capacitors or op-amp devices if difficulty is seen in achieving the effect
given here. Especially the bipolar op-amp devices, even if they are labeled
the same, may be quite different in structure and performance; one might
even have different pin-outs. The author has constructed many detector
units (and many colleagues have also done so) so that he has confidence
that the careful and patient researcher, amateur and professional, will
be able to duplicate these results.</font></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions</font></b></div>

<div class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The simple low-cost electronic type
gravity meters described here should enable the electronic experimenter
not only to determine the averaged gravity forces at various locations,
but also enter into the fascinating and quite unexplored area of gravitational
field astronomy. Outside of possibly obtaining a strip chart recorder as
a highly desirable component for use in these studies, the experimenter
is not otherwise limited by extensive or expensive facilities or preferred
locations in pursuing these objectives. Many experimenters, mainly amateur
radio operators (hams) have entered the area of radio astronomy successfully.
However, compared to the above disclosed gravity field astronomy, radio
astronomy is rather expensive, tricky, and involves fairly massive antennas
as well as requiring fairly radio-quiet, i.e., EMI free locations. Gravity
signal astronomy can be done at any location, even electrically noisy locations,
provided the units are adequately Faraday shielded. Simple aluminum box
enclosures are adequate for most locations. The author does his "observing"
in a corner of his basement lab area. The author hopes that many experimenters,
both amateur and professional, will opt to enter into these investigations.
Good luck with your experiments!</font></div>
