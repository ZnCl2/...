<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">G-Factor Gravimeter Circuit #600-A
was fabricated in an aluminum box 2" x 3" x 5" in size. All operating controls
were brought out on the top face, including an output jack and a large
(2.75" wide) calibrated meter to give a display of the output voltage.
A dual 9-volt battery supply is self-contained in the unit. The unit was
primarily designed as a g-field gravimeter, to give the long-term highly
averaged value of the earth’s g-field, although a somewhat faster response
time is also provided for.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Circuit:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The circuit used in this unit is
a bipolar device version of the gravimeter described in the article "Simple
Gravimeter Meters Display Interesting Gravity Effects". It uses the readily
available 1458 operational amplifier (op-amp) device in a typical gravimeter
circuit, but where the operating parameters were adjusted for this particular
mode of operation. A wide range of sensitivity and gain control were provided
for, as well as two levels of output integration. The output meter is used
to give a relative indication of the g-field levels (on a 1 mA meter movement
having a full scale reading of 5 volts). The gain and off-set controls
are nominally set to above their mid-positions so as to keep the output
voltage on scale. Normally, the filter is kept in the Low position for
a highly integrated output as a g-factor meter, but may be switched to
the High position to enable the observation of gravity ‘impulses and ‘shadows’
which are mainly due to events in our own Milky Way Galaxy system.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation of this unit is simple:
Set the gain and off-set controls to slightly above their mid-positions;
set the filter to <u>H</u>igh and the sensitivity control to about its
mid-position. Now turn on the power supply and allow the unit a minute
or two to stabilize. Some slow fluctuations in the output voltage should
now be noted. Slowly adjust the gain and off-set controls upwards, so that
the nominal output voltage is near the 0.6 reading on the meter scale (i.e.,
3 volts). The unit is now responding to the Milky Way Galaxy fluctuations
(to a large measure).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now turn the filter switch to its
<u>L</u>ow
position. This will introduce a very long time constant in the output,
due to the 0.1 farad capacitor now switched in. The unit is now a sensitive
g-factor type of gravimeter, where a scale reading of say 0.6, can now
be related to a g-factor of 32 ft/sec<sup>2</sup> (or 980 cm/sec<sup>2</sup>
). The daily (diurnal) variations in the earth’s g-field can be noted in
this mode of operation and the relative (per cent) change can be determined
from these readings. However, note that the unit will read an increase
in the g-factor as a down scale reading on the meter.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusions:</font></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unit #600-A is primarily a sensitive
gravimeter as used by the oil and mineral prospectors. However, it is also
very useful to follow the subtle daily variations in the earth’s g-field
which are due to massive effects in this universe and note the possible
severe variations which cold possibly affect out jet stream patterns and
thus our earth weather patterns! It is believed that such variations were
responsible for much of the anomalous weather conditions seen since about
December 1986!</font>

<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Notes:</b> (1) Circuit is bipolar
version of Circuit in Figure (1) of the article "Simple Electronic Gravity
meters Display Interesting Gravity Effects"; (2) To avoid going into the
negative mode of operation, place a 10K resistor in the ground leg of the
gain control; (3) Built-in meter range: 0-5 volts; (4) Filter range: High
in Galaxy; Low for g-factor; (5) Increase in g-factor reads down-scale!</font>
