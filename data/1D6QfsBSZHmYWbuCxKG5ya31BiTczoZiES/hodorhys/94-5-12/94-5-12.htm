<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">A two-dimensional scan (2D)
of the zenith-nadir area was made during the time of the 5-10-94 solar
eclipse of the sun by the moon. Circuit # 300B was used with 21 Hz LP filtering
and a 4-diode offset to drive the Rustrak 288 chart recorder. The output
level was kept low to limit the scan width to about 1/4 inch only. The
scan period was unattended and shut off when I returned home about 3:30
PM EDT. The results are given below, the actual scan and an enlarged portrayal
of what could be seen in the scan, since it is difficult to reproduce by
a copier the details in the original.

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">It appears that this scan
did pick up a 2-dimensional view of the eclipse as it passed through our
meridian here. The sun transited our meridian here about 11:54:24 EST,
corrected for the equation of time and the 8.3 minutes if EM transit time.
This was roughly in agreement with the actual scan times seen above. The
sun’s "shadow" is more circular and smaller than the moon’s here since
the moon was moving more rapidly than the sun. This also resulted in a
more elongated response for the moon’s shadow. Since both the sun and moon
were in our zenith area, there was a reduction in gravity here, resulting
in the "darker" response for the sun and moon compared to the general background
response. The reason for a "white ring" around this dark spot is unknown
at present. Several other responses were noted here. The response shown
at B appears to also be possibly in our solar system and perhaps another
planet, but I do not have any knowledge of a planet being in this area
at present. The collections are often seen in these scans and are in repeatable
areas. The interesting response seen at A also appears to be extragalactic,
under earth, and in the general area of the constellation Virgo. It is
pretty much on the meridian of the large galaxy M-87 as seen <u>today</u>
but this response is <u>now</u> and not the many eons ago as seen in the
EM responses! This structure has been "seen" here before and some similar
type responses were seen in the past in other areas.

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in"><b>Conclusions</b>

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">1. Gravitational 2-D detection
techniques appear to have detected the solar eclipse of May 10, 1994 as
it crossed the meridian here.

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">2. While the sensitivity
of the detector may have been set too low, the response indicated some
other structures which were also noted in the past.

<p style="margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in">3. It appears that this technique
is a viable new window to the structure of our universe. It is a shame
that there is still very limited activity in these efforts.
