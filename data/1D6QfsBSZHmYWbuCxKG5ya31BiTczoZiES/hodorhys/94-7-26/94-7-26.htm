<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>A.&nbsp; Test Conditions:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">See Figure; Detection Circuit #15-D
was used here with it driving a Radio Shack mini-amplifier coupled tp a
Radio Shack 3" cube speaker. The pendulum was an 8 oz plumb bob on a 1-1/2'
string length.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>B. Test Results:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the pendulum bob x swings in
the B direction (toward detector), the 0.25 cm 'picket fence' modulation
is slightly <u>higher</u> pitched than when the pendulum bob swings in
the A direction (away from the detector).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>C. Speculations:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) This result could be explained
if the movement of mass (the bob) creates a gravity impulse, or 'wind',
toward the fixed detector and thus <u>compresses</u> some of the aether
matrix strcuture along this line, i.e., 'tightens it', and thus the 0.25
cm universal wavelength is <u>reduced</u>, i.e., the detected frequency
is <u>increased</u>.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) When the bob moves away from
the fixed detector, a rarefaction may take place in the aether in this
line, such that the 0.25 cm wavelength may be <u>increased</u>, i.e., the
detected frequency is <u>lowered</u>!</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) If a relatively moving system
can do this with gravity impulses, it is surmised that a relatively moving
system could do the same with EM waves. Thus the velocity of EM waves from
a moving system might depend upon whether the <u>source</u> of the waves
is moving toward or away rom the fixed detector.</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) In terms of a <u>fixed</u> source
and detector system, the net result might also be determined by the gravitational
'wind' <u>direction</u> between the source and the detector. For example,
with a possible gravitational 'wind' generated by the <u>rotating</u> earth,
there might by possibly a difference in one way light travel time betwen
a source located <u>east</u> of a detector and a source located
<u>west</u>
of the detector, even if the physical spacings are equal!</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>D. Conclusions:</b></font><font face="Times New Roman,Times"></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The speculations given here may or
may not be the correct interpretations, but the experimental facts of this
test are
<u>real</u> -- There is a noticeable change in 'pitch' noted in
this test which has been observed by <u>many</u> (as well as recorded on
tape). The writer has used such 'disturbances' in the aether in long-range
communication tests, in the order of 5-10 miles!</font>
