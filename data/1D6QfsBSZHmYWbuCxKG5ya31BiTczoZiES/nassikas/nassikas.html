      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The author offers for discussion an explanation for the excess
      energy in cold fusion, an explanation which incorporates the
      concept of negative time. The mathematical basis relies on the
      work of Dr. N. Kozyrev (Russia), Dr. Nassikas (Greece), and Thomas
      Bearden (USA).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      "The Hypothesis and The Equations of The Unified Matter Field" by
      Dr. A. A. Nassikas [1], is a rare instance of scientific and
      mathematical publication devoted to fundamental questions that
      leads to a practical approach to space-time engineering. In some
      sense it is a new solution for the development of free energy and
      gravitation technologies. Dr. H. E. Puthoff provided an overview
      of the topic based on the Casimir-effect [2]. This was quite
      interesting, but the author's conclusion was "only in principle,
      yes," but the engineering (practical applications) is "a long way
      off." Also that the "warp drive" idea in the papers (1994-1997) of
      Dr. Miguel Alcubierre, Max-Planck-Institute for
      Gravitationsphysik, Albert-Einstein-Institute, Germany, is a fine
      idea, but it does not provide any technological solution. The only
      author who proposed practical approaches to vacuum engineering is
      Thomas E. Bearden. Let's see what analogies there may be between
      Nassikas' work and the "Gravitobiology" by T. E. Bearden to
      indicate the shortest practical way toward the technologies of the
      future.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The Engine of Space-Time</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The vacuum or 'space-time medium" of T. E. Bearden is described as
      cells of so called "gravitons." Those are "the coupled
      photon/anti-photon pair." Note, that it is a paired process. To
      make it more clean physically, we have to introduce the negative
      time axis for the "anti-photon-" So, the notion for the "virtual
      particles" that is used in many papers as the unlimited sea of
      free energy can be physically introduced only with the notion of
      "negative time," and we must take into account the "surface of
      time" or the "area of possible time directions." In this chronal
      area, the pair of photon/anti-photon seems to be a balanced
      situation of two processes that don't require any energy input,
      but it is a situation that produces both photon and anti-photon
      forms of energy. In other words, it is the "energy creation
      mechanics" itself. The law of energy conservation seems to be the
      law for a "direct time" and "reversed time" balanced situation
      only. Certainly in our reality it is possible to detect by means
      of some measurements only half of the process, i.e. the positive
      time process of the photon energy.<br>
      <br>
      According to the hypothesis of Dr. A. A, Nassikas, there is no
      space-time without energy since "The existence or the
      non-existence of energy implies the existence or the non-existence
      of space-time, and consequently of any geometry." On this point
      his concept is closely connected with Bearden's "vacuum engine."
      Next point: by Nassikas, the energy of positive or negative
      electrical charge of the particle, i.e.. its potential field
      energy can be presented as "equivalent to its internal time." So,
      the sign of the charge can be defined by the "time axis direction"
      and the process of the electron is some opposition to the process
      of the positron. Bearden's photon/anti-photon pair is a similarly
      balanced situation. Note, the mass particle here is considered as
      some dynamical process [3], that is corresponding to some
      four-dimensional resonance condition, demonstrated in calculations
      for the DNA-molecule and for other natural material elements.<br>
      <br>
      A practical solution was proposed by Thomas Bearden to create "the
      local rate of flow of time" that is "determined by the "local
      time-stress of vacuum potential" is to apply some non-linear
      materials for translation of energy between different frequencies
      and harmonics of electromagnetic waves. Normally, i.e. in the
      ordinary time-flow situation, the non-linear material produce the
      harmonics from a fundamental wave. But Bearden says that "in a
      true time-reversed situation, non-linear materials can exhibit the
      production of a stronger fundamental from a combination of the
      fundamental and its harmonics." The principle that is designated
      by Bearden as "Stokes' principle of time reversibility"
      (G.G.Stokes (Camb. DubI, Math. J. 4. 1849, p.l) is&nbsp;
      interesting, but we have to discuss something beyond this
      that&nbsp; is connected with the potential form of energy, i.e.
      with Bearden's "stress of vacuum."<br>
      <br>
      Dr. A. A. Nassikas and Dr. Miguel Alcubierre independently
      proposed to use the difference in local rate of the time flow as
      the source for a propulsion force. According to Nassikas, if "the
      space under the object attracts the object" more or less than the
      upper one in strength of the different relative times around the
      object, gravitational Propulsion can be achieved. So, all we need
      to take the next step from theory to technology is to find a way
      to change the rate of time. Is it too difficult? No, it is quite
      simple if we take into account some points:<br>
      <br>
      a) The notion "time" in any case is connected with some certain
      material system, for example, with some elementary particle or
      with some planetary system. The different velocity of light in
      different materials is a demonstration of this connection.<br>
      <br>
      b) The "space" of some curvature (of some rate of time) is a
      bi-directional or many-directional energy process. Electricity is
      one of many possible balanced situations that is described as
      a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bi-directional or two-polarity case. For
      many-polarity energetic situations there is the possibility of
      three or more time-flow directions.<br>
      <br>
      c) There is no difference in principle between an atom and&nbsp;
      the space around that atom, according to Faraday [4]. So, the
      balanced chronal situation of the vacuum engine corresponds to
      some real properties of matter and we can work with matter to
      reach the changes in the balance of the vacuum engine in the area
      of this material object.<br>
      <br>
      The vacuum is the medium of some known physical properties, for
      example, the dielectrical permittivity. Physically, it is
      connected with the velocity of spreading of the photon, and since
      we can work with different materials of known properties, it means
      we have the possibility of changing the parameters of the vacuum
      engine itself. One quite old example of a practical application is
      USA Patent number 3,187,206, granted in 1959 to Thomas T. Brown.
      The gradient of dielectrical permittivity is proposed and
      experimentally proved as the source of reactionless force. It is
      necessary to note that the same reactionless force is created at
      the border between two different dielectrical materials of the
      electrical capacitor, as it is described in many textbooks on the
      properties of dielectrical materials. The problem of taking the
      next step to fundamental conclusions is understanding the physical
      connection between the permittivity of a material, the velocity of
      light in the material, and the local rate of time for this area of
      space.<br>
      <br>
      The patents by Thomas T. Brown include also asymmetrical
      interaction between electrodes. i.e, the topology of the
      electrical field. Let's note the analogy between Nassikas' idea
      above on "energy and geometry of space" and the invention by Brown
      of reactionless propulsion. The gradient of the electrical
      potential that is created in the natural way with distance from
      the electrically charged particle is a demonstration of the
      natural topology of space, i.e. the electrical field is created
      according to the law of creation of space itself. It is the reason
      for the analogy between the formulation for electrical and
      gravitational interaction. We have the possibility of changing the
      topology of the electrical field, for example by means of the
      asymmetrical dielectrical member in the capacitor of Brown. So we
      have the possibility of compensating the natural gradient created
      by the properties of space. It is the way to space-time
      engineering. <br>
      <br>
      So, the conception by Dr. Nassikas and idea of Dr. Alcubierre are
      a fine theoretical basis for the technology that was discovered
      and proved in practice by Thomas T. Brown. Modern industry,
      specialized in dielectrical materials, is ready now for cheap mass
      production of warp drive systems. The same technology may be the
      basis for self rotating generators. The way is short and all we
      need is the commercial demand and engineering formulation of a
      step-by-step program.<br>
      <br>
      The concept of negative time by Dr. Nassikas can be useful also in
      understanding the over-unity effect that is demonstrated in some
      cold fusion cells. The well-known Pons-Fleischmann experimental
      set-up includes a cathode that is over-saturated by protons when
      the set-up is operating. So, the local concentration of positively
      charged protons can be considered as a local imbalance in vacuum
      engine and the local rate of time in this area is different from
      the normal one. The processes are produced by this local change of
      the curvature of space are multilevel complex energy exchange, but
      the source of over-unity is the local concentration of positive
      electrically charged protons that is due to the lnput power
      source. Let's consider this point more&nbsp; carefully.<br>
      <br>
      Any electrically charged particle can be presented as some volume
      of space i.e. the gravitational space by Nassikas, G-space of
      energy Eg, that is joined with some imaginary electromagnetic
      space of energy Eem. Conservation of energy is presented as:<br>
      <br>
      dEem + dEg
      =O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


      F.1<br>
      <br>
      In my view, it is useful to change equation El to the form:<br>
      <br>
      dEem = -
      dEg&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


      E2<br>
      <br>
      In this case it is obviously that mathematically the space of Eem
      has an "imaginary" value, since the energy and the velocity are
      connected by the quadratic root of the negative number.<br>
      <br>
      The over-unity output in cold fusion systems means the production
      of the excess heat energy. Certainly, some cold fusion systems
      demonstrate power output as the result of nuclear<br>
      transmutation processes. But if we are considering the water to be
      distilled H2O in which fusion does not occur, I have to suppose
      only one way for excess heat production:<br>
      <br>
      dEem &gt;O if
      dEg&lt;O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      E3.<br>
      <br>
      I must note that the idea is not a new one since the famous
      Russian astrophysicist N.A. Kozyrev created in 1947-1980 the&nbsp;
      "conception&nbsp; for active properties of the time." There is
      some natural physical mechanism for production of heat energy that
      is demonstrated by any star and it is not the thermonuclear
      reaction but the transformation of energy by the mechanism of
      Kozyrev. In that concept, the kind of energy that is used by the
      star for heat energy production is the "time flow." On the other
      hand, we can take into consideration the gravitational description
      of space instead of its chronal description, and the production of
      the heat is the transformation of Eg that we noted above.<br>
      <br>
      N.Kozyrev analyzed the wide experimental astrophysical data to
      find the answer for the question of the common "special condition
      of matter" inside any star to provide the transformation of energy
      Eg into energy Eem. His conclusion [5] is quite simple:<br>
      <br>
      B/n = 6
      eV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


      F.4<br>
      <br>
      where "B" is the density of the beam energy of the star and "n" is
      the density of electrons in the volume of space.<br>
      <br>
      We certainly cannot create the conditions of stellar matter in the
      laboratory, but for a&nbsp; Pd-cathode in a cold fusion cell, the
      situation is quite similar to Kozyrev's equation F.4 and heat
      production can be detected as result of F.3. The difference is the
      application of protons instead of electrons. To calculate this we
      have to use the volume density of protons H+ in the material of
      the cathode instead of the volumetrical density of electrons "n"
      in star matter.<br>

      The present invention aims at the creation of hydrogenated carrier
      on the one side of a metallic system, the electric isolation of
      the said system and the exertion of negative potential on it. The
      result of this process is the absorption of ether gravitational
      space. The absorption of ether gravitational space is achieved by
      the oscillations of the hydrogen atom electrons of the
      hydrogenated carrier, by means of unstable states, lower than the
      1st fundamental level. During the approach between electron and
      proton, it takes place an absorption of ether gravitational space
      in the hydrogenated carrier which, by means of the conversion
      process through photons, is finally converted either into heat or
      directly into mechanical work, developing a force resulting from
      the creation of probability density difference at the system's
      ends. This difference is created due to the reduction of the ether
      matter presence probability that creates the gravity at the area
      of the hydrogenated carrier. The embodiment of the invention is
      achieved either by means of a heater utilizing the rejected heat
      or by the production of mechanical work due to developed force, or
      by production of electric energy by means of a generator through
      conversion of mechanical work into rotary motion.<br>

      Present invention consists of a conical superconducting
      multi-layer coil (4) made of REBCO tape coated conductor, where
      currents circulate within said conical superconductor when said
      coil is energized, creating a converging magnetic field within the
      structure of said coil, said magnetic field interacting either in
      the absence or presence of an external magnetic field, with said
      circulating currents creating Lorentz forces having an unbalanced
      axial component which is not counteracted by mechanical stresses
      arising within said conical superconductor. This creates an axial
      propulsion directed towards said conical superconductor coil's
      convergence direction regardless of the magnetic polarity of said
      coil. Two conical superconducting multi- layer coils (4) may be
      mounted on a carrier (8) and activated by energizing means so that
      these conical superconductors are inversely polarized, this
      allowing the whole device to operate without being affected by any
      external magnetic field such as the Earth's. The force being
      developed according to the present invention may be used in the
      propulsive thrust required for any machine or vehicle, as well as
      in the production of energy.<br>

      is developed due to the Meissner effect. The propulsive force,
      which is directed toward the tapered tube's converging end, may be
      used for the propulsion or operation of any machine, motor, or
      vehicle. One arrangement employed for the creation of a strong
      magnetic field comprises, a solenoid placed at the wide end of
      said tapered tube, whilst another arrangement comprises a pair of
      superconducting solenoids (3, 4) located at the ends of said
      tapered tube (2), whilst yet another arrangement comprises a
      superconductive solenoid (5) located in the convergent region (2b)
      of said tapered tube and powered by an AC or DC power source (6).<br>

        <b>Magnetic propulsion method and mechanism using magnetic field
          trapping superconductors</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A method for the creation of propulsive force and a mechanism for
      implementing the method comprising a magnet (3), like a permanent
      magnet or a superconductive solenoid, located at the output of a
      mechanism (2) inside which the propulsive force is developed and
      whose solid parts are those of a hydrodynamic machine made of a
      superconductor, like a type II superconductor, e.g. a
      superconductor Sm-Ba-Cu-O with high magnetic field trapping
      ability. The magnetic field generated by the interaction of magnet
      (3) with mechanism (2) acts in the form of pressure on mechanism
      (2) thereby creating the intended propulsion. Mechanism (2) may be
      a converging nozzle made from a superconductor (1), which
      conjointly with the magnet (3) act as self-propulsion mechanism
      with direction towards the converging area.; The propulsive force
      being developed may be used for the propulsion required in any
      machine or vehicle, as well as in the production of energy.<br>
