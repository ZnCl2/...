      <div align="center"><big><b>Alchemy 2.0 – Low Energy Nuclear
            Reactor Creates Gold and Platinum</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The transmutation from lead to gold has been mankind’s dream for
      millennia. Lattice Energy LLC, a company from Chicago, IL, claims
      to have developed a process for energy production, utilizing a
      low-energy nuclear reactor (LENR) that, as a byproduct of neutron
      captures on tungsten, will create a mix of precious metals.<br>
      <br>
      To learn more about the technology, Tech Metals Insider spoke with
      Lewis Larsen, president and CEO of Lattice.<br>
      <br>
      Lattice was founded in 2001 upon the ruins of the “cold fusion”
      failures that had caused much hope and disappointment back in the
      late 1980’s. Larsen is part of a team that learned from cold
      fusion’s mistakes: “their heat production measurements were
      right”, said Larsen with respect to cold fusion, “but their
      conclusions about the heat being produced by a fusion process were
      completely wrong.”<br>
      <br>
      What enabled Lattice’s new approach were recent advances in
      nanotechnology. “Nanotechnology and LENR are joined at the hip”,
      said Larsen. “It is one of the reasons why this could not be done
      back in 1989-90. Before our work, nobody had a grasp on the theory
      of neutron creation from protons and electrons in tabletop
      apparatus; nor on exactly how to apply advanced nanotechnology to
      build well-performing prototype devices.”<br>
      <br>
      Combining the know-how of experts from a variety of disciplines
      including electro-dynamics, quantum electro-dynamics, nuclear
      physics and solid state physics, lead to the development of a
      theoretical foundation which is now ready to be prototyped, and
      put to the test.<br>
      <br>
      The goal of Lattice is to build high performance thermal sources
      with outputs ranging from single watts to 100 kilowatts, the
      ultimate application being the use of LENRs in cars. Patents have
      been filed and some were issued. At this point, financing is
      provided by insiders and several angel investors, but larger
      amounts of capital are needed to take the technology to its next
      level.<br>
      <br>
      Larsen is labeling the LENR as “green nuclear technology” – green
      because commercial systems could be operated very similar to
      aluminum production using an electric arc. The process would emit
      no energetic neutrons (LENR ultra low energy neutrons are all
      absorbed locally deep inside the reactor and are thus not a safety
      problem), and no gamma radiation.<br>
      <br>
      When asked about differences compared to the deuterium-tritium
      fusion process presented by the Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory last week, Larsen said: “Their dirty little secret they
      don’t talk about is that they produce deadly, very energetic
      neutrons and gamma radiation. Harvesting the energy from these
      neutrons produced by fusion is quite difficult. Furthermore,
      shielding requirements will make fusion unusable for mobile and
      portable power generation applications.”<br>
      <br>
      Larsen’s theory that gold, platinum and several other metals can
      be created by his process is based on findings by Japanese
      physicist Prof. Hantaro Nagaoka who successfully transmuted
      tungsten into gold back in 1924. Nagaoka’s results have been
      verified by several institutions in recent independent experiments
      but so far there has been no effort to commercialize the process.
      “Now that the LENR transmutation process is well understood the
      use of nanotechnology may change all that”, believes Larsen.<br>
      <br>
      “The neutron-catalyzed LENR process follows rows of the periodic
      table of elements”, he went on, meaning that heavier metals than
      the starting targets’ will be created. The work published by
      Larsen and his team suggests that a tungsten target, for instance,
      will absorb neutrons and gradually be transmuted to gold, platinum
      and other platinum group metals. “And because LENR products are
      not dangerously radioactive”, Larsen added, “conventional metal
      recovery processes can be utilized.”<br>
      <br>
      “Can we scale this up to a commercial process that makes money?” –
      Larsen is convinced it may be possible.<br>

      following provisional patent applications by the present
      inventors: (a) "Apparatus and Method for Generation of Ultra Low
      Momentum Neutrons," filed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office

      60/715,622. Background of the Invention<br>
      <br>
      [0005] [0002] The present invention concerns apparatus and methods
      for the generation of extremely low energy neutrons and
      applications for such neutrons. Neutrons are uncharged elementary
      fermion particles that, along with protons (which are positively
      charged elementary fermion particles), comprise an essential
      component of all atomic nuclei except for that of ordinary
      hydrogen. Neutrons are well known to be particularly useful for
      inducing various types of nuclear reactions because, being
      uncharged, they are not repelled by Coulombic repulsive forces
      associated with the positive electric charge contributed by
      protons located in an atomic nucleus. Free neutrons are inherently
      unstable outside of the immediate environment in and around an
      atomic nucleus and have an accepted mean life of about 887 to 914
      seconds; if they are not captured by an atomic nucleus, they break
      up via beta decay into an electron, a proton, and an
      anti-neutrino. Neutrons are classified by their levels of kinetic
      energy; expressed in units measured in MeV, meV, KeV, or eV -
      Mega-, milli-, Kilo- electron Volts. Depending on the mean
      velocity of neutrons within their immediate physical environment,
      energy levels of free neutrons can range from: (1) ultracold to
      cold (nano eVs to 25 meV); (2) thermal (in equilibrium with
      environment at an E approx. = kT = 0.025 eV); (3) slow (0.025 eV
      to 100 eV - at around 1 eV they are called epithermal); (4)
      intermediate (100 eV to about 10 KeV); (5) fast (10 KeV to 10
      MeV), to ultrafast or high-energy (above 10 MeV). The degree to
      which a given free neutron possessing a particular level of energy
      is able to react with a given atomic nucleus/isotope via capture
      (referred to as the reaction capture "cross section" and
      empirically measured in units called "barns") is dependent upon:
      (a) the specific isotope of the nucleus undergoing a capture
      reaction with a free neutron, and (b) the mean velocity of a free
      neutron at the time it interacts with a target nucleus.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] [0003] It is well known that, for any specific atomic
      isotope, the capture cross section for reactions with externally
      supplied free neutrons scales approximately inversely proportional
      to velocity (1/v). This means that the lower the mean velocity of
      a free neutron (i.e., the lower the momentum) at the time of
      interaction with a nucleus, the higher its absorption cross
      section will be, i.e., the greater the probability that it will
      react successfully and be captured by a given target
      nucleus/isotope.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] [0004] Different atomic isotopes can behave very
      differently after capturing free neutrons. Some isotopes are
      entirely stable after the capture of one or more free neutrons
      (e.g., isotopes of Gadolinium (Gd), atomic number 64:
      &lt;154&gt;Gd to &lt;155&gt;Gd to &lt;156&gt;Gd). (As used herein,
      superscripts at the top left side (or digits to the left side) of
      the elemental symbol represent atomic weight.) Some isotopes
      absorb one or more neutrons, forming a more neutron-rich isotope
      of the same element, and then beta decay to another element. Beta
      decay strictly involves the weak interaction, because it results
      in the production of neutrinos and energetic electrons (known as
      [beta]-particles). In beta decay, the neutron number (N) goes down
      by one; the number of protons (atomic number = Z = nuclear charge)
      goes up by one; the atomic mass (A = Z + N) is unchanged. Higher-Z
      elements are thus produced from lower-Z "seed" elements. Other
      atomic isotopes enter an unstable excited state after capturing
      one or more free neutrons, and "relax" to a lower energy level by
      releasing the excess energy through the emission of photons such
      as gamma rays (e.g., the isotope Cobalt- 60 [&lt;60&gt;Co], atomic
      number 27). Yet other isotopes also enter unstable excited states
      after capturing one or more free neutrons, but subsequently
      "relax" to lower energy levels through spontaneous fission of the
      "parent" nucleus. At very high values of A, de-excitation
      processes start being dominated by fission reactions (involving
      the strong interaction) and alpha particle (Helium-4 nuclei)
      emission rather than beta decays and emission of energetic
      electrons and neutrinos. Such fission processes can result in the
      production of a wide variety of "daughter" isotopes and the
      release of energetic particles such as protons, alphas, electrons,
      neutrons, and/or gamma photons (e.g., the isotope &lt;252&gt;Cf of
      Californium, atomic number 98). Fission processes are commonly
      associated with certain very heavy (high A) isotopes that can
      produce many more neutrons than they "consume" via initial
      capture, thus enabling a particular type of rapidly escalating
      cascade of neutron production by successive reactions commonly
      known as a fission "chain reaction" (e.g., the uranium isotope
      &lt;235&gt;U, atomic number 92; or the plutonium isotope Pu,
      atomic number 94). For U, each external free "trigger" neutron
      releases another 100 neutrons in the resulting chain reaction.
      Isotopes that can produce chain reactions are known as fissile.
      Deliberately induced neutron- catalyzed chain reactions form the
      underlying basis for existing nuclear weapons and fission power
      plant technologies. Significant fluxes of free neutrons at various
      energies are useful in a variety of existing military, commercial,
      and research applications, with illustrative examples as follows.
      It should be noted that an advantage of the present invention is
      mentioned in the following Table I: -A-<br>
      <br>
      [0008]<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Table I [0005]<br>
      <br>
      [0010] [0006] Locations and Reaction Products of Fluxes of Free
      Neutrons Found in Nature:<br>
      <br>
      [0011] [0007] Minor natural sources of free neutrons are produced
      by relatively rare accumulations of long-lived radioactive
      isotopes incorporated in a variety of minerals (e.g., Uraninite -
      UO2; with U comprised of about 99.28% of &lt;238&gt;U and 0.72%
      &lt;235&gt;U and a trace of &lt;234&gt;U) found in planetary
      crusts, asteroids, comets, and interstellar dust. In addition to
      such radioactive isotopes and various man-made sources of free
      neutrons noted earlier, natural sources of significant fluxes of
      free neutrons are found primarily in stellar environments. In
      fact, since the Big Bang, nearly all of the elements and isotopes
      found in the Universe besides hydrogen and helium have been
      created by a variety of cosmic nucleosynthetic processes
      associated with various stages of stellar evolution.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] [0008] Stellar nucleosynthesis is a complex collection of
      various types of nuclear processes and associated nuclear reaction
      networks operating across an extremely broad range of
      astrophysical environments, stellar evolutionary phenomena, and
      time-spans. According to current thinking, these processes are
      composed of three broad classes of stellar nucleosynthetic
      reactions as follows:<br>
      <br>
      [0013] [0009] 1. Various nuclear reactions primarily involving
      fusion of nuclei and/or charged particles that start with
      hydrogen/helium as the initial stellar "feedstock" and
      subsequently create heavier isotopes up to &lt;56&gt;Fe (iron), at
      which the curve of nuclear binding energy peaks. At masses above
      &lt;56&gt;Fe, binding energies per nucleon progressively decrease;
      consequently, nucleosynthesis via fusion and charged particle
      reactions are no longer energetically favored. As a result,
      isotopes/elements heavier than &lt;56&gt;Fe must be created via
      neutron capture processes. [0010] 2. S-Process - short-hand for
      the Slow (neutron capture) Process; it is thought to occur in
      certain evolutionary stages of cool giant stars. In this process,
      "excess" neutrons (produced in certain nuclear reactions) are
      captured by various types of "seed" nuclei on a long time-scale
      compared to [beta]-decays. Heavier nuclides are built-up via
      successive neutron captures that ascend the so-called
      beta-stability valley from &lt;56&gt;Fe (a common initial "seed"
      nucleus in stellar environments) all the way up to &lt;209&gt;Bi
      (Bismuth). Masses above &lt;209&gt;Bi require much higher neutron
      fluxes to create heavier elements such as Uranium (e.g.
      &lt;238&gt;U).<br>
      <br>
      [0014] [0011] 3. R-Process - short-hand for the Rapid (neutron
      capture) Process; -it is thought to occur in Type II supernovae
      and various high-energy events on and around neutron stars. In
      this process, intermediate products comprising very neutron-rich
      nuclei are built up by very large neutron fluxes produced under
      extreme conditions that are captured by various types of "seed"
      nuclei. These intermediate products then undergo a series of
      [beta]- decays accompanied by fission of the heaviest nuclei.
      Ultimately, this process produces nuclei having even larger
      masses, i.e. above &lt;209&gt;Bi, that are located on the
      neutron-rich side of the "valley of nuclear stability".<br>
      <br>
      [0015] [0012 ] As evident from the Table I discussed above,
      various types of neutron generators have been known for many
      years. However, the neutron generators of the prior art do not
      produce ultra low momentum neutrons. Two prior publications have
      mentioned or involve "ultracold" neutrons (which are created at
      significantly higher energies and much greater momenta than "ultra
      low momentum" neutrons), but these are easily distinguished from
      the present invention. Specifically, RU2160938 (entitled
      "Ultracold Neutron Generator," by Vasil et al, dated December 20,
      2000) and RU2144709 (entitled "Ultracold Neutron Production
      Process," by Jadernoj et al., dated January 20, 2000) both utilize
      either large macroscopic nuclear fission reactors or accelerators
      as neutron sources to create thermal neutrons, which are then
      subsequently extracted and brought down to "ultracold" energies
      with certain neutron moderators that are cooled-down to liquid
      helium temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] [0013] An object of the present invention is to provide
      method and apparatus for directly producing large fluxes of ultra
      low momentum neutrons (ULMNs) that possess much lower momentum and
      velocities than ultracold neutrons. Illustratively, such fluxes of
      ULMNs produced in the apparatus of the Invention may be as high as
      ~10&lt;16&gt; neutrons/sec/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] [0014] Another object of the present invention is to
      generate ULM neutrons at or above room temperature in very tiny,
      comparatively low cost apparatus/devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] [0015] A further obj ect of the present invention is to
      generate ULM neutrons without requiring any moderation; that is,
      without the necessity of deliberate "cooling" of its produced
      neutrons using any type of neutron moderator.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] [0016] A further object of the present invention is to
      utilize controlled combinations of starting materials and
      successive rounds of ULM neutron absorption and beta decays to
      synthesize stable, heavier (higher-A) elements from lighter
      starting elements, creating transmutations and releasing
      additional energy in the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] [0017] Yet another object of the present invention is to
      produce neutrons with extraordinarily high absorption
      cross-sections for a great variety of isotopes/elements. Because
      of that unique characteristic, the ULMN absorption process is
      extremely efficient, and neutrons will very rarely if ever be
      detected externally, even though large fluxes of ULMNs are being
      produced and consumed internally within the apparatus of the
      invention. One specific object of the present invention is to
      produce neutrons at intrinsically very low energies, hence the
      descriptive term "ultra low momentum" neutrons. ULM neutrons have
      special properties because, according to preferred aspects of the
      invention, they are formed collectively at extraordinarily low
      energies (which is equivalent to saying that at the instant they
      are created, ULMNs are moving at extraordinarily small velocities,
      v, approaching zero). Accordingly, they have extremely long
      quantum mechanical wavelengths that are on the order of one to ten
      microns (i.e., 10,000 to 100,000 Angstroms). By contrast, a
      "typical" neutron moving at thermal energies in condensed matter
      will have a quantum mechanical wavelength of only about 2
      Angstroms. By comparison, the smallest viruses range in size from
      50 to about 1,000 Angstroms; bacteria range in size from 2,000 to
      about 500,000 Angstroms. The great size of the domain of their
      wave function is the source of ULMNs' extraordinarily large
      absorption cross-sections; it enables them to be almost instantly
      absorbed by different local nuclei located anywhere within
      distances of up to 10,000 Angstroms from the location at which
      they are created. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] [ 0018 ] The present invention has numerous features
      providing methods and apparatus that utilize surface plasmon
      polariton electrons, hydrogen isotopes, surfaces of metallic
      substrates, collective many-body effects, and weak interactions in
      a controlled manner to generate ultra low momentum neutrons that
      can be used to trigger nuclear transmutation reactions and produce
      heat. One aspect of the present invention effectively provides a
      "transducer" mechanism that permits controllable two-way transfers
      of energy back-and-forth between chemical and nuclear realms in a
      small-scale, low-energy, scalable condensed matter system at
      comparatively modest temperatures and pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] One aspect of the invention provides a neutron production
      method in a condensed matter system at moderate temperatures and
      pressures comprising the steps of providing collectively
      oscillating protons, providing collectively oscillating heavy
      electrons, and providing a local electric field greater than
      approximately 10&lt;n&gt; volts/meter. Another aspect of the
      invention provides a method of producing neutrons comprising the
      steps of: providing a hydride or deuteride on a metallic surface;
      developing a surface layer of protons or deuterons on said hydride
      or deuteride; developing patches of collectively oscillating
      protons or deuterons near or at said surface layer; and
      establishing surface plasmons on said metallic surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Another aspect of the invention provides a method of
      producing ultra low momentum neutrons ("ULMNs") comprising:
      providing a plurality of protons or deuterons on a working surface
      of hydride/deuteride-forming materials; breaking down the
      Born-Oppenheimer approximation in patches on said working surface;
      producing heavy electrons in the immediate vicinity of coherently
      oscillating patches of protons and/or deuterons; and producing
      said ULMNs from said heavy electrons and said protons or
      deuterons.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] According to another aspect of the invention, a nuclear
      process is provided using weak interactions comprising: forming
      ultra low momentum neutrons (ULMNs) from electrons and
      protons/deuterons using weak interactions; and locally absorbing
      said ULMNs to form isotopes which undergo beta-decay after said
      absorbing.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] According to a further aspect of the invention, a method of
      generating energy is provided. At first sites, the method produces
      neutrons intrinsically having, upon their creation, ultra low
      momentum (ULMNs). A lithium target is disposed at a second site
      near said first sites in a position to intercept said ULMNs. The
      ULMNs react with the Lithium target to produce Li-7 and Li-8
      isotopes. The lithium isotopes decay by emitting electrons and
      neutrinos to form Be-8; said Be-8 decaying to He-4. This reaction
      produces a net heat of reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The foregoing method of producing energy may further
      comprise producing helium isotopes by reacting helium with ULMNs
      emitted from said first sites to form He-5 and He-6; the He-6
      decaying to Li-6 by emitting an electron and neutrino; the
      helium-to-lithium reactions yielding a heat of reaction and
      forming a nuclear reaction cycle.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The present invention also provides a method of producing
      heavy electrons comprising: providing a metallic working surface
      capable of supporting surface plasmons and of forming a hydride or
      deuteride; fully loading the metallic surface with H or D thereby
      to provide a surface layer of protons or deuterons capable of
      forming coherently oscillating patches; and developing at least
      one patch of coherently or collectively oscillating protons or
      deuterons on the surface layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In addition, the present invention also provides apparatus
      for a nuclear reaction. Such apparatus comprises: a supporting
      material; a thermally conductive layer; an electrically conductive
      layer in contact with at least a portion of said thermally
      conductive layer; a cavity within said supporting material and
      thermally conductive layer; a source of hydrogen or deuterium
      associated with said cavity; first and second metallic
      hydride-forming layers within said cavity; an interface between a
      surface of said first hydride-forming layer, said interface being
      exposed to hydrogen or deuterium from said source; a first region
      of said cavity being located on one side of said interface and
      having a first pressure of said hydrogen or deuterium; a second
      region of said cavity being located on one side of said second
      hydride- forming layer and having a second pressure of said
      hydrogen or deuterium; said first pressure being greater than said
      second pressure; said apparatus forming a sea of surface plasmon
      polaritons and patches of collectively oscillating protons or
      deuterons, and ultra low momentum neutrons in a region both above
      and below said interface. Optionally, a laser may be positioned to
      irradiate said sea and said interface. An electrically conductive
      layer may form a portion of an inside wall of the cavity.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Another aspect of the present invention provides a neutron
      generator for producing ultra low momentum neutrons ("ULMNs")
      comprising: a metallic substrate having a working surface capable
      of supporting surface plasmons and of forming a hydride or
      deuteride, located above the substrate. The metallic substrate is
      fully loaded with hydrogen or deuterium; a surface layer of
      protons or deuterons. At least one region of collectively
      oscillating protons or deuterons is on said surface layer, and
      surface plasmons are located above the surface layer and said
      region. A flux of protons or deuterons is incident on said surface
      plasmons, surface layer, and working surface. Optionally, a
      plurality of target nanoparticles can be positioned on the working
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Preferably, in the ULMN generator just mentioned, the
      Born-Oppenheimer approximation breaks down on the upper working
      surface. The invention may further comprise laser radiation
      incident on said working surface to stimulate and transfer energy
      into said surface plasmons. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>

      Gamma radiation (22) is shielded by producing a region of heavy
      electrons (4) and receiving incident gamma radiation in such
      region. The heavy electrons absorb energy from the gamma radiation
      and re-radiate it as photons (38, 40) at a lower energy and
      frequency. The heavy electrons may be produced in surface plasmon
      polaritons. Multiple regions (6) of collectively oscillating
      protons or deuterons with associated heavy electrons may be
      provided. Nanoparticles of a target material on a metallic surface
      capable of supporting surface plasmons may be provided. The region

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present invention concerns apparatus and methods for
      the shielding (absorption) of incident gamma radiation and its
      conversion to less energetic photons. Gamma photons (often denoted
      by the Greek letter gamma, [gamma]) are a form of very high
      energy, very high frequency, very short wavelength, and very
      penetrating electromagnetic radiation emitted by, for example:<br>
      <br>
      Atomic nuclei making a transition from an initial excited nuclear
      state to a subsequent lower energy state, or<br>
      <br>
      Transmutation reactions (nuclear reactions in which one element
      changes to another) in which prompt gamma rays are emitted by an
      atomic nucleus after it has absorbed a type of neutral elementary
      particle called a neutron, or<br>
      <br>
      Radioactive decay of nuclei in processes such as fission of
      unstable radioactive isotopes (e.g. Uranium-235, used in nuclear
      weapons and some commercial nuclear power plants), and<br>
      Other subatomic processes involving elementary particles such as
      electron-positron annihilation...<br>
