      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Imagine a heavier-than-air
          flying craft devoid of any visible means of propulsion, which
          rises from the earth and travels through the air in apparent
          defiance of gravity. Lifting itself by its own bootstraps, by
          slinging weights about its interior, it could navigate at will
          in the stratosphere or even in the unknown reaches of outer
          space. Such a craft is brought within the realm of speculation
          by pioneer experiments of Harry W. Bull, of Syracuse, NY, with
          an entirely new form of propulsion that he terms the reaction
          motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Suspended from a pair of
          light, flexible wires, in his laboratory, hands a cylindrical
          tube about a foot long. At the touch of an electric switch, it
          becomes alive and leaps forward, as if drawn by some invisible
          magnet. Actually the power plant, a curious system of
          reciprocating weights, is contained within the tube itself.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This elementary form of
          reaction motor operates on a principle that has long been
          neglected by engineers, but which Bull believes can be applied
          in aircraft and other vehicles. It depends upon the difference
          in effectiveness of two ways of transmitting energy, which can
          be termed impact and impulse. If a weight is thrown against a
          solid wall, it is stopped by impact, and much of its energy is
          wasted in distorting the weight and wall and in producing
          heat. However, if the weight is thrown against a spring
          fastened to the wall, it is stopped by impulse, the spring
          conserving the energy of the moving weight and transmitting
          the resulting force, with little loss, to the wall. Tests have
          shown a weight will yield three times more force by impulse
          than by impact.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 3 ~ Harry W. Bull,
            inventor, exhibits an experimental model of his reaction
            motor with which he hopes to power an aircraft that will,
            apparently, defy gravity. When the power is shut off the two
            pointers, above, coincide. Weights in the device are
            operated by electromagnets.</font></b> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Applying this principle in
          the manner shown in the accompanying diagram, he mounts two
          movable weights in a cylinder and starts them simultaneously
          in opposite directions. One is stopped by a flat steel plate,
          and the other by a spring. The difference in the effectiveness
          of the two blows, as explained above, is sufficient to kick
          the cylinder forcibly in the direction of the spring. The
          weights may be returned to their original positions by any
          standard mechanical means, and the cycle repeated
          continuously, providing a steady and self-contained driving
          force without recourse to propellers, rocket jets, or any
          other familiar means of propulsion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the present
          experimental model to a reaction motor powerful enough to lift
          aircraft seems a long step. Achieving a practical reaction
          motor, Bull points out, depends to a large extent,
          paradoxically, upon how inefficient it can be made. The more
          force that can be wasted in impact, the greater force will be
          left to push ahead, a new problem for engineers, who have
          spent years trying to conserve energy rather than dissipate
          it. Likewise, much experimentation remains to be done upon the
          impulse side of the apparatus, which is still far from
          efficient.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Supposing these difficulties
          overcome, what would an airship, driven by a reaction motor,
          look like? Bull visualizes a globular craft with a motor in
          the form of an upright cylinder containing two pistons
          operating in opposite directions, one delivering an impulse
          and the other an impact. A carburetor adapted for mixing
          vaporized oxygen and gasoline would supply an explosive
          mixture to drive the pistons. Several cylinder units could be
          used to obtain a steady lifting force. Others placed
          horizontally would provide forward motion. A similar
          impulse-impact cylinder of reduced size, operated electrically
          and mounted near the outer shell of the ship, would rotate the
          craft for steering. An airship driven by this new method could
          travel at high speed and could be used at either high or low
          altitudes.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">An
            entirely new means of securing a reaction was next tested.
            The rocket was made up of a series of chambers the ends of
            which consisted of steel disks fastened together by a 1/4
            inch diameter steel rod. The chambers were arranged to
            explode in series, blowing the steel disks downward with
            great velocity. Knowing the weight of the disk and its
            velocity and also the weight of the complete rocket it is a
            simple matter to find the energy of the recoil. Although
            this type of rocket works, it leaves much to be desired in
            the line of safety.</font></font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">A
            series of tests now followed which I believe are original in
            the field of reaction. They dealt with a form of
            impact-impulse reactions which are created mechanically. The
            apparatus if placed in a box in space would move without the
            use of a jet of any sort, it being propelled by a
            reciprocating motion of two weights. The truth of the theory
            may be easily proven by a very simple apparatus.</font></font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><font color="#000000">The
            theory is that a large weight with a low velocity ( if
            stopped by springs ) will yield more foot pounds of energy
            than a small weight with a high velocity being stopped by
            impact, even though both were given the same initial force.
            A simple illustration: Let us assume you are in the center
            of a room in space. One wall is elastic and the opposite one
            solid. In your hands are two balls one heavy and the other
            light and you throw them with the same force at the same
            time. The heavier one hits the elastic wall with an impulse
            and a large amount of energy is given to the room in that
            direction. The lighter one having the same energy hits the
            solid wall but its energy is dissipated in heat and
            distortion. If there could be found a method whereby the
            kinetic energy of the lighter ball could be effectively
            utilized the room would move in the other direction.</font></font>
