      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Regauging a Magnetic
            Scalar Potential ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"To "regauge" a
          magnetostatic scalar potential on a stator, we must create a
          stator magnetic pole in such a manner that the magnetic field
          H from the suddenly injected pole strength cannot cause
          tangential translation acceleration of the rotor in the
          regauging region itself. There is no such limitation on
          tangential translation acceleration of the rotor between the
          regauging region and regions outside it. Further, if the
          injected pole strength creates an accelerating tangential
          field from the regauging region to the nextmost stator region,
          that can be highly beneficial and it can be utilized to enable
          overunity. In fact, that is the active principle used by the
          magnetic Wankel engine. On the other hand, Kawai creates a
          tangential force field by a stator electromagnet when it is
          just forward of the radial flux from a central ring magnet.
          This produces an accelerating tangential force field, which
          reduces as the rotor proceeds and the flux becomes aligned
          with the stator electromagnet. If unchanged, the tangential
          force component would then reverse in direction and add
          drag-back to the rotor. Just as the tangential force
          approaches zero and its reversal, Kawai regauges by
          de-energizing the stator electromagnet and resetting that
          stator coil potential back to zero. Hence the regauging
          "quenches" the back-drag field portion. Regauging is best
          accomplished by creating the magnetic field H of the injected
          pole oriented radially with respect to the rotor pole in the
          regauging sector, as that rotor pole moves along its
          tangential path. In that case, no radial work on the rotor
          system is required in order to regauge the magnetic scalar
          potential. The injected magnetostatic scalar potential (pole)
          can readily be made sufficiently strong as to create an
          accelerating force between it and the potential (pole)
          nextmost in rotation order. Thus the rotor can actually be
          strongly boosted through a region that would otherwise produce
          back-drag if regauging were not accomplished. So, once the
          regauging jump of the magnetostatic scalar potential (MSP) is
          accomplished, the tangential back drag on the rotor in a
          permanent magnet motor arrangement can be eliminated or
          materially reduced __ or even reversed so as to aid the
          rotor's operation __ with the expenditure of very little
          energy in creating the "regauging jump." That is the regauging
          secret of the magnetic Wankel engine, together with sudden
          breaking of a small current through a radial stator coil in
          order to induce a momentary, free, very high MSP with its
          radial H field radial to the rotor. This produces a large,
          amplified magnetostatic scalar potential (footnote 29) "jump"
          so that the usual "tangential back drag" force __ between the
          regauging region and the stator region directly ahead __ is
          actually reversed and now strongly aids in accelerating the
          rotor's movement out of the regauging region. The magnetic
          Wankel engine is a "convert decelerating drag into
          accelerating boost" engine, while the Kawai engine is an
          "eliminate decelerating back drag" engine.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"It is important to note
          that the regauging "jump" region becomes an energy reset and
          refueling region. It is just like refueling a gasoline-powered
          automobile __ by refueling, one resets the stored energy
          (i.e., the potential) in a subsystem (the gasoline tank) to
          its initial value.(footnote 30) So regauging a stator sector
          of an EM motor of the magnetic Wankel or Kawai kind or
          similar, is precisely a method of refueling or resetting the
          stored potential energy of the system.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">'For overunity operation,
          one simply resets (refuels), extracts energy as work in the
          load, resets (refuels) again, extracts more energy in the
          load, and so on..."</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kawai Engine ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Figure 9 shows eight
          snapshots of the rotor advance of a typical Kawai engine,
          taken from Kawai's patent. (footnote 74) This is one end
          rotor/stator side of a two rotor device, where a similar
          rotor/stator device is on the other end of the central shaft
          11. In Figure 9A, polepiece 14 has three outward teeth 14b
          dispersed equally around the circumference, alternated with
          three notches. An end magnet 13 provides the source of flux
          passing through the polepiece. With the electromagnets
          de-energized, their core materials 16c, 16d, 16g, 16h, and
          16k, 16l are shown shaded, by flux from central magnet 13
          outwards through teeth 14b.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In Figure 9B,
          electromagnets 16a, 16e, and 16d are energized. The shaded
          area shows the sharp convergence of the flux from magnet 13
          through polepiece 14 and the edge of teeth 14b. Since the
          electromagnets are magnetized in attracting mode, the rotor
          will experience a torque tending to widen the flux path from
          magnet 13 to the activated electromagnets. Thus a clockwise
          torque exists on the rotor, and it will start to rotate
          clockwise. (footnote 75) Note also that each electromagnet is
          operating independently of the other two.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"As shown in Figure 9C, 9D,
          9E, and 9F the rotation of the rotor continues clockwise,
          widening the connecting flux path to the three activated
          electromagnets. During this time the torque on the rotor is
          clockwise.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In Figure 9G, the flux path
          to the activated electromagnets is fully widened. Also, the
          leading edges of the three teeth are just beginning to enter
          the domains of the next electromagnets 16j, 16b, and 16f..
          This is getting symmetrical to the original position shown in
          Figure 9B. Consequently, the electromagnets 16i, 16a, and 16e
          are deactivated, and electromagnets 16j, 16b, and 16f are
          activated. Symmetrically, this regauges and resets the engine
          back to the original starting position in Figure 9B. The
          action cycle begins anew. As can be seen, in each complete
          rotation of the shaft, each of the three teeth of the rotor
          will be regauged 12 times. So 36 total
          regaugings/resetting/refuelings are utilized per shaft
          rotation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In each stator coil, at
          energization a tooth is just entering that coil. Energized in
          attractive mode with respect to the ring magnet around the
          shaft, the flux in the polepiece "jumps" from fully widened
          flux (and small or vanishing radial torque on the rotor) to
          angled and narrowed flux (with full radial clockwise torque on
          the rotor). As previously explained, the narrowed flux and its
          angle exert a clockwise accelerating tangential component of
          force upon the rotor. Each coil is de-energized prior to
          beginning to exert radial back emf (which it would do if it
          remained energized as the trailing edge crossed it and again
          narrowed the flux path). So the Kawai engine uses normal
          magnetic attraction to accelerate the rotor for a small
          distance, then regauges to zero attraction to eliminate the
          back-drag portion of the attractive field. It regauges to zero
          as the "RESET" condition.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"For appreciable power and
          smoothness, the Kawai engine uses an extensive number of
          regaugings per axle rotation, being 36 times on each end, or a
          total of 72 for the two ends. The forcefield of each coil,
          accompanying its increased magnetostatic scalar potential, is
          oriented radially inward, so that radial work cannot be done
          by the coil on the rotor because the rotor does not translate
          radially. Advantage is taken of the initial clockwise
          acceleration force initially produced, and regauging
          eliminates the counterclockwise drag or "decelerating" force
          that would be produced without the regauging.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The major benefits of the
          Kawai arrangement are that (1) a large number of regaugings
          occurs for a single rotation of the rotor assembly, enabling
          high power-to-weight ratio, (2) each electromagnet is
          energized only when positively contributing to the clockwise
          torque that drives the rotor, and (3) each coil is
          de-energized to regauge the system during those periods when
          the coil would otherwise create back-drag (counterclockwise
          torque) if it remained energized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"So the Kawai engine
          delivers what it advertises: It dramatically reduces or
          eliminates the "back drag" from the fields of the stator
          electromagnets, because there are no fields activated in the
          electromagnets during the back-drag sectors of rotation. A
          conservative field cycle is one in which the back-drag is
          equal to the forward boost. Eliminating the back-drag portion
          of the cycle is a form of regauging. Note that again it was
          accomplished by a change in the magnetostatic scalar potential
          being reset to zero by the de-energized coil during the
          back-drag portion of an otherwise conservative cycle. The
          Kawai engine therefore uses regauging and nonconservative
          fields in order to legitimately achieve overunity operation.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Because of the numerous
          regaugings and back drag elimination, this engine definitely
          can provide a COP&gt;1.0. Placed in an electric vehicle with
          necessary switching circuitry and ancillary equipment, a
          properly designed Kawai engine and its derivatives should be
          capable of starting from a single ordinary battery, then
          powering the vehicle agilely, powering the accessories, and
          recharging its own battery __ all three simultaneously. And in
          so doing, it complies with all the laws of physics and
          thermodynamics..."</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusion ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In this paper we have
          briefly discussed the storage of energy in an electromagnetic
          circuit from a gauge-theoretic viewpoint. We have presented
          the multivalued potential and the pseudo-multivalued
          potential, and their usage in regauging the potential in the
          energy-storing subsystem of an EM engine. Regauging
          accomplishes a work-free resetting or "refueling" flow of
          energy in an electrical circuit, from a modified Poynting
          vector standpoint. In addition we have presented embodiments
          of the current-blocking, energy storage, energy shuttling,
          multivalued potential (MVP), pseudo-MVP, and regauging
          approach for overunity electrical power systems and for room
          temperature superconductivity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In addition we have
          explained two Japanese overunity engines, at least one of
          which (the Kawai engine) appears to have reached full
          production capability in an extremely well-funded, national
          Japanese strategic effort lasting more than two decades.
          (footnote 76) The ominous implications for U.S. science and
          industry __ and U.S. financial stability __ are sobering to
          say the least. Until recently delayed, beginning in model year
          1997, a certain percentage of all new automobiles sold in the
          U.S. would have had to be zero-polluting vehicles __ i.e.,
          electric vehicles. U.S. manufacturers are already
          irretrievably committed for the specific electric vehicles
          they will offer. These U.S. offerings will be bulky,
          cumbersome, largely impractical, expensive, and
          maintenance-intensive. They will require frequent and lengthy
          recharging of their huge battery packs. They will give poor
          performance, get very low mileage (range) between recharges,
          and will have only austere powered accessory systems. The
          manufacturers will have to either sell them or give them away
          somehow in order to meet their mandatory quotas.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"The Japanese manufacturers
          appear to be poised to introduce en masse a substantial line
          of powerful electric engines which are overunity and
          self-powered, and a substantial line of powerful electric
          vehicles utilizing those engines. In short, those vehicles can
          be initiated from a single battery and self-powered from then
          on. They are eminently practical, unlimited in range and
          performance, can be large and luxurious and agile, can have
          full-powered accessory systems, and will probably be available
          in a wide range of sizes and performances.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In short, there is evidence
          that the Japanese have scored a great coup on the entire
          automotive world, and especially upon the U.S. Japanese
          businessmen are samurai; such is in their psyche and ingrained
          in their culture. For the Japanese businessmen, the financial
          struggle is just like any other war and any other struggle.
          They attack the business struggle with a single-mindedness
          typical of the Japanese samurai warrior. They have also been
          strongly motivated by national need; Japan is energy-poor and
          literally has been at the mercy of the energy-rich nations of
          the world. The Japanese samurai simply have attacked their
          nation's energy problem like the sturdy warriors they are, and
          put their funds, their hearts, and their minds into it with a
          single purpose: winning.(footnote 77) Now we are faced with a
          fait accompli.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We close by emphasizing the
          final statements of our previous article on the Japanese
          overunity engines. "He that does not know history, it's been
          said, is doomed to repeat it. We simply must not repeat a
          Pearl Harbor in the overunity electrical energy field. This
          time the torpedoes may be too devastating for America itself
          to survive."</font> <br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A motive power generating
          device comprises a permanent magnet disposed around a
          rotational output shaft for rotation therewith, the output
          shaft being mounted on a support member for rotation, a
          magnetic body disposed in concentric relationship with the
          permanent magnet for rotation with the rotational output
          shaft, the magnetic body being subjected to magnetic flux
          generated by the permanent magnet, a plurality of
          electromagnets fixedly mounted to the support member in such a
          manner that they are spaced at predetermined distances around
          the periphery of the magnetic body, each magnetic circuit of
          the electromagnets being adapted to be independent of one
          another, and excitation change-over means for the
          electromagnets, the excitation change-over means being adapted
          to sequentially magnetize one of the electromagnets which is
          positioned forwardly with regard to a rotational direction of
          the rotational output shaft, so as to impart to the particular
          electromagnet a magnetic polarity opposite to that of the
          magnetic pole of the permanent magnet, whereby magnetic flux
          passing through the magnetic body converges in one direction
          so as to apply a rotational torque to the rotational output
          shaft. No force opposing movement of a rotor or movable
          element is generated.</font> </p>

      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BACKGROUND OF THE
            INVENTION</font></i> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to a
          motive power generating device in which electromagnets and a
          combination of a magnetic material and a permanent magnet are
          used as a stator and a rotator, respectively. More
          particularly, the invention relates to a motive power
          generating device which transforms magnetic energy into
          operative energy with maximum efficiency utilizing a magnetic
          force inherent in a permanent magnet as an energy source.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Heretofore, it has been
          known in the art that a motive power generating device in
          which electromagnets and a combination of a magnetic material,
          such as soft steel, and a permanent magnet are used as a
          stator and a rotator, respectively. Such a device includes,
          for example, a step motor of a HB (Hybrid) type.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIGS. 12 to 17
          diagrammatically illustrate an example of conventional HB type
          step motors. The HB type motor is characterized by a rotor 52,
          as shown in FIGS. 12 and 13. The rotor combines the
          advantageous feature of a step motor of a VR (Variable
          Reluctance) type in that a smaller step angle may be obtained
          by virtue of the teeth formed in a laminated steel plate 53
          constituting one component of the rotor, with the advantageous
          feature of a step motor of a PM (Permanent Magnet) type in
          that a high degree of efficiency and miniaturization may be
          obtained by virtue of the permanent magnet 54 constituting the
          other component of the rotor 52. It is to be noted here that
          the steel core of the stator 50 is the same as that of a VR
          type motor, but the method of winding and connecting the coils
          is different.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 14 shows a passage of
          magnetic flux (magnetic path) created by the permanent magnet
          54. The magnetic path represents a distribution of a uni-polar
          type in which an N-pole or S-pole uniformly appears at the
          axial ends of a rotor shaft 55. On the other hand, FIG. 15
          shows a magnetic path created by the electromagnets 51 of the
          rotor 50. The magnetic path represents a distribution of a
          hereto-polar type in which an even number of magnetic poles in
          the order, for example, of NSNS . . . appear in a plate
          vertical to the rotor shaft 55. The uni-polar magnetic flux of
          the permanent magnet (magnetic field of the permanent magnet)
          and the hereto-polar magnetic flux of the windings (magnetic
          field of the electromagnet) interact with each other so as to
          generate a torque. The term "interaction between the magnetic
          flux of the permanent magnet and the magnetic flux of the
          windings" is used herein to mean that an inclination of the
          line of magnetic force is created in the gap between the
          permanent magnet 54 and the electromagnet 51.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A torque generating
          mechanism of the HB type motor will be explained with
          reference to FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrating a model developed
          into a form of a linear motor. FIG. 16 shows a cross-section
          of S-side (south pole side) of the permanent magnet 54, while
          FIG. 17 shows a cross-section of N-side (north pole side) of
          the permanent magnet. In these drawings, magnetic flux
          emanating from the electromagnets 51 is shown by solid lines,
          and magnetic flux emanating from the permanent magnet 54 is
          shown by dotted lines.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With regard to the magnetic
          field from the electromagnets 51 (refer to the solid line in
          FIGS. 16), the S-side cross-section of the permanent magnet 54
          shows that the line of magnetic force in the central gap is
          inclined in the downward and right hand direction, while the
          line of magnetic force in the right hand end gap is inclined
          in the upward and right-hand direction. Thus, the lines of
          magnetic force in the above two gaps tend to cancel each other
          out. The same relationship is applied to the cross section of
          the N-side (north pole side) of the permanent magnet 54.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is noted that torque will
          be generated when the magnetic field of the electromagnet 51
          and the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 54 interact
          with each other. Specifically, and with regard to the central
          gap in the S-side cross-section of the permanent magnet 54,
          i.e., N-side of the electromagnet 51, the magnetic field of
          the electromagnet 51 and the magnetic field of the permanent
          magnet 54 interact with each other strongly in the same
          direction so as to generate in the rotor 52 a propulsive force
          toward the left in FIG. 16. On the other hand, and with regard
          to the right-hand gap, i.e., S-side of the electromagnet 51,
          both magnetic fields interact with each other weakly in
          opposite directions, so as to generate a propulsive force
          toward the right in FIG. 16. It is noted, however, that the
          propulsive force generated toward the right in FIG. 16 is
          relatively small. Consequently, a stronger propulsive force
          toward the left in FIG. 16 is generated.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With regard to the central
          gap in N-side cross-section of the permanent magnet 54, i.e.,
          N-side of the electromagnet 51, the magnetic field of the
          electromagnet 51 and the magnetic field of the permanent
          magnet 54 interact with each other weakly in opposite
          directions, so as to generate in the rotor 52 a propulsive
          force toward the right in FIG. 17. The resultant propulsive
          force is relatively small. On the other hand, and with regard
          to the right-hand gap in FIG. 17, i.e., S-side of the
          electromagnet 51, both magnetic field interact strongly with
          each other in the same direction, so as to generate a
          propulsive force of relatively significant magnitude toward
          the left in FIG. 17. Consequently, a stronger propulsive force
          toward the left in FIG. 17 will be generated. Accordingly, the
          thus generated propulsive force causes the rotor to be
          advanced in the left-hand direction in FIGS. 16 and 17.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It should be noted, however,
          that such a conventional HB type motor involves a problem in
          that a force acting in an opposite direction to the torque (a
          force tending to interfere with rotation of the rotor 52) is
          generated as mentioned above. In view of electrical energy to
          be applied to the windings of the electromagnets 51, an
          electric current applied to the winding of the right-hand end
          electromagnet in FIG. 16 and the winding of the central
          electromagnet in FIG. 17 is merely consumed so as to cancel
          the magnetic field of the permanent magnet which tends to
          prevent rotation of the rotor 52. Thus, such an electric
          current does not effectively contribute at all to the movement
          of the rotor 54, thus decreasing energy efficiency. In view of
          the magnetic energy of the permanent magnet 54, such energy is
          utilized together with the magnetic field created by the
          electromagnet 51, but it partly interferes with the movement
          of the rotor 52. Thus, magnetic energy of the permanent magnet
          54 is not effectively utilized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The above problem
          experienced with the HB type motor applies equally to motive
          power generation devices in which an electromagnet is used as
          a stator and soft steel and a permanent magnet is used as a
          rotor.</font> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</font></i>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Accordingly, it is an object
          of the invention to provide a motive power generation device
          in which the occurrence of a force acting in a direction
          opposite to the direction of movement of a rotor and/or a
          stator is prevented, so as to permit efficient use of electric
          energy to be applied to electromagnets, as well as magnetic
          energy generated by a permanent magnet.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to achieve the

          another and the excitation change-over means of the
          electromagnets, the excitation change-over means being adapted
          to sequentially magnetize one of the electromagnets which is
          positioned forwardly with regard to a rotational direction of
          the rotational output shaft, so as to impart to the
          electromagnet a magnetic polarity magnetically opposite to
          that of the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet, whereby a
          magnetic flux passing through the magnetic body converges in
          one direction thereby applying a rotational torque to the
          rotational output shaft.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the first
          invention, when one of the electromagnets which is positioned
          forwardly in the rotational direction of the rotational output
          shaft, a magnetic field created by the excited electromagnet
          and a magnetic field created by the permanent magnet interact
          with each other. Thus, the magnetic flux passing through the
          magnetic body converges toward the exited electromagnet, so as
          to rotate the rotational output shaft by a predetermined angle
          toward the excited electromagnet. When the rotational output
          shaft has been rotated by the predetermined angle, the above
          excited electromagnet is de-magnetized, and another
          electromagnet currently positioned forwardly in the rotational
          direction of the rotational output shaft is excited or
          magnetized. Sequential excitation of the electromagnets in the
          above manner permits rotation of the output shaft in a
          predetermined direction. In this regard, it is noted that the
          electromagnets are excited to have a magnetic polarity
          opposite to that of the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet
          and that the magnetic circuit of the excited electromagnets is
          independent from those of adjacent electromagnets. Thus, the
          magnetic flux generated by the excited electromagnet is
          prevented from passing through magnetic circuits of adjacent
          electromagnets, which, if it occurs, might cause the
          electromagnets to be magnetized to have the same polarity as
          that of the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet.
          Accordingly, no objectionable force will be generated which
          might interfere with rotation of the output shaft.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to achieve the
          above object, the second invention comprises a permanent
          magnet mounted on a movable body arranged movably along a
          linear track, a magnetic body mounted on the permanent magnet,
          the magnetic body being subjected to a magnetic flux of the
          permanent magnet, a plurality of electromagnets spaced an
          appropriate distance along the linear track, said
          electromagnets having respective magnetic circuits which are
          independent of one another and excitation change-over means of
          the electromagnets, said excitation change-over means being
          adapted to sequentially magnetize one of the electromagnets
          which is positioned forwardly with respect to the direction of
          movement of the movable body, so as to impart to the excited
          electromagnet a magnetic polarity opposite to that of the
          magnetic pole of the permanent magnet, whereby a magnetic flux
          passing through the magnetic body converges in a predetermined
          direction so as to cause linear movement of the movable body.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the second
          invention, when the electromagnet positioned forwardly of the
          forward end of the movable body with regard to the direction
          of the movement of the movable body is excited, a magnetic
          field generated by the excited electromagnet and magnetic
          field generated by the permanent magnet interact with each
          other. Thus, a magnetic flux passing through the magnetic body
          converges toward the excited electromagnet, so as to displace
          the movable body a predetermined distance toward the excited
          electromagnet. When the movable body has been moved the
          predetermined distance, the movable body is positioned below
          the above excited electromagnet, and another electromagnet is
          positioned forwardly of the forward end of the movable body.
          When this occurs, excitation of the electromagnet positioned
          above the movable body is interrupted, and excitation of the
          electromagnet now positioned forwardly of the forward end of
          the movable body is initiated. Sequential excitation of the
          electromagnets in the above manner permits movement of the
          movable body in a predetermined direction. It is noted that no
          objectionable force which would interfere with movement of the
          movable body is created for the same reason as that explained
          in relation to the first invention.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF
          PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Preferred embodiments of the
          invention will be explained in detail below with reference to
          the attached drawings.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to a first
          embodiment of the invention, a rotational output shaft 11 is
          rotatably mounted between front and rear side plates 10a of a
          support member 10 through bearings 11a, as shown in FIGS. 1
          and 2. Permanent magnets 13 in a ring form are freely fitted
          over the output shaft at the axially opposite ends thereof and
          axially inward of the respective side plates 10a for movement
          with the rotational output shaft 11. The permanent magnets are
          magnetized in the axial direction. A magnetic body 14 is
          fixedly mounted between each of the side plates 10a for the
          rotational output shaft 11 and the permanent magnets 13. Each
          magnetic body 14 includes alternately disposed notches 14a and
          magnetic teeth 14b. It is noted that flux of the permanent
          magnets 13 passes through the respective magnetic bodies 14.
          FIG. 1 shows that the magnetic body 14 is provided, for
          example, with three notches 14a and three magnetic teeth 14b.
          The permanent magnets 13 and magnetic bodies 14 are disposed
          coaxially with the rotational output shaft 11. The
          corresponding permanent magnets 13 and magnetic bodies 14 are
          combined together by means of connecting means such as bolts
          15 so as to form a rotor 12. The rotor 12 is adapted to be
          rotated in unison with the rotational output shaft 11.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is noted that the support
          member 10 and rotational output shaft 11 are both made from a
          non-magnetic material. The support member 10 may be formed,
          for example, from stainless steel, aluminum alloys, or
          synthetic resins, while the rotational output shaft 11 may be
          formed from stainless steel, for example. Thus, the magnetic
          circuit formed by the permanent magnet 13 and magnetic body at
          one axial end of the rotational output shaft 11 and the
          magnetic circuit formed by the permanent magnet 13 and
          magnetic body at the opposite axial end of the output shaft
          are independent of one another. The magnetic bodies 14 may be
          formed from magnetic materials having a high magnetic
          permeability, such as various kinds of steel materials,
          silicon steel plate, permalloys, or the like.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A plurality of
          electromagnets 16a through 16l, constituting the stator, are
          disposed between the side plates 10a. The electromagnets are
          equidistantly and fixedly disposed around the magnetic
          materials 14 so that they surround the magnetic bodies. As
          shown in FIG. 1, twelve (12) electromagnets may be disposed.
          The magnetic circuit of each of the electromagnets 16a through
          16l is adapted to be independent from one another, so that no
          flux of magnetized electromagnets passes through the iron core
          of adjacent electromagnets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The iron core of each of the
          electromagnets 16a through 16l extends in parallel with the
          axial direction of the rotational output shaft 11, permanent
          magnets 13 and magnetic bodies 14. The axially opposite ends
          (magnetic polar portion) of each of the iron cores are
          oppositely disposed relative to the peripheral surface of the
          magnetic bodies with a slight gap therebetween.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some of the electromagnets
          16a through 16l are disposed at a position corresponding to
          boundary portions 14c1 through 14c6 between the notch 14a and
          the magnetic tooth 14b. For example, as shown in FIG. 1,
          electromagnets 16a, 16b, 16e, 16f, 16i and 16j are positioned
          in an opposite relationship to the boundary portions 14c1,
          14c2, 14c3, 14c4, 14c5, and 14c6, respectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIG. 5A shows a path of
          magnetic flux created by the permanent magnet 13 when the
          electromagnets are not excited or magnetized, while, FIG. 5B
          shows a path of magnetic flux created by the permanent magnet
          13 and a path of magnetic flux created by the windings of the
          electromagnets when the electromagnets are magnetized. As will
          be clear from FIGS. 5A and 5B, both paths of magnetic flux
          represent a uni-polar distribution in which N-pole or S-pole
          evenly appears at the opposite axial ends. When the
          electromagnets are magnetized, the magnetic fields of the
          permanent magnet and electromagnets cooperate or interact with
          each other so as to generate a rotational torque.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Excitation change-over means
          17 for sequentially exciting or magnetizing the electromagnets
          16a through 16l is basically consisted of a conventional
          excitation circuit for supplying direct current to each
          windings of the electromagnets 16a through 16l. In this
          embodiment, the change-over portion for changing electric feed
          to the electromagnets 16a through 16l includes a plurality of
          optical sensors 18 and a light shield plate 19 for turning the
          optical sensors ON and OFF.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The optical sensors 18 are
          spaced apart from one another with a space therebetween for
          permitting the light shield plate 19 to pass through a light
          emitting element and a light receiving element. The optical
          sensors 18 are disposed in the outer surface of one of the
          side plates 10a in equidistal relationship in the
          circumferential direction thereof, so that they are positioned
          to correspond to the electromagnets 16a through 16l (for
          example, the optical sensor 18 is shown to be disposed in the
          outer surface of the rear side plate). The light shielding
          plate 19 is fixed to the rotational output shaft 11 at the end
          thereof, the light shielding plate protruding from the rear
          side plate 10a on which the optical sensors are disposed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the illustrated
          embodiment, when a particular optical sensor 18 is blocked by
          the light shielding plate 19, the electromagnet corresponding
          to such optical sensor 18 is supplied with electricity.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The operation of the first
          embodiment described above will be explained with reference to
          FIGS. 4A through 4H.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the electromagnets 16a
          through 16l are not supplied with electricity by means of the
          excitation changeover means 17, the electromagnets 16c, 16d,
          16g, 16h, 16k and 16l opposed to the magnetic teeth 14b with a
          small gap therebetween merely serve as a magnetic material
          disposed within the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 13
          (refer to shaded portion in FIG. 4A), so as to absorb the
          magnetic teeth 14b thereto, and the rotor 12 remains
          stationary.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the electromagnets 16a,
          16e and 16i positioned adjacent to the boundary portion 14c1,
          14c3 and 14c5 formed between the respective notches 14a and
          the magnetic teeth 14b are magnetized or excited
          simultaneously by means of the excitation change-over means,
          as shown in FIG. 4B, the magnetic field of the permanent
          magnet 13 and the magnetic fields of the electromagnets 16a,
          16e and 16i interact with each other, so that a magnetic flux
          14d passing through the magnetic body 14 instantaneously
          converges to the electromagnets 16a, 16e, and 16i. In this
          way, the rotor 12 is imparted with a rotational torque in a
          direction in which the magnetic flux 14d will be widened,
          i.e., counterclockwise direction as viewed in FIG. 4B.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIGS. 4C through 4G
          illustrate change in the width of the magnetic flux 14d in
          accordance with rotation of the rotor 12. When the width of
          the magnetic flux becomes maximized, i.e., when only the
          magnetic teeth 14b are opposed to the electromagnets 16a, 16e
          and 16i, while the notches 14a are displaced completely away
          from the electromagnets 16a, 16e and 16i, the width of the
          magnetic flux 14d is maximized. Thus, an absorption force
          acting between the permanent magnet 13 and the electromagnets
          16a, 16e and 16i is maximized. On the other hand, the
          rotational torque acting on the rotor 12 becomes zero.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before the rotational torque
          acting on the rotor 12 becomes zero, i.e., as the boundary
          portion 14c1, 13c3 and 14c5 approach another electromagnets
          16b, 16f and 16j positioned forwardly in regard to the
          rotational direction, respectively, the electromagnets 16a,
          16e and 16i are demagnetized and the electromagnets 16b, 16f
          and 16j are excited or magnetized by means of the excitation
          change-over means 17. Thus, the magnetic flux 14d converges
          toward the electromagnets 16b, 16f and 16j, as shown in FIG.
          4H, so that a rotational torque acts upon the rotor, as
          described above.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then, the electromagnets
          16c, 16g and 16k are excited. When the boundary portion 14c1,
          14c3 and 14c5 approach another electromagnets 16d, 16h and 16l
          positioned forwardly in regard to the rotational direction, in
          response to rotation of the rotor 12, the electromagnets 16c,
          16g and 16k are de-magnetized and the electromagnets 16d, 16h
          and 16l are energized or excited.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As explained above,
          sequential excitation or energizing of the electromagnets 16a
          through 16l causes interaction between the magnetic flux of
          the permanent magnet 13 and the electromagnets 16a through
          16l, whereby a rotational torque is applied to the rotor 12.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When this occurs, a
          rotational torque is generated between one of the magnetic
          poles of the permanent magnet 13 (for example, N-pole) and the
          magnetic poles (for example, S-poles) of the electromagnets
          16a through 16l positioned at their respective axial ends. A
          rotational torque is also generated between the other magnetic
          pole (for example, S-pole) of the permanent magnet 13 and the
          other magnetic pole (for example, N-pole) of each of the
          electromagnets 16a through 16l positioned at the other axial
          end.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is noted that, at one
          magnetic pole, for example N-pole, of the permanent magnet 13,
          certain of the electromagnets 16a through 16l are magnetized
          only to S-pole, thus preventing formation of a magnetic
          circuit, due to passage of magnetic flux from the excited
          electromagnets through adjacent electromagnets, which tends to
          bring about N-poles magnetically similar to the permanent
          magnet 13. It is also noted that, at the other magnetic pole,
          for example S-pole, of the permanent magnet 13, certain of the
          electromagnets are magnetized only to N-pole, thus preventing
          formation of a magnetic circuit, due to passage of magnetic
          flux from the excited electromagnets through adjacent
          electromagnets, which tends to bring about S-poles
          magnetically similar to the permanent magnet 13. The magnetic
          flux of the permanent magnet 13 passes through the magnetic
          bodies 14 so as to be converged to the excited electromagnets
          (refer to the magnetic flux 14d shown in FIGS. 4 through 4H),
          thus forming dead zones, through which no magnetic flux
          passes, in the magnetic bodies 14 at a position opposite to
          the un-excited electromagnets. Accordingly, no force is
          generated which tends to prevent rotation of the rotor 12.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of electric energy
          applied to the electromagnets 16a through 16l, substantially
          all the electric energy having been applied thereto is
          consumed so as to effectively contribute to the rotation of
          the rotor 12. On the other hand, and in view of magnetic
          energy of the permanent magnet 18, substantially all the
          magnetic energy is effectively utilized to contribute to the
          rotation of the rotor 12.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is also noted that, since
          the notches 14a and the magnetic teeth 14b are alternately
          disposed in the outer periphery of the magnetic materials 14
          in an acute angle configuration seen in FIGS. 4a-4h, and the
          electromagnets are disposed at a position each corresponding
          to the boundary portions between the notches and the magnetic
          teeth, it is possible for the line of the magnetic force,
          generated in each gap between the boundary portions and the
          electromagnets when the electromagnets are excited, to be
          inclined to a substantial degree, so that a sufficient degree
          of rotational torque may be obtained upon initial excitation
          of the electromagnets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The result obtained during
          an actual running test of the motor according to the first
          embodiment is shown in FIGS. 1 to 3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Pure steel was used as a
          magnetic material. The magnetic material was 30 mm in
          thickness and formed to have magnetic teeth of 218 mm diameter
          and notches of 158 mm diameter. A ferritic magnet was used as
          a permanent magnet. The magnetic force of the magnet was 1,000
          gauss. Electric power of 19.55 watts was applied to the
          electromagnets at 17 volts and 1.15 amperes. Under the above
          condition, a rotational number of 100 rpm, a torque of 60.52
          Kg-cm and an output of 62,16 watt were obtained.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Alternative embodiments will
          be explained below with reference to FIGS. 6 through 9.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The modified embodiment
          shown in FIG. 6 is similar to the motor according to the first
          embodiment as shown in FIGS. 1 through 3, with the exception
          that each electromagnet 160 to form the stator comprises an
          iron core 161 having a pair of legs 162 disposed at opposite
          axial ends thereof and extending toward the outer periphery of
          the magnetic bodies (outer periphery of the magnetic teeth
          14b), each of the legs being wound with respective coils 163.
          The remaining components are basically identical to those in
          the motor shown in FIGS. 1 through 3. In FIG. 6, the
          components similar to those in FIGS. 1 through 3 are denoted
          by like reference numerals. It is noted that each coil 163 is
          supplied with electricity so that one leg 162 disposed at one
          axial end (left-hand side in FIG. 6) of each of the iron cores
          161 is magnetized to be S-pole which is magnetically opposite
          to the magnetic pole (N-pole) of the confronting magnetic body
          14, while the leg 162 disposed at the other end of each of the
          iron cores is magnetized to be N-pole which is magnetically
          opposite to the magnetic pole (S-pole) of the confronting
          magnetic body 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to this modified
          embodiment, it is possible to significantly reduce leakage of
          the magnetic flux created by the electromagnets 160 in gaps
          each defined between the surfaces of the magnetic poles of the
          electromagnets 160 and the outer peripheries of the magnetic
          teeth 14b of the magnetic bodies 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An alternative embodiment
          shown in FIG. 7 is similar to the motor shown in FIGS. 1
          through 8, with the exception that: an additional magnetic
          body 14 is mounted on the rotational output shaft 11 at the
          axial midpoint thereof; two permanent magnets 130 are freely
          mounted on the output shaft 11 in a manner shown in FIG. 6;
          and each iron core 165 is provided with three legs 166
          positioned at the opposite axial ends and midpoint thereof and
          extending toward the respective outer periphery of the
          magnetic bodies, with the legs 166 positioned at axial
          opposite ends of the respective iron cores 165 being wound
          with a coil 167, whereby forming electromagnets 164. The
          remaining components are substantially the same as those in
          the motor shown in FIGS. 1 through 3. It is noted here that
          the rotational output shaft 11 may be formed from magnetic
          materials or non-magnetic materials.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in FIG. 7, each of
          the coils 167 is supplied with electricity so that the legs
          166 positioned at the opposite axial ends of each of the iron
          cores 164 is magnetized to be S-pole which is magnetically
          opposite to the magnetic pole (N-pole) of the confronting
          magnetic body 14. By this, the leg 166 positioned at the
          midpoint of the iron core 165 is magnetized to be N-pole which
          is magnetically opposite to the magnetic pole (S-pole) of the
          confronting magnetic body 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this embodiment, it is
          also possible, as in the modified embodiment shown in FIG. 6,
          to significantly reduce leakage of magnetic flux generated by
          the electromagnets 164. In addition to this, it is also
          possible to obtain a rotational torque between the leg 166
          positioned at the midpoint of the iron core and the magnetic
          body 14 positioned at the axial midpoint of the rotational
          output shaft 11. Accordingly, a higher rotational torque may
          be obtained with the same amount of electrical consumption, in
          comparison with the embodiment shown in FIG. 6.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further embodiment shown
          in FIG. 8 is similar to the motor shown in FIGS. 1 though 3,
          with the exception that a permanent magnet magnetized in the
          radial direction, rather than in the axial direction is
          employed. The permanent magnet 131 of an annular configuration
          has, for example, N-pole in the outer periphery and S-pole in
          the inner periphery. The permanent magnet 131 is received
          within a cavity 14e provided in the respective magnetic body
          14 at the intermediate portion thereof as disposed at the
          opposite axial ends of the rotational output shaft 11. The
          remaining components are identical to those in the motor shown
          in FIGS. 1 to 3. The components identical to those in the
          motor shown in FIGS. 1 to 3 are denoted by the same reference
          numerals. It is noted that this embodiment may also employ the
          electromagnets 160 shown in FIG. 6.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In this embodiment, the

          materials, rather than non-magnetic materials.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further embodiment shown in
          FIG. 9 is similar to the motor shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, with
          three exceptions. The first exception is that a permanent
          magnet magnetized in the radial direction, rather than in the
          axial direction is employed. The permanent magnet 131 having
          an annular configuration has, for example, N-pole in the outer
          periphery and S-pole in the inner periphery. The permanent
          magnet 131 is received within a cavity 14e provided in the
          respective magnetic body 14 at the intermediate portion
          thereof as disposed at the axial opposite ends of the
          rotational output shaft 11. The second exception is that an
          additional magnetic body 14 is disposed at the axial midpoint
          of the rotational output shaft 11. Finally, the third
          exception is that the iron core 165 is provided with three
          legs 166 disposed at the axial opposite ends and the midpoint
          thereof, respectively, and extending toward the outer
          periphery of the magnetic body 14, with the legs positioned at
          the opposite axial ends being wound with respective coils so
          as to form an electromagnet 164. The remaining components are
          identical to those in the motor shown in FIGS. 1 to 3. The
          components identical to those in the motor shown in FIGS. 1 to
          3 are denoted by the same reference numerals.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in FIG. 9, each
          coil is supplied with electricity so that the legs 166
          disposed at opposite axial ends of the iron core 165 are
          magnetized to be S-pole which is magnetically opposite to the
          magnetic pole (N-pole) of the confronting magnetic body 14. By
          this, the leg 166 disposed at the midpoint of the iron core
          165 is magnetized to be N-pole which is magnetically opposite
          to the magnetic pole (S-pole) of the confronting magnetic body
          14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to the embodiment
          described above, the rotational output shaft 11 may be formed
          from magnetic materials rather than non-magnetic materials.
          With this embodiment, it is possible to obtain the same effect
          as that obtained with the embodiment shown in FIG. 7.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Further the alternative
          embodiments shown in FIGS. 10A to 10C are similar to the motor
          shown in FIGS. 1 to 3, with the exception that: like the
          embodiments shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, an annular permanent
          magnet 131 is employed which is received in a cavity 140e
          provided in the central portion 140 of the magnetic body 140;
          the magnetic body 140 is provided with notches 140a in the
          outer peripheral portion thereof, so that the gap G between
          the magnetic body 140 and the electromagnet becomes gradually
          broader in the rotational direction of the rotor; and the
          electromagnets confronting to the gap G with an intermediate
          width as positioned between the electromagnets confronting to
          the gap G with a narrower width and the electromagnets
          confronting to the gap G with a broader width are excited or
          magnetized in a sequential manner. The remaining components
          are identical to those in the motor shown in FIGS. 1 to 3. In
          FIGS. 10A to 10C, the components identical to those in FIGS. 1
          to 3 are denoted by the same reference numerals. In this
          regard, it should be noted that reference numeral 140d
          indicates magnetic flux passing through the magnetic body 140,
          so as to illustrate converged condition of such magnetic flux
          upon excitation of the electromagnets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the embodiment Just
          described above, it is possible to rotate the rotor in the
          counter clockwise direction as viewed in FIG. 10A, for
          example, by exciting the electromagnets 16a, 16d, 16g and 16j,
          as shown in FIG. 10A, then, the electromagnets 16c, 16f, 16i
          and 16l, as shown in FIG. 10B, and then the electromagnets
          16b, 16e, 16h and 16k. According to this embodiment, it is
          possible to obtain a stable rotational force, as well as a
          higher rotational torque, even though number of rotations is
          reduced in comparison with the above embodiment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in FIG. 10A, four
          (4) notches 140a are provided. It is noted, however, that two
          (2) or three (3) notches may be provided. It is also possible
          to attach the magnetic material 140 to the rotational output
          shaft 11 in an eccentric manner in its entirety, without
          providing notches 140a.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIGS. 11A through 11H are
          illustrative diagrams showing the operation of the second
          embodiment of the invention when developed into a linear motor
          type.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">According to this
          embodiment, a movable body 21 is adapted to be moved along a
          linear track 20 of a roller conveyor type. The track includes
          a frame on which a plurality of rollers are disposed in
          parallel relationship relative one another. A permanent magnet
          22 is mounted on the movable body 21. A magnetic body 23 of a
          plate-like configuration is fixed to the permanent magnet 22
          in the upper surface thereof, so as to form a movable element.
          It is noted that magnetic flux from the permanent magnet 22
          passes through the magnetic body 23. A plurality of
          electromagnets 25a, 25b, 25c, 25d and so on are disposed above
          the movable element 24 along the linear track and in a
          parallel relationship relative one another. The electromagnets
          constitute a stator 25. Magnetic circuits of the
          electromagnets 25a, 25b, 25c, 25d, and so on, are independent
          from one another, so that the electromagnets are magnetized in
          a sequential manner by means of excitation change-over means
          (not shown), so as to have a magnetic polarity opposite to the
          magnetic pole of the permanent magnet 22. Power output shafts
          21a are attached to a side surface of the movable body 21.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Operation of the above
          second embodiment will be explained below.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in FIG. 11A, and
          when no electricity is supplied to the electromagnets, the
          electromagnets 25a and 25b positioned Just above the movable
          element 24 are subjected to magnetic field of the permanent
          magnet 22 (refer to shaded portion in FIG. 11A). Thus, such
          electromagnets magnetically absorb the magnetic body 23
          thereto, so that the movable element 24 remains to be stopped.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in FIG. 11B, and
          when the electromagnet 25c, positioned forwardly with respect
          to the direction in which the movable element 24 moves, is
          excited, the magnetic field of the permanent magnet 22 and the
          magnetic field of the electromagnet 25c interact with each
          other, so that magnetic flux 23a passing through the magnetic
          body 23 converges instantaneously toward the electromagnet
          25c. By this, the movable element 24 is magnetically absorbed
          to the electromagnet 25c, so that it is moved along the linear
          track 20 under the propulsive force acting in the direction in
          which the width of the magnetic flux 23a becomes broader,
          i.e., in the direction of an arrow mark shown in FIG. 11B.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIGS. 11C through 11E
          illustrate a change in width of the magnetic flux 23a in
          response to movement of the movable element 24. At the point
          at which the width of the magnetic flux 23a becomes maximized,
          i.e., when the forward end of the magnetic material 23 of the
          movable element 24 is positioned Just before passing by the
          electromagnet 25c, the width of the flux 23 becomes maximized.
          At this time, magnetic absorption acting between the permanent
          magnet 22 and the electromagnet 25c becomes maximized, but the
          propulsive force acting on the movable element becomes zero.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before the propulsive force
          acting on the movable element 24 becomes completely zero,
          i.e., when the forward end of the magnetic body 23 of the
          movable element 24 is about to pass the electromagnet 25d, the
          excitation changeover means is actuated so as to stop
          excitation of the electromagnet 25c and so as to initiate
          excitation of the electromagnet 25d. Thus, the magnetic flux
          23a converges to the electromagnet 25d, as shown in FIG. 11F,
          so that a propulsive force acts on the movable element 24, as
          in the previous stage.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Subsequently, and in
          response to further movement of the movable element 24, the
          width of the magnetic flux 23a is reduced as shown in FIGS.
          11G and 11H, and thus a similar operation will be repeated.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The sequential excitation of
          the electromagnets, as explained above, causes interaction
          between the magnetic fields of permanent magnet 22 and
          electromagnets, whereby a propulsive force is applied to the
          movable element 24.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is noted that, when the
          magnetic polarity of the permanent magnet 22 confronting the
          electromagnets is assumed to be N-pole, the electromagnet 25c
          is magnetized solely to be S-pole, so as to prevent formation
          of a magnetic circuit by virtue of passage of magnetic flux
          from the electromagnet 25c through to the adjacent
          electromagnets 25b and 25d, which formation, if it occurs,
          tends to cause the polarity of the electromagnets to be N-pole
          identical to the magnetic pole of the permanent magnet 22.
          Accordingly, and in a manner similar to that in the first
          embodiment, no force is generated which tends to interfere
          with movement of the movable element 24.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the present invention, a
          plurality of electromagnets serving as a stator are so
          arranged that their respective magnetic circuits become
          independent from one another. The electromagnets are also
          arranged so that they are solely magnetized or excited to have
          a magnetic polarity opposite to the magnetic pole of the
          confronting permanent magnet. Thus, each electromagnet is
          prevented from becoming magnetized to the same polarity as
          that of the permanent magnet, which may occur when magnetic
          flux from a particular electromagnet passes through to
          adjacent electromagnets. Accordingly, no force will be exerted
          which tends to interfere with the intended movement of a rotor
          or a movable element. As a result, electric energy applied to
          the electromagnets may be efficiently utilized, while, at the
          same time, magnetic energy contained in the permanent magnet
          may-also be efficiently utilized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The coils constituting the
          electromagnets are consistently supplied with electric current
          with the same polarity, without any change, so that heating of
          coils may be prevented. Further, it is possible to obviate the
          problems of vibration and noise which might occur due to a
          repulsive force being generated when polarity of an electric
          current supplied to the coils is changed.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just a note in response to
          your suggestion:&nbsp; Most Japanese are in fact peace-loving
          folks the way you pointed out.&nbsp; The problem in the energy
          field seems to be that the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) is seizing
          and stopping all Japanese-developed overunity systems.&nbsp;
          There are at least three of these Japanese overunity systems
          that I'm aware of, being held off the market. Control of one
          of the Japanese systems, the Kawai system, was seized right
          here in the U.S. in 1996, in my physical presence and the
          Board of Directors of our little company.&nbsp; We had reached
          an agreement with Kawai to market his engine worldwide, set up
          a development laboratory here in Huntsville for further
          developments, and get on with it.&nbsp; We reached that
          agreement on Thursday evening that week, after negotiations
          most of the week.&nbsp; That night, a jet arrived post-haste
          from Los Angeles, with a special Japanese on board, and the
          next morning Kawai and party were in fear and trembling -- and
          just hung their heads in shame and great disgrace.&nbsp; One
          of the individuals accompanying the newcomer had the typical
          markings and tip of a finger missing.&nbsp; At that point,
          everything was finished.&nbsp; We shipped the two Kawai
          engines we had received, out of here to Los Angeles.&nbsp; The
          Japanese party left, and that was that.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Kawai engine switches
          the magnetic flux path at the opportune moment, by a very
          clever mechanical arrangement augmented by photo-coupled EM
          switching, and eliminates most of the back mmf.&nbsp; This
          effectively doubles the COP of the magnetic motor to which it
          is adroitly applied.&nbsp; If the motor is, say, 0.4 (normal
          inefficient motor), you will get a COP = 0.8, but not
          overunity.&nbsp; But if you start with a high efficiency
          magnetic motor (as made by Hitachi and others) of, say, COP =
          0.7 or 0.8, you will get a motor with COP = 1.4 or 1.6.&nbsp;
          The latter can then be close-looped to power itself and a load
          simultaneously.&nbsp; Kawai personally informed me that he
          already had a successful closed loop motor running and had
          filed another patent in Japan on it.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is a flash release of
          information on the operational principles of three overunity
          electromagnetic engines that are in the successful prototype
          stage or advanced engineering development. My purpose is to
          provide an explanation of the master overunity mechanisms
          utilized by these devices, and to alert researchers and
          experimenters that the mechanisms are well-established in the
          conventional scientific literature, though still but little
          known to the majority of electrical engineers.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My series of articles[1] on
          overunity engines and mechanisms, for The Virtual Times,
          Internet node www.hsv.com, covers these three engines, the
          master regauging mechanism, the multivalued potential, and
          several other overunity mechanisms or proposed mechanisms. The
          magazine has just released my latest article over the
          Internet, entitled "The Master Principle of EM Overunity and
          the Japanese Overunity engines: A New Pearl Harbor?" The
          article is heavily referenced and gives a thorough explanation
          of the three overunity devices: (1) Johnson's nonlinear
          boosting permanent magnet gate, [2 ,3] (2) the Takahashi
          engine, and (3) the Kawai engine.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All Three Engines Use
            Regauging of Magnetic Scalar Potential ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All three devices freely
          asymmetrically regauge (A-regauge) (recharge or discharge, as
          required) the magnetic scalar potential energy of the device
          in a selected A-regauging sector.[4 ,5] Johnson uses a
          multivalued magnetic scalar potential to accomplish this
          A-regauging completely by means of a nonlinear permanent
          magnet rotor and nonlinear permanent magnet stator, without
          any electrical input. Takahashi and Kawai both use external
          electrical input to create or alter a magnetic scalar
          potential in the A-regauging section.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conservative and
            Nonconservative Fields and Multivalued Potential (MVP) ~</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Normal engine designers work
          with conservative fields, which require single-valued
          potentials. (See Figure 1). They consider A-regauging
          operations, as well as the multivalued potential (MVP), to be
          nuisances, since A-regauging may immediately involve
          nonconservative electromagnetic fields (see Figure 2). Most of
          the favored "engine design" laws and trusted circuit laws
          "blow up" during A-regauging, whether by electrical injection
          or the MVP region. So electrical power engineers just design
          conventional electromagnetic engines to avoid the MVP or
          eliminate it. On the other hand, if one deliberately evokes
          and properly uses the free "jump" of stored potential energy
          that occurs in an MVP-containing sector of an engine, a
          standard gauge-theoretic analysis will show that one can
          legitimately have overunity coefficient of performance from
          that engine. (See Figure 3). I first pointed this out in
          1980.[6 ]</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Multivalued Potential
            (MVP) Frequently Occurs in Nature ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The multivalued potential
          occurs widely in nature,[7] and particularly in magnetics. In
          fact, it is quite often the rule rather than the exception.
          Still, the MVP is usually ignored by conventional engine
          designers, and many electrical engineers have hardly heard of
          it. S-regauging [8] of the magnetic potential changes only the
          magnetic potential; the force fields themselves need not be
          changed. A-regauging also creates additional force fields,
          which may be used to assist the system's operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is easiest to A-regauge a
          magnetic scalar potential on a rotary electromagnetic engine
          by simply energizing a coil. If the coil is oriented radially,
          its associated B-field will not perform radial work on the
          rotor. Any tangential field resulting from creation of the
          magnetic scalar potential will either be (i)
          rotor-accelerating, or (ii) rotor decelerating. Obviously one
          wants the A-regauging of the magnetic scalar potential to
          either (iii) accelerate the rotor, or (iv) go to zero so as to
          zero out the back-drag. So one will adjust the polarity and
          strength of the magnetic scalar potential created by the
          radial coil accordingly.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For those unfamiliar with
          modern gauge theory, we point out that this discussion is
          completely consistent with Maxwell's equations, which formed
          the first true gauge theory. It is simply a matter of
          preference by the electrodynamicists, e.g., that the
          indefinite potentials of the Maxwellian equations are usually
          just symmetrically regauged. By use of an MVP region and/or an
          A-regauging region in an engine, however, additional "free"
          force terms are created and utilized by the engine designer to
          accomplish COP&gt;1.0.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Regauging is Work-Free,
            and Can Produce Additional Orthogonal Fields ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Work requires the
          translation of a force through a distance. Since the
          A-regauging change creates additional forces, the change in
          the force fields already present can be helpful. Rigorously it
          does not require extra work to A-regauge the system. However,
          the regauging is free to create any number of additional force
          fields at right angles to those already present before the
          regauging, depending upon the relationships between the
          regauged potential and various potentials in adjacent
          locations at right angles nearby. Let us examine that more
          closely in Figure 4.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rigorously, W = Fds. That
          is, work is done by a translating force only along the
          direction of translation. Ancillary force field B2, formed at
          a right angle to the radial force field B1 in stator coil A,
          can do tangential work on rotor C without any additional
          "drain" or effect upon the radial coil other than the normal
          drain utilized to form the primary B1 field. Simply put,
          radial forces do not perform work at right angles
          (tangentially) to their direction. However, at the fixed
          stator point S1 where radial magnetic force B1 exists, a
          magnetic scalar potential F1 also exists. At the nextmost
          tangential stator position S2, a scalar potential F2 exists.
          If F1-F2 0, then a tangential magnetic field B2 exists between
          S1 and S2. By adjusting the strength and polarity of F1,
          magnetic field B2 can be made to assist the rotation of rotor
          C, in what would otherwise be a "back drag" or decelerating
          sector. In short, the tangential back-drag force normally
          existing between F1-F2 in the normally-decelerating sector can
          be reversed and made to accelerate the rotor C in that sector,
          without requiring excess work in stator coil A or in stator
          electromagnet assembly P when the strength and polarity of F1
          are regauged. In short, one can A-regauge in the normal
          back-drag region of the rotation, and reverse what would
          normally be back-drag into positive acceleration.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Both Johnson and Takahashi do
          this in their engines. Johnson A-regauges via a complex
          assembly of stator magnets (see Figure 5) that provides an
          MVP. Takahashi (see Figure 6) A-regauges by utilizing a radial
          coil with a weak current through it, where the current is
          sharply broken by ignition points to provide a "nearly free,"
          momentarily high magnetic scalar potential and thereby perform
          the regauging nearly "for free."</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A-regauging a sector of a
          rotary electromagnetic engine is just like refueling a car by
          putting gas in its gas tank: During the regauging operation,
          the system is an "open" system receiving an injection of
          excess potential (stored) energy from the surrounding vacuum
          -- except in the electromagnetic case the refueling is free.
          (See Figure 3). The excess stored energy injected into the
          system from the "refueling" jump due to A-regauging, can then
          be dissipated in the load during the remainder of the rotary
          cycle -- just as a refueled automobile can dissipate its
          additional fuel energy in powering the car, until it is time

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Johnson

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 5 diagrammatically
          illustrates the operation of the force-producing magnetic gate
          in Johnson's permanent magnet motor. As Johnson has shown, by
          using a multivalued potential in his gates, a rotor magnet is
          attracted into a highly nonlinear stator gate region where the
          MVP is located. When it enters the MVP, the rotor encounters a
          dramatic jump in stator's magnetic scalar potential with a
          change of polarity. In turn, this produces a sudden
          accelerating tangential force in the region which would
          otherwise have been the back-drag region. This accelerating
          force propels and accelerates the rotor magnet on through the
          gate and out of it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Rigorous force meter
          measurements taken at 0.01 second intervals prove that this
          occurs as the rotor passes through Johnson's gate. A
          representative plot of such force meter measurements is shown
          as the dotted line in Figure 3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Johnson thus uses a highly
          nonlinear magnet assembly of special design to create an MVP
          in his gate. The MVP produces a "magnetic potential jump" and
          a reversal of the (otherwise) exiting back-drag on the rotor.
          In short, Johnson causes the system to be automatically
          "refueled" in the A-regauging sector, so that it can continue
          to rotate and power a load.</font> </p>

      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 6 diagrammatically
          shows the scheme of operation of the Takahashi engine. Here a
          set of permanent magnets, each at an angle to the various
          radial lines of the device, comprises a slightly widening
          spiral stator that is "almost" circular but not quite. A
          circular rotor with a sector magnet is mounted inside this
          spiral stator. An end gap exists in the stator as shown, so
          that the stator is not a completely closed ring. The direction
          of rotation for the rotor is clockwise as shown. For
          demonstration of the principle, the beginning air gap is 0.1
          mm and the ending air gap is 5 mm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A permanent magnet is
          mounted along the perimeter of an angular sector of the rotor.
          It is magnetized, say, with the north pole facing radially
          outwards, and the south pole facing radially inside. In the
          stator, the permanent magnet north poles are facing radially
          in toward the rotor, but at an angle, and the south poles are
          facing radially outside but at an angle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus tangentially the north
          pole of the rotor is in a nonlinear magnetic field, and it
          will experience a clockwise force and acceleration from
          position 1 (where the air gap is the minimum) to position 2
          (where the air gap reaches maximum).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If this were all there was
          to it, the Takahashi motor would not be overunity because the
          tangential field is conservative. When the rotor crossed the
          end gap in the stator between point 2 and point 1, very sharp
          and dynamic braking work would be done back upon the rotor
          magnet by the field of the stator magnets at point 1. This
          braking work would precisely equal the amount of dynamic
          acceleration work that was done in accelerating the rotor
          magnet from position 1 to position 2, in accordance with a
          distortion of Figure 1. For an absolutely frictionless machine
          with no losses, the coefficient of performance (COP) would be
          1.0. Since any real machine will have at least some friction
          and drag, the actual COP would be less than 1.0.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let us now utilize the notion
          of the magnetostatic scalar potential to examine a new
          situation in the end gap.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Technically, let us regard a
          single unit north pole in the rotor, going from position 1 to
          position 2 (the acceleration cycle, where the engine will
          deliver shaft horsepower against a load), and then from
          position 2 to position 1 (where the magnetostatic scalar
          potential must be A-regauged to equal or exceed the potential
          at position 1, in order for the rotor to continue unabated or
          even further accelerate. I.e., in the separation gap, a
          A-regauging operation must be done so that the "stator to
          inner" potential is increased equal to or exceeding the
          "stator to inner" potential of position 1.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In normal machines, the
          A-regauging part of the cycle is conventionally where the
          design engineer forcibly inputs energy from outside the system
          to do brute physical work on the machine to forcibly wrestle
          its energy storage back to initial conditions. In the past
          engineers have automatically assumed COP&lt;1.0 without
          exception, since their forcible RESET work was always equal to
          the maximum theoretical energy output to the load during the
          motor part of the cycle from point 1 to point 2, plus any
          losses in the "wrestling" process and in the machine itself.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So we simply must perform
          the A-regauging or RESET of the system's energy storage,
          without performing tangential "back-drag" work on the rotor.
          In other words, we must refuse to engage in the conventional
          "wrestling match." For that purpose, an electromagnet is
          utilized to fill the end gap in the stator, arranged so that
          when it is activated its north pole will face radially inward.
          A small current activates the coil weakly, through a
          distributor with breaker points. At the proper timing (i.e.,
          when the rotor is directly opposite the electromagnet
          polepiece, a set of ignition points is sharply broken in the
          circuit with the coil of the electromagnet. Momentarily, a
          very high potential will appear at the end of the coil as the
          collapsing field is highly amplified and trying to sustain the
          previous current in its previous direction. The end result is
          the formation of a strong magnetostatic scalar potential
          (pole), of north polarity, on the stator polepiece facing the
          rotor. Note that no radial work can be done on either the
          stator polepiece or the rotor by gradients of this high
          potential, because they cannot move radially.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The potential in the end gap
          is now higher than the potential at position one. Consequently
          a clockwise tangential force field exists between the end gap
          potential and the lower potential at position one. This force
          cannot do "back-drag" work on the fixed stator. It cannot
          oppose the radial B-field, because it is orthogonal to it. An
          assisting clockwise tangential force therefore appears upon
          the rotor, and the rotor is accelerated and "boosted" out of
          the stator gap and back past point 1. At that point the
          electromagnet has lost its potential, but the engine has now
          been A-regauged and again is in the clockwise acceleration
          field of the rotor-stator permanent magnets.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In short, the rotor
          perceived the sudden change of magnetostatic scalar potential
          from the electromagnet in the stator gap as a pseudo-MVP, and
          the system received a sharp influx of potential energy,
          without work except for that lost in the electromagnet
          circuitry. Since that loss can be made quite nominal by
          conventional electronic practices, the engine permissibly
          provides COP&gt;1.0. It can therefore be rigged to power
          itself and a load simultaneously.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Placed in an electric
          vehicle with necessary switching circuitry and ancillary
          equipment, a properly designed Takahashi engine and its
          derivatives should be capable of starting from a single
          ordinary battery, then powering the vehicle agilely, powering
          the accessories, and recharging its own battery -- all three
          simultaneously.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 7B, electromagnets
          16a, 16e, and 16d are energized. The shaded area shows the
          sharp convergence of the flux from magnet 13 through polepiece
          14 and the edge of teeth 14b. Since the electromagnets are
          magnetized in attracting mode, the rotor will experience a
          torque tending to widen the flux path from magnet 13 to the
          activated electromagnets. Thus a clockwise torque exists on
          the rotor, and it will start to rotate clockwise.[10] Note
          also that each electromagnet is operating independently of the
          other two.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As shown in Figure 7C, 7D,
          7E, and 7F the rotation of the rotor continues clockwise,
          widening the connecting flux path to the three activated
          electromagnets. During this time the torque on the rotor is
          clockwise.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In Figure 7G, the flux path
          to the activated electromagnets is fully widened. Also, the
          leading edges of the three teeth are just beginning to enter
          the domains of the next electromagnets 16j, 16b, and 16f. This
          is getting similar to the original position shown in Figure
          7B. Consequently, the electromagnets 16i, 16a, and 16e are
          deactivated, and electromagnets 16j, 16b, and 16f are
          activated. Asymmetrically, this regauges and resets the engine
          back to the original starting position in Figure 7B. The
          action cycle begins anew. As can be seen, in each complete
          rotation of the shaft, each of the three teeth of the rotor
          will be A-regauged 12 times. So 36 total
          A-regaugings/resettings/refuelings are utilized per shaft
          rotation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In each stator coil, at
          energization a tooth is just entering that coil. Energized in
          attractive mode with respect to the ring magnet around the
          shaft, the flux in the polepiece "jumps" from fully widened
          flux (and small or vanishing radial torque on the rotor) to
          angled and narrowed flux (with full radial clockwise torque on
          the rotor). As previously explained, the narrowed flux and its
          angle exert a clockwise accelerating tangential component of
          force upon the rotor. Each coil is de-energized prior to
          beginning to exert radial back emf (which it would do if it
          remained energized as the trailing edge crossed it and again
          narrowed the flux path). So the Kawai engine uses normal
          magnetic attraction to accelerate the rotor for a small
          distance, then A-regauges to zero attraction to eliminate the
          back-drag portion of the attractive field. It A-regauges to
          zero as the "RESET" condition.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For appreciable power and
          smoothness, the Kawai engine uses an extensive number of
          A-regaugings per axle rotation, being 36 times on each end, or
          a total of 72 for the two ends. The forcefield of each coil,
          accompanying its increased magnetostatic scalar potential, is
          oriented radially inward, so that radial work cannot be done
          by the coil on the rotor because the rotor does not translate
          radially. Advantage is taken of the initial clockwise
          acceleration force initially produced, and A-regauging
          eliminates the counterclockwise drag or "decelerating" force
          that would be produced without the A-regauging.</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">The major benefits of the
          Kawai arrangement are that (i) a large number of A-regaugings
          occurs for a single rotation of the rotor assembly, enabling
          high power-to-weight ratio, (ii) each electromagnet is
          energized only when positively contributing to the clockwise
          torque that drives the rotor, and (iii) each coil is
          de-energized to A-regauge the system during those periods when
          the coil would otherwise create back-drag (counterclockwise
          torque) if it remained energized.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So the Kawai engine delivers
          what it advertises: It dramatically reduces or eliminates the
          "back drag" fields of the stator electromagnets, because there
          are no back-drag fields activated in the electromagnets during
          the back-drag sectors. A conservative field cycle is one in
          which the back-drag is equal to the forward boost. Eliminating
          the back-drag portion of the cycle is a form of A-regauging,
          and makes the net field highly nonconservative. Note that
          again it was accomplished by a change in the magnetostatic
          scalar potential, which was reset to zero by the de-energizing
          coil during the back-drag portion of an otherwise conservative
          cycle. The Kawai engine therefore uses A-regauging and
          nonconservative fields in order to legitimately achieve
          overunity operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because of the numerous
          A-regaugings and back drag elimination, this engine definitely
          can provide a COP&gt;1.0. Placed in an electric vehicle with
          necessary switching circuitry and ancillary equipment, a
          properly designed Kawai engine and its derivatives should be
          capable of starting from a single ordinary battery, then
          powering the vehicle agilely, powering the accessories, and
          recharging its own battery -- all three simultaneously. And in
          so doing, it complies with all the laws of physics and
          thermodynamics.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Closed Loop
            (Self-Powering) Operation ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Both the Kawai and Takahashi
          engines require input power, at least in the configurations
          shown to date. However, both engines are technically capable
          of overunity -- e.g., in his patent Kawai quotes performance
          measurements indicating 318% efficiency. Obviously, such a
          system can be close-looped by simply hooking it to a
          generator, and using positive feedback of a portion of the
          generator output to run the engine while using the remainder
          of the output to power a load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Johnson engine is
          inherently already self-powering, since it requires no
          external power input in the conventional fashion. One accents,
          of course, that in any such self-powered engine, there is
          indeed a steady input of power from the vacuum, in the violent
          virtual photon exchange with the particles and atoms
          comprising the magnets. A magnet simply acts as a gate in that
          energy exchange, as indeed does the bipolarity of an
          electrical power source.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusion ~</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Presently the three
          inventors mentioned have developed prototype engines which (1)
          produce COP&gt;1.0, and (2) apply a multivalued potential,
          pseudo-multivalued potential, or A-regauging, or both. The
          Johnson engine is already self-powering. Both the Takahashi
          and Kawai engines are readily convertible to self-powering
          embodiments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It would appear that these
          engines should now move into full development for introduction
          upon the world market.[11] Together with the Patterson
          cell,[12] we believe that these engines will usher in a new
          age of cheap clean energy for everyone.</font> </p>

      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</font></i>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          relates to an electric motor capable of effectively converting
          electric energy into mechanical energy by using a structure
          wherein the attraction and repulsion between a magnetic member
          and a magnet or magnets are intense where they are brought
          into contact with each other.</font> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BACKGROUND OF THE
            INVENTION</font></i> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A prior art electric motor
          for producing mechanical energy from electric energy is
          illustrated in FIG. 4. The electric motor comprises a rotary
          axle a, a commutator b and brushes c combined with the
          commutator b positioned around the rotary axle a, an armature
          d composed of an iron core and a coil wound around the iron
          core, and a pair of magnets e positioned outside the armature
          d whereby the armature d is turned by the attraction between
          the electromagnets to thereby produce the turning force or the
          mechanical force. The prior art electric motor has however the
          problem that, inasmuch as the direction of mutual induction
          between the armature d and the magnets e fixed outside the
          armature is circumferential, the inductance distance in the
          successive attractive and repellent movement effected during
          the operation of the electric motor, namely, the distance from
          the start of the mutual attraction between the fixed magnets e
          and the poles of the armature d to the point at which the
          attractive force therebetween is directed radially, cannot be
          smaller than the distance which is defined by dividing the
          circumferential length of the fixed magnets e by the number of
          switching poles produced by the armature d when rotated
          360.degree., irrespective of whether a brush type or a
          non-contact type of motor is used.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an inertia type motor,
          there is a shortcoming in that the inertia type motor is
          delayed in actuation thereof and much power is wasted because
          the inertia type motor cannot operate with its inherent
          capacity when energized until it arrives at a fixed speed of
          rotation.</font> </p>
      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</font></i>

          been made to solve the problems of the prior art electric
          motor.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is therefore an object of
          the present invention to provide an electric motor capable of
          producing and taking off high effective turning energy or
          mechanical force from a predetermined input of electric energy
          and eliminating the delayed actuation thereof and the damages
          caused thereby.</font> </p>

          inside the electromagnets and having a peripheral surface to

      <p><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">DESCRIPTION OF THE
            PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</font></i> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An electric motor according
          to an embodiment of the present invention will be described
          with reference to FIGS. 1 to 3.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric motor comprises
          a plurality of electromagnets 1a-1h arranged annularly and in
          parallel relationship with each other, an electric current
          switching circuit 8 connected to each electromagnet, an iron
          cylinder 4 arranged inside the electromagnets and having a
          peripheral surface to be attracted partially arbitrarily by
          part of the electromagnets, a main axle 5a positioned
          coaxially at the center of the iron cylinder 4 via bearings 6
          and 7, and eccentric axles 5b provided at both ends of the
          main axle 5a and arranged eccentrically relative thereto in
          accord with the center of the electromagnets 1a-1h to define a
          power generating axle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">More in detail, the
          electromagnets 1a-1h are annularly concentrically arranged and
          supported between supporting frames 3 which respectively
          oppositely project from a base 2. The number of electromagnets
          is eight according to the disclosed embodiment, but is not
          limited thereto. Generally, the greater the number of
          electromagnets, the smoother the turning movement of the
          motor. The iron cylinder 4 has an outer diameter slightly
          smaller than and eccentric relative to an inner diameter
          defined by the inner surfaces of the electromagnets. The axle
          5 comprises the main axle 5a positioned in the center of the
          iron cylinder 4 and eccentric axles 5b having diameters less
          than that of the main axle 5a and provided at both ends of the
          main positioned coaxially, hence the main axle 5a operates as
          a crank pin and the eccentric axles 5b operate as crank
          shafts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric motor having
          such an arrangement operates as follows.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the electric current
          switching circuit 8 applies current to the electromagnets
          1a-1h to successively energize them, the iron cylinder 4 is
          attracted in order successively by the electromagnets so that
          the iron cylinder 4 performs the turning movement or the
          rotary motion. Accordingly, the eccentric axles 5b form rotary
          axles whereby the mechanical force or power caused by the
          rotary motion is taken off from the eccentric axles 5b. The
          attractive force is intensely generated at the portion of the
          iron cylinder 4a where the electromagnets 1a-1h and the iron
          cylinder 4 are brought into contact with each other.
          Immediately after the portion 4a of the iron cylinder 4
          arrives at a center point 0 of the electromagnet 1a, the
          electromagnet 1b is energized while the electromagnet 1a is
          de-energized at the same time. Immediately after the portion
          4a of the iron cylinder 4 is attracted by the electromagnet 1b
          and arrives at the center point 0 of the electromagnet 1b, the
          electromagnet 1c is energized while the electromagnet 1b is
          de-energized at the same time. The electromagnets 1d-1h are in
          order successively operated in the same manner.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electric current
          switching circuit 8 can also apply current to the three
          electromagnets 1a, 1b, 1c so as to energize them
          simultaneously. In such case, immediately after the portion 4a
          of the iron cylinder 4 arrives at the center point 0 of the
          electromagnet 1a, the electromagnet 1d following the last
          energized electromagnet 1c is energized while the
          electromagnet 1a is de-energized at the same time. Immediately
          after the portion 4a of the iron cylinder 4 is attracted by
          the electromagnet 1b and arrives at the center point 0 of the
          electromagnet 1b, the electromagnet 1e is energized while the
          electromagnet 1b is de-energized at the same time. When such
          successive operations are repeated in order for the
          electromagnets 1f-lh, the iron cylinder 4 effects rotary
          motion.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With such repeated rotary
          motions, the turning force or the mechanical force is taken
          off from the eccentric axles 5b. However, inasmuch as the
          eccentric axles 5b are eccentric relative to the main axle 5a,
          the main axle 5a produces a centrifugal force when it is
          turned. Accordingly, once the main axle 5a starts to turn, the
          speed of rotation is increased satisfactorily. However, in the
          event that the main axle 5a does not turn smoothly from a
          static state, an adjustable weight 10 may be attached to the
          main axle 5a so that the main axle 5a can smoothly turn. Such
          adjustable weight 10 is shown by a chain line in FIG. 2.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As mentioned above in
          detail, the iron cylinder is successively attracted by the
          electromagnets when they are successively energized to thereby
          subject the iron cylinder to rotary motion. With successive
          rotary motion, mechanical force or power is generated and is
          taken off from the eccentric axles 5b provided at both sides
          of the main axle 5a. Thus, the rotary motion can be utilized
          as a drive source. Accordingly, inasmuch as the iron cylinder
          can be turned by the attractive force within the
          electromagnets, it is possible to take off a great power from
          the power axle, namely, from the eccentric axles, within a
          short period of time with a slight amount of electric power.
          Furthermore, the electric motor of the present invention is
          simple in structure and requires a small number of parts, and
          is thus very practical for manufacturing at low cost. In
          addition, the motor may be used with much less trouble than
          other known motors.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although the invention has
          been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of
          particularity, it is to be understood that many variations and
          changes are possible in the invention without departing from
          the scope thereof.</font> </p>

      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Dear Jon,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the time we negotiated
          with Kawai (at his wish!), he had already produced a "closed
          loop" motor in Japan where what you are getting at was
          accomplished.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">E.g., say you have a Kawai
          system whose COP is double its efficiency, and its efficiency
          is 80%.&nbsp; That gives a COP of 1.6.&nbsp; This is one of
          the actual Hitachi motors he modified for Hitachi engineers to
          test, in evaluating his system and patent originally.&nbsp;
          And that is what it proved to do, under rigorous Hitachi
          testing (some of the best in the world).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now if you take, say, 80% of
          that output EM energy, and feed it back into the electrical
          output in a closely governed positive feedback manner, you
          will be feeding back about 1.28 as much energy as you had to
          input.&nbsp; You will still have some separate output energy,
          also, to dissipate in an external load and power it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, you will have some
          losses in the feedback loop and related switching, so suppose
          you lose that 0.28 part of that COP along the feedback
          way.&nbsp; That means you will be inputting 1.0, or precisely
          as much energy as is needed to run the system under load. That
          system then becomes "self-powering", or more exactly, it draws
          sufficient EM energy from the local vacuum to power itself
          (losses and inefficiencies and switching) and its loads
          simultaneously.&nbsp; It draws from the local vacuum the extra
          energy for the input, as well as the energy being dissipated
          in the external load.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The key is that all EM field
          energy and potential energy in any EM circuit or device comes
          from the source charges in that circuit or device, not from
          what one inputs, not from a battery, and not from cranking the
          shaft of a generator.&nbsp; And the source charges (together
          with their clustering virtual charges of opposite sign) are
          dipolar ensembles of opposite charges.&nbsp; Hence the source
          charge ensemble must obey the known asymmetry of opposite
          charges.&nbsp; Rigorously (already proven in particle physics,
          with a Nobel Prize awarded to Lee and Yang for predicting
          broken symmetry) such "opposite charges asymmetry" freely
          absorbs virtual photons from the seething vacuum, coherently
          integrates the subquantal energy into quantal (observable)
          size, and re-emits the energy as real, observable photons in
          all directions --- thereby establishing and continuously
          replenishing its associated EM fields and potentials,
          spreading outward at light speed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So the Kawai process is a
          process whereby Lorentz symmetrical regauging (of an otherwise
          closed current loop circuit) is broken.&nbsp; This rigorously
          changes the system into a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS)
          system that openly receives excess energy from its active
          environment.&nbsp; The established thermodynamics of open NESS
          dissipative systems (plenty of hard references and
          experiments) then permits the system to exhibit any of five
          novel functions: (1) self-order (increase its own energy by
          simple free regauging via the gauge freedom axiom), (2)
          self-oscillate or self-rotate, (3) output more energy as
          useful work than the operator inputs and pays for (the excess
          input energy is freely received from the active environment),
          (4) power itself and its load simultaneously with energy
          received freely from the active external environment, and (5)
          exhibit negative entropy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You really can build
          electrical windmills operating in a free electrical wind, so
          to speak.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kawai's process is perfectly
          legitimate, and with attention to very efficient switching it
          can be successfully replicated in accord with the patent
          itself.&nbsp; You have to start with a very efficient motor
          (say, an 80% efficient Hitachi standard motor) and you have to
          use very efficient switching (say, photon-coupled switching
          using very little power).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was a sad and shocking
          day when the Yakuza appeared and put a stop to the Kawai
          system and a clamp on Kawai forever. Otherwise, you would
          already have seen self-powering Kawai systems on the
          market.&nbsp; We would have put them there, under agreement
          with Kawai, and being funded by Kawai himself!&nbsp; His
          backers were some of the wealthiest men in Japan.&nbsp; But
          the Yakuza suppressed it like snuffing out a candle.&nbsp;
          Simply do a Google search on the Yakuza, and you may be very
          surprised at what you discover.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Best wishes,</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Tom Bearden</font> </p>
      <p><b><i><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Excerpted from
              correspondence:</font></i></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just a note in response to
          your suggestion:&nbsp; Most Japanese are in fact peace-loving
          folks the way you pointed out.&nbsp; The problem in the energy
          field seems to be that the Yakuza (Japanese Mafia) is seizing
          and stopping all Japanese-developed overunity systems.&nbsp;
          There are at least three of these Japanese overunity systems
          that I'm aware of, being held off the market. Control of one
          of the Japanese systems, the Kawai system, was seized right
          here in the U.S. in 1996, in my physical presence and the
          Board of Directors of our little company.&nbsp; We had reached
          an agreement with Kawai to market his engine worldwide, set up
          a development laboratory here in Huntsville for further
          developments, and get on with it.&nbsp; We reached that
          agreement on Thursday evening that week, after negotiations
          most of the week.&nbsp; That night, a jet arrived post-haste
          from Los Angeles, with a special Japanese on board, and the
          next morning Kawai and party were in fear and trembling -- and
          just hung their heads in shame and great disgrace.&nbsp; One
          of the individuals accompanying the newcomer had the typical
          markings and tip of a finger missing.&nbsp; At that point,
          everything was finished.&nbsp; We shipped the two Kawai
          engines we had received, out of here to Los Angeles.&nbsp; The
          Japanese party left, and that was that.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Kawai engine switches
          the magnetic flux path at the opportune moment, by a very
          clever mechanical arrangement augmented by photo-coupled EM
          switching, and eliminates most of the back mmf.&nbsp; This
          effectively doubles the COP of the magnetic motor to which it
          is adroitly applied.&nbsp; If the motor is, say, 0.4 (normal
          inefficient motor), you will get a COP = 0.8, but not
          overunity.&nbsp; But if you start with a high efficiency
          magnetic motor (as made by Hitachi and others) of, say, COP =
          0.7 or 0.8, you will get a motor with COP = 1.4 or 1.6.&nbsp;
          The latter can then be close-looped to power itself and a load
          simultaneously.&nbsp; Kawai personally informed me that he
          already had a successful closed loop motor running and had
          filed another patent in Japan on it.</font> </p>
