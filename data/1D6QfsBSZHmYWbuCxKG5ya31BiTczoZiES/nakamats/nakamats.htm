      <p>Yoshiro Nakamatsu ( born June 26, 1928), a.k.a. Dr. NakaMats,
        is a Japanese inventor claiming to hold the world record for
        number of inventions with over 3,000. He is known as the "Edison
        of Japan." Nakamatsu claims that possibly his greatest invention
        is the floppy disk (1950). He is the only person who has
        licensed 16 patents to IBM, including the floppy disk. He
        created his first invention at the age of five. </p>
      <p>Nakamatsu is a graduate of the University of Tokyo. He has so
        far completed four doctor thesis and claims that he will never
        stop studying. </p>
      <p>Archimedes, Michael Faraday, Marie Curie, Nikola Tesla and
        Yoshiro Nakamatsu were chosen by U.S. Science Academic Society
        as the five greatest scientists in history. </p>
      <p>He was awarded the 2005 Ig Nobel prize for Nutrition, for
        photographing and retrospectively analyzing every meal he has
        consumed during a period of 34 years (and counting). The goal of
        NakaMats is to live over 140 years old. </p>
      <p>He invented the Enerex, a pollution free car engine that runs
        on tap water and can generate three times as much power as a
        standard gasoline engine. It splits water, producing hydrogen as
        the fuel.</p>

      <p>Plans for a new car engine are all wet, but that’s good news
        because this fantastic invention is supposed to run on plain old
        tap water. </p>
      <p>This is not some pipe dream. The man behind the pollution-free
        engine Enerex is Yoshiro Nakamatsu, the famous ‘Edison of Japan’
        who invented the computer floppy disk and digital watch. </p>
      <p>So people listen when Yoshiro says his Enerex engine will run
        on tap water and can create three times as much power as a
        standard gasoline motor. ‘It will generate electricity for any
        purpose,” he boasts. ‘Petroleum will exhaust in 100 years’. </p>
      <p>The 62-year-old wizard says listening to Beethoven’s Fifth
        Symphony and swimming help him maintain his creativity. It must
        work. Yoshiro has obtained more than 2000 patents in the US and
        Japan. </p>
      <p>Yoshiro says he plans to modify his engine so it can be used to
        power a special road vehicle. Major car manufacturers must be
        shaking, knowing their production of gas engines could sputter
        and stall if Enerex takes the country by storm. </p>
      <p>Yoshiro also displayed some of his other creations at the
        onroeville Expo mart in suburban Pittsburgh, including packages
        of ‘brain food’. This is a snack that tastes like seaweed but is
        supposed to contain ‘good elements’ to encourage clear thinking…</p>

      <p>FIELD OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention relates to an energy system for electrolyzing
        water with high efficiency to generate hydrogen and oxygen. Such
        hydrogen and oxygen may be employed, for example, as a fuel for
        powering automobiles, ships, airplanes and rockets, and for
        generating electricity. The system enables reduction of air
        pollution. </p>
      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>In Japan the number of automobile has sharply increased due to
        the high growth of the economy, and air pollution caused by
        automobile traffic has become a large problem. Environmental
        standards have been established concerning nitrogen dioxide,
        which is an indicator of air pollution, but the yearly average
        value of nitrogen dioxide has recently turned to rising trend as
        shown by FIG. 1 according to an investigation by The Environment
        Agency of the Japanese Government. In order to reduce this
        problem, electric automobiles have been developed to power low
        pollution cars. This solution is expensive, provides only short
        running distances per charge and results in low powered
        vehicles. </p>
      <p>Using methanol to power cars results in half of the running
        distance than is obtained with conventional gasoline for each
        filling of the tank, and a supply organization for distributing
        methanol is not complete. </p>
      <p>Compressed natural gas automobiles also have short running
        distances per charge and their total weight increases due to the
        necessity of mounting a gas cylinder on the vehicle. </p>
      <p>Fuel mounting technology and safety assurance for driving
        hydrogen powered automobiles have not been solved yet. Gas
        turbine automobiles have low reliability, efficiency and
        reaction to acceleration and deceleration, and exhaust too much
        nitrogen dioxide. Sterling engines are heavy and bulky and
        require long starting times, and their reliability has not been
        confirmed. Hydrogen automobiles using electricity and diesel
        engines are heavy, and more study is required for controlling
        such engines. With gasoline Cars using LPG jointly, the cost of
        improvement is very expensive, and also LPG distribution is not
        fully available. </p>
      <p>Many ways have been studied for decreasing the exhaust
        composition of air pollution from automobile engine. In
        accordance with one of these techniques, the combustion of
        diluted fuel has been tried. Such techniques generally
        complicate the construction of engine, in comparison with
        conventional engines. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>This invention is directed to the provision of a method for
        reducing or eliminating air pollution by effectively extracting
        hydrogen from water without changing the construction of the
        engine. Hydrogen has such properties as wider combustion range,
        higher combustion speed, less ignition energy and more easily
        making uniform mixed gas than gasoline, and this invention
        contemplates. the combustion of diluted mixed gas and decreases
        the exhaust of nitrogen dioxide. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows the example of the invention wherein water 1 is
        supplied to an electrolytic bath 2 to be electrolyzed by
        electric current from a battery 3, the equipment being mounted
        on a car (not illustrated). Hydrogen 4 generated in the
        equipment is supplied together with gasoline to the engine, and
        generated oxygen 5 is released to the inside of the car. </p>
      <p>An ion exchange resin layer 7 of replaceable construction is
        mounted in the outlet of a water tank 6, so that distilled water
        for electrolysis is not required, and ordinary tap water from a
        water faucet, etc. can be used. Water tank 6 is placed with the
        water level therein always higher than electrolytic bath 2, so
        that pressure is always applied to an electrolytic film 8 within
        the electrolytic bath 2. Water from the tank 6 enters from the
        bottom of electrolytic bath via a pipe 9. This accelerates the
        chemical reaction in the bath and decreases electrical
        consumption by heating, as described below cold water
        immediately after it is sent from below electrolytic bath
        instead of from above, in order to raise the temperature within
        the electrolytic battery as much as possible and by sending
        heated water within the electrolytic bath to keep a high
        temperature within the bath as much as possible, without
        enabling the water to flow back to water tank. </p>
      <p>The water electrolysis method of the invention employs solid
        polyelectrolyte water electrolysis by polymer electrolysis, and
        does not need electrolytic liquid. This is one feature of the
        invention. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 and also as described
        below, the electrolytic film in the electrolytic bath 2 is a
        solid polyelectrolytic film 8 having a positive electrode 10 on
        one side and a negative electrode 11 on the other side. The
        solid polyelectrolytic film 8 extends vertically and is
        sandwiched with apertured metal plates 12, metal nets 13 and
        another apertured metal plates 14 symmetrically arranged on both
        sides of film 8. The solid polyelectrolytic film 8 is mounted to
        extend vertically in order to enable it to vibrate as the car or
        other vehicle is moved in order to easily set hydrogen foam
        free, to thereby accelerate the chemical reaction, to enhance
        the efficiency of heating from the outside of the electrolytic
        bath and the efficiency of heating up interior heat generating
        substance by making the electrolytic film thinner, not to
        prevent hydrogen and oxygen from rising, and also to simplify
        the drain on the side of positive electrode. Electricity is
        applied to electrodes 10, 11 of said film 8 from power supply 15
        connected to battery 3 via electric cables 16. </p>
      <p>The solid polyelectrolytic film 8 illustrated in FIG. 7 set
        forth above is a cation exchange film having the following
        chemical formula: ##STR1## </p>
      <p>As shown in the plan view of FIG. 3 and cross section of FIG.
        7, thin film electrodes 10, 11 of porous anti-corrosive
        catalytic metals such as platinum of platinum group, rhodium,
        palladium, ruthenium, iridium, etc. are applied to both sides of
        the electrolytic film 8. </p>
      <p>As further shown in FIG. 7, the apertured metal plates 12 of
        FIG. 4 contact the electrodes 10, 11 and the layers of the metal
        mesh 13 of FIG. 5 are attached to the outer sides of the
        apertured metal plates 12. The apertured metal plates 14 of FIG.
        6 are attached to the outer sides of the layers of metal mesh
        13. The layers including the apertured metal plates 14, metal
        mesh layers 13, apertured metal plates 12, positive and negative
        electrodes 10. 11 and the electrolytic film 8, are fastened
        together with inserted packings 17 by the meshed threads 19 of
        an electrically insulated holder 18. The electrolytic film 8 is
        replaceable, if necessary, for instance every 3 years. When
        electricity is applied between the positive electrode 10 and the
        negative electrode 11 via the apertured metal plate 12, water 1
        permeating to the electrolytic film 8 is electrolyzed,
        generating oxygen from the positive electrode 10 and hydrogen
        from the negative electrode 11. Hydrogen is supplied from the
        outlet pipe 20 at the upper portion of electrolytic bath 2 to an
        engine, etc. and oxygen is discharged to the cabin of the
        vehicle, via outlet pipe 21 located at the upper portion of
        electrodes. </p>
      <p>Anti-corrosive materials such as plastic or titanium or
        material coated With fluoric resin are used for the electrolytic
        bath. In examples of the invention employing a 20 mm diameter
        electrolytic film, hydrogen was generated at 12.59 cc/minute
        with a voltage of 12 V and current of 2.5 A; hydrogen was
        generated at 9.98 cc/minute with a voltage of 12 V and current
        of 2.0 A; hydrogen was generated at 7.53 cc/minute at a voltage
        of 12 V and current of 1.5 A, hydrogen was generated at 5.00
        cc/minute at a voltage of 12 V and current of 1.0 A; and
        hydrogen was generated at 2.42 cc/minute at a voltage of 12 V
        and current of 0.5 A. </p>
      <p>In order to heat water within the electrolytic bath 2 shown in
        FIG. 2, a heat generating element 22 such as a rectifier,
        transistor, etc. in the circuit of the power supply 15 shown by
        FIG. 9, is coated with Teflon resin or sealed in titanium box
        23, and mounted within the electrolytic bath 2. This arrangement
        is designed to heat water at the location of electrolysis and to
        simultaneously cool the heat generating parts of the power
        supply circuit. Especially when the electrolytic bath is made of
        plastics without using heat absorbing fins, as set forth later,
        this method is especially advantageous, since plastics cannot
        absorb external and in addition heat produced from heat
        generating interior substances is insulated by plastics to
        enhance the interior heating efficiency. </p>
      <p>The space 24 for receiving hydrogen generated on the side of
        negative electrode and water permeating from electrolytic film
        can be discharged from the space 24 via drain valve 25. </p>
      <p>Part 26 is a support to hold the system of the invention under
        the hood, etc. of an automotive vehicle, this support enabling
        substantial vibration of the electrolytic bath 2 with vibration
        of automobile. </p>
      <p>FIG. 8 illustrates a side view of the arrangement of FIG. 2,
        showing that the electrolytic film 8 may be circular. With this
        arrangement, the device of the invention is compact since the
        water pipe 9 is arranged along the round side of the bath, and
        the absorption of heat from the external fins is not disturbed.
      </p>
      <p>Solid polyelectrolyte water electrolysis by electrolytic film 8
        and catalytic metallic electrode 10, 11 used for the system of
        the invention enables the attaining of high energy efficiency
        without using an electrolytic liquid,,and the energy system is
        compact and easy to handle. As shown in FIG. 2, heat absorbing
        fins 27 are mounted externally on the electrolytic bath 2 to
        absorb heat from the engine or under the hood. The fins aid in
        the heating of the water within the electrolytic bath 2 by a
        heat generating element, so that the electrolytic voltage can be
        reduced by 5 to 10%. In addition this enables the release of
        oxygen foam from the electrolytic film 8 to be accelerated by
        transmitting engine and car movement vibration to the
        electrolytic film 8, thereby enhancing the energy generating
        efficiency, so that extremely high energy efficiencies as 95%
        can be obtained. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen coming from the pipe 20 of the system of the invention
        can be supplied to the suction duct of a hydrogen engine, and is
        also usable for conventional gasoline automobile. In this event,
        if the system is mounted under the hood to send hydrogen to the
        intake duct of the engine, under the power of the car battery,
        to mix hydrogen with evaporated gasoline, fuel expense can be
        not only saved but is also possible to reduce C0, C02, and N0
        within exhaust gas. In addition, sleepiness of the driver can be
        prevented, thereby enhancing attention of the driver to careful
        driving. By discharging oxygen coming from the pipe 21 of the
        system of the invention to the drivers seat in order to provide
        oxygen to the brain of driver. </p>
      <p>The circuit of FIG. 9, is an example of the circuit of the
        power supply 15 for supplying constant current from the battery
        3 to the electrolytic bath 2. The battery of the automobile is
        usable for supplying the input to this circuit, for example a
        battery having a capacity of 12 VDC at 5 A can be used, and the
        range of input voltages for the circuit is 10-15 V. </p>
      <p>The output of the circuit of FIG. 9 is set with range of 0 VDC,
        4 A. Lamp LED 2 is lit to shut off the output current when the
        output voltage exceeds DC 2.8 V by increasing of the resistance
        resulting from long usage of the solid polyelectrolytic film, or
        when the input voltage has fallen to lower than DC 10 V due to
        consumption of the battery and the temperature of radiator
        exceeds 80 degrees C. Lamp LED 3 is lit when output current is
        supplied. </p>
      <p>Part U-1 in the power supply circuit is a DC/DC converter to
        provide an output voltage of -12 V necessary to drive the
        op-amp. </p>
      <p>Part 28 of the circuit is a thermal fuse which senses the
        temperature in the bath to shut off the output current when the
        temperature of element 22 rises to more than 80 degrees C. </p>
      <p>Element 22 in the circuit is a transistor having large heat
        generation. The invention serves the double purpose of enhancing
        electrolytic efficiency to lower the voltage by raising the
        water temperature within electrolytic bath 2 by using the
        heating property of element 22, as shown by FIG. 2, and also of
        cooling the transistor or other element 22 at the same time. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 19, it is also possible to heat the water by
        attaching radiation fins 27 to the transistor and contacting the
        radiation fins with the metallic electrolytic bath 2 made of
        such metals as titanium, etc. It is also possible to heat the
        water by contacting the radiation fins with the outside of
        electrolytic bath 2 made of such metals as titanium, etc. </p>
      <p>FIG. 10 and FIG. 11 show an example of the invention wherein
        heat absorbing fins 27 are mounted to extend in the direction of
        the diameter of electrolytic bath 2, and water pipe 9 is
        inserted between the heat absorbing fins 27 so as to place the
        heat absorbing fins 27 on the water pipe 9 itself in order to
        preheat the water before it enters the electrolytic bath. </p>
      <p>FIG. 12 shows an example of the invention wherein a plurality
        of electrolytic films 8 are aligned in parallel to increase the
        generation of hydrogen. This reason for the use of a plurality
        of electrolytic films is explained in the following paragraphs.
      </p>
      <p>Gasoline is represented by the formula C.sub.8 H.sub.16 and if
        the hydrogen mixing rate is 5%, the volume of hydrogen to 1 mol
        (112 g) of gasoline is 112.times.0.05/ (1-0.05)=5.89 g. </p>
      <p>Since the heat generating volume at low mixtures of hydrogen
        and gasoline is 10,500 kcal/kg and 28,800 kcl/kg respectively,
        when a 5% hydrogen mixing rate is converted to heat generating
        volume, hydrogen becomes 5.89.times.28.8/
        (5.89.times.28.8+112.times.10.5);=12.6%. </p>
      <p>Considering a 30% heat efficiency of the engine and
        approximately 10 horsepower under light load (40 to 50 km/h of
        constant speed on city roads), heat input at 10 horsepowers
        (7.35 kw) of net output is 7.35/0.3=24.5 kw=24.5.times.860
        kcal/h=21,070 kcal/h. </p>
      <p>The supply calorie of hydrogen out of the 21,070 kcal/h is
        0.126.times.21,070=2,655 kcal/h and that of gasoline is
        21,070-2,655=18,415 kcl/h. When obtaining heat generating volume
        from 0.0899 kg/m3 (gas) of hydrogen's density and 0.74 kg/l
        (liquid) of gasoline's density, hydrogen is 28,800.times.
        0.0899=2,589 kcal/m3 (H2 gas) and gasoline
        10,500.times.0.74=7,770 kcal/m3 (gasoline). Consequently the
        supply volume of hydrogen and gasoline is 2,655/2,589/60=17.1
        l/min and 1,841.5/7,770/60=39.5 cc/min respectively. </p>
      <p>Assuming that one sheet of electrolytic film with a 8 cm
        diameter generates 50 cc/min of hydrogen, 342 sheets of the film
        aligned in parallel are required to supply 17.1 l/min of
        hydrogen to a conventional automobile engine. However, as shown
        in FIG. 22, in the system of the invention using a hydrogen tank
        31, the number of electrolytic films as set forth above is not
        required, since controller 32 controls the necessary volume of
        hydrogen according to the condition of the engine and because,
        as long as the controller 32 works, hydrogen is stored in the
        tank to be released only when necessary. </p>
      <p>FIG. 13 shows an example of the invention wherein a plurality
        of electrolytic baths are connected to a unit 31. </p>
      <p>FIG. 14 shows an example of the invention wherein the
        electrolytic bath 2 is cylindrical with the electrolytic film 8
        attached to its bottom. Vibration of car moves water within the
        electrolytic bath 2 in a vertical direction A, and power in the
        A direction is divided into the B direction axial of the
        electrolytic bath 2 and in the C direction at right angles to
        the axis of the electrolytic bath 2 and also in parallel with
        the surface of the electrolytic film 8, in order to accelerate
        discharging foam of hydrogen coming from electrolytic film 8 to
        enhance electrolytic efficiency. Heat absorbing fins 27, drain
        pipe 32, fixture 33, water inlet 34, ion exchange resin layer 7,
        hydrogen outlet 20 and oxygen outlet 21 are mounted in the
        electrolytic bath 2. </p>
      <p>FIG. 15 shows an example of the invention wherein the
        electrolytic bath 2 is inclined and the bottom of electrolytic
        bath extends vertically. In this arrangement the water inlet is
        in an upper horizontal portion of electrolytic bath. The ion
        exchange resin layer and the electrolytic film are represented
        by the reference numerals 7 and 8 respectively. The electrolytic
        bath is made of non-corrosive metals such as titanium, etc. and
        heated semi-conductors in the power supply circuit contact the
        outside of electrolytic bath so that the heat of engine, etc. is
        transmitted through fins 27 to heat the electrolytic bath. </p>
      <p>FIG. 16 is an example of the invention wherein the electrolytic
        bath, etc. are heated. Using the example of FIG. 14, heating
        pipe 35 is installed in the cylindrical electrolytic bath 2 to
        heat the water 1 by sending heat of the engine and exhaust into
        heating pipe 35 in order to enhance the electrolytic efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 17 shows an example of the invention wherein an electric
        heating wire 36 coated with Teflon resin is placed within the
        electrolytic bath 2 to heat water 1 by current from the
        automobile battery. </p>
      <p>FIG. 18 is an example of the invention using a vertically
        extending tube shown in FIG. 14, wherein members 37 in the shape
        of trumpet horns are supported by rods 38 inserted in the water
        tank 1. Motion A of the water in a vertical direction due to up
        and down movement of car is converted to movement in the
        horizontal direction B to improve discharging and dispersing
        foam of the hydrogen gas. </p>
      <p>FIG. 19 is an example of the invention wherein radiating fins
        27 of the power supply 15 are attached along the outside wall of
        the electrolytic bath 2 to heat the water within the
        electrolytic bath 2 by heat generated from the power supply and
        also to cool the heat generating semi-conductors. </p>
      <p>FIG. 20 is an example of the invention wherein the power supply
        15 is fabricated on a flexible printed circuit board which is
        mounted around the electrolytic bath 2 to heat water within the
        bath and cool the power supply circuit. </p>
      <p>FIG. 21 is an example of the invention wherein the power supply
        15 is fixed on the wide bottom of the electrolytic bath 2 in the
        form of a cube and heat absorbing fins 27 are attached to other
        surfaces, so that the electrolytic efficiency can be enhanced by
        heat generated by the power supply and heat absorbed by fins 27
        from the engine. </p>
      <p>FIG. 22 is an example of the invention wherein the power supply
        15 is mounted on a narrow longitudinal face of the electrolytic
        bath in the form of a rectangular parallel piped, as shown in
        the previous example. </p>
      <p>FIG. 23 shows an example of the invention wherein the
        electrolytic bath 2 is very thin, so that the temperature of
        interior water is easy to raise by external heating, and the
        power supply 15 is set on the wide bottom of the electrolytic
        bath 2. </p>
      <p>FIG. 24 shows the test results of the inventor, assuming that
        the abscissa and ordinate represent the necessary current and
        voltage and current, respectively, for electrolysis, and the
        curve B shows the relationship between the voltage and current
        when neither heat nor vibration is provided. Curve A shows the
        relationship in accordance with the invention upon the
        application of loading pressure on the electrolytic film 8 by
        heating and vibrating water 1 within electrolytic bath 2. This
        test shows that the voltage necessary for electrolysis is
        reduced by at least 15% and the energy efficiency is
        consequently enhanced. </p>
      <p>FIG. 25 shows an example of the invention comprised of 3 main
        elements of the hydrogen generating apparatus, hydrogen storing
        apparatus and controller which have been explained with
        reference to FIG. 2. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen outlet pipe 20 from the electrolytic hydrogen
        generating apparatus 39 driven by the battery 3 and the power
        supply 15 of FIG. 2 are connected to the hydrogen tank 40, where
        a hydrogen storage alloy 41, such as iron plus titanium or iron
        plus titanium plus niobium, invented by me, is filled to
        efficiently absorb hydrogen. As I have explained in another of
        my patent applications, an alloy of iron and titanium and
        Niobium has a hydrogen storage capacity of 6.7 times as much as
        a conventional hydrogen cylinder. A controller 43 for
        controlling the hydrogen volume is set between this hydrogen
        tank 40 and the engine 42. Gasoline 44 is supplied to the engine
        42 via and evaporator 45. FIG. 25 also shows the system where
        hydrogen is supplied from the controller 43. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen controller 42 is designed to increase and decrease
        the supplied volume of hydrogen as a function of the rpm of the
        engine or the angle (alpha) of the accelerator pedal 46. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen generating apparatus 39 receives heat produced by
        the engine or exhaust from the engine or from a supply of
        electricity to heat the generating parts 22 of the power source
        and electrolytic film 8, and produces hydrogen to be stored in
        the hydrogen storage alloy filled hydrogen tank 40. The hydrogen
        storage alloy in the hydrogen tank is cooled by water 1 in order
        to send hydrogen to hydrogen tank by pressure for storage. </p>
      <p>The hydrogen storage alloy filed storage tank 40 is placed
        close to the engine to discharge hydrogen from the metal by heat
        coming from engine 42. This hydrogen tank 40 is connected to the
        hydrogen controller 42 which is designed to shut down hydrogen
        when the load to engine becomes large. In other words, the
        controller 43 is closed and the supply of hydrogen to the engine
        stops or is reduced, during which period hydrogen from the
        hydrogen generating apparatus is stored in the hydrogen tank.
        The controller, when necessary, opens to send hydrogen to the
        engine. Therefore, in accordance with the invention, even a
        small hydrogen generating capacity is enough to drive the
        engine, so that the system may be small. A hydrogen cylinder can
        be used instead of the hydrogen tank 31, or can be used along
        with the hydrogen tank 31. </p>
      <p>The controller 43 changes the volume of hydrogen in proportion
        to the size of the load, the density of mixed gas and the size
        of mixing ratio. </p>
      <p>FIG. 26 is a plane figure showing an automobile 47
        incorporating the system of the invention, and also illustrating
        the driver 48. </p>
      <p>In order to describe the hydrogen controller 43, the test data
        of the example of the invention, FIG. 27 graphically shows
        the,relationship between the equivalent ratio of limit of
        hydrogen thinness .phi. and the hydrogen mixing rate f. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen generated by this system was sent into an inlet pipe
        located at approximately 50 mm down from the throttle valve
        within the pipe or suction pipe located at approximately 150 mm
        up from carburetor. The stroke capacity of engine used for this
        experiment is 323 cc. </p>
      <p>The equivalent ratio .phi. of hydrogen is represented by the
        ratio of quality and volume of oxygen necessary for complete
        combustion of mixed gas consisting of hydrogen and gasoline with
        respect to the quality and volume of oxygen within the mixed
        gas. The hydrogen mixing rate f is represented by comparison of
        quality and volume of hydrogen with quality of volume of
        hydrogen plus gasoline. </p>
      <p>As clearly apparent from FIG. 27, the effect of driving
        capacity of thin fuel increases at lower hydrogen mixing rates
        and also at lower loads. </p>
      <p>FIG. 28 shows that a thicker mixed gas is required as hydrogen
        in the system increases together with increases of load. </p>
      <p>Gasoline engines can be driven only by thin mixed gas of not
        more than approximately 1.2 times as much as generally
        theoretical gas volume. Therefore the output at low driving
        speed is controlled by throttling the volume of both the fuel
        and air. However, since the driving limit of thin mixed gas is
        expanded when adding hydrogen by this system, it is possible to
        control the output by decreasing only the volume of fuel without
        throttling air, to decrease any damage to the pump by throttling
        the volume of sucked air and to enhance the heat efficiency,
        i.e. one of effects of the present invention. </p>
      <p>This effect becomes more remarkable with lower output of
        driving with thin mixing ratio, and also the addition of
        hydrogen when driving with thin mixed gas makes it possible to
        decrease the combustibility of hydrocarbon HC, CO, etc. On the
        other hand, when driving with a thick mixed gas near the
        theoretical mixing ratio (high output driving), the effect of
        the addition of hydrogen is lower, and when increasing the
        mixing ratio of hydrogen, the output adversely lowers, leading
        to increase in exhaust of NOx. Consequently, the addition of
        hydrogen is recommended for partial load driving, and driving
        with gasoline only is better for high load driving. </p>
      <p>Consequently, as explained with reference to FIG. 25, I have
        provided a system having a hydrogen controller 43. </p>
      <p>The effect of mixing hydrogen into the fuel when driving with a
        thin gas mixture is especially effective, and the preferred
        hydrogen mixing rate is 5 to 10%. The smaller that the flame
        speed is when using a thin mixed gas of gasoline and air, the
        more effective flame transmission is accelerated by mixing small
        hydrogen with the fuel, for which the present controller is
        effective. </p>
      <p>When using gasoline only, the ignition advance angle, which is
        referred to herein as the MBT (Minimum Advance for Best Torque)
        increases in proportion to the rotating speed of the engine, but
        the degree is reduced by mixing hydrogen with the fuel. It has
        been found by experiment that in the case of a high speed
        rotation there is a trend that the effect of mixing hydrogen is
        large until the hydrogen mixing rate is large. </p>
      <p>If gasoline in a thin mixed gas at constant equivalent ratio
        continues to be partially replaced with hydrogen, it is possible
        to delay the ignition time for MBT, and the output increases
        when the hydrogen mixing rate is small. </p>
      <p>When maintaining a constant rotation speed, it is possible to
        make the equivalent ratio substantially smaller under no-load
        conditions, hardly changing the ignition time for MBT together
        with increasing hydrogen mixing ratio. With mixed gas required
        by the output, the smaller its equivalent rate is, the larger
        the hydrogen mixing effect is. </p>
      <p>If hydrogen is mixed with mixed gas of gasoline and air,
        combustion speed increases and the relationship of the hydrogen
        mixing rate with combustion speed shows an almost straight
        tendency. For instance, the regular combustion speed of thin
        mixed gas having a 0.7 equivalent rate at a hydrogen mixing rate
        of 0.2% and 10% is 20.25 cm/s and 40 cm/s respectively, having
        an almost straight relationship. The effect of mixing hydrogen
        on the combustion speed is more remarkable as the mixing rate
        becomes smaller, showing a logarithmic change with the mixing
        rate. </p>
      <p>Hydrogen mixing accelerates the effect of increasing combustion
        speed, particularly by turbulence of thin mixed gas. Increase of
        combustion speed in turbulent flow by mixing hydrogen on the
        side of excessive density of hydrogen having approximately 1.3
        of equivalent ratio .phi. shows an almost straight relationship
        as well as an increase in regular combustion speed, and hydrogen
        combustion speed on the side of thin density of hydrogen
        increases greatly by mixing approximately 2% hydrogen. The
        reason why the effect of turbulence on combustion speed
        increases greatly on the side of thin density by adding small
        amount of hydrogen is that the molecule dispersion coefficient
        of hydrogen is so extremely large that hydrogen disperses on the
        surface of irregular disordered combustion and selects oxygen to
        burn. On the basis of observations when using a burning vessel,
        it has been confirmed that the irregular surface of flame
        becomes very fine by mixing hydrogen. Consequently, when using
        this mixed gas, effective transmission of flame is accelerated
        more and more in case of thin mixed gas and of lower mixing
        ratio of hydrogen. Delaying MBT ignition timing is due to not
        only the effect of hydrogen having a high combustion speed, but
        also to the effect as set forth above. </p>
      <p>The effect of the invention on the density of air pollution
        materials contained in engine exhaust results in making possible
        the driving of cars at fully low equivalent rate of NO density
        compared with gasoline, only by mixing hydrogen into thin mixed
        gas. </p>
      <p>FIG. 29 shows the measurement of ignition time for MBT when
        driving by adding hydrogen to gasoline, and it is indicated that
        the ignition time for MBT is greatly delayed by adding a small
        amount of hydrogen. </p>
      <p>FIG. 30 shows the effect on NO density when changing the
        ignition timing at constant rotation speed and equivalent rate
        by 5 degrees and 10 degrees before and after from MBT, and the
        effect of the invention wherein it is possible on lowering NO
        density by delaying the ignition timing. </p>
      <p>FIG. 31 shows the relationship between NO density and
        decreasing rate of average effective pressure according to
        ignition delaying angle from MBT, and it indicates the effect
        wherein mixing hydrogen in accordance with the invention has a
        large effect on lowering NO density compared with the output
        decrease by ignition delaying angle. Furthermore, it is the
        effect of the invention that, when using thinner mixed gas,
        mixed hydrogen is also advantageous in the NO exhausting rate
        (g/ps.h). </p>
      <p>FIG. 32 shows that the NO exhaust rate is decreased by increase
        in the value of Gh/Gg. Compared with driving with gasoline of
        .lambda.=1.0, when driving with .lambda.=1.3 and adding
        hydrogen, the NO exhaust rate is decreased to approximately 1/4.
      </p>
      <p>FIG. 33 shows the indicated horsepower of ignition timing, HC
        within the exhaust gas, CO and the effect on NO exhaust rate.
        The HC exhaust rate become less with increases in the added
        volume of hydrogen, and it slightly increases when delaying
        ignition time. </p>
      <p>The reason that HC exhaust is decreased by adding hydrogen is
        that the flowing volume of gasoline decreases by adding the
        volume of hydrogen, inasmuch as the excessive air ratio .lambda.
        is kept at constant level, and that combustion efficiency around
        the wall of combustion chamber is accelerated since the
        hydrogen's lame distinguishing distance becomes small at the
        same time as the rise of maximum pressure. (see FIG. 42.) </p>
      <p>The C0 exhaust rate also shows a similar tendency as the HC
        exhaust rate but is hardly dependable on ignition time. The NO
        exhaust rate sharply decreases when delaying the ignition time.
        The NO exhaust rate at the same ignition time increases as the
        value of Gh/Gg increases, since the combustion speed increases
        by adding hydrogen and the temperature of combustion of the gas
        increases. </p>
      <p>FIG. 34 shows the fluctuation of the HC exhaust ratio when
        changing the excessive air ratio. When approaching the condition
        of discontinuing combustion, the HC exhaust ratio'is seen to
        sharply increase. When the excessive air ratio is increased,
        there is trend for the HC exhaust ratio to increase, but it is
        possible to protect the increase in HC exhaust by increasing the
        Gh/Gg value. </p>
      <p>FIG. 35 shows the effect of changes in HC density within the
        exhaust by the equivalent ratio, using the hydrogen mixing rate
        of the invention as a parameter, and it indicates the effect of
        the invention that it is possible to control the increase in HC
        density until the thin side of mixed gas by mixing hydrogen
        according to the invention. This figure shows the effect of the
        invention that, when thin mixed gas having equivalent ratio
        .phi. of approximately 0.75, HC density and HC exhaust rate
        substantially decreased by mixing hydrogen in accordance with
        the invention. </p>
      <p>FIG. 36 shows the CO exhaust rate when adding hydrogen. The
        absolute value of CO exhaust rate is small. </p>
      <p>Conventional hydrogen mixing methods cannot keep the HC density
        at a low level when using a thinner mixed gas as shown by FIG.
        35, unless a substantially large volume of hydrogen is mixed.
        Therefore, conventional hydrogen mixing methods cannot control
        the HC density to be low, whereas the method of the invention
        has the effect of keeping HC at its lowest level in any case,
        since it automatically adjusts the volume of hydrogen according
        to the curve shown in FIG. 35. </p>
      <p>FIG. 37 shows an example of measurement of the CO density
        within the exhaust, and it indicates the effect of the invention
        wherein in case of thin mixed gas having equivalent ratio .phi.
        of less than 0.9, the CO density lowers upon mixing hydrogen
        according to the invention. As the mixed gas becomes thinner, it
        is usual for the cycle change to increase by discontinued
        combustion or drop of the combustion speed, but safe driving
        with thin mixed gas can be obtained by mixing hydrogen according
        to the invention, and the change in the cycle decreases. </p>
      <p>FIG. 38 shows the distribution of the frequency of maximum
        pressure wherein the range of fluctuation is large when using
        only gasoline having equivalent ratio .phi. close to 1, but it
        indicates the effect that mixing hydrogen in accordance with the
        invention makes the range of fluctuation small. When using only
        hydrogen in accordance with the system of the invention, safe
        driving with regular dispersion can be obtained even with mixed
        gas close to driving limit of thin gas. </p>
      <p>Decreasing the ratio of maximum pressure fluctuation by mixing
        hydrogen does not change as much by equivalent ratio, and the
        invention has the large effect that fluctuation decreases to
        almost half at 10% mixing. The lower the gas suction pressure
        is, the bigger fluctuation ratio is, but the effect of mixing
        hydrogen in accordance with the invention is also large. When
        using gasoline only, the fluctuation ratio does not change as
        much with rotation speed. At a high speed with thin gas the
        invention has the effect that the fluctuation ratio is greatly
        reduced by mixing hydrogen therein in accordance with the
        invention. </p>
      <p>As a measure to stabilize driving with thin mixed gas, there is
        a method using simultaneous ignition at two places. The method
        of the invention has the same effect when using two plugs as
        when using a single ignition plug. </p>
      <p>The excessive air ratio (.lambda.) when adding hydrogen to
        gasoline by the invention is: ##EQU1## wherein the flowing
        volume of air is G<sub>a</sub>, the flowing volume of hydrogen
        in accordance with the invention is G<sub>h</sub>, the flowing
        volume of gasoline is G<sub>g</sub> and theoretically the
        combustion rate of gasoline and hydrogen added by the invention
        is .phi<sub>g</sub> and phi<sub>h</sub>. </p>
      <p>The calorie Q (kcal/s) per unit of time of fuel supplied to the
        engine is: </p>
      <p>Q=g<sub>h</sub> G<sub>h</sub> +g<sub>g</sub> G<sub>G</sub> </p>
      <p>provided the heat generating amount of hydrogen added by the
        invention and gasoline per unit of volume are g.sub.h and
        g.sub.g, respectively. </p>
      <p>FIG. 39 is a manometric diagram showing the development of
        pressure within the cylinder when changing the value of Gh/Gg
        while keeping the air excessive ratio .lambda. and the ignition
        time constant. It is seen from FIG. 39 that, when increasing the
        ratio of flowing volume of hydrogen and gasoline (Gh/Gg), the
        time from ignition until reaching maximum pressure becomes short
        and the maximum pressure increases. On this occasion, as seen
        clearly in FIG. 3, a change in supplied calories Q/Q' is
        approximately 1.02 even at Gh/Gg=0.1, and it is considered that
        its effect hardly appears. Consequently, the difference by
        adding hydrogen as shown at FIG. 39 means mainly an increase in
        combustion speed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 40 shows the relationship between the excessive air ratio
        and Gh/Gg. with ignition time for MBT, and it is apparent from
        FIG. 39 that if Gh/Gg is increased at the same value of
        excessive air ratio, the ignition time for MBT is delayed
        (approaching TDC). This fact agrees with the result of the
        manometric diagram (FIG. 39) that it is conserved for combustion
        speed to increase, when increasing added volume of hydrogen. In
        addition, the expansion of discontinued combustion limit 6 based
        on adding hydrogen is clear from this figure. </p>
      <p>FIG. 41 shows the temperature of the exhaust measured
        approximately 150 mm below the exhaust valve using a
        thermoelectric couple. Since the exhaust valve is not kept
        perfectly warm, the absolute value is meaningless, but when
        compared relatively, a decrease of temperature is seen when
        adding hydrogen and corresponds to the tendency shown by FIG.
        39. The standard deviation .sigma..sub.p and .delta..sub.p of
        maximum pressure within the cylinder when adding hydrogen is
        shown in FIG. 42. When the value of Gh/Gg is increased, both
        .sigma..sub.p and .delta..sub.p decrease, which means that the
        combustion within the cylinder has been stabilized. This
        phenomena is considered to be due to the large dispersion
        coefficient of hydrogen and to combustion characteristics as set
        forth previously. The indicated horse power at ignition time for
        MBT is shown in FIG. 43. When Gh/Gg=0, which means using
        gasoline only, combustion discontinuance occurs at an excessive
        air ratio of 1.2, and the indicated horsepower sharply f11s.
        When Gh/Gg=0.05, it was possible to drive until an excessive air
        ratio .lambda. of 1.4, but discontinuance of combustion occurred
        at an excessive air ratio of 1.5. When Gh/Gg=0.15, it was
        impossible to keep G.sub.a =3.0.times.10.sup.-3 kg/s due to the
        increase in the flowing volume of hydrogen. In FIG. 43, the
        indicated horsepower generally decreases with increase in the
        value of excessive air ratio, but if the supplied calories are
        inversely proportional to excessive air ratio .lambda. and the
        indicated thermal efficiency are fixed at one point FIG. 43, as
        shown by the chain line, and the decreasing ratio of the test
        result is less than this. An increase of the supplied calories
        by adding hydrogen is approximately 3% at Gh/Gg=0.15, and also
        in the case of hydrogen, a decrease in the mole number by
        combustion occurs, which is a contrary effect. Therefore, these
        influences are regarded as small. At the point obtained by
        experiment, there is almost no difference in Gh/Gg between 0.05
        and 0.15. Consequently the reason why the experimental point
        comes above chain line at one point is considered to be an
        enhancement of the indicated heat efficiency. </p>
      <p>FIG. 44 shows the change in indicated heat efficiency
        .eta..sub.i when changing Gh/Gg and the excessive air ratio. It
        is impossible to compare this directly with the conditions of
        FIG. 43 because of the different adding time, but the
        enhancement of indicated heat efficiency with increases in
        excessive air ratio is definite, except for the range of
        decrease in indicated heat efficiency by imperfect combustion at
        the time when the combustion is about to discontinue. This is
        why it is considered that when approaching air cycle cyan
        increase in excessive air ratio, thermal loss decreases upon a
        fall of the combustion temperature. Moreover, the theoretical
        thermal efficiency .eta..sub.th of the auto-cycle of air only
        under the conditions of this experiment is approximately 47%. </p>
      <p>FIG. 45 illustrates an example of applying the system of the
        invention to an electric automobile. </p>
      <p>Film 50 has holes and is sandwiched between two plastic film
        plates 51, and film 50 is fixed in box 49. The platinum plates
        serve as electrodes, and the air at room temperature freely
        enters through the hole 52. When hydrogen from the hydrogen
        generating apparatus 39 is supplied from hole 53 and exposed to
        gas mixed with oxygen within the air, one electrode produced a
        voltage of 1 V. If N volts are required, N electrodes are
        mounted in the box. Since a thin electrode, like a micro chip,
        has high energy efficiency, it is possible for an electrode
        weighing 1 kg. to produce electric power of 1 kw. Part of the
        electric power serves as a supply source of power supply circuit
        15 for the energy system of the invention via 54, and most of
        the electric power is supplied to the motor 56 for driving the
        wheels 55 of automobile. An apparatus incorporating this film
        fuel battery and hydrogen generating apparatus into one unit is
        also contemplated by the invention. </p>
      <p>FIG. 45 shows an example of the invention wherein fuel
        batteries are placed sideways (horizontally). FIG. 46 shows an
        example of the invention wherein fuel batteries 57 are placed
        longitudinally and hydrogen 4 and air 58 are fully used when
        rising to contact the electrodes 51. </p>
      <p>FIG. 47 shows an example of the invention comprising an
        electric automobile wherein solar batteries are attached to the
        outside of the roof 59 and the upper side of hood 60 and trunk
        lid 61. The hydrogen generating apparatus 39 is fixed at the
        rear portion 39' or front portion 39" within the car, and the
        film batteries 57 are attached to the inside of roof 59.
        Electric power is obtained by supplying to the film fuel battery
        57 hydrogen produced by the hydrogen apparatus 39 and by
        electric power generated from the solar batteries operating by
        sun light, together with air. The electric power together with
        part of electric power from solar battery 62 is supplied to the
        motor 56 driving the wheels 55. </p>
      <p>The outlet pipe 20 of the system is fixed within the suction
        pipe of a ready-made gasoline engine to cause the following
        effects: </p>
      <p>1-(1) The limit of discontinuance of combustion, with thin fuel
        density is increased. The invention has the effect that the
        equivalent ratio of the limit in driving with thin fuel can more
        effectively be reduced as the load decreases. </p>
      <p>1-(2) The invention has the noticeable effect that it is
        possible to adequately increase combustion speed of the engine
        and accelerate the speed of combustion of thin mixed gas on
        turbulent flow under the condition that the mixed gas is thin
        and mixing rate is small. </p>
      <p>1-(3) In accordance with the invention, the maximum pressure
        within the cylinder rises, the ignition time for MBT is delayed,
        the exhaust temperature falls, the drop of indicated horsepower
        is less when increasing the air excessive ratio, and the
        indicated heat efficiency is enhanced. </p>
      <p>1-(4) The invention has the effect that, when less than an
        equivalent rate of 1, the NO exhaust ratio at the lag angle of
        ignition decreases in comparison with the case when using
        gasoline only, even at same equivalent rate. The NO exhaust
        decreases at an ignition time for MBT of 1.0 to 1.1. </p>
      <p>1-(5) The invention has the effect that it is possible to lower
        the HC exhaust ratio at a rarefied area. Because of its expanded
        limit in discontinuance of combustion, the HC exhaust can
        control a sharp increase on the rarefied side of fuel. The C0
        exhaust is the same as the HC exhaust. As a result of driving at
        an air excessive ratio equal to or exceeding 1.0, the absolute
        value becomes low. The HC exhaust can prevent sharp increases of
        HC exhaust around the discontinuance of combustion with the
        value of excessive air ratio. </p>
      <p>1-(6) CO exhaust does not increase sharply around the same
        discontinuance of combustion as the HC exhaust. As a result of
        driving at an excessive air ratio equal to or exceeding 1.0, the
        absolute value of the CO exhaust ratio is extremely low. </p>
      <p>1-(7) There is the effect that the cycle fluctuation ratio
        decreases in accordance with the invention and it decreases to
        approximately half at a 10% mixing ratio, resulting in an
        increase of the maximum pressure and a delay of MBT ignition
        time. </p>
      <p>1-(8) The rising ratio of pressure within the cylinder
        increases by adding hydrogen and the maximum pressure increases.
        In addition, the MBT ignition time is delayed. </p>
      <p>1-(9) The exhaust temperature decreases when hydrogen is added.
      </p>
      <p>1-(10) It is possible to expand the limitation in
        discontinuance of combustion in a large range of excessive air
        ratios by adding hydrogen. If the excessive air ratio is
        increased, the indicated heat efficiency is enhanced. </p>
      <p>1-(11) In order to decrease composition of air pollution
        exhausted from an automobile engine, a rarefied combustion
        method has been tried, but an engine for using this method is
        complicated in comparison with a conventional engine. The
        invention is an epoch making one which can realize low
        environmental pollution without changing the construction of
        conventional automobiles and engines. </p>
      <p>1-(12) Hydrogen has a wide combustion range, high combustible
        speed, lower ignition energy and is adaptable to more easily
        making uniform mixed gas, as compared with gasoline. Therefore,
        the invention is an epoch making one which can realize the
        combustion of thin mixed gas and decreases in exhausting nitric
        oxide by making use of these properties. </p>
      <p>1-(13) Since the system of the invention adequately controls
        the volume of hydrogen according to the size of load, thinness
        of mixed gas, size of mixing ratio and ignition time for MBT, it
        has the maximum effect on non environmental pollution and fuel
        saving. </p>
      <p>1-(14) The system of the invention, when assembling a
        controller, hydrogen generating apparatus and hydrogen tank, can
        make a hydrogen generating apparatus that is smaller and lighter
        than usual. </p>
      <p>1-(15) Even when using mixed gas close to limit of driving with
        thinned gas, safe driving similar to those when using normal
        distributed gas, can be obtained with the invention. </p>
      <p>1-(16) In addition to the effects when applying the invention
        to conventional gasoline engine as set forth above, the
        invention can eliminate air pollution, especially in the use of
        current diesel engine trucks, particularly with respect to
        exhaust gas discharged when driving at low speeds within a city,
        without changing the construction of the diesel engine truck. </p>
      <p>In addition to the advantages of the invention set forth above,
        the effect of the invention is: </p>
      <p>1. It is possible to make an automobile driven by hydrogen
        only, instead of mixing the hydrogen with gasoline, i.e. an
        automobile driven by water. </p>
      <p>2. In accordance with the invention it is possible to drive a
        motor bicycle, vessel, jet airplane, rocket (solar battery is
        used for power source and water is obtainable from space) and
        also to an operate electric power generator, aluminum
        refinement, furnace, iron manufacture, burner, etc. by using
        water. </p>
      <p>4. Since energy that has a clean exhaust can be obtained, such
        problems as the exhaust gas of automobile and exhaust materials
        from atomic power generation do not occur. </p>
      <p>5. A particular liquid such as an electrolytic liquid is not
        required and regular water is usable. Therefore, water is
        obtainable from water taps and there is no need of going to a
        gas station. </p>
      <p>6. The energy converting ratio is as high as 95% </p>
      <p>7. Since the system is small and light and it is also operated
        by battery and portable, it can be placed in small space such as
        under the hood of an automobile, and is usable for conveyances
        such as automobiles. </p>
      <p>8. Oxygen obtained together with the hydrogen can not only
        improve the cabin environment of automobile, etc. but can also
        prevent traffic accident by preventing the sleeping of the
        driver and by improving the driver's attentiveness. </p>
      <p>9. The invention quickly takes away produced foam of hydrogen
        from film 8 when driving the car or engine, and also by placing
        the water tank 6 at a high position, and the method of
        connecting pipe 9 so that pressure of water on electrolytic film
        is increased. Therefore, permeation of water 1 into electrolytic
        film 11 is accelerated and the electrolytic effect is larger
        than publicly known. </p>
      <p>10. Since the invention can heat water with the semi-conductors
        used for the power source and at the same time cool
        semi-conductors, it is superior in efficiency and reduces the
        size of the apparatus. </p>
      <p>11. A rise in water temperature does not flow backward to the
        side of water tank but is concentrated on the side of
        electrolytic film only. Consequently, the water temperature can
        rise effectively with less energy. </p>
      <p>12. It is possible for the operating voltage to be controlled
        to be 10% lower by increasing the water temperature. </p>
      <p>13. Electric cars, etc. superior in efficiency can be made by
        the system of the invention, in combination with the film
        battery set forth above. </p>
      <p>The invention has an ideal effect as a new energy source and is
        a revolutionary one, providing the same influence as the
        industrial revolution caused by James Watt's steam locomotive. </p>
      <p>In addition to the above, the invention may be employed with a
        methanol car, a solar cell car, and electric car, a CNG car, a
        hydrogen car, a gas turbine car, a Sterling cycle engine, a
        hydro car (electric+diesel), and a carjointly using LPG, etc.
        Variations other than mentioned above are contemplated and
        considered to be within the scope of the invention. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been disclosed and described with
        reference to a single embodiment, it will be apparent that
        variations and modification may be made therein, and it is
        therefore intended in the following claims to cover each such
        variation and modification as falls within the true spirit and
        scope of the invention.</p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An energy system comprises a solid
        polyelectrolyte film in the water bath, and a source of electric
        current connected to the film, for generating hydrogen. The
        hydrogen is mixed with gasoline in an amount, dependent upon the
        size of load on the engine, the thinness of the mixed gas, the
        size of the mixing ration, and the ignition time, to obtain the
        minimum time for the best torque (MBT).</p>
