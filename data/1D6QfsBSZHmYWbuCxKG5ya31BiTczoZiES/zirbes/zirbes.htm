      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Excerpts : Brian Desborough :
        "Why I Wrote "They Cast No Shadows"</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      "Sadly, I was only able to give passing recognition on page 72 to
      a great scientist whose name and scientific work should be as well
      known to every high school student as that of Einstein, yet has
      been totally ignored by the scientific community. He is the late
      Lloyd Zirbes, who was never able to have his twenty five years of
      research published; his harassment included the destruction of his
      laboratory by arson. Contemporary physics theories, including the
      work of Albert Einstein, have been built upon the laws of Newton,
      who in turn based his work on the writings of Galileo. According
      to academia, Galileo demonstrated that objects of equal mass but
      of different physical materials e.g. lead and feathers, fall at
      the same rate of acceleration in a vacuum. Lloyd Zirbes was
      astounded to discover that Galileo never made any tests on falling
      bodies, his claims were pure supposition. Zirbes accordingly
      conducted an experiment in which a <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">sphere of iron and a sphere of graphite of equal weight
        were simultaneously dropped down a two thousand feet mineshaft.
        At the bottom of the shaft, the final few feet of the fall was
        recorded by means of a high speed camera.</span><br>
      <br>
      "Amazingly, the graphite sphere, although considerably larger than
      the iron sphere because of its lower density, and therefore prone
      to more wind resistance, impacted when the iron sphere was still
      six feet from impact. A similar experiment using spheres of other
      metals revealed that the<span style="font-weight: bold;"> iron
        sphere still impacted later than all the other spheres.
        Moreover, the spheres diverged considerably from each other
        prior to impact and also developed a specific rotation when
        falling.</span><br>
      <br>
      "So what? Only that the work of Galileo, Newton and later
      scientists was very badly flawed; Zirbes research suggested that
      the sun is not a gigantic fusion reactor as claimed by academia,
      but rather consists of thousands of individual bodies which
      release energy by means of the interaction between their
      respective gravity fields. In other words, the sun’s energy
      production is by mechanical not nuclear means, something also
      claimed by that brilliant scientist and Sumerian scholar, Dr.
      George Merkl.<br>
      <br>
      After twenty five years of research, Zirbes invented a device
      which created gravity. So successful was the first test that
      everything in the lab that was not bolted down, degravitated and
      flew around, severely injuring the hapless Zirbes in the process.
      While he was hospitalized, his laboratory, van and some of his
      research notes were destroyed in an arson fire.<br>
      <br>
      Zirbes stated that there are only two fundamental forces in the
      universe: motion and gravity. I feel this statement should be
      modified to read that gravity is compressed, or folded magnetism.
      Magnetism appears to be the glue that holds the univese together,
      something which can be illustrated by studying the 525 HP Rory
      Johnson free energy motor, which now has been classified by the US
      government, in order to prevent its incorporation into the
      Greyhound Bus Company coaches.<br>
      <br>
      Among the many things that could be achieved by the application of
      the Zirbes physics is the injection of contained gravity into any
      physical matter in order to rearrange the atomic structure, thus
      producing any desired element.Intelligence (audio and video) could
      be modulated onto a pulsed Zirbes gravity generator, thus
      broadcasting gravity.<br>
      <br>
      Since the Zirbes research material has never been officially
      published, the reader may be wondering why I am familiar with it.
      One balmy night several years ago, I attended a garden party in
      Santa Barbara, California. Suddenly a stranger approached me from
      out of the gloom and said that he felt that he had to gatecrash
      the party to deliver a package to someone that he didnt know, and
      intuitively felt that the person was myself. When I looked at the
      thick file of papers later, I discovered that it was a copy of
      Lloyd Zirbes’ research data.<br>

      The late geomagnetic researcher Dr. Lloyd Zirbes discovered that
      Galileo's suppositions are complete error. He proved that Newton's
      law of gravity is also an error. This puts the foundation of
      science and technology of our world on error and lies. You can't
      build a world on error, or it will fall. It is unfortunate that we
      are the "last generation" Mat.24:34 who will "witness" the END of
      the WORLD.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Zirbes strongly opposed the technology utilized in the HAARP
      system. He wrote, 'Disruption of the Earth's magnetic field will
      complete damages to the planet's balance done by the government
      nuclear bomb blasts in the natural radiation belts above the
      ionosphere. Earth's magnetic field keeps the planet in balance
      with the moon and sun. Disrupting the field will be the last straw
      in sending Earth into the sun or out into space."<br>

      A Minnesota farmer, checking his trap lines, is abducted on his
      way home at night, an taken aboard an alien vehicle, along with a
      neighboring family, who were already aboard. The farmer, Lloyd
      Zirbes, was shown on viewing screens the deficiencies in our
      understanding of physics, and also shown the forces behind all
      motion and creation. The "Falling Bodies Theory" demonstrated is
      so profound that Zirbes had to begin taking college-level physics
      courses in order to understand the Alcyon E.T.s' theories.<br>
      <br>
      Zirbes has now become a professor of physics, and offers the
      alien's "Falling Bodies Theory" concepts to academia.<br>
      <br>
      The Zirbes case is also noteable in that it is another valid case
      of UFO Contact from the Pleiades star cluster, demonstrating again
      that the Pleiades is an area of our galaxy from where a number
      of&nbsp; ET contacts on Earth are originating.<br>

      The larger something is (the more mass it has) or the faster it
      spins, or both, then the more of a local gravity field it produces
      as it spins. Earth spinning and floating in space is an example.
      The huge mass of our planet is floating in the sun's gravity
      field, but our planetary rotation allows our planet to create its
      own "local" gravity field preventing us from crashing into the
      sun. The very bottom of a tornado (a type of vortex) is a smaller
      mass but so concentrating and rapidly spinning that it creates a
      counter flow of gravitons in outward radiation - it generates its
      own "local" field of gravitons. Each graviton is1 80th the size of
      an electron. This field causes a local gravity field that
      temporarily cancels the surrounding Earth gravity. This is why
      houses and locomotives have been seen to float in the air next to
      tornados - the tornado's local gravity field temporarily cancels
      the Earth &amp; Sun gravity fields because it's gravitons are more
      in number than the others in the area. Graviton movement flowing
      through substances while having a polarizing effect is also the
      ultimate source of all electricity and magnetism, but most
      scientists and engineers are not aware of this. Definitely not
      taught in school.<br>

      Your interest in the “Flux-O-Matic Motor” as an Alternative Energy

      Early in 1990 I became the steward of seven sets of blueprints
      which were the draft and/or design drawings for construction of
      the “Flux-O-Matic Motor”, an alternative energy source capable of
      creating, gathering, and generating electromagnetic energy through
      a self-sustaining static charge.<br>
