            Vehicle Exhaust Fumes at the Source</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Nova Institute of Technology introduces a breakthrough technology
      for removing all vehicle exhaust fumes before they leave the
      tailpipe. The Corona Discharge Gas Plasma Disassociation System™
      (CO2 device) can also be adapted to gas vents used in refineries,
      exhaust stacks for incinerators, and implemented in more than 100
      other common uses.<br>
      <br>
      SALT LAKE CITY, Sept. 25, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- David G. Yurth,
      principal inventor and co-founder of Nova Institute of Technology,
      a privately-owned research and development group located in Salt
      Lake City, Utah, announced today the successful testing of The
      Corona Discharge Gas Plasma Disassociation System™ (CDGPDS™), a
      compact, lightweight, low-cost energy efficient device that
      eradicates all exhaust fumes produced by internal combustion
      engines before they leave the tailpipe.<br>
      <br>
      States Yurth: "The CO2 device can be retrofitted to every internal
      combustion engine on the planet. The device can also be adapted
      for use in gas vents used in refineries, exhaust stacks for
      incinerators, and more than 100 other common uses."<br>
      <br>
      CDGPDS™ incorporates proprietary plasma generating devices with
      high speed switching circuits to create what is known as a
      fracturing field inside a pulsating plasma chamber located within
      the exhaust system. The fracturing field breaks down or
      "dissociates" carbon dioxide and other pollutants within the
      device itself, thus eliminating the problem before it manifests.<br>
      <br>
      "The challenge with dissociating carbon dioxide is that unlike
      most other three-atom gas molecules, CO2 is a very stable gas,"
      says Yurth. "We have succeeded in demonstrating virtually 100%
      efficiency in the dissociation process because we have been able
      to propagate what is known as non-linear dissonance in the plasma
      chamber."<br>
      <br>
      States Dr. Michael Kralik, Senior Physicist and Chief Science
      Officer for Nova: "Carbon dioxide molecules behave according to a
      well-known set of harmonic resonances which generate the fields
      that attract and bind the oxygen atoms to the central carbon atom.
      By subjecting the gas to intensely dissonant field effects, we are
      able to disrupt the spin polarity and oscillation frequencies that
      bind the atoms together."<br>
      <br>
      According to Yurth and Kralik, the search for a solution to the
      production and release of carbon dioxide and other potent
      greenhouse gases has been the target of intensive research for
      more than 40 years.<br>
      <br>
      "The stability of the CO2 molecule has resisted other attempts to
      break it down using a long list of excitation technologies,
      including microwaves, radio frequency pulses, lasers,
      electromagnetic fields, and various plasma field effects," says
      Yurth. "Thus far, the scientific literature has reported only
      nominal success using these methods under carefully controlled
      laboratory conditions."<br>
      <br>
      The CO2 device is the result of Nova's joint technology
      development arrangement with Collier Group, LLC and SaviCorp, a
      publicly traded supplier of the DynoValve® family of automotive
      products since 2004.<br>
      <br>
      States Kevin Collier, CEO of Collier Group: "The system developed
      by Nova's design engineers can be retrofitted to the tailpipe of
      the exhaust system and powered by less than 20 amps of current.
      When we manufacture and distribute these units for mass
      consumption in the automotive after-market installation and retail
      outlets, no modifications to the vehicle's electrical system will
      be required. The Nova system will be compact, lightweight, low
      cost, and very energy efficient."<br>

          </b><b>PLASMA IGNITION PLUG FOR AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE</b></big><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      A plasma ignition plug for an internal combustion engine has a
      thorium alloyed tungsten anode separated from a vanadium- or
      beryllium-alloyed copper cathode by a boron nitride ceramic powder
      insulator. A generally semi-spherical titanium emitter is
      electrically coupled to the anode and disposed within an end of
      the insulator so as to form an annular gap with a torus on the end
      of the cathode. The surface of the emitter protrudes slightly
      beyond the rim of the torus on the cathode. High amplitude pulses
      driven into the anode arc across the annular gap to the cathode at
      more than twenty-four spots simultaneously, generating a plasma
      ignition front.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [Para 2] This invention is directed to an ignition source for use
      with internal combustion engines. More particularly, the invention
      is directed to a plasma ignition plug designed to replace a spark
      plug. The plasma generated by the inventive ignition plug
      increases molecular dissociation of the fuel such that virtually 1
      00% combustion is achieved, with a decrease in heat generation, an
      increase in horsepower, and near complete remediation of the
      exhaust profile.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 3] The purpose of this invention is to create a device for
      use in internal combustion engines that induces combustion of
      petroleum-based fuels by plasma propagation. Plasma ignition
      properties are not currently provided by conventional spark
      ignition devices such as spark plugs. The field of spark-type
      devices is densely populated by more than 1 ,000 patented spark
      emitter and plasma propagation devices. The field of plasma-arc
      igniter systems is also densely populated but largely relegated to
      uses not affiliated with internal combustion engines. All such
      devices are typically comprised of (a) an anode bar which is
      inserted longitudinally through the center of (b) an insulating
      porcelain material comprised of a vitreous or glassine ceramic of
      various types, (c) a fitted metallic cathode material comprised of
      various materials, which is affixed to the ceramic insulating
      material using various strategies and techniques, (d) all of which
      incorporate a wide variety of spark-gap geometries ranging from a
      simple spark bar separated from the tip of the anode bar to
      various types of cages, plates, layered materials, and other
      strategies intended to amplify or enhance the effectiveness of the
      spark emitted into the cylinder of the engine during ignition
      cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 4] The current invention is distinguished from all prior art
      devices of the same class by (a) the materials incorporated into
      its design, (b) the geometry of its ignition tip, and (c) its
      electronic and electrical properties. A singular and common
      short-coming of spark plugs in general is that the metallic
      elements incorporated into their manufacture are incapable of
      emitting a spark across the ignition gap that efficiently ignites,
      beyond a finite limit, the air and fuel droplets compressed in the
      cylinder during the detonation phase. The limitations of current
      'spark emitter' devices are the product of (a) marginal
      conductivity of the metallic elements, (b) electrical persistence
      demonstrated by the metallic elements, and (c) a finite limit to
      electrical saturation provided by the porcelain ceramic insulating
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 5] The normal air-to-fuel ratio supported by conventional
      devices is generally recognized as 1 4.7: 1 . Newer engines have
      recently been manufactured which operate at an elevated ratio of
      22: 1 . This elevated level of air-to-fuel mixtu res represents
      the upper limit of operability in conventional internal combustion
      engine devices because the amou nt of electrical current
      (including a number of variable input properties) that can be
      tolerated by conventional spark plugs cannot exceed this level of
      performance. In order to efficiently detonate a fuel-air mixture
      at a higher ratio the ignition source must be designed to tolerate
      much higher current levels, faster switching times, and higher
      peak amplitudes than can be supported by any currently available
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 6] The present invention fulfills these needs and provides
      other related advantages.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [Para 7] The inventive plasma ignition plug incorporates the
      following elements into its design:<br>
      <br>
      [Para 8] Electrical Saturation: The conventional porcelain
      glassine ceramic insulation material used in spark plugs of
      current manufacture is replaced by a vitreous machinable ceramic,
      such as boron-nitride. Vitreous machinable ceramics such as
      boron-nitride are available in various formulations and generally
      reduce to a glassine ceramic crystalline insulator when exposed to
      appropriately applied temperatures and pressures. Other examples
      include RESCOR™ alumina and alumina silicate machinable ceramics
      provided by Catronics Corp. Such machinable ceramic insulator
      materials provide elevated electrical saturation limits which are
      shown by manufacturer's specifications to exceed conventional
      porcelain spark plug insulation materials by as much as 1 800
      times. The use of such materials renders the current invention
      capable of supporting input levels of current in the range of 75
      ,000 volts DC at up to 7.5 amperes. Tests demonstrate that
      electrical current applied at this level breaches the tolerances
      of the most advanced conventional devices resulting in
      catastrophic failure in identical test protocols within less than
      1 5 seconds. The test results for the current invention
      demonstrate its ability to accommodate switched and sustained
      inputs at this level for indefinite periods without damage or
      deterioration.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 9] Switching Times: The nature of spark-type ignition
      devices of current manufacture induces residual persistence of
      each electrical impulse as it is delivered by the ignition coil
      and distributor apparatus. Beyond a certain switching threshold,
      shown by manufacturers of the best commercially available
      racing-type spark plugs to be less than 5 milliseconds, the spark
      arc passing from the anode to the cathode at each ignition event
      becomes a continuous arcing sequence. The result of this
      material-based limitation is that a significant amount of the
      induced spark impulse is retained by the metallic materials of the
      spark plug and not delivered to the gases in the cylinder. It has
      been repeatedly shown that the efficiency of combustion in an
      ignition system is a function of numerous combined variables,
      including (a) switching times, (b) amplitude peaks, (c) pulse
      duration, (d) pulse discriminator curve slopes, (e) resonance,
      capacitance and impedance in the arc emitter, and (f) insulation
      efficiencies. The current invention resolves the issues which
      limit the performance of conventional spark-emitter devices by
      including in its manufacture (a) thorium-alloyed tungsten as the
      anode material, (b) titanium as the plasma emitter tip, (c)
      vitreous machinable ceramics as the ceramic insulation material,
      and (d) beryllium-alloyed copper as the cathode housing. These
      materials demonstrate electrical discharge persistence at less
      than 2.1 x 1 0&lt;"6&gt;watts per pulse at 75 ,000 volts @ 6.5
      amps when switched at intervals of 5 x 1 O&lt;-7&gt;seconds with 5
      x 1 0&lt;-8&gt;discriminator durations. This performance level is
      fully 1 000 times better than any conventionally manufactured
      spark emitter yet manufactured.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 1 0] Combustion Efficiency: The nature of the ignition cycle
      in internal combustion engines relies on (a) the ratio and
      efficiency with which air is mixed with finely atomized fuel vapor
      inside the cylinder, (b) the amount of heat and pressure applied
      to the air-fuel mixture in the cylinder prior to ignition, (c) the
      properties of the ignition source, and (d) the geometry of the
      physical apparatus in which the fuel is combusted. The current
      invention increases combustion efficiency by enabling the
      combustion of air-to-fuel mixtures in the range of 30: 1 - 40: 1 ,
      with a resulting increase in actual output in the form of usable
      horsepower, a concomitant reduction in fuel consumption per unit
      of output, a decrease in the operating temperature of the engine,
      and substantial remediation of the exhaust constituents, to as
      little as 1 .0 parts-per-million to 2.5 parts-per-billion. The
      current invention accomplishes this by (a) delivering an ignition
      source that is at least 1 000 times greater in amplitude than a
      conventional spark plug, and (b) introducing a dissociating plasma
      field prior to the ignition event which serves to fully dissociate
      the long-chain hydrocarbon molecules characterizing
      petroleum-based fuels. By exposing virtually all carbon ions held
      in the molecular chain to free oxygen molecules carried by the air
      component of the fuel-air mixture, the percentage of carbon ions
      which are effectively oxidized results in a substantial increase
      in ignition pressure output and virtual elimination of un-ignited
      carbon particulates in the exhaust profile.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 11] Plasma-Induced Ignition: Plasma-induced ignition of
      compressed mixtures of petroleum-based fuels and air has been
      shown to (a) increase combustion efficiency, (b) increase
      combustion effectiveness, (c) increase work- function output, (d)
      reduce operating temperatures, and (e) remediate exhaust emission
      profiles. To date it has not been possible to introduce an
      effective plasma-based ignition component to conventional internal
      combustion engines because the materials used to manufacture
      conventional spark plugs are incapable of accommodating the
      electrical and signal input levels required to create plasma
      fields which can be sufficiently dense, adequately amplified, and
      effectively switched in extended operation.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 12] In one particular embodiment, a plasma ignition plug
      according to the present invention includes a generally
      cylindrical insulating body having a proximal end and a distal
      end. A central anode is coaxially disposed within the insulating
      body and generally coextensive therewith. A generally semi-
      spherical or hemispherical emitter is disposed in the distal end
      of the insulating body and electrically connected to the central
      anode. A terminal is disposed in the proximal end of the
      insulating body and electrically connected to the central anode. A
      generally toroidal cathode sleeve is coaxially disposed around the
      distal end of the insulating body and forms an annular gap between
      the cathode sleeve and the emitter.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 1 3] The equatorial diameter of the emitter is approximately
      equal to the inner diameter of the hollow insulating body. The
      cathode sleeve is preferably threaded and configured to be
      compatible with a threaded port on an internal combustion engine.
      The insulating body is preferably made from a vitreous, machinable
      ceramic. A preferred example of such a material is boron nitride
      ceramic powder compressed with a machinable composition, which is
      subsequently heated and compressed to a glassine crystalline
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 1 4] The central anode is preferably made from a
      thorium-alloyed tu ngsten. The emitter is preferably made from
      titanium and press-fitted onto the central anode. The cathode
      sleeve is preferably made from beryllium- alloyed copper or
      vanadium-alloyed copper.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 1 5] The emitter preferably extends beyond the distal end of
      the cathode sleeve. The insulating body electrically insulates the
      central anode from the cathode sleeve along its length. The
      annular gap formed between the emitter and the torus on the distal
      end of the cathode sleeve is not interrupted by the insulating
      body.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 1 6] The plasma ignition plug may be constructed using the
      general shapes and configurations described above, the materials
      described above, or a combination of both. [Para 1 7] Other
      features and advantages of the present invention will become
      apparent from the following more detailed description, taken in
      conjunction with the accompanying drawings, which illustrate, by
      way of example, the principles of the invention.<br>

      [Para 26] The inventive plasma ignition plug 1 0 is designed to
      accommodate a specially designed plasma emitter shown in separate
      tests to emit a highly energized arc-driven plasma field when
      subjected to a properly designed power supply and switching
      system. The device as shown in FIGS 1 -4 is constructed of (a) an
      anode 1 2 made from thorium-alloyed tungsten rod stock, (b) an
      insulator 1 4 made from a vitreous machinable ceramic material
      such as boron-nitride, (c) a hemispherical field emitter 1 6 made
      from titanium, and (d) a cathode sleeve 1 8 made from either
      beryllium-alloyed copper or vanadium-alloyed copper. The cathode 1
      8 has a torus-shaped ring 20 near the emitter 1 6. The body of the
      cathode 1 8 is preferably tooled and threaded 22 to fit into an
      engine port configured to receive a spark plug in a typical
      internal combustion engine. A terminal or ignition input cap 24 is
      press-fitted on the end of the anode 1 2 opposite the cathode 1 8.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 27] The inventive plasma ignition plug delivers much higher
      current to the ignition cycle in nanosecond bursts. Instead of
      simply producing an ignition arc, the inventive plasma plug
      produces a plasma so powerful that it disassociates water
      molecules in open air and burns them with a brilliant arc. When
      exposed to the plasma field of the inventive plasma ignition plug,
      gasoline molecules are broken into single ionic radicals which are
      then ignited by an equally powerful arc. The result is that fuel
      molecules are completely burned with hydrocarbon particulates
      being virtually eliminated in amounts less than 2.5 parts per
      billion. In addition, carbon monoxide is completely eliminated and
      the entire exhaust profile is remediated. When used in two- stroke
      oil additive vehicles, the six carcinogenic exhaust contaminants
      typically produced by such engines are completely eliminated.
      Vehicles tested with plasma ignition plugs according to the
      present invention demonstrate significant increases in horsepower
      output and gas mileage. Emission tests performed on such vehicles
      demonstrates a significant reduction or total elimination of the
      most dangerous exhaust contaminants. Additional components can be
      used with the inventive plasma ignition plugs to increase
      electrical discharge levels, control switching rates, recalibrate
      ignition timing, and recalibrate fuel-air ratios.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 28] The current invention resolves the underlying issues of
      prior art spark plugs by adopting the following design
      distinctions:<br>
      <br>
      [Para 29] Thorium-alloyed Tungsten Anode: Thorium-232 is useful as
      an alloy in devices that propagate finely controlled electronic
      systems because the 232 isotope of Thorium continuously emits free
      electrons (6.02 x 1 0&lt;1 7&gt;per square cm /sec) without also
      exhibiting the release of any of the other emission products
      associated with nuclear decay. In the inventive plasma ignition
      plug 1 0, the free electrons supplied by the Thorium-232 increase
      the amount of actual electron output by the emitter by 73.91 %.
      This amplifying feature renders the current invention functionally
      superior to any known devices of similar construction or
      application. The anode 1 2 is preferably made from thorium-alloyed
      tungsten (3%). The thorium-alloyed Tungsten anode rod allows for
      super fast switching with exceptionally low resistance. The
      material allows for free electron field saturation with virtually
      zero residual charge persistence.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 30] Beryllium-alloyed Copper Cathode: Conventional
      iron-based metals have been used in spark plug cathode systems for
      more than 1 30 years. This convention has been adopted because
      steel cathodes are strong, relatively inexpensive, and
      ubiquitously available. The short-comings of ferrous materials in
      spark-plug applications only become important when desired input
      values breach the tolerance thresholds that can be tolerated by
      this kind of material. The present invention resolves this problem
      by substituting beryllium-alloyed copper for conventional ferrous
      cathode materials. The alloy of copper with beryllium has the
      effect of (a) increasing the tensile strength of copper, (b)
      increasing the softening point of copper, and (c) amplifying the
      conductivity of copper in environments of elevated temperatures.
      The cathode 1 8 is preferably made from beryllium-alloyed copper
      or vanadium-alloyed copper. The beryllium-alloyed copper cathode
      provides extremely high conductance with amplified dielectric
      potential and superior tensile strength compared to copper.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 31 ] Titanium Plasma Emitter: The point of greatest exposure
      to deterioration in every spark-emitter type device is the tip of
      the spark-emitting anode. Recent advancements in materials
      technologies have produced anode tips that are thinly coated with
      materials such as platinum and iridium. When the test data of such
      coating materials is reviewed, it is clear that the actual output
      of work-function in the form of usable energy is not improved by
      the addition of these coating materials. Additionally, while the
      life-expectancy of anode tips exposed to conventional input
      discharge impulses may have been extended by this modification,
      conventional anode tips coated with platinum or iridium
      catastrophically fail within 1 5 seconds or less when exposed to
      the input levels required to create and propagate a continuous
      series of plasma bursts.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 32] The present invention solves this problem by
      substituting a spherical propagation element or emitter 1 6
      comprised of high purity titanium. The emitter 1 6 is preferably
      on the order of 1⁄4 inch in diameter - presented as either a
      sphere or a hemisphere. The thorium-alloyed tungsten anode rod 1 2
      is press-fitted to the titanium emitter 1 6 to constitute a
      strong, highly conductive component that is fundamentally
      resistive to deterioration under continuous operation at the
      levels contemplated for plasma generation. When assembled with the
      cathode 1 8, the arc of the emitter 1 6 - whether a sphere or a
      hemisphere - protrudes beyond an end of the torus 20. The fact
      that titaniu m exhibits extremely low electrical capacitance in
      the form of residual charge persistence renders it ideal for this
      specific application. Titanium is also fundamentally resistant to
      deterioration when employed as a high voltage anode. The titanium
      plasma emitter provides extremely high resistance to high
      voltage/high amperage degradation with very low residual charge
      persistence, very low resistance, high surface area geometries,
      and extremely high temperature/pressure tolerance.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 33] Field Propagation Mapping: The sufficiency of an
      electrical arc as an ignition source in internal combustion
      engine-type devices is a function of (a) source charge amplitude,
      (b) source charge duration, (c) geometry at the tip of the
      emitter, and (d) surface area operating between the anode and
      cathode elements. In conventional spark plug devices, a single bar
      of approximately 0.1 25" diameter is separated from a cathode
      element by a gap which is typically in the range of 0.030" + /-.
      The highest efficiency devices (e.g., as approved by NASCAR and
      Formula 1 racing organizations) consist of a single platinum-
      coated spark bar tip surrounded by three or more cathode tips.
      This configuration has been adopted because it effectively
      increases the surface area upon which the spark arc can operate.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 34] The current invention optimizes the relationship between
      both the geometric and surface area components by using a
      spherical anode emitter 1 6 which is separated from a torus 20 of
      the beryllium-alloyed copper or vanadium-alloyed copper cathode 1
      8 by a gap of approximately 0.030 inches. The tip of the emitter
      hemisphere protrudes beyond the end of the torus 20 by
      approximately 0.020 inches. The vitreous machinable ceramic
      insulator 1 4 is situated within 0.030 inches of the exposed
      surface of the cathode torus 20. This combination of materials,
      along with curved geometric sections and a closely-fixed insulator
      floor provides a conductive surface area which is at least
      twenty-five times greater than the high performance NASCAR
      racing-type spark plugs. In addition, the configuration of the
      plasma ignition plug 1 0 forces the plasma field away from the tip
      of the propagation device towards the head of the piston. The
      combination of increased surface area has been shown to improve
      combustion effectiveness and efficiency by more than 68% when
      compared to NASCAR-type spark plugs in identical test applications
      under typical 4-cycle gasoline burning internal combustion engine
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 35] When high amplitude pulses are driven into the anode 1
      2, the arc that results reaches across the annular gap 26 at more
      than twenty-four spots simultaneously. Under conventional input
      from a standard alternator and ignition system (2500 rpm at 1 3.5
      volts DC and 30 amps, converted to 50,000 volts DC and 0.0036
      amps), the inventive plasma ignition plug 1 0 produces twenty-five
      times more ignition flame front than a conventional spark plug.
      When the ignition level is increased 1 ,800 times (75,000 volts DC
      and 6.5 amps), the spark front is replaced by a plasma. No
      conventional spark plug can tolerate current input levels such as
      this. At these conditions, the inventive plasma ignition plug 1 0
      increases molecular dissociation to near 1 00% combustion with a
      decrease in heat, an increase in horsepower, and near complete
      remediation of the exhaust profile.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 36] Combustion Efficiency: A gasoline-based fuel-air mixture
      creates an exhaust profile that is fundamentally different when
      ignited in the presence of a conventional spark plug as compared
      to a plasma field. The increased effect exerted by plasma fields
      on combustion dynamics results primarily from the molecular
      dissociation that is induced on the long-chain hydrocarbon
      molecules comprising the fuel by the plasma. Conventional
      combustion relies on the combination of (a) heat, (b) pressure,
      (c) effective homogeneous mixing of fuel and air molecules, and
      (d) an ignition source to oxidize hydrocarbon molecules by
      combustion. The burning of petroleum-based fuels in a pressurized
      environment typically creates cylinder-head pressures in the range
      of 450-550 psi during conventional internal combustion engine
      operation. In contrast, plasma-induced fuel combustion has been
      shown by the Russian Academy of Science to create cylinder-head
      pressures in the range of 1 1 20 psi under identical conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 37] The advantage of the use of a plasma-induced combustion
      cycle is that half the fuel mass normally combusted in a typical
      internal combustion engine-system can be oxidized to create the
      same work-fu nction output values, all other variables remaining
      unchanged.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 38] The inventive plasma ignition plug may also include mono
      atomic gold super conductors or orbitally reordered monotonic
      elements (ORME) within the emitter. Such ORME may comprise mono
      atomic transitional group eleven metallic powders, i.e., copper,
      silver, and gold. These powders exhibit type two super
      conductivity in the presence of high voltage in EM fields and
      induce type one super conductivity in contiguous copper and copper
      alloys.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 39] The control of switching rates relies on maximu m
      switching speeds of up to one hundred thousand cycles per minute
      at six hundred nanoseconds per pulse. Preferably, achievable
      switching rates include fifty nanosecond rise time plasma field
      propagation, two hundred nanosecond plasma field persistence,
      fifty nanosecond shutoff discriminator, fifty nanosecond rise time
      combustion arc, two hundred nanosecond combustion arc duration at
      one hundred times surface area, and fifty nanosecond shutoff
      discriminator. The increased electrical discharge levels
      preferably have an operating range of 1 3.5 volts DC at one
      hundred amps up to seventy-five thousand volts DC at 7.5 amps. The
      plasma field is preferably less than or equal to 1 3.5 volts DC at
      forty-one thousand, six hundred sixty amps pulsed at two hundred
      nanoseconds. The combustion arc is preferably less than or equal
      to seventy five thousand volts DC at 7.5 amps pulsed at two
      hundred nanoseconds. The airfuel ratio is preferably adjusted from
      1 4: 7- 1 up to 1 4:40- 1 . The ignition timing adjustment is
      preferably digitally controlled to forty degrees before top dead
      center.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 40] In conjunction with the inventive plasma ignition plug,
      the electrical discharge cycle is also improved by advances in the
      ignition switching, the transformer coil, and the spark plug
      wiring harness. The transformer coil includes a novel
      electromagnetic core made from a nano-crystalline electromagnetic
      core material. Such nano-crystalline material exhibits zero
      percent hysteresis under load regardless of current levels.
      Vitroperm™ manufactured by Vacuum Schmelze GmbH &amp; Co. of Hanau
      , Germany is a preferred example of the nano-crystalline material
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 41 ] In combination with the nano-crystalline
      electromagnetic core material, the system designed for the
      electrical discharge cycle in combination with the inventive
      plasma ignition plug uses a special type of cable or wire designed
      to carry both alternating and direct currents. The wire is
      constructed so as to reduce "skin effect" or "proximity effect"
      losses in conductors used at frequencies up to about one
      megahertz. Such dual current wires consist of many thin wire
      strands individually insulated and twisted or woven together in
      one of several specifically prescribed patterns often involving
      several layers or levels. The several levels or layers of wire
      strands refers to groups of twisted wires that are themselves
      twisted together. Such a specialized winding pattern equalizes the
      proportion of the overall length over which each strand is laid
      across the outside surface of the conductor. While such dual
      current wires are not superconductive, they operate with extremely
      low resistance to rapid pulses of VDC current in the ranges
      discussed herein. When used as the primary winding material for
      transformer coils, this dual current wire almost completely
      eliminates resistance losses, back eddy currents, and other losses
      related to transforming VDC circuits. Such dual current wire is
      often referred to as litz wire and is primarily used in
      electronics to carry alternating current.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 42] Another novel material used in the inventive system that
      impacts the electrical discharge cycle is a dense core wire that
      incorporates intercalated tellurium 1 28 with highly pure copper
      windings - an alloyed solid core Tellurium-Copper wire. A
      particular version of this product goes by the brand name
      Tellurium-Q&lt;®&gt;manufactured by Tellurium-Q Ltd. out of
      England. This dense core wire was originally developed for use in
      high performance audio file systems to eliminate phase distortion
      between the amplifier and speaker components. When used as a
      replacement for spark plug wires such dense core wire provides
      current delivery from the transformer and switching system to the
      inventive plasma ignition plugs with virtually zero resistance and
      virtually complete absence of phase distortion. This means that
      the signal produced at the source can be delivered without
      degradation to the plasma ignition plug on a continuous basis.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 43] When a nano-crystalline electromagnetic core material
      such as Vitroperm™ and litz wire are combined to transform the
      current delivered by the alternator, they make it possible to
      create an integrated wire harness designed to incorporate the
      ignition transformer coil directly into each wire. Each wire has a
      separate ignition coil and switching module attached directly to
      its end just before it is connected to each plasma ignition plug.
      These integrated wire harness components are only possible because
      the heat losses due to resistance and hysteresis effects are
      virtually eliminated by the components themselves. Previous
      attempts to do something similar, i.e., drag racers and high
      performance engines used in Formula 1&lt;®&gt;, sometimes connect
      each spark plug wire to a separate ignition coil using digital
      output controllers to ensure that the output parameters do not
      overload the spark plugs. They also include feedback circuits and
      sensors tied to wireless monitoring systems. In the inventive
      system, each plasma ignition plug is tied to its own transformer
      and switching modu le built right into the wire itself.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 44] In addition, a novel wire harness sheathing is utilized
      in the inventive system to cover the wire harness, in-line
      transformers, and in-line switching systems. Fibers extruded from
      molten lava (basalt) in 0.5 micron diameter cross-sections are
      collected on spools, woven together, and used for various
      high-tech applications. The advantage of basalt fiber materials is
      that they have a softening temperature of twelve hundred degrees
      centigrade, which is the melting point of lava rock. Such
      materials are three times stronger than boron-doped graphite
      fibers of the same diameter and can be bonded together to create
      insulating materials that are flexible, exhibit extremely high
      resistance to electrical saturation, and cannot be degraded by
      heat. Such material is also absolutely non-conductive and exhibits
      zero static electricity when exposed to magnetic fields. Such
      basalt fiber encasement makes the wire harness components,
      including the dense core wire, in-line transformers, and digital
      switching modules virtually indestructible and extremely durable
      in persistent use.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 45] FIGURE 5 schematically illustrates a system on an
      original equipment manufacture (OEM) engine using the inventive
      plasma ignition plug 1 0. The OEM system 30 includes the vehicle
      battery 32 electrically connected to a fuse 34 which is in turn
      electrically connected to the ignition switch 36. The ignition
      switch 36 is connected to the alternator 38 which supplies power
      to the distributor module 40. Up to this point, the OEM system 30
      very closely resembles prior art designs. An output from the
      distributor module 40 connects to a spark controller 42 which in
      turn connects to a timing controller 44 that routes through a plug
      wire 46 to the plasma ignition plug 1 0. The spark controller 42,
      timing controller 44, and plug wire 46 are as described herein.
      All components of this OEM system 30 have appropriate grounding
      connections 48 as shown.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 46] FIGURE 6 schematically illustrates an integrated plug
      and wire retrofit system 50 for use with the inventive plasma
      ignition plug 1 0. In this retrofit system 50, a plug wire 46
      extends from the distributor module 40.<br>
      <br>
      Integral with the plug wire 46 is an integrated circuit board
      (ICB) switching element 52 and a transformer 54. The ICB switching
      element 52 is a high speed digitally controlled switch that is
      connected to the transformer 54. The transformer 54 consists of a
      nano-crystalline material EM torus 56 and primary and secondary
      windings 58 of dual current wires, i.e., litz wire. The switching
      element 52 and transformer 54 combine to output a pulse that is
      initially high amperage and then switched to high voltage. The
      output from the transformer 54 connects to a plug cap 60
      configured to connect directly to the plasma ignition plug 1 0.
      Again each of the components has an appropriate grounding
      connection 48 as shown. Preferably, the ICB switching element 52
      is controllable by a programmable microprocessor. The programmable
      microprocessor may be integrated with the ICB switching element 52
      or a separate component that is connected to the ICB switching
      element 52 and capable of controlling the same.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 47] Typically, the pulse switching discussed above will
      convert the output from the distributor module 40 first into a
      high amperage pulse, i.e., 1 3.5 volts DC at 30 amps, and then
      into a high voltage pulse, i.e., 50,000- 75,000 volts DC at 0.0036
      amps, with a total pulse duration of 200 n-sec. The purpose of the
      switched pulse is to take full advantage of the plasma ignition
      plug 1 0. When the plasma ignition plug 1 0 is pulsed with a very
      fast (50 n-sec) high-rise burst of high amperage (square wave at
      200 n-sec duration), the air fuel mixture is molecularly
      dissociated into individual radicals and ions in a plasma field.
      The plasma field is persistent even when the source of charge has
      been terminated. The rate at which the source charge is fully
      terminated is critical to the effectiveness of the dissociation
      function, so the switch must convert the plasma field into an
      ignition field very quickly (50- 1 00 n-sec).<br>
      <br>
      While the constituent radicals and individual ions are still in a
      dissociated plasma state, the introduction of the high voltage
      ignition source serves to excite the oxidation reaction with
      extremely high efficiency. This operates without a flame front
      because the entire field now operates as a single ignition point
      in a plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 48] That all constituents are temporarily suspended in a
      plasma field creates a unique circumstance. Instead of just mixing
      finely divided fuel droplets with intact air molecules which are
      by definition separated by distances in the double-digit micron
      range during compression, the constituent ions and radicals are
      held in atomic proximity. This brings then into a spatial
      relationship that is between 5 and 6 orders of magnitude closer
      than prior art fuel/air mixtures, while at the same time
      increasing surface area contact by a similarly exponential
      increase. This is one factor contributing to the conditions for
      complete combustion, i.e., all the ions and radicals of all the
      constituents. Such results in all of these constituents reacting
      instantaneously upon the introduction of high voltage while the
      plasma field continues to persist. When the constituents interact
      to oxidize the fuel, the amount of energy released is higher than
      with a prior art spark plug and ignition system because the
      ignition conditions have been fundamentally altered. These
      improvements have experimentally demonstrated a reduction in the
      amount of fuel to drive a load by 68%-73%, a reduction in engine
      operating temperatu re by as much as 80° F, fundamental alteration
      of exhaust profile, and high durability of plasma ignition plug 1
      0.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 49] An alternate retrofit system 62 is shown in FIG. 7. This
      alternate retrofit system 62 has a similar construction to that
      shown in the earlier systems including the battery 32, fuse 34,
      ignition switch 36, alternator 38 and distributor module 40. This
      system also includes an ignition module 64 electrically connected
      to the alternator 38. The ignition module 64 acts as a power
      transistor. In the alternate retrofit system 62 the plug wire 46
      extends directly from the distributor module 40 and includes an
      inline spark transformer 66 and an inline digital switch 68
      connected to the inventive plasma ignition plug 1 0. Again
      appropriate components have grou nding connections 48 as shown.
      The retrofit replaces the original spark plug wires with the new
      plug wire 46 including the inline transformer 66 and digital
      switch 68, along with the plasma ignition plug 1 0.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 50] In a particularly preferred embodiment, the inventive
      plasma ignition plug used in a four-cycle engine provides the
      following dynamics. The fuel is atomized to 0.4 micrometer
      diameter droplets mixed with air in a fuel injector/carburetor jet
      diameter of 0.056 centimeters. The air and fuel is injected into
      the cylinder and a ratio of 1 4: 7- 1 mixture. Plasma propagation
      occurs at an ignition point of twenty-two degrees before top dead
      center with the plasma field propagated at fifty nanosecond rise
      time, two hundred nanosecond duration, and fifty nanosecond
      shutoff duration at 1 3.5 volts DC at forty-one thousand, six
      hundred sixty amps. At these values, the plasma field
      disassociates long chain hydrocarbon molecules to individual ions,
      evenly distributed at atomic scale proximity under pressure. The
      following ignition arc occurs fifty nanoseconds after the collapse
      of the plasma field with an injection ignition impulse at
      seventy-five thousand volts DC at 7.5 amps for two hundred
      nanoseconds followed by a fifty nanosecond shutoff duration. The
      power stroke is driven by recombination and oxidation of the
      carbon fuel and oxygen ions up to sixty percent higher than
      conventional combustion. The exhaust stroke emissions exhibit up
      to forty-two percent lower carbon (2.5 PPMs), regularized N02,
      regularized S02, and virtual elimination of carbon monoxide and
      carbon dioxide. This plasma ignition plug produces more complete
      combustion with nanosecond timing intervals to reduce cylinder
      head temperatures by about eighty to one hundred twenty degrees
      Fahrenheit and exhaust temperatures by about sixty to eighty
      degrees Fahrenheit. When the ignition timing is adjusted to
      between thirty-five degrees and thirty-eight degrees before top
      dead center, horsepower increases by about fifteen to twenty-two
      percent depending upon the engine type and the fuel blend. When
      the air to fuel ratio is adjusted to 40: 1 , the break horsepower
      output increases with a reduction in fuel consumption by up to
      62.1 percent overall.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 51 ] The inventive plasma ignition plug produces similar
      benefits in a two-stroke engine. Two stroke exhaust emissions
      typically include benzene, 1 ,3-butadiene, benzo (a) pyrene,
      formaldehyde, acrolein, and other aldehydes. Carcinogenic agents
      exacerbate the irritation and health risks associated with such
      emissions. Two-stroke engines do not have a dedicated lubrication
      system such that the lubricant is mixed with the fuel resulting in
      a shorter duty cycle and life expectancy. Using the inventive
      plasma ignition plug, a two- stroke engine experiences ignition
      amplification where the normal magneto output (fifteen thousand
      volts DC at ten amps) is amplified about four times to sixty
      thousand volts at fourteen amps by virtue of the thorium-alloyed
      Tungsten anode. The spark discharge surface area is increased from
      a single spark bar (0.01 81 square inches) to the halo emitter
      (0.0745 square inches) - an increase of 4.1 69 times. The total
      spark discharge density increase is 23.251 times. The exhaust
      emissions profile in a two-stroke engine shows a decrease in
      hydrocarbon particulates by about eighty-seven percent,
      elimination of carbon monoxide, conversion of NOX to NO2 ,
      conversion of SOX to SO2, elimination of benzene, reduction of 1
      ,3 butadiene by eighty-four percent, elimination of formalins, and
      elimination of aldehydes. The horsepower is increased by 1 2.4
      percent and the engine temperature is decreased from two hundred
      sixty degrees Fahrenheit to about one hundred eighty-seven degrees
      Fahrenheit at six thousand RPM.<br>
      <br>
      [Para 52] A test series of the inventive plasma ignition plug was
      designed to (a) create a controlled vacuum with deliberately
      induced attributes, (b) visually observe and empirically measure
      the results of the tests, (c) conduct a series of tests based on
      incrementally controlled amounts of vaporized water, and (d)
      digitally record the test results at each segment. A testing rig
      consistent with the design of the plasma ignition plug 1 0 was
      constructed. In a test of a prototype plasma ignition plug, a
      fly-back transformer producing 75,000 volts AC at 3.0 amps created
      a clearly visible plasma field. Cold ionized water vapor generated
      by a conventional nebulizer was vented into the plasma field in
      open air. The water vapor was dissociated, ionized, and detonated
      in open air.<br>

      Eric, <br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Jack says he does not want to waste time on the idiot David Yurth;
      neither do I. That David Yurth is a liar, a fraud, and a
      pseudoscientist, for me is quite obvious. I expressed my opinion
      re Yurth on my webpage: <br>

      </b><br>
      After receiving two private emails from him, I had&nbsp; no doubt
      whatsoever that he was lying, because what he had written was an
      obvious disinformation. After that, I found the official info
      about a David Yurth's having been indicted for defrauding
      investors in Utah. Both Jack and I then asked Yurth (several
      times) whether or not it was him who had been indicted in Utah.
      Yurth, without answering the question, replied with yet another
      portion of bullshit; which led me (and I think Jack Sarfatti) to
      believe that the David Yurth indicted in 2000 and the David Yurth
      we were talking to were one and the same person. Ask Yurth; see
      what he replies. <br>
      <br>
      Alex, could you write me up your experience or understanding about
      Yurth cheating people?&nbsp;&nbsp; I provide web pages warning
      people about con men.<br>

      Also you should really do something about that slanderous phony

      Victor, do your homework before promoting Yurth's psycho-babble

      I am going to inform the FBI about false claims made by David

      laboratory. These claims cannot be true. Yurth is<b> </b>definitely





      attempting to defraud someone....<br>
      <br>
      I don't know, maybe we should inform the FBI about Yurth's
      attempts to defraud someone?<br>
      Obviously that is why Yurth has been backing up and defending the
      Russian torsion field fraud. Because Yurth is a fraud himself. <br>
      <br>
      Yurth has done time for defrauding investors and now he again is
      attempting to swindle someone. That is why he has been lying&nbsp;
      about his "contacts with Russian torsion experts" and his
      "experiments with torsion fields" and his "numerous papers on
      torsion". Yurth is swindling someone. Possibly he is helping the
      Russian frauds, Akimov et al, to swindle American investors.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      NB: on his webpage, David Yurth writes that he lives in Utah. And
      the fraud David Yurth, who was sentenced to jail, was sentenced in
      Utah: <br>
