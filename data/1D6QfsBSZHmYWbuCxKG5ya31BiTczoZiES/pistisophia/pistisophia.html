      <b><br>
      </b>IN the Introduction (pp. xxxv f.) to the first edition (1896),
      the translator wrote:<br>
      <br>
      "In presenting the following translation to the English-reading
      public, I may say that I should not have ventured on such an
      undertaking if any Coptic scholar had undertaken the task, or I
      had heard that such a task was contemplated. In a matter of so
      great difficulty every possible liability to error should be
      eliminated, and it stands to reason that the translation of a
      translation must needs be but an apology for a first-hand version.
      Nevertheless I am not without predecessors. The Coptic MS. itself
      is in the first place a translation, so that even Coptic scholars
      must give us the version of a translation. I am persuaded also
      that the anonymous and very imperfect French translation (1856) in
      the Appendix to Migne's Dictionnaire des Apocryphes (vol. i.) is
      made from Schwartze's Latin version (1851) and not from the Coptic
      text. C. W. King in The Gnostics and their Remains (2nd ed., 1887)
      has also translated a number of pages of the Pistis Sophia from
      Schwartze. Some three or four years ago Mr. Nutt, King's
      publisher, sent out a notice proposing the publication of the
      whole of King's translation, but the project fell through. Last
      year (1895) I offered to edit this translation of King's, but was
      informed that the literary legatee of the deceased scholar was of
      the opinion that it would be unfair to his memory to publish a MS.
      that was in so incomplete a condition.<br>
      <br>
      "In 1890 I had already translated Schwartze's Latin version into
      English and published pages 1 to 252, with comments, notes, etc.,
      in magazine-form from April 1890 to April 1891. But I hesitated to
      put it forward in book-form, and should not have done so, but for
      the appearance of Amélineau's French translation in 1895. I then
      went over the whole again and checked it by Amélineau's version. I
      was further induced to venture on this undertaking, because the
      narrative, though dealing with mystical and therefore obscure
      subjects, is in itself exceedingly simple, and therefore mistakes
      cannot so readily creep in as into a difficult philosophical work.
      I, therefore, present my translation with all hesitation, but at
      the same time think that the English public, which is steadily
      increasing its interest in mysticism and allied subjects, will be
      better satisfied with half a loaf than with no bread."<br>
      <br>
      A quarter of a century has rolled away; much water has flowed
      under the bridges of scholarly research whence the general stream
      of Gnosticism has been surveyed with greater accuracy, and much
      good work been done on the special subject of the Coptic Gnostic
      documents. Though the first edition of this book was quickly
      exhausted and many requests were made for a second, I had hitherto
      refused to accede to this demand, still hoping that some English
      Coptic scholar would take the matter in hand. Indeed, at one time
      I was in high expectation that this would be achieved. Shortly
      before the War a friend, whom I had interested in the work,
      completed a version of the fine Untitled Apocalypse of the Bruce
      Codex, and was next to have attempted a translation of the P.S.
      But pressing interests and activities of a totally different
      nature connected with the War and its aftermath have absorbed all
      my friend's energies, and the version of the P.S. has been
      definitely abandoned. Nor can I hear of any other project of
      translation. This being the case, and as the utility of even a
      translation of a translation is evidenced by the keen demand for
      the volume in the second-hand market, I have at last decided to
      repeat my venture.<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless a reprint of the first edition was not to be thought
      of. Introduction and translation needed revision in the light of
      twenty-five years' further study of the work of specialists. To
      this end the most valuable help, not to speak of his long labours
      on the allied documents, is afforded by Carl Schmidt's admirable
      German translation of the P.S. (1905).<br>
      <br>
      Schwartze's Latin translation was good for its date (1851), and
      scholars still quote it to-day; Amélineau's French rendering
      (1895) was somewhat of an improvement; but Schmidt's version is
      unquestionably the best. I have therefore revised my prior
      Englishing from the former two by the finer work of the latter.
      Schmidt is exceedingly careful throughout, and not only have I
      taken his decision where Schwartze and Amélineau differ, but have
      generally preferred him for consistency in phrasing. In my humble
      opinion it will be long before we have a better rendering than
      that of this ripe Coptic scholar.<br>
      <br>
      But not only has the Translation been thoroughly revised; the
      Introduction has been entirely rewritten and the Annotated
      Bibliography corrected and brought up to date. The second edition
      is practically a new book.<br>
      <br>
      The Schwartze-Petermann marginal pagination, which is the usual
      scheme of reference, and which in the first edition was shown in
      brackets in the text, is now indicated at the side of the page. I
      have also adopted Schmidt's division into chapters as an
      additional convenience for more general reference, and have
      numbered the verses of the Psalms and of the Odes of Solomon for
      easier comparison with the Repentances and Songs of Sophia. It
      should, of course, be understood that the detailed paragraphing
      does not exist in the original, which runs on for the most part
      monotonously without break.<br>

      <i>The Askew Codex. </i><br>
      THE unique MS. of the Coptic Gnostic document commonly called
      'Pistis Sophia' was bought by the British Museum in 1785 from the
      heirs of Dr. Askew, and is now catalogued as MS. Add. 5114. The
      title on the back of the modern binding is 'Piste Sophia Coptice.'
      On top of the first page of the MS. is the signature 'A. Askew,
      M.D.' On the first page of the binding is the following note,
      probably in the hand of Woide, the most famous Coptic scholar of
      those days and Librarian of the Museum:<br>
      <br>
      "Codex dialecti Superioris Ægypti, quam Sahidicam seu Thebaidicam
      votant, cujus titulus exstat pagina 115: Pmeh snaou ǹtomos
      ǹ̀tpiste Sophia -- Tomos secundus fidelis Sapientiæ -- deest
      pagina 337-344."<br>
      <br>
      The title 'Piste Sophia' is incorrect. Nowhere is this form found
      in the very numerous instances of the name in the text, and the
      hastily suggested 'emendation' of Dulaurier and Renan to read
      'Piste Sophia' thoughout has perforce received no support.<br>
      <br>
      Woide, in a letter to Michaelis (Bibliography, 4), says that Askew
      bought the MS. from a book-seller (apparently in London); its
      previous history is unknown. Crum informs us in an official
      description (Bib. 46, p. 173) that at the end of a copy in the
      B.M. of the sale-catalogue of Askew's MSS. is the entry: 'Coptic
      MS. £10. 10. 0.,' and that this refers presumably to our Codex --
      a good bargain indeed!<br>
      <br>
      The best descriptions of the MS. are by Schmidt (Introd. to his
      Trans., Bib. 45, pp. xi f.), and Crum (l.c.). The Codex is of
      parchment and contains 178 leaves = 356 pages 4to (8¾ x 6½ in.).
      The writing is in two columns of from 30 to 34 lines each. There
      are 23 quires in all; but the first has only 12 and the last 8
      pages, of which the last page is left blank. It is, as a whole, in
      an exceptionally well-preserved state, only 8 leaves being missing
      (see ch. 143, end).<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Scripts. </i><br>
      The writing as a whole is the work of two scribes, whose entirely
      different hands are very clearly distinguishable. The first (MS.
      pp. 1-22, 196-354) wrote a fine, careful, old uncial, and the
      second (MS. pp. 23-195) in comparison a careless, clumsy hand with
      signs of shakiness which S. thinks might suggest the writing of an
      old man. They used different inks and different methods both of
      paging and correction, not to speak of other peculiarities. These
      scribes must have been contemporaries and divided the task of
      copying fairly equally between them. So far Crum and Schmidt are
      in complete agreement; they differ only as to the handwriting of a
      note on MS. p. 114, col. 2, of the superscription on p. 115 and of
      the last page (see pp. 105, 106 and 325 of Trans.).<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Contents.</i><br>
      &nbsp;From an external point of view the contents fall into 4 main
      Divisions, generally referred to as Books i.-iv.<br>
      <br>
      i. The first extends to the end of ch. 62, where in the MS. more
      than a column and a half has been left blank, and a short, but
      entirely irrelevant, extract has been copied on to the second
      column, presumably from some other book of the general allied
      literature.<br>
      <br>
      There is no title, either superscription or subscription, to this
      Div. Why the second scribe left a blank here in his copying is a
      puzzle, for the text which follows on MS. p. 115 runs straight on
      without a break of subject or incident.<br>
      <br>
      ii. The next page is headed 'The Second Book (or Section) of
      Pistis Sophia.' Crum assigns this superscription to the second
      hand, and the short extract on the second column of the preceding
      page to the first. But Schmidt thinks that both are later
      additions by another hand, and this is borne out both by the
      colour of the ink and also by the very important fact that the
      older Coptic MSS. have the title at the end and not at the
      beginning of a volume, conserving the habit of the ancient
      roll-form. And as a matter of fact we find at the bottom of MS. p.
      233, col. 1, the subscription: 'A Portion of the Books (or Texts)
      of the Saviour' (see end of ch. 100).<br>
      <br>
      iii. There follows a short piece on the Gnosis of the Ineffable
      (ch. 101), which is without any setting and entirely breaks the
      order of sequence of ideas and is the end of a larger whole. It is
      clearly an extract from another 'Book.'<br>
      <br>
      After this again with ch. 102 we have a very distinct change of
      subject, though not of setting, from the ending of ii., so that,
      in my opinion, it is difficult to regard it as an immediate
      continuation. Later, at ch. 126, occurs another abrupt change of
      subject, though not of setting, preceded by a lacuna in the text.
      At the end of ch. 135 (bottom of MS. p. 318, col. 1) we have again
      the subscription: 'A Portion of the Books of the Saviour.'<br>
      <br>
      iv. The last piece has no title, either superscription or
      subscription. From the change of setting in its introduction and
      the nature of its contents it is generally assigned to an earlier
      phase of the literature. Here again a complete change of subject
      occurs with ch. 144, after a lacuna of 8 leaves. Finally, on the
      last page is an appendix, somewhat in the style of the
      Mark-conclusion, beginning quite abruptly in the middle of a
      sentence and presumably part of a larger whole. The contents,
      measurements and writing make it almost certain that it formed no
      part of the original copy. At the very end two lines surrounded by
      ornamentation are erased. These may have contained the names of
      the owner or scribes, or possibly a general subscript title.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Title. </i><br>
      From the above indications and from a detailed study of the
      contents it is evident that, though the episode of the adventures
      of Pistis Sophia, her repentances and songs and their solutions
      (chh. 30-64), occupy much space, it is by no means the principal
      theme of the collection; it is rather an incident. The blundering
      heading of a later scribe, 'The Second Book of Pistis Sophia,'
      some two-thirds of the way through this episode, has misled
      earlier scholars and set up the bad habit of referring to the
      whole document as the 'Pistis Sophia' -- a habit it is now too
      late to change. If there is any general title to be derived from
      the MS. itself, it should be rather 'A Portion' or 'Portions of
      the Books of the Saviour.' Whether this title can be made to cover
      Div. iv. is an open question. In any case we have before us
      extracts from a more extensive literature which belonged to the
      same group, and of which there were at least two strata. The
      contents of the Askew Codex are thus a collection or a miscellany,
      and not a single consistent work. It is very difficult, therefore,
      to distinguish the contents by any consistent nomenclature. I have
      followed the usual custom of calling the whole 'Pistis Sophia,'
      and let Divv. i. and ii. stand as Books i. and ii., as is usually
      done, though this is clearly improper, judged from the point of
      view of contents. Thereafter I have distinguished the extracts in
      Div. iii. as being from two different 'Books' (apart from the
      short insertion at the beginning), and again those in Div. iv. as
      being from two different 'Books,' these 'Books' meaning simply
      subdivisions of or excerpts from larger wholes.<br>
      <br>
      It seems highly probable that our scribes did not do the
      extracting themselves, but found it already done in the copy which
      lay before them.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Date of the MS.</i><br>
      &nbsp;The date of our MS. is undecided, owing to the difficulty of
      making exact judgments in Coptic paleography. The general view
      assigns it with Schmidt to the 5th century. It may be noted that
      Woide (Bib. 3) assigned it to the 4th, and Crum seems to agree
      with him. Hyvernat (Bib. 21) suggests the 6th, and Wright (Bib.
      16) the 7th. Amélineau (Bib. 35) goes to a ridiculous extreme by
      placing it in the 9th or 10th century, but his too radical views
      have been severely criticized.<br>
      <br>
      <b><i>Translated from the Greek. </i></b><br>
      The Coptic of the P.S. is in pure Sahidic--that is, the dialect of
      Upper Egypt, -- preserving many features of antiquity. It is,
      however, clearly not the original language in which the extracts
      were written. These, like the rest of the extant Coptic Gnostic
      documents, were originally composed in Greek. This is shown by the
      very large number of Greek words, not only names, but
      substantives, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and even conjunctions,
      left untranslated, on well-nigh every page, and this applies to
      the O.T. and N.T. quotations equally with the rest. The
      Schwartze-Petermann Latin version preserves every Greek word
      throughout untranslated, and Schmidt's German translation
      invariably adds them in brackets. In the P.S. a large number of
      abstract qualificative general names of exalted super-æonic orders
      is given, such as 'Unapproachables,' 'Uncontainables,' which could
      not possibly be native to Coptic diction. In a number of passages
      again, where the translator had difficulty, he slavishly follows
      the Greek construction. Frequently also he gives alternative
      renderings. The fact of translation from the Greek is well-nigh
      universally acknowledged; and indeed we now possess decisive
      objective proof, for one of the documents in the Berlin Codex,
      which presents identical linguistic phenomena, lay before Irenæus
      in its Greek original form (Bib. 47). Nevertheless Granger (Bib.
      44) and Scott-Moncrieff (Bib. 56) have questioned this fact of
      translation, and quite recently Rendel Harris (Bib. 60), after
      accepting the general consensus of opinion (Bib. 49), has changed
      his mind and thinks that the matter should be reinvestigated. None
      of these scholars, however, has set forth any objective grounds
      for his opinion. It is difficult to believe that any one who has
      laboured through the versions line by line and word by word can
      have the slightest doubt on the matter. The whole style of the
      work is foreign to the Coptic idiom, as may be seen from
      Amélineau's Introduction to his French version (Bib. 35), where he
      writes (p. x): "Whoever has any knowledge of the Coptic language
      knows that this idiom is foreign to long sentences; that it is a
      tongue eminently analytic and by no means synthetic; that its
      sentences are composed of small clauses exceedingly precise, and
      almost independent of each other. Of course all Coptic authors are
      not equally easy, some of them are even exceedingly difficult to
      understand; but this much is certain, that never under any
      circumstances in Coptic do we come across those periods with
      complicated incidental sentences, of three or four different
      clauses, whose elements are synthetically united together so that
      the sense of the entire sentence cannot be grasped before we
      arrive at the last clause. Nevertheless, this is just what the
      reader meets with in this work. The sentences are so entangled
      with incidental and complicated propositions, that often, indeed
      very often, the Coptic translator has lost the thread, so to say,
      and made main propositions out of incidental clauses. . . . The
      one thing that it conclusively proves is that the book was
      originally written in a learned language."<br>
      <br>
      Amélineau makes rather too much of the abstruse nature of the
      subject; for, though many passages are transcendental or mystical,
      nevertheless the whole is conceived in a narrative or descriptive
      style. There is no attempt at philosophical argument, no really
      involved logical propositions. We may then take it as sufficiently
      established that Greek originals underlay the whole contents of
      the Askew Codex. It is on this basis at any rate that rests every
      methodical attempt which has hitherto been made to determine the
      most probable place and date of origin and to discover the school
      or circle to which the P.S. miscellany can be referred.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Originals composed in Egypt.</i><br>
      Amid much else that is uncertain no one has questioned that the
      immediate place of origin must be sought in an Egyptian
      environment. In other words, the 'Books' of the miscellany were
      all composed or compiled in Egypt, though where precisely it is
      impossible to conjecture. But the clearly Egyptian elements are
      not the more numerous; moreover, they do not seem to be the most
      fundamental, but are blended with, or rather superimposed upon,
      others which clearly did not originate in Egypt.<br>
      <br>
      The date of composition is a difficult problem, and is bound up
      with the more puzzling question of the sect to which the P.S.
      literature should be ascribed. There is as yet no certainty; it is
      a matter of cumulative probabilities at best.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Date: The 2nd-century Theory. </i><br>
      The earlier view ascribed the P.S. to Valentinus, who died
      probably about the middle of the, or a decade later, or
      alternatively to an adherent of the Valentinian school. We may
      call it the 2nd-century theory. A succession of scholars were of
      this opinion, among whom may be mentioned Woide, Jablonski, La
      Croze, Dulaurier, Schwartze, Renan, Révillout, Usener and
      Amélineau. This earlier view can hardly be said to have been
      supported by any great show of detailed argument, except by the
      French Egyptologist and Coptic scholar Amélineau, who was its most
      stalwart supporter. Seven years prior to his translation of P.S.
      in 1895, Amélineau devoted 156 pp. of a voluminous essay (Bib.
      19), in which he sought to prove the Egyptian origins of
      Gnosticism--a general thesis which can hardly be maintained in the
      light of more recent research,--to a comparison of the system of
      Valentinus with that of the P.S.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The 3rd-century Theory. </i><br>
      Meantime in Germany, shortly after the appearance of Schwartze's
      Latin version in 1851, the careful analysis of the system of the
      P.S. by Köstlin in 1854 gave rise to or confirmed another view. It
      abandoned the Valentinian origin, and pronounced generally in
      favour of what may becalled an 'Ophitic' derivation. Köstlin
      placed the date of the P.S. in the 1st half of the 3rd century,
      and Lipsius (Bib. 15) and Jacobi (Bib. 17) accepted his finding.
      We may call this alternative general view the 3rd-century theory.<br>
      <br>
      In 1891 Harnack, accepting Köstlin's analysis of the system,
      attacked the problem from another point of view, basing himself
      chiefly on the use of scripture, as shown in the quotations from
      the O.T. and N.T., and on the place of the doctrinal ideas and
      stage of the sacramental practices in the general history of the
      development of Christian dogma and rites. He pointed out also one
      or two other vague indications, such as a reference to
      persecution, from which he concluded that it was written at a date
      when the Christians were 'lawfully' persecuted. These
      considerations led him to assign the most probable date of
      composition to the 2nd half of the 3rd century. Schmidt in 1892
      accepted this judgment, with the modification, however, that Div.
      iv. belonged to an older stratum of the literature, and should
      therefore be placed in the 1st half of the century. This general
      view has been widely adopted as the more probable. In Germany it
      has been accepted by such well-known specialists as Bousset,
      Preuschen and Liechtenhan; and in France by De Faye. Among English
      scholars may be mentioned chiefly E. F. Scott, Scott-Moncrieff and
      Moffat.<br>
      <br>
      The only recent attempt to return to the earlier 2nd-century view
      is that of Legge in 1915 (Bib. 57), who roundly plumps for
      Valentinus as the author. In order to do this he thinks it
      necessary first of all to get out of the way Harnack's parallels
      in P.S. with the fourth gospel. They may just as well, he
      contends, be compilations from the synoptics. One clear parallel
      only can be adduced, and this may be due to a common source. I am
      not convinced by this criticism; nor do I think it germane to
      Legge's general contention, for it is precisely in Valentinian
      circles that the fourth gospel first emerges in history. In the
      Introduction to the first edition of the present work I registered
      my adhesion to the Valentinian hypothesis, but, as I now think,
      somewhat too precipitously. On general grounds the 3rd-century
      theory seems to me now the more probable; but, even if Harnack's
      arguments as a whole hold, I see no decisive reason why the P.S.
      may not equally well fall within the 1st half as within the 2nd
      half of the century.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The 'Ophitic' Background.</i><br>
      The question of the sect or even grouping to the P.S. literature
      should be assigned is still more difficult. To call it 'Ophitic'
      is nebulous at best. Ophitism in Gnosticism is ill-defined, if not
      chaotic, owing to the confusing indications of the Church Fathers.
      They called Ophitic or classed as Ophitic very different sects who
      never used the name for themselves. It ought to mean people either
      who worshipped the serpent or in whose symbolism or mythology the
      serpent played the most characteristic or dominant rôle. But most
      of what we are told of the views and doctrines of circles directly
      referred to under this opprobrious designation (as it is clearly
      intended to be by the heresiologists) and of those brought into
      close connection with them, has not the slightest reference to
      what by hypothesis should have been their chief cult-symbol. Sed
      et serpens is conspicuous by its absence. All that we can
      legitimately say is that along this confused line of heredity we
      have to push back our researches in any endeavour to discover the
      earliest developments of Gnosticism in Christian circles. These
      took place unquestionably first on Syrian ground, and doubtless
      had already a long heredity behind them, former phases of
      syncretism, blendings of Babylonian, Persian, Semitic and other
      elements. The 'Ophitic' elements in P.S. are of Syrian origin, but
      developed on Egyptian soil. If there is also a slight Hellenistic
      tinging, it is not of a philosophizing nature.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Three vague Pointers.<b> </b></i><br>
      Can we, however, find any indications in the P.S. which might be
      thought to direct us whither to search in the jumble of sects
      which the chief heresiological Fathers bring into an 'Ophitic'
      connection? There are three vague pointers: (1) Philip is declared
      pre-eminently (chh. 22, 42) to be the scribe of all the deeds and
      discourses of the Saviour, but with him are associated Thomas and
      Matthew (ch. 43); (2) in Div. iii. Mary Magdalene stands forth as
      the chief questioner, no less than 39 of the 42 questions being
      put in her mouth; (3) in Div. iv. a foul act of obscene sorcery is
      condemned as the most heinous of all sins (ch. 147).<br>
      <br>
      Now, Epiphanius (writing about 374-377 A.D.) groups together
      certain sects under the names Nicolaïtans, Gnostics, Ophites,
      Cainites, Sethians and Archontics; these possessed a rich
      apocalyptic literature. Among the titles of their books reference
      is made to a Gospel of Philip (Hær. xxvi. 13) and Questions of
      Mary, both The Great and The Little (ib. 8). A quotation is given
      from the former, and several from the latter. But in both cases
      they are of an obscene nature and have clearly nothing whatever to
      do with P.S. in any way. It is true that the more abundant
      quotations are from The Great Questions, and this has led Harnack
      and others to assume that The Little Questions may have been of a
      different and even ascetic character. But Epiphanius classes the
      two writings together without distinction; and even if the title
      Questions of Mary could be legitimately given to part of the
      contents of P.S., surely these would be more appropriately styled
      The Great and not The Little Questions? Finally, the document from
      which Epiphanius quotes belongs to a different type of setting.
      Mary questions apart, is alone with Jesus. She is not with the
      rest of the disciples, as in the P.S.<br>
      <br>
      In describing these sects Epiphanius repeatedly dwells on certain
      unspeakably foul rites and practices which he would have us
      believe were widely spread among them. P.S. condemns with even
      greater severity a similar obscene abomination, introducing this
      stern reprobation with the solemn words, the only instance of such
      an outbreak in the whole narrative: "Jesus was wroth with the
      world in that hour and said unto The libertinist Sects of
      Epiphanius.<br>
      <br>
      Thomas: 'Amēn, I say unto you: This sin is more heinous than all
      sins and all iniquities.'" There is, however, no indication that
      in the experience of the writers of the P.S. such a practice was
      widespread; on the contrary, it would seem for them to have been a
      rare occurrence -- indeed, the most horrible thing of which they
      had ever heard. If Epiphanius is to be relied on here, it is vain
      to look for the Gnostics of the P.S. in such an environment. But
      Epiphanius has no great reputation for accuracy in general, and it
      is very difficult to believe in such widespread iniquity of so
      loathsome a nature. In any case he is writing at a later date.
      Liechtenhan's hypothesis (Bib. 41), that a certain common body of
      literature was rewritten -- on the one hand to serve libertinist
      propensities, and on the other in the interest of ascetic
      tendencies,--though more or less accepted by Harnack, seems to me
      to be too facile a generalization to meet the special difficulty
      with which we are confronted. Epiphanius in his youth had certain
      unfortunate experiences with the adherents of a libertinist sect
      in Egypt, and the moral shock it gave him seems to have warped his
      judgment as a historian in this part of his work; it led him to
      collect every scrap of evidence of obscenity he could lay hands on
      and every gross scandal that had come to his ears, and freely to
      generalize therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Severians.</i><br>
      &nbsp;Into relation with the above-mentioned Epiphanian group of
      names Schmidt brings the ascetic Severians; these, according to
      our heresiologist (xlv.), still in his own day maintained a
      miserable existence in the upper Thebaid. To them S. would
      specifically refer the P.S. But, in my opinion, it is very
      difficult indeed to fit in what Epiphanius tells us so sketchily
      of these people, however skilfully it is analyzed, with the main
      doctrines and practices in the P.S.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Bruce Codex. </i><br>
      With nothing but Patristic indications before us, no matter what
      pains are taken to submit them to microscopic critical inspection,
      it seems impossible to place the P.S. precisely. But our Codex
      does not stand in isolation as the only directly known Christian
      Gnostic document -- that is to say, as coming straight from the
      hands of the Gnostics themselves, though by way of translation. We
      have first of all the two MSS. of the Bruce Codex in the Bodleian,
      Oxford. One of these, The Book of the Great Logos according to the
      Mystery, is closely connected with the literature from which the
      P.S. miscellany is excerpted, especially with Div. iv. We can say
      with a high degree of confidence that it belonged to the same
      tradition, though whether to an earlier or later stratum is not
      quite decided. There are, however, no indications in it which will
      further help us as to date or name of sect. The second MS., a
      lofty apocalypse, which unfortunately bears no title, is of
      another line of tradition or type of interest. Schmidt, in the
      Introduction to his translation (p. xxvi, Bib. 45), thinks he can
      refer it with certainty to the Sethian-Archontic group, placing it
      in the 1st half of the 3rd century, in-stead of, as previously
      (Bib. 28), in the last quarter of the 2nd. His reason for this
      change of view may be seen from the following observations, which
      introduce us to the third extant, but unpublished, collection of
      Coptic Gnostic works.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Berlin Codex.</i><br>
      On July 16, 1896, Schmidt surprised and delighted students of
      Gnosticism by reporting, at a sitting of the Royal Prussian
      Academy of Sciences, on the contents of a precious Coptic Gnostic
      Codex which had in January of the same year been procured by Dr
      Reinhardt at Cairo from a dealer in antiquities from Akhmīm, and
      is now in the safe custody of the Berlin Egyptian Museum
      (Sitzungsberichte d. k. p. Akad. d. Wissensch. zu Berlin, xxxvi).
      This notice and a more detailed study of one of the treatises by
      S. in 1907 (Bib. 47) give us all the information we possess so far
      concerning this very important Codex. In 1900 I summarized S.'s
      first notice in the first edition of my Fragments of a Faith
      Forgotten (pp. 579-592). The Codex consists mainly of three
      original Greek Gnostic works in Coptic translation: (1) The Gospel
      of Mary; (2) The Apocryphon of John; (3) The Wisdom of Jesus
      Christ. At the end there is an extract from The Acts of Peter,
      which are also of Gnostic origin, setting forth an episode from
      the healing wonders of the Apostle.<br>
      <br>
      The Gospel of Mary relates visions of John and Mary Magdalene, but
      Schmidt gives us none of their contents. He is equally reserved as
      to the contents of The Wisdom of Jesus Christ, giving only the
      introduction. After the resurrection the twelve disciples and
      seven women-disciples of Jesus go into Galilee to a certain
      mountain (as in Div. iv. of P.S.). To them Jesus appears as a
      great angel of light and bids them lay all their questions before
      him. The disciples bring forward their questions and receive the
      desired replies. Schmidt must have told Harnack more about the
      contents, for in an appendix to the report, the latter ventures on
      the suggestion that it may possibly be found that this treatise is
      the lost book of Valentinus referred to under the title of Wisdom.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The so-called Barbēlō-Gnostics.<b> </b></i><br>
      It is the second treatise, The Apocryphon of John, to which S.
      devotes most of his attention in both the papers to which we are
      referring, the titles of which are respectively, 'A Pre-irenæic
      Gnostic Original Work in Coptic' and 'Irenæus and his Source in
      Adv. Hær. i. 29,' S. proves beyond a shadow of doubt that the
      Greek original of this Gnostic apocryphon lay before Irenæus (c.
      190 A.D.), and that the Church Father's method of quotation and
      summarizing is, to say the least of it, misleading, for it
      practically makes nonsense of what is by no means absurd. The
      treatise tells us much of interest concerning the part played by
      Barbēlō, 'the perfect Power,' 'the Æon perfect in glory'; the
      system is of the philosophized type and by no means inconsistent.
      Hitherto the clumsy treatment of it by Irenæus has been generally
      referred to as descriptive of the tenets of the Barbēlō-Gnostics,
      and to them Scott (Bib. 54) and Moffat (Bib. 58) have sought
      variously to ascribe the P.S. These Gnostics are brought by
      Irenæus into a confused relationship with some of the sects of the
      group on which Epiphanius two centuries later animadverted so
      severely.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Sethians. </i><br>
      Schmidt, however, has shown that the document in question belongs
      immediately to the literature of the Sethians, to whom also he now
      ascribes the Untitled Apocalypse of the Bruce Codex. The
      Apocryphon of John is clearly imbued with a very similar spirit of
      philosophizing to that of the Valentinian school, and Schmidt
      promises to compare the two systems in detail, so as to determine
      their relationship, when he publishes his translation of these new
      documents, which are of so great importance for the history of the
      Christianized Gnosis.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The present Position of the Enquiry. </i><br>
      What precise light the publication of Schmidt's labours will
      throw, directly or indirectly, on the puzzling question of the
      exact placing of the P.S. literature, we must wait to see; it is
      highly probable, however, that it will throw some light on its
      problems. But from what we glean so far from the above indications
      it may be again suggested that, though the Valentinian hypothesis
      will have to be definitely abandoned, there seems nothing to
      compel us to lean to the 2nd rather than to the 1st half of the
      3rd century for the date. Here the view of Lipsius (Bib. 20) and
      Bousset (Bib. 48), that similar features in the P.S. and the
      religion of Mani are in a more primitive form in the former than
      in the latter, has to be considered. Manichæism emerged somewhere
      about 265 A.D., but it is very difficult to say what was its
      precise original form. The similarities in the two systems may of
      course be due to their coming from a common source.<br>
      <b><i><br>
        </i></b><i>The new and the old Perspective in Gnostic Studies. </i><br>
      What is certain is that we have in the contents of the Askew,
      Bruce and Berlin Codices a rich material which hands on to us
      valuable direct information concerning what I have called 'The
      Gnosis according to its Friends,' in distinction from what
      previously used to be our only sources, the polemical writings of
      the heresiological Fathers, which set forth 'The Gnosis according
      to its Foes.' We have thus at last a new standpoint from which to
      review the subject, and therewith the opportunity of revising our
      impressions in a number of respects; a considerably different
      angle of vision must needs change the perspective of no little in
      the picture.<br>
      <br>
      The chief business or interest of the orthodox Fathers was to
      select and stress what appeared to them to be the most bizarre
      points and elements, all that was most absurd in their judgment,
      in the many Gnostic systems, and of course, and rightly,
      everything that could be thought to be ethically reprehensible.
      Good, bad and indifferent were only too frequently lumped
      together. It was of no interest to this polemic to mention
      similarities in belief and practice between the heretics and their
      opponents, to dwell on the lofty faith of numbers of these
      Gnostics in the transcendent excellence and overmastering glory of
      the Saviour, or on many signs of spiritual inwardness, and
      especially of high virtue, in which they were at the least not
      less scrupulous than their critics. Doubtless there were sects and
      groups whose tenets were absurd at any valuation, and some whose
      laxity of ethics demanded severe reprobation. But the majority
      could not be accused on the score of moral delinquency, indeed no
      few were rigidly ascetic; and some of their speculations again
      have a sublimity of their own, and in a number of cases
      anticipated Catholic dogma. If we turn to our direct sources in
      Coptic translation, we find that the ethic is admirable, even if
      we are averse from over-asceticism in the religious life, and that
      their whole-souled devotion to and worship of the Saviour is
      unbounded.<br>
      <br>
      It is no part of the plan of this translation to attempt anything
      in the nature of a commentary. That would mean a second volume,
      and would in any case be an unsatisfactory performance; for much
      would still remain obscure, even if every ray of light shed on
      this or that special point by those who have most deeply studied
      the subject, were gathered together. One or two very general
      remarks, however, may be ventured.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Ministry of the First Mystery. </i><br>
      In the P.S. Jesus is everywhere pre-eminent and central. He is
      here revealed as Saviour and First Mystery, who knows all and
      unveils all, infinite in compassion. As such he is pre-existent
      from eternity, and his ministry is not only earthly, but cosmic
      and supercosmic; indeed, it is the chief feature in the divine
      economy. Yet nowhere is he called the Christ. If this is
      intentional, no reason seems to be assignable for such an
      abstention. There is no sign of antagonism to Judaism or to the
      O.T. On the contrary, the psalms and other utterances which are
      quoted, are validated by the theory that it was the Power of the
      Saviour which so prophesied of old through the mouth of a David, a
      Solomon, or an Isaiah.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The post-resurrectional Setting. </i><br>
      The whole setting is post-resurrectional. In Divv. i.-iii. Jesus
      has already, for eleven years after the crucifixion, been
      instructing his disciples, men and women, in the Gnosis. The scene
      now depicts the disciples as gathered round the Saviour on the
      Mount of Olives on earth. The range and scope of this prior
      teaching may be seen in Div. iv., where the introductory words
      speak of it as taking place simply after the crucifixion. In this
      stratum the scene is different. The sacramental rite is solemnized
      on earth; it takes place, however, on the Mount of Galilee and not
      on the Mount of Olives. But the scene is not confined to earth
      only, for the disciples are also taken into some of the regions of
      the invisible world, above and below, have vision there conferred
      upon them, and are instructed on its meaning. Now in Divv. i.-iii.
      Jesus promises to take the disciples into the spheres and heavens
      for the direct showing of their nature and quality and
      inhabitants, but there is no fulfilment of this promise in the
      excerpts we have from 'The Books of the Saviour.' It is not to be
      supposed, however, that Div. iv. is part of the fulfilment of the
      high promise made in the prior extracts; for in it we move in an
      earlier phase of the instruction and in an atmosphere of lesser
      mysteries than those indicated in the preceding part.<br>
      <br>
      Divv. i.-iii. throughout proclaim the revelation of higher
      mysteries. This is only now made The higher Revelation within this
      Setting.possible by the supremely joyous fact that in the twelfth
      year of the inner-teaching-ministry a great, if not supreme,
      moment in the life of the Saviour has been accomplished: his
      earthly ministry is now achieved, and he is invested with the full
      radiance of his triple robe of glory, which embraces the whole
      powers of the universe. He ascends into heaven in dazzling light
      which blinds the disciples. After thirty hours he returns again,
      and in compassion withdraws his blinding splendour, so as to give
      his final teaching to his faithful in his familiar form. This
      means that 'The Books of the Saviour' purport to contain not only
      a post-resurrectional teaching, and therefore a Gnostic revelation
      supplementary to the public preaching before the crucifixion, but
      also a still higher and more intimate unveiling within the
      post-resurrectional instruction already current in the tradition.
      If there had been apocalyptic elements and visions in the prior
      literature, there were to be still more transcendental revelations
      now on the completion of the ministry. Until the investiture, or
      rather reinvestiture, had taken place according to the divine
      command, it had not been possible for the Saviour to speak in
      utter openness face to face on all things; now it is possible.
      Such is the convention.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Æon-lore. </i><br>
      In Divv. i.-iii. there is presupposed throughout a system of æons
      and the rest, which is already highly complex and shows manifest
      signs of consisting of stages once severally at the summit of
      earlier systems, but now successively subordinated. It is clear
      then that, if still loftier hierarchies are to be brought on to
      the stage, it can only be by again reducing what had previously
      been regarded as 'the end of all ends' to a subordinate position.
      This is the method adopted, and we lose ourselves in the recital
      of the designations and attributes of ever more transcendental
      beings and spaces and mysteries.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Sophia Episode. </i><br>
      In all of this, however, there is no sign of interest in
      metaphysical speculation; there is no philosophizing. It is then
      not any element of Hellenic thought proper in the æonology, which
      is said to have been so strongly the case with the teaching of
      Valentinus himself, that has led so many to conjecture a
      Valentinian derivation. It is rather the long episode of the
      sorrowing Sophia which has influenced them. This episode reflects
      on a lower level of the cosmic scale somewhat of the motif of the
      'tragic myth' of the world-soul, the invention of which is
      generally ascribed to Valentinus himself, though he may possibly
      have transformed or worked up already existing materials or
      notions. It is this long Sophia episode and its skilfully inverted
      mystical exegesis and allegorical interpretation, following the
      methods developed by Alexandrine contemplatives, which has
      produced the impression on many that it was of fundamental
      importance for the system of the P.S.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The ethical Interest. </i><br>
      It is certainly an indication of the deep interest of the circle
      in repentance and the penitential psalms. But the interest is here
      ethical rather than cosmological. Pistis Sophia would seem to be
      intended to represent the type of the faithful repentant
      individual soul. Throughout, the chief interest is in salvation
      and redemption. This is to be acquired by repentance and by
      renunciation of the world, its lures and cares, but above all by
      faith in the Saviour, the Divine Light, and his mysteries. The
      first requisite is sincere repentance. The chief topic round which
      all the ethical teaching naturally centres, is sin, its cause and
      its purification, and the revelation of the mystery of the
      forgiveness of sins and of the infinite compassion of the First
      Mystery. Though there is very much also concerning the complex
      schematology of the invisible worlds and the hierarchies of being,
      much concerning the soul and its origin, of how it comes to birth
      and departs from earth-life, much of the light-power, the
      spiritual element in man,--all is subordinated to the ethical
      interest in the first place, and in the second to the efficacy of
      the high mysteries of salvation.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Mysteries. </i><br>
      The whole is set forth in terms of these mysteries, which are now
      conceived in a far more vital way than was apparently the case in
      the earlier literature. On the lower side the mysteries still in
      some respects keep in touch with the tradition of words-of-power,
      authentic and incorruptible names, and so forth, though there is
      little of this specifically in Divv. i.-iii. But it is evidently
      intended that the higher mysteries should now be conceived in the
      light of the fact that the Saviour himself is in himself
      concretely the First Mystery and indeed the Last Mystery, and
      thatthe mysteries are not so much spiritual powers as substantive
      beings of transcendent excellence. The light-robe is a mystery of
      mysteries, and they who have received of the high mysteries become
      light-streams in passing from the body. The mysteries are closely
      intertwined with the lore of the glory and its modes.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The astral Lore. </i><br>
      One of the main elements in the lower schematology is the ancient
      astral lore, those ground-conceptions of sidereal religion which
      dominated the thought of the times and upheld their sway directly
      and indirectly for long centuries after. But here again our
      Gnostics, while retaining the schematology for certain purposes,
      placed it low in the scale. Moreover, while not denying that
      previously there was truth even in the astrological art, they
      reduced the chances of the horoscope-casters to zero, by declaring
      that the Saviour in the accomplishment of his cosmic ministry had
      now drastically changed the revolution of the spheres, so that
      henceforth no calculations could be counted on; these were now of
      no more value than the spinning of a coin.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Transcorporation.</i> <br>
      Our Gnostics were also transmigrationists; transcorporation formed
      an integral part of their system. They found no difficulty in
      fitting it into their plan of salvation, which shows no sign of
      the expectation of an immediate end of all things--that prime
      article of faith of the earliest days. So far from thinking that
      reincarnation is alien to gospel-teaching, they elaborately
      interpret certain of the most striking sayings in this sense, and
      give graphic details of how Jesus, as the First Mystery, brought
      to rebirth the souls of John the Baptizer and of the disciples,
      and supervized the economy of his own incarnation. In this respect
      the P.S. offers richer material for those interested in this
      ancient and widespread doctrine than can be found in any other
      old-world document in the West.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The magical Element. </i><br>
      A far more distressingly puzzling immixture is the element of
      magic. In Div. iv. especially there are invocations and many names
      which resemble those found in the Greek magical papyri and other
      scattered sources. But no one has so far thrown any clear light on
      this most difficult subject of research in general, much less on
      its relation to the P.S. It is evident that the writers of Div.
      iv. and of the first treatise of the Bruce Codex set a high value
      on such formulæ and on authentic names; nor are these entirely
      absent from the excerpts from 'The Books of the Saviour,' as
      witness the five words written on the light-robe. Our Gnostics
      unquestionably believed in a high magic, and were not averse from
      finding in what was presumably its most reputable tradition,
      material which they considered to be germane to their purpose. In
      this tradition there must have been a supreme personage possessing
      characteristics that could be brought into close connection with
      their ideal of the Saviour, for they equate a certain Aberamenthō
      with him. The name occurs once or twice elsewhere; but who or what
      it suggested, we do not know. In any case, as they utilized and
      attempted to sublimate so much else which was considered by many
      in those days to be most venerable, in order that they might the
      more extend and exalt the glory of the Saviour and take up into it
      what they considered the best of everything, so did they with what
      was presumably the highest they could find in the hoary tradition
      of magical power, which had enjoyed empery for so long in the
      antique world and still continued to maintain itself even in
      religio-philosophical circles, where we should, from the modern
      standpoint, least expect to find it.<br>
      <br>
      <i>History and psychic story. </i><br>
      As to the setting of the narrative, -- if we had not such an
      abundance of instances of pseudo-historic and pseudo-epigraphic
      scripture-writing, if this were not, so to speak, the commonplace,
      not only of apocryphal and apocalyptic literature, but also of no
      little that falls within the borders of canonical sanction, we
      might be more surprized than we are at the form in which the
      composers or compilers have framed their work. It is clear that
      they loved and worshipped Jesus with an ecstasy of devotion and
      exaltation; they do not fall short in this of the greatest of his
      lovers. What sort of authority, then, could they have supposed
      they had for conceiving the setting of their narrative in the way
      they have?<br>
      <br>
      Objective physical history, in the rigid sense in which we
      understand it to-day, was of secondary interest to them, to say
      the least; indeed, it was apparently of little moment to the
      Gnostics of any school, and their opponents were not in-frequently
      rowing in the same boat. The Gnostics were, however, less
      disingenuous; they strenuously declared their belief in continued
      revelation, they delighted in apocalyptic and in psychic story.
      The belief in a post-resurrectional teaching had doubtless existed
      for long in many forms in Gnostic circles. It must have been
      widespread; for, as shown by Schmidt quite recently (Bib. 59), a
      Catholic writer in Asia Minor found himself compelled to steal the
      fire of the Gnostics and adopt the same convention in an orthodox
      document that was intended to be a polemic against Gnostic ideas,
      somewhere in the 3rd quarter of the 2nd century. However they
      arrived at their conviction, it seems highly probable that the
      writers of the P.S. must have sincerely believed they had high
      authority for their proceeding, and were in some way emboldened by
      'inspiration' to carry out their task. As far as they were
      concerned, they do not by any means seem conscious of belonging to
      a decadent movement or of deterioration in the quality of the
      ideas they were attempting to set forth, as so many modern critics
      would have it. On the contrary, they thought they were
      depositories or recipients of profound mysteries never hitherto
      revealed, and that by a knowledge of these mysteries they could
      the more efficiently evangelize the world.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The P.S. a reserved Document. </i><br>
      It is evident, however, that the P.S. was never intended to be
      circulated as a public gospel. Certain things are to be preached
      or proclaimed to the world, but only certain things. Certain
      mysteries, again, the recipients were to bestow under certain
      conditions, but others were to be reserved. The 'Books of the
      Saviour' are, therefore, to be regarded as apocrypha in the
      original sense of the word--that is, 'withdrawn' or 'reserved'
      writings. As such they fell within the proscriptions of artificial
      secrecy common to all the initiatory institutions of the time and
      of all time. And artificial secrecy can with difficulty, if ever,
      avoid the moral and intellectual hazard of its innate
      obscurations. The P.S. was intended for already initiated
      disciples, for chosen learners, though no pledge of secrecy is
      mentioned. It was intended, above all, for would-be apostles, for
      those who should go forth to proclaim what was for them the best
      of good news; it is clearly the inner instruction of a zealously
      propagandist sect.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Its general Value. </i><br>
      If 'The Books of the Saviour' in their full original form -- for
      in the extant P.S. we have but selections from them and the
      formulæ of the higher mysteries are omitted,--and if what is given
      of the lower mysteries in Div. iv. were held back from public
      perusal owing partly at least to the fear of the unworthy making
      improper use of them, there is little danger to-day on this score,
      for this part of the miscellany remains so far the most securely
      incomprehensible. And indeed no little else remains obscure, even
      when we are of those who have made a protracted study of the
      psychical elements in mysticism and of the general psychology of
      religious experience. But there is much also in our Codex which
      has a charm of its own. There are things of rare, if exotic,
      beauty, things of profound ethical significance, things of
      delicate spiritual texture.<br>
      <br>
      In any case, however all these very various elements and features
      in the syncretism be judged and evaluated, the Pistis Sophia is
      unquestionably a document of the first importance, not only for
      the history of Christianized Gnosticism, but also for the history
      of the development of religion in the West.<br>
      <br>
      A Skeleton of the Scheme of the System. In conclusion, a skeleton

      It was by W. that the New Testament, according to the text of the
      famous Codex Alexandrinus, was edited, in uncial types cast to
      imitate those of the MS., in 1786. In an Appendix to this great
      undertaking, in 1799 (see below, 5), he added certain fragments of
      the New Testament in the Thebaico-Coptic dialect, together with a
      dissertation on the Coptic version of the New Testament. The date
      of the C.A. is generally assigned to the 5th cent., and, with the
      exception of the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex Sinaiticus, which
      are sometimes assigned to the 4th cent., is the oldest extant MS.
      of the New Testament. This being the case, it is of interest to
      quote from the Beiträge W.'s opinion on the date of the MS. of
      P.S., which was lent to this careful scholar by Dr. Askew and
      which he copied from the first word to the last:<br>
      <br>
      "It [P.S.] is a very old MS. in 4to on parchment in Greek uncial
      characters, which are not so round as those in the Alexandrine MS.
      in London, and in the Claromontain MS. in Paris [Codex Regius
      Parisiensis, also an Alexandrine text]. The characters of the MS.
      [P.S.] are somewhat longer and more angular, so that I take them
      to be older than both the latter MSS., in which the letters eta,
      theta, omicron, rho and sigma are much rounder."<br>
      <br>
      Thus W. would date the MS. towards the end of the 4th cent.<br>

      Under date 1773 there is a letter from Woide to Michaelis, in
      which the former says in reference to the P.S. Codex that Askew
      had picked it up by chance in a book-shop. There follows a
      description of the MS.<br>

      <br>
      W. gives the date of the P.S. Codex as about the 4th cent., and
      considers the writer of the Greek original to have been
      Valentinus.<br>

      <br>
      Bishop Münter, a learned Dane, probably got his text from Woide's
      copy. His brief pamphlet is of no particular importance;
      nevertheless it was solely upon these few selections, the five
      Odes of Solomon, that, with the exception of Dulaurier, scholars
      formed their opinion of the P.S. up to the time of the publication
      of Schwartze's translation in 1851. Münter believed that the
      original treatise belonged to the 2nd cent. For Odes of Solomon
      see below, 49, 53 and 60.<br>

      reference to P.S. In Dörner's German translation the references
      are ii. 69 ff. and 163 ff.<br>
      <br>
      M. rejects the authorship of Valentinus, though he bases himself
      otherwise entirely on Woide. He vaguely places the date of the
      original treatise between the end of the 2nd and the end of the
      5th cent., but gives no opinion as to the school to which it
      belongs (p. 352).<br>

      projetée du Texte et de la Traduction française de ce Manuscript.'<br>
      <br>
      D. had prepared a translation of the P.S. He writes: "The
      translation of the Pistis Sophia and the glossary which forms a
      complement to it are finished, and will be sent to the printers,
      when I have convinced myself that I have fulfilled the
      requirements that this task imposes, taking into consideration the
      present state of science and my own capabilities. The MS. from
      which I have made my translation is a copy which I have taken from
      the original, during my stay in England in 1838-1840, when I was
      charged by MM. de Salvandy and Villemain, successive ministers of
      public instruction, with the commission of proceeding to London to
      study this curious monument." (p. 542). D., however, did not
      publish his labours, nor have I as yet come across any record of
      the fate of his MS. He ascribes the treatise to Valentinus.<br>

      Valentino adjudicatum, e Codice Manuscripto Coptico Londinensi
      descriptum. Latine vertit M. G. Schwartze, edidit J. H. Petermann
      (Berlin).<br>
      <br>
      In 1848 Schwartze made a copy of the Codex in London, but
      unfortunately died before the completion of his labours on the
      P.S., and the MS. translation he left behind contained a number of
      blanks and passages which he intended to fill up and correct. His
      friend Petermann confined himself in his notes strictly to verbal
      corrections and suggestions as to variæ lectiones. The consequence
      is that we have a translation without the notes of the translator
      and without a word of introduction. P. says the task of editing
      was so severe that he frequently suffered from fits of giddiness.
      In spite of numerous blemishes this first edition is said to be
      'an outstanding achievement.' S. considers the original treatise,
      as we see from the title of his work, to have been written by
      Valentinus; but P. is of the opinion that it is the work of an
      Ophite, and promises to set forth his reasons at length in a
      treatise, which has unfortunately never seen the light. A review
      of S.'s work appeared in the Journal des Savants of 1852 (p. 333).<br>

      "Great, therefore, were my hopes in 1842, that the ancient Coptic
      manuscript of the British Museum, inscribed Sophia, might be a
      translation, or at least an extract, from that lost text-book of
      Gnosticism [the work quoted by Hippolytus, sub Valent.]: but
      unfortunately the accurate and trustworthy labours of that patient
      and conscientious Coptic scholar, Dr. Schwartze, so early taken
      away from us, have proved to me (for I have seen and perused his
      manuscript, which I hope will soon appear), that this Coptic
      treatise is a most worthless (I trust, purely Coptic) offshoot of
      the Marcosian heresy, of the latest and stupidest mysticism about
      letters, sounds and words."<br>
      <br>
      B.'s Marcosian theory has been partially revived by Legge (below,
      57), but is supported by no one else, and we doubt whether B.
      could have read Schwartze's MS. with any great care.<br>

      B. evidently added these notes at the last moment before
      publication. On page 206 he leans to the idea of an Ophite origin.<br>

      <br>
      K. was the first to make an exhaustive analysis of the contents of
      the treatise, with the special object of setting forth the system
      of P.S., and his labours were used later by Lipsius in his art, in
      Smith and Wace's Dictionary of Christian Biography (below, 20). He
      assigns its date to the first half of the 3rd cent., and thinks
      that it is of Ophite origin. In a note to page 1, K. writes:<br>
      <br>
      "The MS. from which the work is published belongs to the
      collection of MSS. collected by Dr. Askew of London during his
      travels in Italy and Greece, of which The British Theological
      Magazine (Das Brittische theol. Magazin) for the year 1770 (vol.
      i. part 4, p. 223) gives more particulars."<br>
      <br>
      We know nothing of these travels, and there is no such magazine in
      the catalogue of the British Museum. The Theological Repository
      for 1770 contains no information on the subject; and no
      permutation of names solves the mystery. There were very few
      magazines published at that early date, so that the choice is
      limited.<br>

      <br>
      The translation is a sorry piece of work, more frequently a mere
      paraphrase from Schwartze's version than translation; there are
      also frequent omissions, sometimes as many as 40 pages of
      Schwartze's text; e.g. pp. 18, 19, 36 ff., 50, 51, 72, 73, 86-90,
      108-135, 139, 157-160, 162, 171, 179, 180, 184-186, 221-243,
      245-255, 281-320, 324-342. These are some of the omissions; but
      there are many more. It is, therefore, entirely useless to the
      student. The anonymous writer vaguely suggests a late date for the
      treatise because of the complicated nature of the system.<br>

      A still valuable study. "We may regard ourselves as justified in
      assigning (with Petermann and Köstlin) the book Pistis Sophia to
      one of the large groups of Ophite sects, though nevertheless the
      system it contains is not identical with any one of the other
      Ophite systems known to us." Of importance is L.'s suggestion that
      P.S. may be indirectly one of the sources of the Manichæan
      religion. In any case, "it may be assumed as probable that the
      book Pistis Sophia was written before the time of the Manichæan
      system, and therefore before A.D. 270. Moreover, as the system
      contained in it is evidently more recent than the other Ophitic
      systems known to us, we shall have, with Köstlin, to assign its
      composition to the first half of the 3rd cent." (p. 414b).<br>

      <br>
      A study (144 pp.) of the first importance, in which this high
      authority on the history and chronology of early Christian
      literature and the history of the development of dogma submits the
      contents of the Latin version of Schwartze to a careful analysis,
      and gives 8/9 reasons for placing the P.S. in the second half of
      the 3rd cent. H. is mainly valuable in his analysis of the
      Biblical references in the P.S., especially the uses it makes of
      the N.T., and in his estimate of the stage of development of the
      general Christian and Catholic elements in P.S. H. thinks that
      Div. iii. should be called 'Questions of Mary' (pp. 94, 108).
      Unknown to H., Renan (Marc Aurèle, p. 120) had already hazarded
      the suggestion that the whole P.S. might be identical with the
      Little Questions of Mary, mentioned by Epiphanius. But R. shows
      (p. 145) that he has no direct acquaintance with the subject. H.
      assigns the P.S. to an 'Ophitic' sect, but not the 'Ophites' in
      the narrower meaning, for here, as elsewhere often in the use of
      the name, no sign of the worship of the serpent is found (p. 110).
      He brings the P.S. sect into close connection with the Syrian
      Ophitic group, which had offshoots in Egypt, and opens up those
      investigations into the statements of Epiphanius which Schmidt has
      surveyed in greater detail in his edition of the Codex Brucianus
      (below, 28). In fact these two scholars have been in close touch
      with one another in their work on the P.S. as to its origin, date
      and place. The concluding remark of H. on the general religious
      status of the P.S.--that is to say, its bearing on Early Christian
      and Catholic religion, in other words its place within the general
      history of Christianity--is noteworthy. He writes (p. 114): "In
      this respect the P.S. is a document of first rank, for we possess
      no second work which brings before our eyes so clearly the
      previous history of Catholic sacramentism. What we meet with here
      more sharply brought out and at one stroke among the Gnostics of
      the end of the third century, was accomplished by the Catholic
      Church toilsomely and gradually in the following century. This
      Gnosticism is not the father of Catholicism, but rather an elder
      brother who gained by assault what the younger brother attained
      subsequently amid a thousand exigencies."<br>

      S.'s masterly edition entirely supersedes that of Amélineau, who
      worked on Woide's copy of the confused heap of leaves preserved in
      the Bodleian. His minute examination of the original discovered
      that the chaos could first of all be sorted out into two totally
      different MSS. The larger work is entitled The Book of the Great
      Logos according to the Mystery. The contents fall naturally into
      two divisions, which S. calls respectively 'The First' and 'The
      Second Book of Jeû.' The system is closely related to that of the
      P.S. miscellany. S. devotes pp. 334-538 to a penetrating study of
      this relation-ship, in which he makes a most valuable contribution
      to the analysis of the contents of the P.S. His labours here are
      practically an Introduction to his subsequent translation of the
      P.S. in 1905 (below, 45). Among much else of the greatest value he
      gives us a minutely detailed investigation of the system of the
      P.S., which supersedes Köstlin's pains-taking pioneer effort
      (1854). S. is rightly of opinion that P.S. is a more or less happy
      compilation from other works (p. 318), as Köstlin had already
      pointed out (p. 344). He seems to think little of the possible
      objection that, whereas the 'Two Books of Yew,' mentioned twice in
      the P.S., are said to have been dictated to Enoch by Jesus before
      the Flood and hidden away, the contents of the first document of
      the C.B. are revealed by Jesus himself to the disciples (p. 343).
      The statement in the P.S. is in keeping with common apocalyptic
      claims, and in any case the sect as a matter of fact did possess
      two Yew Books, and the contents of C.B. I. are what we should
      expect from the references in the P.S., while the intimate
      relationship between P.S. Div. iv. and C.B. I.b is patent to the
      most casual reader. He agrees with Harnack as to the date of the
      P.S.--namely, the latter half of the 3rd cent. for Divv. i.-iii.,
      and a few decades earlier for Div. iv. C.B. I. is thus to be
      placed in the first half of the 3rd cent. (pp. 540, 598). C.B. II.
      is a work without a title, the contents of which have roused S. to
      enthusiasm (pp. 34, 35). It is plainly of an earlier date, and so
      S. here conjectures for it about 160-200 A.D. (p. 542); but he has
      subsequently changed his view as to date (see 47, below).<br>
      <br>
      After a close methodical investigation, in which in particular he
      submits the statements of Epiphanius to a searching criticism, S.
      thinks that everything points to the Severians as being most
      probably the sect to which the writings contained in P.S. and C.B.
      I. can be attributed (p. 596). C.B. II., he concludes, may be
      assigned to Sethian-Archontics (p. 659). But the whole question
      bristles with difficulties when precise names are in question. It
      is to be noted that in his researches S. lays under contribution
      as very pertinent to the inquiry his prior labours on the puzzling
      problem of the Gnostics of Plotinus, in his treatise Plotin's
      Stellung zum Gnosticismus und kirchlichen Christentum (Leipzig),

      <br>
      A. advocates strongly the Valentinian origin of the treatise, and
      leans almost exclusively to an Egyptian origin of the ideas. These
      views have been severely criticized, especially by Schmidt. The
      MS. itself, however, A. places very late, writing on page xi of
      his Introduction as follows:--"After an examination of the
      enormous faults which the scribe has committed, I cannot attribute
      to the MS. which has preserved the Pistis-Sophia to us, a date
      later than the ninth or tenth century, and that too the minimum.
      For this I have several reasons. Firstly, the MS. is written on
      parchment, and parchment was hardly ever commonly used in Egypt
      before the sixth or seventh century. Secondly, the writing, which
      is uncial, though passable in the first pages of the MS., becomes
      bastard in a large number of leaves, when the scribe's hand is
      fatigued; no longer is it the beautiful writing of the Egyptian
      scribes of the great periods, but slack, inconsistent, almost
      round and hurried. Thirdly, the faults of orthography in the use
      of Greek words evidently show that the scribe belonged to a period
      when Greek was almost no longer known."<br>
      <br>
      In a footnote Amélineau says that he is perfectly aware that this
      opinion of his will 'raise a tempest,' and begs for a suspension
      of judgment till he has published his reasons, especially as to
      the late use of parchment, at greater length. The storm broke, and
      no one has accepted A.'s arguments. Among other things he failed
      to notice that in the first place the Askew Codex is the work of
      two scribes, and not of one, and that the various portions of
      their common task can be unquestionably assigned to each. The
      parchment argument has never seen the light, as far as I am aware.<br>

      On p. 7 R. calls attention to a remarkable difference in the

      slightly from the usual Sahidic version, those in pp. 86-110 are
      so totally different that they must be an independent translation
      from the Greek. If this is so, we are confronted by the high
      probability that Repentances 8-13 are a later addition, and that
      there were thus originally only 7 Repentances. If this hypothesis
      stands, it is of great importance for the internal analysis of the
      literature. R.'s view is criticized by Rendel Harris (below, 60).<br>

      <br>
      In his analysis of the composition of the P.S., L. introduces a
      novelty. He thinks that pp. 128 (ch. 64)-175 (end of ch. 80),
      subsequent to the thirteen Repentances, are a later insertion in
      the Sophia-episode, and regards the opening lines of ch. 81 ("It
      came to pass after all this") as a redactor's connecting
      paragraph.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the appropriateness of the suggested title, 'The
      Questions of Mary,' for Div. iii., and of 'The Gospel of Philip'
      (P.S. ch. 42) as a possible title for Divv. i. and ii.,--he tries
      to get over the difficulty that those two titles are mentioned by
      Epiphanius among the books of a group of sects to which the Church
      Father ascribes the most filthy, blasphemous and obscene rites, in
      the following conjecture (p. 242):--" A Gnostic sect in Egypt
      possessed a rich, apocalyptic<br>
      <br>
      literature, among which was to be found a Gospel of Philip and
      Questions of Mary. This sect was divided into an ascetic and a
      libertinist branch, and each group worked over the sacred
      literature which had come down to them." Epiphanius (Hær. xxvi.)
      got hold of the libertinist redaction; the ascetic is preserved
      for us in P.S., Divv. i.-iii. Div. iv. is an earlier stratum. 'The
      Books of Yew' mentioned in P.S. are said to have been revealed to
      Enoch; accordingly, like Preuschen, he thinks that these cannot be
      the treatise of the Bruce Codex to which Schmidt has assigned this
      title, for the latter is revealed to the Disciples (p. 251).<br>

      <br>
      H. repeats, from his detailed study (above, 24a), his reasons for
      assigning the contents of P.S. Divv. i.-iii. to the latter half of
      3rd cent. He says that Liechtenhan's final opinion (above, 41) on
      'The Questions of Mary' problem is not far from his own view. Why
      H. assigns the treatises of the Bruce Codex to the 5th or 6th

      G. (p. 401) questions whether the P.S. is a translation from the

      the same qualities of style as the Coptic biographies and

      Bd. II. is to contain the three unpublished works of the Berlin

      seen the light. The contents are of great value, for The
      Apocryphon of John, in its original Greek form, lay before
      Irenæus, and in an appendix to Schmidt's notice Harnack ventures
      the query: Can The Wisdom (Sophia) of Jesus Christ possibly be the
      lost famous writing of Valentinus so entitled?<br>

      In the Introduction (pp. ix-xviii) S. sums up the results of his
      prior studies. The Translation of the P.S. occupies pp. 1-254, and

      <br>
      This is a very important study, in which S. again treats of The
      Apocryphon of John in the unpublished Coptic Gnostic Berlin Codex,
      on which he had already specially dwelt in reporting for the first
      time the contents of the Codex to the Prussian Academy in 1896.
      The Greek original is early, and a copy of it lay before Irenæus.
      We are thus in a position to estimate the nature of the Church
      Father's method of quotation and summarizing, and it is clearly
      proved to be unreliable. S. definitely assigns this special
      document to a Sethian circle in Egypt, and brings its æon-lore
      into close touch with Valentinian ideas. He says nothing,
      unfortunately, of how this document and the other two of the
      Codex--namely, The Gospel of Mary and The Wisdom of Jesus
      Christ--bear on the line of descent of the doctrines of the P.S.
      Doubtless he is reserving his treatment of the subject for his
      long-expected edition of the whole Berlin Codex, which for the
      first time will give us first-hand knowledge of second-century
      Gnosticism, and, judging by what little S. has already disclosed
      to us, throw a brilliant light on some of the most puzzling
      obscurities in the history of the development of Gnostic doctrine.<br>

      This is a study of the greatest value from the comparative
      standpoint. Though Lipsius (above, 20) had already drawn attention
      to the point, B. goes further by showing in detail the close
      connection between some main notions of the Manichæan religion and
      some features of the P.S., whereas Schmidt (1892, pp. 375, 404,
      417, 564) had previously drawn attention to isolated parallels
      only. In dealing with the system of the P.S. (pp. 346-350) B.
      writes: "There can be no doubt at all on the affinity between the
      two systems. The only possible question which remains is whether
      in the P.S. and II. Jeû direct dependence on the Manichæan system
      comes up for discussion, or whether a common source underlies both
      systems. The latter appears to me provisionally to be the more
      probable hypothesis. Many of the kindred ideas appear in the P.S.
      in their more original and purer form, the figure of the Virgin of
      Light has in the P.S. meaning and great importance, whereas in the
      Manichæan system she is a shadowy form by the side of the Third
      Envoy. If the latter supposition proves correct, Mani would have
      far less right of claim to originality for his system than has
      hitherto seemed to be the case."<br>

      R. H. devotes pp. 16-35 to treating of the use of the Odes in the
      P.S. On p. 35 he writes: "The Pistis Sophia, in which the Odes are
      imbedded, dates from the third century, and the author of the
      Pistis had, as we have shown, the Odes bound up with his Canonical
      Psalter; at the time intimated there was no Coptic [Thebaic] Bible
      from which the extracts could have been made; so we may be sure
      the Odes were taken from a Greek Bible, and, with almost equal
      certainty, that the Pistis Sophia itself was a Greek book."<br>

      view of the later date of C.B., and says that the eschatology of

      P.S. was written in Egypt at close of 3rd cent. (p. 241b). This is
      by no means certain; we must wait for Schmidt's full translation
      and commentary on The Apocryphon of John before any definite
      conclusion can be reached.<br>

      <br>
      D. F. agrees with Harnack and Schmidt as to the most probable date
      being the 2nd half of the 3rd cent. (p. 254). He thinks that Div.
      iii. is the lost Little Questions of Mary, favouring Harnack
      against Schmidt, whom he blames (p. 266) for abandoning this view
      in the Introduction (p. xviii) to his Translation (above, 45),
      after first adopting it in his earlier work. He thinks that
      Schmidt has made out his case for the two Jell Books against the
      reservations of Preuschen and Liechtenhan (p. 291). D. F. is
      strongly opposed to the hypothesis of a Valentinian origin (p.
      251); he is also very critical of the general Ophite theory (p.
      327) and of the special Severian theory of Schmidt (p. 355). He
      has no precise view of his own as to origin; but, in keeping with
      his general thesis, which would make most, if not all, of the
      anonymous and pseudonymous systems later and degenerate forms of
      the more metaphysical views of a Basilides, a Valentinus and a
      Marcion, he is content to leave the P.S. to a later, period of
      degeneration. His general metaphysical test can hardly be said to
      be a criterion for history. Metaphysic does not come first;
      philosophizing is a secondary stage, and this is certainly the
      case in the general development of the Gnosis which starts in a
      strongly mythological and apocalyptic circle of ideas.<br>

      <br>
      After a review of contents and literature, with regard to place of
      origin the author writes (p. 175): "But if of Syrian origin the
      scheme betrays here and there marked signs of Egyptian influence,
      and the fact that the work was sufficiently important to be
      translated into the native tongue shows without doubt that the
      sect which inspired it was an Egyptian branch who dwelt in Egypt."
      This is of course generally evident. S.-M. thinks, however, that
      the question of translation may be pressed too much. Without
      attempting any justification of his opinion, he asserts that "the
      Coptic text is at the earliest a fifth-century work when
      Gnosticism was fast dying out and could only be practised
      furtively." Surely the author is here confusing the probable date
      of the Askew Codex copy with the question of date of the original?<br>

      Divv. i. and ii. presuppose belief in a system resembling those of
      the Ophites and of Valentinus (p. 135). Divv. iii. and iv. are
      probably Marcosian in origin (p. 173), in any case later (!) than
      Divv. i. and ii. (p. 184). In this L. partially revives Bunsen's
      rejected theory (above, 11). He accepts translation from a Greek
      original, and continues (p. 177): "We must . . . look for an
      author who, though an Egyptian and acquainted with the native
      Egyptian religion, would naturally have written in Greek; and on
      the whole there is no one who fulfils these requirements so well
      as Valentinus himself. The fact that the author never quotes from
      the Gospel according to St. John indicates that it had not come to
      his knowledge." L.'s criticism (pp. 161 f.) of Harnack's parallels
      from this Gospel (above, 24a), however, does not seem to me
      satisfactory. The first commentary on the Fourth Gospel was made
      by a Valentinian. L.'s view of authorship of the P.S. revives the
      Valentinian hypothesis in its most radical form. The two books of
      the Bruce Codex, which Schmidt calls 'The Books of Jeû,' are not
      the books referred to in the P.S. "which therefore remains the
      parent document" (p. 194).<br>

      This is a useful, if brief, summary of contents and prior
      opinions. M. takes up a moderate position when he says that,
      though the P.S. is to be assigned to some Gnostic circles in
      Egypt, its particular type of Gnosticism cannot be identified. He
      thinks, however, on the whole that the occurrence of the name
      Barbelo assigns our miscellany "to some circle more or less allied
      to the pious theosophists of the 2nd cent. whom we know as the
      Ophites collectively, and as the Nicolaitans, Simonians and
      Barbelo-Gnostics specifically." H. thinks the Yew Books mentioned
      in the P.S. can hardly be the books of C.B. I.<br>

      The external form of this interesting and important document is an
      Epistle, resembling that of the Catholic Epistles of the N.T. But
      within, it passes into the form of an apocalypse, and that too of
      Discourses between Jesus and his Disciples after the Resurrection.
      This latter characteristic is otherwise not found in Catholic
      documents; it is a Gnostic peculiarity, of which the P.S. is a
      classical example, the other instances being what Schmidt calls
      the 'Two Books of Jeû' of the Bruce Codex and of The Gospel of
      Mary and of The Wisdom of Jesus Christ of the Berlin Codex. The
      Questions of Mary, The Great and The Little, of Epiphanius'
      'Gnostici' were also of this post-resurrectional type of
      discourses (p. 206).<br>
      <br>
      S. does not re-discuss the question of date of the P.S. by the
      light of this new find, but it is clearly of importance, seeing
      that with regard to the new document he concludes (p. 402): "The
      Epistola Apostolorum is written by a representative of the
      Catholic Church with the intention of attacking the Gnostic
      heresies, especially Docetism. The country of origin is Asia
      Minor, and the date is the second half of the second century, more
      precisely 160-170 A.D."<br>

      <br>
      Here R. H. entirely changes his view of P.S. being a translation
      from the Greek. He now thinks that (p. 117): "Unless . . . the
      P.S. has substituted the Sahidic [Bible] version for some other
      version which lay before the author, of which he has avoided the
      trouble of making a fresh translation, there is a strong
      presumption that the P.S. is a genuine Coptic book, and not a
      rendering of some other work (Greek or Syriac) into Coptic." He
      rejects (p. 183) Worrell's theory (above, 53) of a Gnostic Hymn-
      and Psalm-book, and criticizes (pp. 186 f.) Rahlfs' discovery of
      two versions of the Psalms (above, 40). He is accordingly opposed
      to the general view of translation from the Greek, and suggests
      (p. 186) that the matter needs some further elucidation. It
      cannot, however, be said that his argument is in any way
      convincing.<br>
      <br>
      As to the Odes of Solomon themselves, which have produced so large
      and instructive a literature since the first edition was
      published, their lucky discoverer and able editor, in reviewing
      the whole question, thinks we cannot go far wrong if we conclude
      that they were written at Antioch in the 1st century (p. 69).<br>

      <i><br>
        Jesus hitherto instructeth his disciples only up to the regions
        of the First Mystery.</i><br>
      IT came to pass, when Jesus had risen from the dead, that he
      passed eleven years discoursing with his disciples, and
      instructing them only up to the regions of the First Commandment
      and up to the regions of the First Mystery, that within the Veil,
      within the First Commandment, which is the four-and-twentieth
      mystery without and below -- those [four-and-twenty] which are in
      the second space of the First Mystery which is before all
      mysteries, -- the Father in the form of a dove.<br>
      <br>
      <i>What the First Mystery surroundeth.</i><br>
      And Jesus said to his disciples: "I am come forth out of that
      First Mystery, which is the last mystery, that is the
      four-and-twentieth mystery." And his disciples have not known nor
      understood that anything existeth within that mystery; but they
      thought of that mystery, that it is the head of the universe and
      the head of all existence; and they thought it is the completion
      of all completions, because Jesus had said to them concerning that
      mystery, that it surroundeth the First Commandment and the five
      Impressions and the great Light and the five Helpers and the whole
      Treasury of the Light.<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>The regions of the great Invisible. </i><br>
      And moreover Jesus had not told his disciples the total expansion
      of all the regions of the great Invisible and of the three
      triple-powers and of the four-and-twenty invisibles, and all their
      regions and their æons and their orders, how they are
      extended--those which are the emanations of the great Invisible --
      and their ungenerated and their self-generated and their generated
      and their light-givers and their unpaired and their rulers and
      their authorities and their lords and their archangels and their
      angels and their decans and their servitors and all the houses of
      their spheres and all the orders of every one of them.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Treasury of the Light. </i><br>
      And Jesus had not told his disciples the total expansion of the
      emanations of the Treasury, nor their orders, how they are
      extended; nor had he told them their saviours, according to the
      order of every one, how they are; nor had he told them what guard
      is at every [gate] of the Treasury of the Light; nor had he told
      them the region of the Twin-saviour, who is the Child of the
      Child; nor had he told them the regions of the three Amēns, in
      what regions they are expanded; nor had he told them into what
      region the five Trees are expanded; nor as to the seven Amēns,
      that is the seven Voices, what is their region, how they are
      expanded.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Light-world. </i><br>
      And Jesus had not told his disciples of what type are the five
      Helpers, nor into what region they are brought; nor had he told
      them how the great Light hath expanded itself, nor into what
      region it hath been brought; nor had he told them of the five
      Impressions, nor as to the First Commandment, into what region
      they have been brought. But he had discoursed with them generally,
      teaching that they exist, but he had not told them their expansion
      and the order of their regions, how they are. For this cause they
      have not known that there were also other regions within that
      mystery.<br>
      <br>
      And he had not told his disciples: "I have gone forth out of such
      and such regions until I entered into that mystery, and until I
      went forth out of it"; but, in teaching them, he said to them: "I
      am come forth from that mystery." For this cause then they thought
      of that mystery, that it is the completion of completions, and
      that it is the head of the universe and that it is the total
      Fulness. For Jesus had said to his disciples: "That mystery
      surroundeth that universe of which I have spoken unto you from the
      day when I met with you even unto this day." For this cause then
      the disciples thought there is nothing within that mystery.<br>

      <i>Jesus and his disciples are seated on the Mount of Olives. </i><br>
      It came to pass then, when the disciples were sitting together on
      the Mount of Olives, speaking of these words and rejoicing in
      great joy, and exulting exceedingly and saying one to another:
      "Blessed are we before all men who are on the earth, because the
      Saviour hath revealed this unto us, and we have received the
      Fulness and the total completion," -- they said this to one
      another, while Jesus sat a little removed from them.<br>
      <br>
      <i>A great light-power descendeth on Jesus. </i><br>
      And it came to pass then, on the fifteenth day of the moon in the
      month Tybi, which is the day on which the moon is full, on that
      day then, when the sun had come forth in his going, that there
      came forth behind him a great light-power shining most
      exceedingly, and there was no measure to the light conjoined with
      it. For it came out of the Light of lights, and it came out of the
      last mystery, which is the four-and-twentieth mystery, from within
      without, -- those which are in the orders of the second space of
      the First Mystery. And that light-power came down over Jesus and
      surrounded him entirely, while he was seated removed from his
      disciples, and he had shone most exceedingly, and there was no
      measure for the light which was on him.<br>
      <br>
      <i>It surroundeth him entirely. </i><br>
      And the disciples had not seen Jesus because of the great light in
      which he was, or which was about him; for their eyes were darkened
      because of the great light in which he was. But they saw only the
      light, which shot forth many light-rays. And the light-rays were
      not like one another, but the light was of divers kind, and it was
      of divers type, from below upwards, one [ray] more excellent than
      the other, . . ., in one great immeasurable glory of light; it
      stretched from under the earth right up to heaven. -- And when the
      disciples saw that light, they fell into great fear and great
      agitation.<br>

      <i>Jesus ascendeth into heaven. </i><br>
      It came to pass then, when that light-power had come down over
      Jesus, that it gradually surrounded him entirely. Then Jesus
      ascended or soared into the height, shining most exceedingly in an
      immeasurable light. And the disciples gazed after him and none of
      them spake, until he had reached unto heaven; but they all kept in
      deep silence. This then came to pass on the fifteenth day of the
      moon, on the day on which it is full in the month Tybi.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The confusion of the powers and the great earthquake.</i> <br>
      It came to pass then, when Jesus had reached the heaven, after
      three hours, that all the powers of the heaven fell into
      agitation, and all were set in motion one against the other, they
      and all their æons and all their regions and all their orders, and
      the whole earth was agitated and all they who dwell thereon. And
      all men who are in the world fell into agitation, and also the
      disciples, and all thought: Peradventure the world will be rolled
      up.<br>
      <br>
      And all the powers in the heavens ceased not from their agitation,
      they and the whole world, and all were moved one against the
      other, from the third hour of the fifteenth day of the moon of
      Tybi until the ninth hour of the morrow. And all the angels and
      their archangels and all the powers of the height, all sang
      praises to the interiors of the interiors, so that the whole world
      heard their voices, without their ceasing till the ninth hour of

      But the disciples sat together in fear and were in exceedingly
      great agitation and were afraid because of the great earthquake
      which took place, and they wept together, saying: "What will then
      be? Peradventure the Saviour will destroy all regions?" Thus
      saying, they wept together.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus descendeth again. </i><br>
      While they then said this and wept together, then, on the ninth
      hour of the morrow, the heavens opened, and they saw Jesus
      descend, shining most exceedingly, and there was no measure for
      his light in which he was. For he shone more [radiantly] than at
      the hour when he had ascended to the heavens, so that men in the
      world cannot describe the light which was on him; and it shot
      forth light-rays in great abundance, and there was no measure for
      its rays, and its light was not alike together, but it was of
      divers kind and of divers type, some [rays] being more excellent
      than others . . .; and the whole light consisted together. The
      nature of his gloryIt was of threefold kind, and the one [kind]
      was more excellent than the other. . . . The second, that in the
      midst, was more excellent than the first which was below, and the
      third, which was above them all, was more excellent than the two
      which were below. And the first glory, which was placed below them
      all, was like to the light which had come over Jesus before he had
      ascended into the heavens, and was like only itself in its light.
      And the three light-modes were of divers light-kinds, and they
      were of divers type, one being more excellent than the other. . .

      feared exceedingly, and were in agitation. Then Jesus, the
      compassionate and tender-hearted, when he saw his disciples, that
      they were in great agitation, spake with them, saying: "Take

      thyself that we may be able to stand; otherwise our eyes are
      darkened, and we are agitated, and the whole world also is in
      agitation because of the great light which is about thee."<br>
      <br>
      <i>He draweth his light unto himself. </i><br>
      Then Jesus drew to himself the glory of his light; and when this
      was done, all the disciples took courage, stepped forward to
      Jesus, fell down all together, adored him, rejoicing in great joy,
      and said unto him: "Rabbi, whither hast thou gone, or what was thy
      ministry on which thou hast gone, or wherefor rather were all
      these confusions and all the earth-quakings which have taken
      place?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>He promiseth to tell them all things. </i><br>
      Then Jesus, the compassionate, said unto them: "Rejoice and exult
      from this hour on, for I have gone to the regions out of which I
      had come forth. From this day on then will I discourse with you in
      openness,&nbsp; from the beginning of the Truth unto its

      similitude. From this hour on will I not hide anything from you of
      the [mystery] of the height and of that of the region of Truth.
      For authority hath been given me through the Ineffable and through

      is the four-and-twentieth mystery from within without, -- those

      <i>Of the souls of the disciples and their incarnation.</i><br>
      "For this cause have I chosen you verily from the beginning
      through the First Mystery. Rejoice then and exult, for when I set
      out for the world, I brought from the beginning with me twelve
      powers, as I have told you from the beginning, which I have taken
      from the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light, according
      to the command of the First Mystery. These then I cast into the
      womb of your mothers, when I came into the world, that is those
      which are in your bodies to-day. For these powers have been given
      unto you before the whole world, because ye are they who will save
      the whole world, and that ye may be able to endure the threat of
      the rulers of the world and the pains of the world and its dangers
      and all its persecutions, which the rulers of the height will
      bring upon you. For many times have I said unto you that I have
      brought the power in you out of the twelve saviours who are in the
      Treasury of the Light. For which cause I have said unto you indeed
      from the beginning that ye are not of the world. I also am not of
      it. For all men who are in the world have gotten their souls out
      of [the power of] the rulers of the æons. But the power which is
      in you is from me; your souls belong to the height. I have brought
      twelve powers of the twelve saviours of the Treasury of the Light,
      taking them out of the portion of my power which I did first
      receive. And when I had set forth for the world, I came into the
      midst of the rulers of the sphere and had the form of Gabriēl the
      angel of the æons; and the rulers of the æons did not know me, but
      they thought that I was the angel Gabriēl.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the incarnation of John the Baptizer.</i><br>
      "It came to pass then, when I had come into the midst of the
      rulers of the æons, that I looked down on the world of mankind, by
      command of the First Mystery. I found Elizabeth, the mother of
      John the Baptizer, before she had conceived him, and I sowed into
      her a power which I had received from the little Iaō, the Good,
      who is in the Midst, that he might be able to make proclamation
      before me and make ready my way, and baptize with the water of the
      forgiveness of sins. That power then is in the body of John.<br>
      <br>
      <i>That John was Elias in a former birth.</i><br>
      "Moreover in place of the soul of the ruler which he was appointed
      to receive, I found the soul of the prophet Elias in the æons of
      the sphere; and I took him thence, and took hi soul and brought it
      to the Virgin of Light, and she gave it over to her receivers;
      they brought it to the sphere of the rulers and cast it into the
      womb of Elizabeth. So the power of the little Iaō, who is in the
      Midst, and the soul of the prophet Elias, they were bound into the
      body of John the Baptizer. For this cause then were ye in doubt
      aforetime, I when I said unto you: 'John said: I am not the
      Christ,' and ye said unto me: 'It standeth written in the
      scripture: When the Christ shall come, Elias cometh before him and
      maketh ready his way.' But when ye said this unto me, I said unto
      you: 'Elias verily is come and hath made ready all things, as it
      standeth written, and they have done unto him as they would.' And
      when I knew that ye had not understood that I had discoursed with
      you concerning the soul of Elias which is bound into John the
      Baptizer, I answered you in the discourse in openness face to
      face: 'If ye like to accept John the Baptizer: he is Elias, of
      whom I have said that he will come.'"<br>

      <i>Of his own incarnation through Mary.</i><br>
      And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: "It came to
      pass then thereafter, that at the command of the First Mystery I
      looked down on the world of mankind and found Mary, who is called
      'my mother' according to the body of matter. I spake with her in
      the type of Gabriēl, and when she had turned herself to the height
      towards me, I cast thence into her the first power which I had
      received from Barbēlō--that is the body which I have borne in the
      height. And instead of the soul I cast into her the power which I
      have received from the great Sabaōth, the Good, who is in the
      region of the Right.<br>
      <br>
      <i>More concerning the light-powers in the disciples. </i><br>
      "And the twelve powers of the twelve saviours of the Treasury of
      the Light which I had received from the twelve ministers of the
      Midst, I cast into the sphere of the rulers. And the decans of the
      rulers and their servitors thought that they were souls of the
      rulers; and the servitors brought them, they bound them into the
      body of your mothers. And when your time was completed, ye were
      born in the world without souls of the rulers in you. And ye have
      received your portion out of the power which the last Helper hath
      breathed into the Mixture, that [power] which is blended with all
      the invisibles and all rulers and all æons,--in a word, which is
      blended with the world of destruction which is the Mixture. This
      [power], which from the beginning I brought out of myself, I have
      cast into the First Commandment, and the First Commandment cast a
      portion thereof into the great Light, and the great Light cast a
      portion of that which it had received, into the five Helpers, and
      the last Helper took a portion of that which it received, and cast
      it into the Mixture. And [this portion] is in all who are in the
      Mixture, as I have just said unto you."<br>

      <i>Why they should rejoice that the time of his investiture had
        come.</i><br>
      This then Jesus said to his disciples on the Mount of Olives.
      Jesus continued again in the discourse with his disciples [and
      said]: "Rejoice and exult and add joy to your joy, for the times
      are completed for me to put on my Vesture, which hath been
      prepared for me from the beginning, which I left behind in the
      last mystery until the time of its completion. Now the time of its
      completion is the time when I shall be commanded through the First
      Mystery to discourse with you from the beginning of the Truth to
      the completion thereof, and from the interiors of the interiors
      [to the exteriors of the exteriors], for the world will be saved
      through you. Rejoice then and exult, for ye are blessed before all

      question thee on this word, before that thou discoursest with us
      about the regions whither thou didst go."<br>

      magic of all the rulers of all the æons of the Fate and of those
      of the sphere, in the way in which the angels who transgressed
      have taught them, if they invoke them in their mysteries, that is
      in their evil magic, to the hindering of good deeds, -- will they
      accomplish them henceforth from now on or not?"<br>
      <br>
      Jesus explaineth further the conversion of the spheres.Jesus
      answered and said unto Mary: "They will not accomplish them as
      they accomplished them from the beginning, because I have taken
      away a third of their power; but they will raise a loan from those
      who know the mysteries of the magic of the thirteenth æon. And if
      they invoke the mysteries of the magic of those who are in the

      horoscope-casters and consulters from now on declare unto men what
      will come to pass for them?"<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "If the horoscope-casters
      find the Fate and the sphere turned towards the left, according to
      their first extension, their words will come to pass, and they
      will say what is to take place. But if they chance on the Fate or
      the sphere turned to the right, they are bound to say nothing
      true, for I have changed their influences and their squares and
      their triangles and their octagons; seeing that their influences
      from the beginning onwards were continuously turned to the left
      and their squares and their triangles and their octagons. But now
      I have made them spend six months turned to the left and six
      months turned to the right. He who then shall find their reckoning
      from the time when I changed them, setting them so as to spend six
      months facing towards their left and six months facing their right
      paths,-- he who then shall observe them in this wise, will know
      their influences surely and will declare all things which they
      will do. In like manner also the consulters, if they invoke the
      names of the rulers and chance on them facing the left, will tell
      [men] with accuracy all things concerning which they shall ask
      their decans. On the contrary, if the consulters invoke their
      names when they face to the right, they will not give ear unto
      them, because they are facing in another form compared with their
      former position in which Yew had established them; seeing that
      other are their names when they are turned to the left and other
      their names when they are turned to the right. And if they invoke
      them when they are turned to the right, they will not tell them
      the truth, but they will con-found them with confusion and
      threaten them with threatening. Those then who do not know their
      path, when they are turned to the right, and their triangles and
      their squares and all their figures, will find nothing true, but
      will be confounded in great confusion and will find themselves in
      great delusion, because I have now changed the works which they
      effected aforetime in their squares, when turned to the left, and
      in their triangles and in their octagons, in which they were
      busied continuously turned to the left; and I have made them spend
      six months forming all their configurations turned to the right,
      in order that they may be confounded in confusion in their whole
      range. And moreover I have made them spend six months turned to
      the left and accomplishing the works of their influences and all
      their configurations, in order that the rulers who are in the æons
      and in their spheres and in their heavens and in all their

      from now on will I hide nothing from you, but I will reveal unto

      from those of the sphere -- for he carried away then that which
      brings them into agitation -- and he set in motion the hastener

      [sc. the hastener] carried away their power which was in them and
      the breath of their mouth and the tears [lit. waters] of their

      while the servitors of all the rulers gather together all matter
      from them all; and the servitors of all the rulers of the Fate and

      fashion it into souls of men and cattle and reptiles and

      the moon, if they look above and see the configurations of the
      paths of the æons and the configurations of the Fate and those of
      the sphere, then they take from them the light-power; and the
      receivers of the sun get it ready and deposit it, until they hand
      it over to the receivers of Melchisedec, the Light-purifier. And
      their material refuse they bring to the sphere which is below the
      æons, and fashion it into [souls of] men, and fashion it also into
      souls of reptiles and of cattle and of wild-beasts and of birds,
      according to the circle of the rulers of that sphere and according

      of their æons and the paths of their Fate and of their sphere. I
      made them face six months towards the triangles on the left and
      towards the squares and towards those in their aspect and towards
      their octagons, just as they had formerly been. But their manner

      set them in great agitation, and thence on they were no longer

      order that their regions may continue to delay and they
      [themselves] may spend a long time as rulers.<br>

      time facing to the right. I have changed their whole path and
      their whole course, and I have made the path of their course to
      hurry, so that they may be quickly purified and raised up quickly.
      And I have shortened their circles, and made their path more
      speedy, and it will be exceedingly hurried. And they were thrown
      into confusion in their path, and from then on were no more able
      to devour the matter of the refuse of the purification They no
      more have the power of devouring their matter.of their light. And
      moreover I have shortened their times and their periods, so that
      the perfect number of souls who shall receive the mysteries and be
      in the Treasury of the Light, shall be quickly completed. For had
      I not changed their courses, and had I not shortened their
      periods, they would not have let any soul come into the world,
      because of the matter of their refuse which they devoured, and
      they would have destroyed many souls. For this cause I said unto
      you aforetime: 'I have shortened the times because of my elect;
      otherwise no soul would have been able to be saved.' And I have
      shortened the times and the periods because of the perfect number
      of the souls who shall receive the mysteries, that is to say, the

      would have been saved, but they would have perished in the fire

      she had seen in the light of the veil of the Treasury of the
      Light.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The rulers hate her for ceasing in their mystery. </i><br>
      "It came to pass then, when she sang praises to the region of the
      height, that all the rulers in the twelve æons, who are below,
      hated her, because she had ceased from their mysteries, and
      because she had desired to go into the height and be above them
      all. For this cause then they were enraged against her and hated
      her, [as did] the great triple-powered Self-willed, that is the
      third triple-power, who is in the thirteenth æon, he who had
      become disobedient, in as much as he had not emanated the whole
      purification of his power in him, and had not given the
      purification of his light at the time when the rulers gave their
      purification, in that he desired to rule over the whole thirteenth
      æon and those who are below it.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Self-willed uniteth himself with the rulers of the twelve æons
        and emanateth a lion-faced power to plague Sophia.</i><br>
      "It came to pass then, when the rulers of the twelve æons were
      enraged against Pistis Sophia, who is above them, and hated her
      exceedingly, that the great triple-powered Self-willed, of whom I
      have just now told you, joined himself to the rulers of the twelve
      æons, and also was enraged against Pistis Sophia and hated her
      exceedingly, because she had thought to go to the light which is
      higher than her. And he emanated out of himself a great lion-faced
      power, and out of his matter in him he emanated a host of other
      very violent material emanations, and sent them into the regions
      below, to the parts of the chaos, in order that they might there
      lie in wait for Pistis Sophia and take away her power out of her,
      because she thought to go to the height which is above them all,
      and moreover she had ceased to perform their mystery, and lamented
      continuously and sought after the light which she. had seen. And
      the rulers who abide, or persist, in performing the mystery, hated
      her, and all the guards who are at the gates of the æons, hated
      her also.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then thereafter by command of the First
      Commandment that the great triple-powered Self-willed, who is one
      of the three triple-powers, pursued Sophia in the thirteenth æon,
      in order that she should look towards the parts below, so that she
      might see in that region his lion-faced light-power and long after
      it and go to that region, so that her light might be taken from
      her.<br>

      <i>Sophia taketh the lion-faced power of Self-willed for the true
        Light.</i><br>
      "It came to pass then thereafter that she looked below and saw his
      light-power in the parts below; and she knew not that it is that
      of the triple-powered Self-willed, but she thought that it came
      out of the light which she had seen from the beginning in the
      height, which came out of the veil of the Treasury of the Light.
      And she thought to herself: I will go into that region without my
      pair and take the light and thereout fashion for myself
      light-æons, so that I may go to the Light of lights, which is in
      the Height of heights.<br>
      <br>
      <i>She descendeth to the twelve æons and thence into the chaos.</i><br>
      "This then thinking, she went forth from her own region, the
      thirteenth æon, and went down to the twelve æons. The rulers of
      the æons pursued her and were enraged against her, because she had
      thought of grandeur. And she went forth also from the twelve æons,
      and came into the regions of the chaos and drew nigh to that
      lion-faced light-power to devour it. But all the material
      emanations of Self-willed surrounded her, and the great lion-faced
      light-power devoured The emanations of Self-willed squeeze the
      light-powers out of Sophia.all the light-powers in Sophia and
      cleaned out her light and devoured it, and her matter was thrust
      into the chaos; it became a lion-faced ruler in the chaos, of
      which one half is fire and the other darkness,-- that is
      Yaldabaōth, of whom I have spoken unto you many times. When then
      this befell, Sophia became very greatly exhausted, and that
      lion-faced light-power set to work to take away from Sophia all
      her light-powers, and all the material powers of Self-willed
      surrounded Sophia at the same time and pressed her sore.<br>

      <i>The first repentance of Sophia. </i><br>
      "And Pistis Sophia cried out most exceedingly, she cried to the
      Light of lights which she had seen from the beginning, in which
      she had had faith, and uttered this repentance, saying thus:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. O Light of lights, in whom I have had faith from the
      beginning, hearken now then, O Light, unto my repentance. Save me,
      O Light, for evil thoughts have entered into me.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. I gazed, O Light, into the lower parts and saw there a light.
      thinking: I will go to that region, in order that I may take that
      light. And I went and found myself in the darkness which is in the
      chaos below, and I could no more speed thence and go to my region,
      for I was sore pressed by all the emanations of Self-willed, and
      the lion-faced power took away my light in me.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. And I cried for help, but my voice hath not reached out of
      the darkness. And I looked unto the height, that the Light, in
      which I had had faith, might help me.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. And when I looked unto the height, I saw all the rulers of
      the æons, how in their numbers they looked down on me and rejoiced
      over me, though I had done them no ill; but they hated me without
      a cause. And when the emanations of Self-willed saw the rulers of
      the æons rejoicing over me, they knew that the rulers of the æons
      would not come to my aid; and those emanations which sore pressed
      me with violence, took courage, and the light which I had not
      taken from them, they have taken from me.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. Now, therefore, O Light of Truth, thou knowest that I have
      done this in my innocence, thinking that the lion-faced
      light-power belonged to thee; and the sin which I have done is
      open before thee.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. Suffer me no more to lack, O Lord, for I have had faith in
      thy light from the beginning; O Lord, O Light of the powers,
      suffer me no more to lack my light.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. For because of thy inducement and for the sake of thy light
      am I fallen into this oppression, and shame hath covered me.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. And because of the illusion of thy light, I am become a
      stranger to my brethren, the invisibles, and to the great
      emanations of Barbēlō.<br>
      <br>
      "'9. This hath befallen me, O Light, because I have been zealous
      for thy abode; and the wrath of Self-willed is come upon me--of
      him who had not hearkened unto thy command to emanate from the
      emanation of his power -- because I was in his æon without
      performing his mystery.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. And all the rulers of the æons mocked me.<br>
      <br>
      "'11. And I was in that region, mourning and seeking after the
      light which I had seen in the height.<br>
      <br>
      "'12. And the guards of the gates of the æons searched for me, and
      all who remain in their mystery mocked me.<br>
      <br>
      "'13. But I looked up unto the height towards thee and had faith
      in thee. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, I am sore pressed in
      the darkness of chaos. If now thou wilt come to save me,--great is
      thy mercy,-- then hear me in truth and save me.<br>
      <br>
      "'14. Save me out of the matter of this darkness, that I may not
      be submerged therein, that I may be saved from the emanations of
      god Self-willed which press me sore, and from their evil doings.<br>
      <br>
      "'15. Let not this darkness submerge me, and let not this
      lion-faced power entirely devour the whole of my power, and let
      not this chaos shroud my power.<br>
      <br>
      "'16. Hear me, O Light, for thy grace is precious, and look down
      upon me according to the great mercy of thy Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'17. Turn not thy face from me, for I am exceedingly tormented.<br>
      <br>
      "'18. Haste thee, hearken unto me and save my power.<br>
      <br>
      "'19. Save me because of the rulers who hate me, for thou knowest
      my sore oppression and my torment and the torment of my power
      which they have taken from me. They who have set me in all this
      evil are before thee; deal with them according to thy good
      pleasure.<br>
      <br>
      "'20. My power looked forth from the midst of the chaos and from
      the midst of the darkness, and I waited for my pair, that he
      should come and fight for me, and he came not, and I looked that
      he should come and lend me power, and I found him not.<br>
      <br>
      "'21. And when I sought the light, they gave me darkness; and when
      I sought my power, they gave me matter.<br>
      <br>
      "'22. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, may the darkness and the
      matter which the emanations of Self-willed have brought upon me,
      be unto them for a snare, and may they be ensnared therein, and
      recompense them and may they be made to stumble and not come into
      the region of their Self-willed.<br>
      <br>
      "'23. May they remain in the darkness and not behold the light;
      may they behold the chaos for ever, and let them not look unto the
      height.<br>
      <br>
      "'24. Bring upon them their revenge, and may thy judgment lay hold
      upon them.<br>
      <br>
      "'25. Let them not henceforth come into their region to their god
      Self-willed, and let not his emanations henceforth come into their
      regions; for their god is impious and self-willed, and he thought
      that he had done this evil of himself, not knowing that, had I not
      been brought low according to thy command, he would not have had
      any authority over me.<br>
      <br>
      "'26. But when thou hadst by thy command brought me low, they
      pursued me the more, and their emanations added pain to my
      humiliation.<br>
      <br>
      "'27. And they have taken light-power from me and fallen again to
      pressing me sore, in order to take away all the light in me.
      Because of this in which they have set me, let them not ascend to
      the thirteenth æon, the region of Righteousness.<br>
      <br>
      "'28. But let them not be reckoned in the lot of those who purify
      themselves and the light, and let them not be reckoned with those
      who will quickly repent, that they may quickly receive mysteries
      in the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'29. For they have taken my light from me, and my power hath
      begun to cease in me and I am destitute of my light.<br>
      <br>
      "'30. Now, therefore, O Light, which is in thee and is with me, I
      sing praises to thy name, O Light, in glory.<br>
      <br>
      "'31. May my song of praise please thee, O Light, as an excellent
      mystery, which leadeth to the gates of the Light, which they who
      shall repent will utter, and the light of which will purify them.<br>
      <br>
      "'32. Now, therefore, let all matters rejoice; seek ye all the
      Light, that the power of the stars which is in you, may live.<br>
      <br>
      "'33. For the Light hath heard the matters, nor will it leave any
      without having purified them.<br>
      <br>
      "'34. Let the souls and the matters praise the Lord of all æons,
      and [let] the matters and all that is in them [praise him].<br>
      <br>
      "'35. For God shall save their soul from all matters, and a city
      shall be prepared in the Light, and all the souls who are saved,
      will dwell in that city and will inherit it.<br>
      <br>

      which Pistis Sophia uttered in her first repentance, repenting of
      her sin, and reciting all which had befallen her. Now, therefore:
      'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.'"<br>

      Mary again came forward and said: "My Lord, my indweller of light
      hath ears, and I hear with my light-power, and thy spirit which is
      with me, hath sobered me. Hearken then that I may speak concerning
      the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, speaking of her
      sin and all that befell her. Thy light-power hath prophesied
      thereof aforetime through the prophet David in the sixty-eighth
      Psalm:<br>

      "'1. Save me, O God, for the waters are come in even unto my soul.<br>

      was not. I have gone-down into the depths of the sea; a tempest
      hath submerged me.<br>

      waiting patiently for God.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. They who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
      my head; mighty are my foes, who violently pursued me. They
      required of me that which I took not from them.<br>

      hid from thee.<br>

      ashamed for my sake; let not those who seek thee be ashamed for my

      sons of my mother.<br>

      well-liking is [now], O God. In the fulness of thy grace give ear
      unto my salvation in truth.<br>

      and thou thyself didst make me to emanate; and I have had faith in
      thy light from the beginning.<br>

      "'7. And when I had faith in thee, the rulers of the æons mocked
      at me, saying: She hath ceased in her mystery. Thou art my saviour
      and thou art my deliverer and thou art my mystery, O Light.<br>

      "'10. For all the emanations of Self-willed have taken from me my
      whole light-power and have surrounded me. They desired to take
      away my whole light from me utterly and have set a watch on my
      power,<br>

      let us seize her and take away the whole light in her.<br>

      "'9. Cast me not away in the time of age; if my soul fades,
      forsake me not.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. For mine enemies have spoken evil against me and they who
      lay in wait for my soul, have taken counsel against my soul,<br>

      order that the lion-faced power and all the material emanations
      with it, which Self-willed had sent into the chaos, might not take
      away her total light in her. She uttered then this repentance as
      follows:<br>

      "'1. O Light, in whom I have trusted, give ear to my repentance,

      have forgotten my mystery which heretofore I was wont to
      accomplish.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. Because of the voice of the fear and the power of Self-willed
      my power is vanished.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. I am become as a demon apart, who dwelleth in matter and
      light is not in him, and I am become as a counterfeiting spirit,
      which is in a material body and light-power is not in it.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. And I am become as a decan who is alone in the air.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. The emanations of Self-willed have sore oppressed me, and my
      pair hath said unto himself:<br>
      <br>
      "'9. Instead of with light which was in her, they have filled her
      with chaos. I have devoured the sweat of my own matter and the
      anguish of the tears from the matter of my eyes, so that they who
      oppress me may not take the rest.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. All this hath befallen me, O Light, by thy commandment and
      thy command, and it is thy commandment that I am here.<br>
      <br>
      "'11. Thy commandment hath brought me down, and I am descended as
      a power of the chaos, and my power is numbed in me.<br>

      "'12. But thou, O Lord, art Light eternal, and dost visit them who
      are for ever oppressed.<br>

      soul in me. Thy commandment is accomplished, which thou didst
      decree for me in my afflictions. My time is come, that thou
      shouldst seek my power and my soul, and this is the time which
      thou didst decree to seek me.<br>

      because the number is completed, and in order that also its matter
      may be saved.<br>
      <br>
      "'15. And then at that time shall all the rulers of the material
      æons be in fear of thy light, and all the emanations of the
      thirteenth material æon shall be in fear of the mystery of thy
      light, so that the others may put on the purification of their
      light.<br>
      <br>
      "'16. For the Lord will seek the power of your soul. He hath
      revealed his mystery,<br>
      <br>
      "'17. So that he may regard the repentance of them who are in the
      regions below; and he hath not disregarded their repentance.<br>
      <br>
      "'18. This is then that mystery which is become the type in
      respect of the race which shall be born; and the race which shall
      be born will sing praises to the height.<br>
      <br>

      It will look down on the total matter,<br>

      Mary started forward again, stepped into the midst, placed herself
      by Philip and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, my in-dweller of light
      hath ears, and I am ready to hear with my power, and I have
      understood the word which thou hast spoken. Now, therefore, my
      Lord, hearken that I may discourse in openness, thou who hast said
      unto us: 'Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.'<br>

      three by the First Mystery, to write all the discourses of the

      said: "Well said, Mary, this is the solution of the word. Now,
      therefore, do thou, Philip, come forward and proclaim the solution
      of the fifth repentance of Pistis Sophia, and thereafter take thy
      seat and write all the discourses which I shall speak, until the
      number of thy portion which thou hast to write of the words of the

      Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his
      disciples: "It came to pass, when Pistis Sophia had finished
      uttering the sixth repentance for the forgiveness of her
      transgression, that she turned again to the height, to see if her
      sins were forgiven her, and to see whether they would lead her up
      out of the chaos. But by commandment of the First Mystery not yet

      should be led up out of the chaos. When then she had turned to the

      over her because her repentance was not accepted from her. When

      lifted up her voice to the height in her seventh repentance,

      for ever.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. As to my transgression, which I have committed from the
      beginning in my ignorance, put it not to my account, O Light, but
      rather save me through thy great mystery of the forgiveness of
      sins because of thy goodness, O Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. For good and sincere is the Light. For this cause will it
      grant me my way, to be saved out of my transgression;<br>
      <br>
      "'9. And for my powers, which are diminished through the fear of
      the material emanations of Self-willed, will it draw near after
      its commandment, and will teach my powers, which are diminished
      because of the merciless, its gnosis.<br>
      <br>

      mysteries for all who seek the regions of its Inheritance and its
      mysteries.<br>

      will show them the region of the Inheritance, which is in the
      Treasury of the Light.<br>

      feet from the bonds of the darkness.<br>

      Remember me according to the fulness of thy mercy because of thy
      goodness, O Lord.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. The Lord is gracious and sincere; therefore fore will he

      "'9. He will guide the tender-hearted in the judgment and will
      teach the tender-hearted his ways.<br>

      out of the chaos. Nevertheless of myself out of compassion without
      commandment I led her into a somewhat spacious region in the
      chaos. And when the material emanations of Self-willed had noticed
      that she had been led into a somewhat spacious region in the
      chaos, they ceased a little to oppress her, for they thought that
      she would be led up out of the chaos altogether. When this then
      took place, Pistis Sophia did not know that I was her helper; nor
      did she know me at all, but she continued and persisted withal
      singing praises to the Light of the Treasury, which she had seen
      aforetime and on which she had had faith, and she thought that it
      [sc. the Light] also was her helper and it was the same to which
      she had sung praises, thinking it was the Light in truth. But as
      indeed she had had faith in the Light which belongeth to the
      Treasury in truth, therefore will she be led up out of the chaos
      and her repentance will be accepted from her. But the commandment
      of the First Mystery was not yet accomplished to accept her
      repentance from her. But hearken now in order that I may tell you

      region in the chaos, that the emanations of Self-willed ceased
      entirely to oppress her, thinking that she would be led up out of
      the chaos altogether. It came to pass then, when the emanations of
      Self-willed had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led up out
      the chaos, that they turned about again all together, oppressing
      her vehemently. Because of this then she uttered the eighth
      repentance, because they had not ceased to oppress her, and had
      turned about to oppress her to the utmost. She uttered this
      repentance, saying thus:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. On thee, O Light, have I hoped. Leave me not in the chaos;
      deliver me and save me according to thy gnosis.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. Give heed unto me and save me. Be unto me a saviour, O Light,
      and save me and lead me unto thy light.<br>
      "'3. For thou art my saviour and wilt lead me unto thee. And
      because of the mystery of thy name lead me and give me thy
      mystery.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. And thou wilt save me from this lion-faced power, which they
      have laid as a snare for me, for thou art my saviour.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. And in thy hands will I lay the purification of my light;
      thou hast saved me, O Light, according to thy gnosis.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. Thou art become wroth with them who keep watch over me and
      will not be able to lay hold of me utterly. But I have had faith
      in the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. I will rejoice and will sing praises that thou hast had mercy
      upon me and hast heeded and saved me from the oppression in which
      I was. And thou wilt set free my power out of the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. And thou hast not left me in the hand of the lion-faced
      power; but thou hast led me into a region which is not
      oppressed.'"<br>

      <i>The emanations of Self-willed cease for a time to oppress
        Sophia. She continueth her repentance. </i><br>
      When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he answered
      again and said unto them: "It came to pass then, when the
      lion-faced power had noticed that Pistis Sophia had not been led
      up altogether out of the chaos, that it came again with all the
      other material emanations of Self-willed, and they oppressed
      Pistis Sophia again. It came to pass then, when they oppressed
      her, that she cried out in the same repentance, saying:<br>
      <br>
      "'9. Have mercy upon me, O Light, for they have oppressed me
      again. Because of thy commandment, the light in me is distracted
      and my power and my understanding.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. My power hath begun to wane whiles I am in these
      afflictions, and the number of my time whiles I am in the chaos.
      My light is diminished, for they have taken away my power from me,
      and all the powers in me are tossed about.<br>
      <br>
      "'11. I am become powerless in the presence of all the rulers of
      the æons, who hate me, and in the presence of the four-and-twenty
      emanations, in whose region I was. And my brother, my pair, was
      afraid to help me, because of that in which they have set me.<br>
      <br>
      "'12. And all the rulers of the height have counted me as matter
      in which is no light. I am become as a material power which hath
      fallen out of the rulers,<br>
      <br>
      "'13. And all who are in the æons said: She hath become chaos. And
      thereafter all the pitiless powers encompassed me together and
      proposed to take away the whole light in me.<br>
      <br>
      "'14. But I have trusted in thee, O Light, and said: Thou art my
      saviour.<br>
      <br>
      "'15. And my commandment, which thou hast decreed for me, is in
      thy hands. Save me out of the hands of the emanations of
      Self-willed, which oppress me and persecute me.<br>
      <br>
      "'16. Send thy light over me, for I am as naught before thee, and
      save me according to thy compassion.<br>
      <br>
      "'17. Let me not be despised, for I have sung praises unto thee, O
      Light. Let chaos cover the emanations of Self-willed, let them be
      led down into the darkness.<br>
      <br>
      "'18. Let the mouth of them be shut up, who would devour me with
      guile, who say: Let us take the whole light in her,--although I
      have done them no ill.'"<br>

      And when Jesus had spoken this, Matthew came forward and said: "My
      Lord, thy spirit hath stirred me and thy light hath made me sober
      to proclaim this eighth repentance of Pistis Sophia. For thy power
      hath prophesied thereof aforetime through David in the thirtieth
      Psalm, saying:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. On thee, O Lord, have I hoped. Let me never be put to shame;

      privily for me; for thou art my protection.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. Into thy hands I will render my spirit; thou hast redeemed
      me, O Lord, God of Truth.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. Thou hast hated them who hold to vain emptiness; but I have
      trusted.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. And I shall rejoice because of my Lord and make merry over
      thy grace. For thou hast looked down upon my humbleness and saved
      my soul out of my necessities.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of my foes; thou

      "'9. Be gracious unto me, O Lord, for I am afflicted; my eye is
      distracted in the wrath and my soul and my body.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. For my years have wasted away in sadness and my life is
      wasted in sighing. My power is enfeebled in misery and my bones
      are distracted.<br>

      "'11. I am become a mockery for all my foes and my neighbours. I
      am become a fright for my acquaintances, and they who saw me, are
      fled away from me.<br>

      "'12. I am forgotten in their heart as a corpse, and I have become

      about. Massing themselves together against me, they took counsel
      to take away my soul from me.<br>

      Pistis Sophia in the chaos, that she uttered the ninth repentance,
      saying:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      "'1. O Light, smite down them who have taken away my power from

      from me.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. For I am thy power and thy light. Come and save me.<br>

      "'3. Let great darkness cover my oppressors. Say unto my power: I
      am he who will save thee.<br>

      "'4. Let all those who would take away my light from me utterly,
      lack their power. Let them face about unto the chaos and become
      powerless, who would take away my light from me utterly.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. Let their power be as dust, and let Yew, thy angel, smite
      them.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. And if they would go into the height, let darkness seize upon
      them and let them slip down and turn to the chaos. And let thy
      angel Yew pursue them and cast them down into the darkness below.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. For they have set a lion-faced power as a trap for me,
      although I have done them no ill, from which its light will be
      taken; and they have oppressed the power in me, which they will
      not be able to take away.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. Now, therefore, O Light, take away the purification from the
      lion-faced power without its knowing it,-- the thought which
      Self-willed hath thought, to take away my light; take away his own
      and let the light be taken away from the lion-faced power, which
      set the trap for me.<br>
      <br>
      "'9. But my power will exult in the Light and rejoice that he will
      save it.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. And all the portions of my power shall say: There is no
      saviour but thee. For thou wilt save me out of the hand of the
      lion-faced power, which hath taken away my power from me, and thou
      savest me out of the hands of them who have taken away my power
      and my light from me.<br>
      <br>
      "'11. For they have risen up against me, lying against me and
      saying that I know the mystery of the Light which is in the
      height, [the Light] in which I have had faith. And they have
      constrained me, [saying:] Tell unto us the mystery of the Light in
      the height,-- that which I know not.<br>
      <br>
      "'12. And they have requited me with all this ill because I have
      had faith in the Light of the height; and they have made my power
      lightless.<br>
      <br>
      "'13. But when they constrained me, I sat in the darkness, my soul
      bowed down in mourning.<br>
      <br>
      "'14. And do thou, O Light -- for that reason sing I praise to
      thee -- save me. I know that thou wilt save me because I fulfilled
      thy will ever since I was in my æon. I fulfilled thy will, as the
      invisibles who are in my region, and as my pair. And I mourned,
      looking unceasingly and searching for the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'15. Now, therefore, have all the emanations of Self-willed
      surrounded me and rejoiced over me and sore oppressed me without
      my knowing [them]. And they have fled away and ceased from me but
      have had no pity upon me.<br>

      oppressed me in great oppression and ground their teeth against
      me, desiring to take away my light from me utterly.<br>

      "'17. How long, therefore, O Light, dost thou suffer them, that
      they oppress me? Save my power from their evil thoughts and save
      me from the hand of the lion-faced power; for I alone of the
      invisibles am in this region.<br>

      who are gathered together against me, and I will cry unto thee in
      the midst of all who oppress me.<br>
      <br>
      "'19. Now, therefore, O Light, let not them who hate me and desire
      to take away my power from me, rejoice over me--who hate me and
      flash their eyes against me, though I have not done anything unto
      them.<br>

      me concerning the mysteries of the Light which I know not, and
      have craftily spoken against me and been enraged against me,
      because I have had faith in the Light in the height.<br>

      indeed, we will take from her her light.<br>

      them not and let not thy help be far from me.<br>

      therefore, O Light of lights, let them not take away my light from
      me,<br>
      <br>
      "'25. And let them not say in their heart: Our power is glutted
      with her light. And let them not say: We have consumed her power.<br>
      <br>
      "'26. But rather let darkness come upon them, and let those who
      long to take away my light from me, become powerless, and let them
      be clothed with chaos and darkness, who say there: We will take
      away her light and her power.<br>
      <br>
      "'27. Now, therefore, save me that I may rejoice, for I long for
      the thirteenth æon, the region of Righteousness, and I shall say
      ever-more: May the light of thy angel Yew shine more and more.<br>

      Mystery hearkened unto her, and I was sent off at his command. I
      came to help her, and led her up out of the chaos, because she had
      repented, and also because she had had faith in the Light and had
      endured these great pains and these great perils. She had been
      deluded through the god-like Self-willed, and had not been deluded
      through anything else, save through a light-power, because of its
      resemblance to the Light in which she had had faith. For this
      cause then was I sent forth at the command of the First Mystery to
      help her secretly. I did not however yet go to the region of the
      æons at all; but I passed down through the midst out of them,
      without any single power knowing it, either those of the interior
      of the interior or those of the exterior of the exterior, save
      only the First Mystery.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then, when I came into the chaos to help her,
      that she saw me, that I was understanding and shone exceedingly
      and was full of compassion for her. For I was not self-willed as
      the lion-faced power, which had taken away the light-power from
      Sophia, and had also oppressed her in order to take away from her
      the whole light in her. Sophia then saw me, that I shone
      ten-thousand times more than the lion-faced power, and that I was
      full of compassion for her. And she knew that I came out of the
      Height of heights, in whose light she had had faith from the
      beginning. Pistis Sophia then took courage and uttered the tenth
      repentance, saying:<br>
      <br>
      <i>The tenth repentance of Sophia.</i><br>
      "'1. I have cried unto thee, O Light of lights, in my oppression
      and thou hast hearkened unto me.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. O Light, save my power from unjust and lawless lips and from
      crafty traps.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. The light which was being taken from me in crafty snaring,
      will not be brought unto thee.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. For the traps of Self-willed and the nooses of the merciless
      [one] are spread out.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. Woe unto me, that my dwelling was far off, and I was in the
      dwellings of the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. My power was in regions which are not mine.<br>

      them, they fought against me without a cause.'"<br>

      "'6. And the four-and-twenty emanations will see what hath

      out of the chaos. And of myself, without the First Mystery, I
      despatched out of myself a light-power, and I sent it down to the
      chaos, so that it might lead Pistis Sophia forth from the deep
      regions of the chaos, and lead [her] to the higher regions of the
      chaos, until the command should come from the First Mystery that
      she should be led entirely forth out of the chaos. And my
      light-power led Pistis Sophia up to the higher regions of the
      chaos. It came to pass then, when the emanations of Self-willed
      had noticed that Pistis Sophia was led forth into the higher
      regions of the chaos, that they also sped after her upwards,
      desiring to bring her again into the lower regions of the chaos.
      And my light-power, which I had sent to lead up Sophia out of the
      chaos, shone exceedingly. It came to pass then, when the
      emanations of Self-willed pursued Sophia, when she had been led
      into the higher regions of the chaos, that she again sang praises
      and cried out unto me, saying:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia uttereth a song of praise.</i><br>
      "'1. I will sing praises unto thee, O Light, for I desired to come
      unto thee. I will sing thee praises, O Light, for thou art my
      deliverer.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. Leave me not in the chaos. Save me, O Light of the Height,
      for it is thou that I have praised.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Thou has sent me thy light through thyself and hast saved me.
      Thou hast led me to the higher regions of the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. May the emanations of Self-willed which pursue me, sink down
      into the lower regions of the chaos, and let them not come to the
      higher regions to see me.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. And may great darkness cover them and darker gloom come over
      them. And let them not see me in the light of thy power, which
      thou hast sent unto me to save me, so that they may not again get
      dominion over me.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. And let not their resolution which they have formed, to take
      away my power, take effect for them. And as they have spoken
      against me, to take from me my light, take rather from them theirs
      instead of mine.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. And they have proposed to take away my whole light and have
      not been able to take it, for thy light-power was with me.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. Because they have taken counsel without thy commandment, O
      Light, therefore have they not been able to take away my light.<br>
      <br>
      "'9. Because I have had faith in the Light, I shall not be afraid;
      and the Light is my deliverer and I shall not fear.'<br>
      <br>
      "Now, therefore, let him whose power is exalted, speak the
      solution of the words which Pistis Sophia hath uttered."<br>
      <br>
      And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished speaking these words
      unto his disciples, that Salome came forward and said: "My Lord,
      my power constraineth me to speak the solution of the words which
      Pistis Sophia hath uttered. Thy power hath prophesied aforetime
      through Solomon, saying:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Salome interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of
        Solomon.</i><br>
      "'1. I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord, for thou art my God.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. Abandon me not, O Lord, for thou art! my hope.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Thou hast given me thy vindication for naught, and I am saved
      through thee.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. Let them who pursue me, fall down and let them not see me.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. May a smoke-cloud cover their eyes and an air-mist darken
      them, and let them not see the day, so that they may not seize me.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. May their resolution be impotent, and may what they concoct
      come upon them.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. They have devised a resolution, and it hath not taken effect
      for them.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. And they are vanquished, although they be mighty, and what
      they have wickedly pre-pared is fallen upon them.<br>
      <br>
      "'9. My hope is in the Lord, and I shall not be afraid, for thou
      art my God, my Saviour.'"<br>
      <br>

      <i>The power sent by Jesus formeth a light-wreath on Sophia's
        head.</i><br>
      And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his
      disciples: "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished
      saying these words in the chaos, that I made the light-power,
      which I had sent to save her, become a light-wreath on her head,
      so that from now on the emanations of Self-willed could not have
      dominion over her. And when it had become a light-wreath round her
      head, all the evil matters in her were shaken and all were
      purified in her. They perished and remained in the chaos, while
      the emanations of Self-willed gazed upon them and rejoiced. And
      the purification of the pure light which was in Pistis Sophia,
      gave power to the light of my light-power, which had become a
      wreath round her head.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia uttereth another song of praise.</i><br>
      "It came to pass then moreover, when it surrounded the pure light
      in Sophia, and her pure light did not depart from the wreath of
      the power of the light-flame, so that the emanations of
      Self-willed should not rob it from it,--when then this befell her,
      the pure light-power in Sophia began to sing praises. And she
      praised my light-power, which was a wreath round her head, and she
      sang praises, saying:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. The Light hath become a wreath round my head; and I shall not
      depart from it, so that the emanations of Self-willed may not rob
      it from me.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. And though all the matters be shaken,&nbsp; yet shall I not
      be shaken.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. And though all my matters perish and remain in the
      chaos,--those which the emanations of Self-willed see,--yet shall
      I not perish.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. For the Light is with me, and I myself am with the Light.'<br>
      <br>
      "These words then Pistis Sophia uttered. Now, therefore, let him
      who understandeth the thought of these words, come forward and
      proclaim their solution."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary, his mother, asketh and receiveth permission to speak.</i><br>
      Then Mary, the mother of Jesus, came forward and said: "My son

      height, bid me proclaim the solution of the words which Pistis
      Sophia hath uttered."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered and said: "Thou also, Mary, hast received form
      which is in Barbēlō, according to matter, and hast received
      likeness which is in the Virgin of Light, according to light, thou
      and the other Mary, the blessed one; and on thy account the
      darkness hath arisen, and moreover out of thee did come forth the

      <i>The commandment of the First Mystery is fulfilled for taking
        Sophia entirely out of the chaos.</i><br>
      And Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his
      disciples: "It came to pass when Pistis Sophia had uttered the
      thirteenth repentance,-- in that hour was fulfilled the
      commandment of all the tribulations which were de-creed for Pistis
      Sophia for the fulfilment of the First Mystery, which was from the
      beginning, and the time had come to save her out of the chaos and
      lead her out from all the darknesses. For her repentance was
      accepted from her through the First Mystery; and that mystery sent
      me a great light-power out of the height, that I might help Pistis
      Sophia and lead her up out of the chaos. <i><br>
        <br>
        The First Mystery and Jesus sent forth two light-powers to help
        Sophia.</i><br>
      So I looked towards the æons into the height and saw that
      light-power which the First Mystery had sent me, that I might save
      Pistis Sophia out of the chaos. It came to pass, therefore, when I
      had seen it, coming forth from the æons and hastening down to
      me,-- I was above the chaos,-- that another light-power went forth
      out of me, that it too might help Pistis Sophia. And the
      light-power which had come from the height through the First
      Mystery, came down upon the light-power which had gone out of me;
      and they met together and became a great stream of light."<br>
      <br>
      When then Jesus had said this unto his disciples, he said:
      "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary Magdalene interpreteth the mystery from Psalm lxxxiv.</i><br>
      Mary started forward again and said: "My Lord, I understand what
      thou sayest. Concerning the solution of this word thy light-power
      hath prophesied aforetime through David in the eighty-fourth
      Psalm, saying:<br>
      <br>
      "'10. Grace and truth met together, and righteousness and peace
      kissed each other.<br>
      <br>
      "'11. Truth sprouted forth out of the earth, and righteousness
      looked down from heaven.'<br>
      <br>
      "'Grace' then is the light-power which hath come down through the
      First Mystery; for the First Mystery hath hearkened unto Pistis
      Sophia and hath had mercy on her in all her tribulations. 'Truth'
      on the other hand is the power which hath gone forth out of thee,
      for that thou hast fulfilled the truth, in order to save her out
      of the chaos. And 'righteousness' again is the power which hath
      come forth through the First Mystery, which will guide Pistis
      Sophia. And 'peace' again is the power which hath gone forth out
      of thee, so that it should enter into the emanations of
      Self-willed and take from them the lights which they have taken
      away from Pistis Sophia, that is, so that thou mayest gather them
      together into Pistis Sophia and make them at peace with her power.
      'Truth' on the other hand is the power which went forth out of
      thee, when thou wast in the lower regions of the chaos. For this
      cause thy power hath said through David<br>
      <br>
      'Truth sprouted out of the earth,' because thou wert in the lower
      regions of the chaos. 'Righteousness' on the other hand which hath
      'looked down from heaven,'--it is the power which hath come down
      from the height through the First Mystery and hath entered into

      <i>The story of the phantom spirit.</i><br>
      "When thou wert little, before the spirit had come upon thee,
      whilst thou wert in a vineyard with Joseph, the spirit came out of
      the height and came to me in my house, like unto thee; and I had
      not known him, but I thought that thou wast he. And the spirit
      said unto me: Where is Jesus, my brother, that I meet with him?'
      And when he had said this unto me, I was at a loss and thought it
      was a phantom to try me. So I seized him and bound him to the foot
      of the bed in my house, until I went forth to you, to thee and
      Joseph in the field, and I found you on the vineyard, Joseph
      propping up the vineyard. It came to pass, therefore, when thou
      didst hear me speak the word unto Joseph, that thou didst
      understand the word, wert joyful and saidest: 'Where is he, that I
      may see him; else I await him in this place.' And it came to pass,
      when Joseph had heard thee say these words, that he was startled.
      And we went down together, entered the house and found the spirit
      bound to the bed. And we looked on thee and him and found thee
      like unto him. And he who was bound to the bed was unloosed; he
      took thee in his arms and kissed thee, and thou also didst kiss
      him. Ye became one.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the spiritual and material bodies of Jesus.</i><br>
      "This then is the word and its solution. 'Grace' is the spirit
      which hath come down out of the height through the First Mystery,
      for it hath had mercy on the race of men and sent its spirit that
      he should forgive the sins of the whole world, and they should
      receive the mysteries and inherit the Light-kingdom. 'Truth' on
      the other hand is the power which hath sojourned with me. When it
      had come forth out of Barbēlō, it became material body for thee,
      and hath made proclamation concerning the region of Truth.
      'Righteousness' is thy spirit, who hath brought the mysteries out
      of the height to give them to the race of men. 'Peace' on the
      other hand is the power which hath sojourned in thy material body
      according to the world, which hath baptized the race of men, until
      it should make it stranger unto sin and make it at peace with thy
      spirit, so that they may be at peace with the emanations of the
      Light; that is, 'Grace and truth kissed each other.' As it saith:
      'Truth sprouted forth out of the earth,'--'truth' is thy material
      body which sprouted forth out of me according to the world of men,
      and hath made proclamation concerning the region of Truth. And
      again as it saith: 'Righteousness [looked down] from
      heaven'--'righteousness' is the power which looked out of the
      height, which will give the mysteries of the Light to the race of
      men, so that they will become righteous and good, and inherit the
      Light-kingdom."<br>

      which is in thee and which hath made proclamation concerning the

      kissed each other,' -- 'righteousness' then is the spirit of the
      Light, which did come upon thee and hath brought the mysteries of
      the height, to give them unto the race of men. 'Peace' on the

      he who hath baptized and hath forgiven the race of men,-- and it
      hath made them at peace with the sons of the Light. And moreover
      as thy power hath said through David: 'Truth sprouted forth out of

      sprouted forth out of Mary, thy mother, the dweller on earth.
      'Righteousness,' which 'looked down from heaven,' on the other

      forth out of me, which thou art. Thou hast had mercy on the whole

      which is John, who did come and hath made proclamation concerning
      the way of Truth, which thou art,--who hath made proclamation
      before thee. And again, 'Grace and truth met together,' -- that is

      <i>John further interpreteth the same scripture.</i><br>
      And John answered and said: "This is the word which thou hast said
      unto us aforetime: 'I have come out of the Height and entered into
      Sabaōth, the Good, and embraced the light-power in him.' Now,
      therefore, 'Grace and truth' which 'met together,' -- thou art
      'grace,' thou who art sent out of the regions of the Height
      through thy Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, in
      that he hath sent thee, that thou mayest have mercy on the whole
      world. 'Truth' on the other hand is the power of Sabaōth, the
      Good, which bound itself in thee and which thou hast cast forth to
      the Left, -- thou the First Mystery which looketh without. And the
      little Sabaōth, the Good, took it and cast it Of Sabaōth, Barbēlō,
      Yabraōth and the light-vesture.forth into the matter of Barbēlō,
      and he made proclamation concerning the regions of Truth to all
      the regions of those of the Left. That matter of Barbēlō then it
      is which is body for thee to-day.<br>
      <br>
      "And 'righteousness and peace' which 'kissed each other,' --
      'righteousness' then art thou who didst bring all the mysteries
      through thy Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, and
      hast baptized this power of Sabaōth, the Good; and thou didst go
      to the region of the rulers and didst give unto them the mysteries
      of the Height; they became righteous and good.<br>
      <br>
      "'Peace' on the other hand is the power of Sabaōth, that is thy
      soul, which did enter into the matter of Barbēlō, and all the
      rulers of the six æons of Yabraōth have made peace with the
      mystery of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "And 'truth' which 'sprouted forth out of the earth,' -- it is the
      power of Sabaōth, the Good, which came out of the region of the
      Right, which lieth outside the Treasury of the Light., and which
      hath come into the region of those of the Left; it hath entered
      into the matter of Barbēlō, and hath made proclamation concerning
      the mysteries of the region of Truth.<br>
      <br>
      "'Righteousness' on the other hand which 'looked down from
      heaven,' is thou the First Mystery which looketh down without, as
      thou didst come out of the spaces of the Height with the mysteries
      of the Light-kingdom; and thou didst come down upon the
      light-vesture which thou didst receive from the hand of Barbēlō,
      which [vesture] is Jesus, our Saviour, in that thou didst come
      down upon him as a dove."<br>
      <br>
      It came to pass then, when John had brought forward these words,
      that the First Mystery which looketh without, said unto him: "Well
      said, John, beloved brother."<br>

      <i>Gabriēl and Michaēl are summoned to help Pistis Sophia.</i><br>
      The First Mystery again continued and said: "It came to pass,
      therefore, that the power which had come out of the Height, that
      is I, in that my Father sent me to save Pistis Sophia out of the
      chaos, [that] I, therefore, and also the power which did go from
      me, and the soul which I had received from Sabaōth, the Good, --
      they drew towards one another and become a single light-stream,
      which shone very exceedingly. I called down Gabriēl and Michaēl
      out of the æons, at the command of my Father, the First Mystery
      which looketh within, and I gave unto them the light-stream and
      let them go down into the chaos to help Pistis Sophia and to take
      the light-powers, which the emanations of Self-willed had taken
      from her, from them and give them to Pistis Sophia.<br>
      <br>
      "And straightway, when they had brought down the light-stream into
      the chaos, it shone most exceedingly in the whole of the chaos,
      and spread itself over all their regions. And when the emanations
      of Self-willed had seen the great light of that stream, they were
      terror-stricken one with the other. And that stream drew forth out
      of them all the light-powers which they had taken from Pistis
      Sophia, and the emanations of Self-willed could not dare to lay
      hold of that light-stream in the dark chaos; nor could they lay
      hold of it with the art of Self-willed, who ruleth over the
      emanations.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The light-stream restoreth the light-powers to Sophia.</i><br>
      "And Gabriēl and Michaēl led the light-stream over the body of the
      matter of Pistis Sophia and poured into her all the light-powers
      which they had taken from her. And the body of her matter became
      shining throughout, and all the powers also in her, whose light
      they had taken away, took light and ceased to lack their light,
      for they got their light which had been taken from them, because
      the light was given them through me. And Michaēl and Gabriēl, who
      ministered and had brought the light-stream into the chaos, will
      give them the mysteries of the Light; it is they to whom the
      light-stream was entrusted, which I have given unto them and
      brought into the chaos. And Michaēl and Gabriēl have taken no
      light for themselves from the lights of Sophia, which they had
      taken from the emanations of Self-willed.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then, when the light-stream had ingathered into
      Pistis Sophia all her light-powers, which it had taken from the
      emanations of Self-willed, that she became shining throughout; and
      the light-powers also in Pistis Sophia, which the emanations of
      Self-willed had not taken, became joyful again and filled
      themselves with light. And the lights which were poured into
      Pistis Sophia, quickened the body of her matter, in which no light
      was present, and which was on the point of perishing or perished.
      And they raised up all her powers which were on the point of being
      dissolved. And they took unto themselves a light-power and became
      again as they were before, and they increased again in their sense
      of the Light. And all the light-powers of Sophia knew themselves
      mutually through my light-stream and were saved through the light
      of that stream. The light-stream, having accomplished its purpose,
      departeth from Sophia.And my light-stream, when. it had taken away
      the lights from the emanations of Self-willed, which they had
      taken away from Pistis Sophia, poured them into Pistis Sophia, and
      turned itself about and went up out of the chaos."<br>
      <br>
      When then the First Mystery said this to the disciples, that it
      had befallen Pistis Sophia in the chaos, he answered and said unto
      them: "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"<br>

      <i>Peter interpreteth the narrative from the Odes of Solomon.</i><br>
      Peter came forward and said: "My Lord, concerning the solution of
      the words which thou hast spoken, thus hath thy light-power
      prophesied aforetime through Solomon in his Odes:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. A stream came forth and became a great wide flood.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. It tore away all to itself and turned itself against the
      temple.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Dams and buildings could not hold it, nor could the art of
      them who hold the waters.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. It was led over the whole land and laid hold of all.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. They who were on the dry sand, drank; their thirst was
      quieted and quenched, when the draught from the hand of the
      Highest was given.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. Blessed are the ministers of that draught, to whom the water
      of the Lord is entrusted.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. They have refreshed parched lips; they whose power was taken
      away, have gotten joy of heart and they have laid hold of souls,
      having poured in the breath, so that they should not die.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. They have raised up limbs which were fallen; they have given
      power to their openness and light unto their eyes.<br>
      <br>
      "'9. For they all have known themselves in the Lord and are saved
      through the water of Life eternal.'<br>
      <br>
      "Hearken, therefore, my Lord, that I may set forth the word in
      openness. As thy power hath prophesied through Solomon: 'A stream
      came forth and became a great wide flood,' -- this is: The
      light-stream hath spread itself out in the chaos over all the
      regions of the emanations of Self-willed.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which thy power hath spoken through Solomon:
      'It tore away all to itself and led it over the temple,' -- that
      is: It drew all the light-powers out of the emanations of
      Self-willed, which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and poured
      them anew into Pistis Sophia.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word thy power hath spoken: 'The dams and buildings
      could not hold it,' -- that is: The emanations of Self-willed
      could not hold the light-stream within the walls of the darkness
      of the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which it hath spoken: It was led over the
      whole land and filled all,' -- that is: When Gabriēl and Michaēl
      had led it over the body of Pistis Sophia, they poured into her
      all the lights which the emanations of Self-willed had taken from
      her, and the body of her matter shone.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which it hath spoken: 'They who were in the dry
      sand, drank,' -- that is:<br>
      <br>
      <i>All in Pistis Sophia whose light had before been taken away,
        got light.</i><br>
      "And the word which it hath spoken: 'Their thirst was quieted and
      quenched,' -- that is: Her powers ceased to lack the light,
      because their light, which had been taken from them, was given
      them [again].<br>

      "And again as thy power hath spoken: 'The draught through the

      through the light-stream, which came forth out of thee, the First
      Mystery."<br>
      <br>
      "And as thy power hath spoken: 'Blessed are the ministers of that
      draught,' -- this is the word which thou hast spoken: 'Michaēl and
      Gabriēl, who have ministered, have brought the light-stream into
      the chaos and also led it forth again. They will give them the
      mysteries of the Light of the Height, they to whom the
      light-stream is entrusted.'<br>
      <br>
      "And again as thy power hath spoken: 'They have refreshed parched
      lips, ' -- that is: Gabriēl and Michaēl have not taken for
      themselves from the lights of Pistis Sophia, which they had
      spoiled from the emanations of Self-willed, but they have poured
      them into Pistis Sophia.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which it hath spoken:<br>
      <br>
      They whose power was taken away, have gotten joy of heart, ' --
      that is: All the other powers of Pistis Sophia, which the
      emanations of Self-willed have not taken, are become exceedingly
      merry and have filled themselves with light from their
      light-fellows, for these have poured it into them.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'They have quickened
      souls, having poured in the breath, so that they should not die,'
      -- that is: When they had poured the lights into Pistis Sophia,
      they quickened the body of her matter, from which they had before
      taken its lights, and which was on the point of perishing.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which thy power hath spoken: 'They have raised
      up limbs which were fallen, or that they should not fall,' -- that
      is: When they poured into her her lights, they raised up all her
      powers which were on the point of being dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      "And again as thy light-power hath spoken: They have received
      again their light and have become as they were before '; and again
      the word which it hath spoken: 'They have given light unto their
      eyes,' -- that is: They have received sense in the Light and known
      the light-stream, that it belongeth to the Height.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which it hath spoken: 'They all have known
      themselves in the Lord,' -- that is: All the powers of Pistis
      Sophia have known one another through the light-stream.<br>

      "And again the word which it hath spoken: 'They are saved through
      water of Life eternal,' -- that is: They are saved through the

      "And again the word which it hath spoken: 'The light-stream tore
      all to itself and drew it over the temple,' -- that is: When the
      light-stream had taken all the light-powers of Pistis Sophia and
      had spoiled them from the emanations of Self-willed, it poured

      <br>
      <i>The emanations of Sell-willed cry aloud to him for help.</i><br>
      And the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said:
      "It came to pass then, before I had led forth Pistis Sophia out of
      the chaos, because it was not yet commanded me through my Father,
      the First Mystery which looketh within, -- at that time then,
      after the emanations of Self-willed had perceived that my
      light-stream had taken from them the light-powers which they had
      taken from Pistis Sophia, and had poured them into Pistis Sophia,
      and when they again had seen Pistis Sophia, that she shone as she
      had done from the beginning, that they were enraged against Pistis
      Sophia and cried out again to their Self-willed, that he should
      come and help them, so that they might take away the powers in
      Pistis Sophia anew.<br>
      <br>
      <i>He sendeth forth another more violent power like unto a flying
        arrow. The fashioning of the serpent-, basilisk- and
        dragon-powers.</i><br>
      "And Self-willed sent out of the height, out of the thirteenth
      æon, and sent another great light-power. It came down into the
      chaos as a flying arrow, that he might help his emanations, so
      that they might take away the lights from Pistis Sophia anew. And
      when that light-power had come down, the emanations of Self-willed
      which were in the chaos and oppressed Pistis Sophia, took great
      courage and again pursued Pistis Sophia with great terror and
      great alarm. And some of the emanations of Self-willed oppressed
      her. One of them changed itself into the form of a great serpent;
      another again changed itself also into the form of a seven-headed
      basilisk; another again changed itself into the form of a dragon.
      And moreover the first power of Self-willed, the lion-faced, and
      all his other very numerous emanations, they came together and
      oppressed Pistis Sophia and led her again into the lower regions
      of the chaos and alarmed her again exceedingly.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The demon-power of Adamas dasheth Sophia down.</i><br>
      "It came to pass then that there looked down out of the twelve
      æons, Adamas, the Tyrant, who also was wroth with Pistis Sophia,
      because she desired to go to the Light of lights, which was above
      them all; therefore was he wroth with her. It came to pass then,
      when Adamas, the Tyrant, had looked down out of the twelve æons,
      that he saw the emanations of Self-willed oppressing Pistis
      Sophia, until they should take from her all her lights. It came to
      pass then, when the power of Adamas had come down into the chaos
      unto all the emanations of Self-willed, -- it came to pass then,
      when that demon came down into the chaos, that it dashed down
      Pistis Sophia. And the lion-faced power and the serpent-form and
      the basilisk-form and the dragon-form and all the other very
      numerous emanations of Self-willed surrounded Pistis Sophia all
      together, desiring to take from her anew her powers in her, and
      they oppressed Pistis Sophia exceedingly and threatened her. It
      came to pass then, when they oppressed her and alarmed her
      exceedingly, that she cried again to the Light and sang praises,
      saying:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. O Light, it is thou who hast helped me; let thy light come
      over me.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia again crieth to the Light.</i><br>
      "'2. For thou art my protector, and I come hence unto thee, O
      Light, having faith in thee, O Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. For thou art my saviour from the emanations of Self-willed
      and of Adamas, the Tyrant, and thou shalt save me from all his
      violent threats.'<br>
      <br>
      <i>Gabriēl and Michaēl and the light-stream again go to her aid.</i><br>
      "And when Pistis Sophia had said this, then at the commandment of
      my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, I sent again
      Gabriēl and Michaēl and the great light-stream, that they should
      help Pistis Sophia. And I gave commandment unto Gabriēl and
      Michaēl to bear Pistis Sophia in their hands, so that her feet
      should not touch the darkness below; and I gave them commandment
      moreover to guide her in the regions of the chaos, out of which
      she was to be led.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then, when the angels had come down into the
      chaos, they and the light-stream, and moreover [when] all the
      emanations of Self-willed and the emanations of Adamas had seen
      the light-stream, how it shone very exceedingly and there was no
      measure for the light about it, that they became terror-stricken
      and quitted Pistis Sophia. And the great light-stream surrounded
      Pistis Sophia on all sides of her, on her left and on her right
      and on all her sides, and it became a light-wreath round her head.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then, when the light-stream had surrounded Pistis
      Sophia, that she took great courage, and it ceased not to surround
      her on all her sides; and she was no longer in fear of the
      emanations of Self-willed which are in the chaos, nor was she any
      more in fear of the other new power of Self-willed which he had
      cast down into the chaos as a flying arrow, nor did she any more
      tremble at the demon power of Adamas which had come out of the
      æons.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The transfiguration of Sophia.</i><br>
      "And moreover by commandment of myself, the First Mystery which
      looketh without, the light-stream which surrounded Pistis Sophia
      on all her sides, shone most exceedingly, and Pistis Sophia abode
      in the midst of the light, a great light being on her left and on
      her right, and on all her sides, forming a wreath round her head.
      And all the emanations of Self-willed [could] not change their
      face again, nor could they bear the shock of the great light of
      the stream, which was a wreath round her head. And all the
      emanations of Self-willed,--many of them fell at her right,
      because she shone most exceedingly, and many others fell at her
      left, and were not able at all to draw nigh unto Pistis Sophia
      because of the great light; but they fell all one on another, or
      they all came near one another, and they could not inflict any ill
      on Pistis Sophia, because she had trusted in the Light.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus, the First Mystery looking without, causeth Sophia to
        triumph.</i><br>
      "And at the commandment of my Father, the First Mystery which
      looketh within, I myself went down into the chaos, shining most
      exceedingly, and approached the lion-faced power, which shone
      exceedingly, and took its whole light in it and held fast all the
      emanations of Self-willed, so that from now on they went not into
      their region, that is the thirteenth æon. And I took away the
      power of all the emanations of Self-willed, and they all fell down
      in the chaos powerless. And I led forth Pistis Sophia, she being
      on the right of Gabriēl and Michaēl. And the great light-stream
      entered again into her. And Pistis Sophia beheld with her eyes her
      foes, that I had taken their light-power from them. And I led
      Pistis Sophia forth from the chaos, she treading under foot the
      serpent-faced emanation of Self-willed, and moreover treading
      under foot the seven-faced-basilisk emanation, and treading under
      foot the lion- and dragon-faced power. I made Pistis Sophia
      continue to stand upon the seven-headed-basilisk emanation of
      Self-willed; and it was more mighty than them all in its evil
      doings. And I, the First Mystery, stood by it and took all the
      powers in it, and made to perish its whole matter, so that no seed
      should arise from it from now on."|141.<br>

      "'9. For thou, O Lord, art my hope. Thou hast established the Most
      High for thyself as refuge.<br>
      <br>
      "'10. Harm will not come nigh unto thee; scourge will not come
      nigh thy dwelling.<br>

      "'11. For he will give commandment to his angels on thy behalf
      that they guard thee on all thy ways,<br>
      <br>
      "'12. And bear thee on their hands, that thou mayest never strike
      with thy foot against a stone.<br>
      <br>

      lion and dragon.<br>
      <br>
      "'14. Because he hath trusted in me, I will save him; I will
      overshadow him, because he hath known my name.<br>
      <br>
      "'15. He will cry unto me and I shall hearken unto him; I am at

      <br>
      "'16. And increase him with many days and show him my salvation.'<br>
      <br>
      "This, my Lord, is the solution of the words which thou hast said.
      Hearken therefore, that I may say it in openness.<br>
      <br>
      "The word then which thy power hath spoken through David: 'Whoso
      then dwelleth under the help of the Most High, will abide under
      the shadow of the God of heaven, '-- that is: When Sophia had
      trusted in the Light, she abode under the light of the
      light-stream, which through thee came out of the Height.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy power hath spoken through David: 'I will
      say unto the Lord: Thou art my succour and my refuge, my God, in
      whom I trust,' -- it is the word with which Pistis Sophia hath
      sung praises:&nbsp; 'Thou art my succour, and I come unto thee.'<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which thy power hath spoken: 'My God, in whom
      I trust, thou wilt save me out of the snare of the hunters and
      from mighty word,' -- it is what Pistis Sophia hath said: 'O
      Light, I have faith in thee, for thou wilt save me from the
      emanations of Self-willed and from those of Adamas, the Tyrant,
      and thou wilt save me also from all their mighty threats.'<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which thy power hath spoken through David: 'He
      will shade thee with his breast, and thou wilt have trust beneath
      his wings, '-- that is: Pistis Sophia hath been in the light of
      the light-stream, which hath come from thee, and hath continued in
      firm trust in the light, that on her left and that on her right,
      which are the wings of the light-stream.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy light-power hath prophesied through David:
      'Truth will surround thee as a shield,' -- it is the light of the
      light-stream which hath surrounded Pistis Sophia on all her sides
      as a shield.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'He will not be afraid
      of terror by night,' -- that is: Pistis Sophia hath not been
      afraid of the terrors and alarms into which she had been planted
      in the chaos, which is the 'night.'<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy power hath spoken: He will not be afraid
      of an arrow which flieth by day,' -- that is: Pistis Sophia hath
      not been afraid of the power which Self-willed hath sent last of
      all out of the height, and which hath come into the chaos as it
      were a flying arrow. Thy light-power therefore hath said: 'Thou
      wilt not be afraid of an arrow which flieth by day,' for that
      power hath come out of the thirteenth æon, it being that which is
      lord over the twelve æons, and which giveth light unto all the
      æons; wherefor hath he [David] said 'day.'<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which thy power hath spoken: 'He will not be
      afraid of a thing which slinketh in the darkness,'-- that is:
      Sophia hath not been afraid of the lion-faced emanation, which
      caused fear for Pistis Sophia in the chaos, which is the
      'darkness.'<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy power hath spoken: 'He will not be afraid
      of a mischance and of a demon at mid-day,' -- that is: Pistis
      Sophia hath not been afraid of the demon emanation of Tyrant
      Adamas, which hath cast Pistis Sophia to the ground in a great
      mischance, and which hath come forth out of Adamas out of the
      twelfth æon; wherefor then hath thy power said: 'He will not be
      afraid of the demon mischance at mid-day,' -- 'mid-day,' because
      it hath come out of the twelve æons, which is 'mid-day'; and again
      ['night,' because] it hath come out of the chaos, which is the
      'night,' and because it hath come out of the twelfth æon which is
      in the midst between both; therefore hath thy light-power said
      'mid-day,' because the twelve æons lie in the midst between the
      thirteenth æon and the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "And again the word which thy light-power hath spoken through
      David: 'A thousand will fall on his left, and ten thousand at his
      right hand, but they shall not come nigh him,' -- that is: When
      the emanations of Self-willed, which are exceedingly numerous,
      could not bear the great light of the light-stream, many of them
      fell on the left hand of Pistis Sophia and many at her right, and
      they could not come nigh her, to do her [harm].<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David:
      'Nay rather with thine eyes wilt thou behold, and wilt see the
      requital of the sinners, for thou, O Lord, art my hope,' -- that
      is the word: Pistis Sophia hath with her eyes beheld her foes,
      that is the emanations of Self-willed, who all have fallen one on
      another; not only hath she with her eyes beheld this, but thou
      also thyself, my Lord, the First Mystery, hast taken the
      light-power which is in the lion-faced power, and hast moreover
      taken the power of all the emanations of Self-willed and moreover
      thou hast imprisoned them in that chaos, [so that] from henceforth
      they have not gone forth to their own region. Therefore then hath
      Pistis Sophia with her eyes beheld her foes, that is the
      emanations of Self-willed, in all which David hath prophesied
      concerning Pistis Sophia, saying: 'Nay rather with thine eyes wilt
      thou behold, and thou wilt see the requital of the sinners.' Not
      only hath she with her eyes beheld, how they fall one on another
      in the chaos, but she hath also seen the requital with which it
      was requited them. Just as the emanations of Self-willed have
      thought to take away the light of Sophia from her, so hast thou
      requited them and repaid them in full, and hast taken the
      light-power in them instead of the lights of Sophia, who hath had
      faith in the Light of the Height.<br>
      <br>
      "And as thy light-power hath spoken through David: 'Thou hast
      established the Most High for thyself as refuge; harm will not
      come nigh unto thee, scourge will not come nigh thy dwelling,' --
      that is: When Pistis Sophia had had faith in the Light and was
      afflicted, she sang praises unto it, and the emanations of
      Self-willed could not inflict on her any harm, nor could they
      [injure] her, nor could they at all come nigh her.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David: 'He
      will give commandment to his angels on thy behalf, that they guard
      thee on all thy ways and bear thee on their hands, that thou
      mayest never strike with thy foot against a stone,' -- it is again
      thy word: Thou hast given commandment to Gabriēl and Michaēl, that
      they guide Pistis Sophia in all the regions of the chaos, until
      they lead her forth and that they uplift her on their hands, so
      that her feet do not touch the darkness beneath, and [that] on the
      other hand they of the lower darkness do not seize hold of her.<br>
      <br>
      "And the word which thy light-power hath spoken through David:
      'Thou wilt tread on serpent and basilisk and tread on lion and
      dragon; because he hath trusted in me, I will save him and I will
      overshadow him, because he hath known my name,' -- that is the
      word: When Pistis Sophia was on the point of coming forth out of
      the chaos, she trod on the emanations of Self-willed, and she trod
      on the serpent-faced ones and on the basilisk-faced ones, which
      have seven heads; and she trod on the lion-faced power and on the
      dragon-faced one. Because she had had faith in the Light, is she
      saved from all of them.<br>
      <br>
      "This, my Lord, is the solution of the words which thou hast
      spoken."<br>

      It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had heard these
      words, that he said: "Well said, James, beloved one."<br>
      <br>
      And the First Mystery continued again in the discourse and said
      unto his disciples: "It came to pass, when I had led Pistis Sophia
      out of the chaos, that she cried out again and said:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia singeth a song of praise.</i><br>
      "'1. I am saved out of the chaos and loosed from the bonds of the
      darkness. I am come unto thee, O Light.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. For thou wert light on all sides of me, saving me and helping
      me.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. And the emanations of Self-willed, which fought against me,
      thou hast hindered through thy light, and they could not come nigh
      me; for thy light was with me and saved me through thy
      light-stream.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. Because in sooth the emanations of Self-willed constrained
      me, they took from me my power and cast me out into the chaos with
      no light in me. So I became as heavy-weighing matter in comparison
      with them.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. And thereafter came a light-stream unto me through thee which
      saved me; it shone on my left and on my right and surrounded me on
      all sides of me, so that no part of me was without light.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. And thou hast covered me with the light of thy stream and
      purged from me all my evil matters; and I shall be relieved of all
      my matters because of thy light.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. And it is thy light-stream which hath raised me up and taken
      from me the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. And I have become sure-trusting in thy light and purified
      light in thy stream.<br>
      <br>
      "'9. And the emanations of Self-willed which constrained me, have
      withdrawn themselves from me; and I shone in thy great power, for
      thou savest for ever.'<br>
      <br>
      "This is the repentance which Pistis Sophia hath uttered, when she
      came forth out of the chaos and was freed from the bonds of the
      chaos. Now, therefore, who hath ears to hear, let him hear."<br>

      It came to pass then, when the First Mystery had finished saying
      these words unto his disciples, that Thomas came forward, and
      said: "My Lord, my light-dweller hath ears and my mind hath
      understood the words which thou hast said. Now, therefore, give
      commandment unto me to set forth clearly the solution of the
      words."<br>
      <br>
      And the First Mystery answered and said unto Thomas: "I give thee

      Sophia sang unto me."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Thomas interpreteth the song of Sophia from the Odes of

      Thomas answered and said: "My Lord, concerning the song which
      Pistis Sophia hath uttered, because she was saved out of the
      chaos, thy light-power prophesied aforetime thereon through
      Solomon, the son of David, in his Odes:<br>
      <br>
      "'1. I am saved from the bonds and am fled unto thee, O Lord.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. For thou hast been on my right hand, saving me and helping
      me.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Thou hast hindered my adversaries and they have not been
      revealed, because thy face was with me, saving me in thy grace.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. I was despised in the sight of many and cast out; I have
      become as lead in their sight.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. Through thee I have gotten a power which helped me; for thou
      hast set lamps on my right and on my left, so that no side of me
      may be without light.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. Thou hast overshadowed me with the shadow of thy grace, and I
      was relieved of the coats of skin.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. It is thy right hand which hath raised me up, and thon hast
      taken the sickness from me.<br>
      <br>
      "'8. I have become powerful in thy truth and purified in thy
      righteousness.<br>

      "'9. My adversaries have withdrawn themselves from me, and I am
      justified by thy goodness, for thy rest endureth unto all

      hast destroyed it, so that its seed may not raise itself up from
      now on.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. And thou Wert with me, giving me power in all this, and thy
      light surrounded me in all regions, and through thee hast thou
      made all the emanations of Self-willed powerless.<br>
      <br>

      made straight my way to lead me out of the chaos.<br>

      taken from them all my powers, from which the light had been
      taken.<br>

      Light of the Height.<br>

      "'9. And thou hast made straight the way for them [sc. my limbs],
      and the light of thy face hath become for me life indestructible.<br>

      "'10. Thou hast led me forth above the chaos, the region of chaos
      and extermination, in order that all the matters in it which are
      in that region, might be unloosed and all my powers be renewed in
      thy light, and thy light be in them all.<br>

      Sophia and led her up to a region which is below the thirteenth
      æon, and gave unto her a new mystery of the Light which is not
      that of her æon, the region of the invisibles. And moreover I gave
      her a song of the Light, so that from now on the rulers of the

      region until I should come after her and bring her to her higher
      region.<br>

      "It came to pass then, when I had removed her to that region, that
      she again uttered this song thus:<br>

      afraid and have faith in the Light.'<br>

      This song then Pistis Sophia uttered, rejoicing that she had been
      led up out of the chaos and brought to regions which are below the
      thirteenth æon. Now, therefore, let him whom his mind stirreth, so
      that he understandeth the solution of the thought of the song

      which is below the thirteenth æon, and was about to go unto the
      Light and depart from her, that she said unto me:<br>

      to this region, he and all his rulers who hate me, and Self-willed
      also will bestow power unto his lion-faced emanation, so that they
      all will come and constrain me all together and take my whole

      without light. Now, therefore, O Light and my Light, take from

      take their light from them; but I will seal the regions of
      Self-willed and of all his rulers who hate thee because thou hast
      had faith in the Light. And I will also seal the regions of Adamas

      with thee about their time, when this which I have said unto thee,
      will come to pass. It will come to pass when [the] three times are
      completed.'<br>
      <br>
      "Pistis Sophia answered and said unto me: 'O Light, by what shall
      I know when the three times will take place, so that I may be glad
      and rejoice that the time is near for thee to bring me to my
      region, and moreover rejoice therein that the time is come when
      thou wilt take the light-power from all them which hate me,

      <i>How Sophia will know that the time of her final deliverance

      æon, and that is the left [one], -- when that gate is opened, then
      are the three times completed.'<br>

      <br>
      <i>What will come to pass at that time.</i><br>
      "And I answered and said unto her: 'When that gate is opened, they
      who are in all the æons will know because of the Great Light which
      will obtain in all their regions. But see, I have now settled that
      they shall venture no ill against thee, until the three times are
      completed. And thou wilt have the power of going down into their
      twelve æons, when it pleaseth thee, and also of returning and
      going into thy region, which is below the thirteenth æon, and in
      which thou now art. But thou wilt not have the power of passing
      through the gate of the Height which is in the thirteenth æon, so
      as to enter into thy region whence thou didst come down. Moreover,
      if then the three times are completed, Self-willed and all his
      rulers will again constrain thee, to take thy light from thee,
      being enraged against thee and thinking that thou hast imprisoned
      his power in the chaos, and thinking that thou hast taken its
      light from it. He will then be embittered against thee, to take
      from thee thy light, in order that he may send it down into the
      chaos and it may get down to that emanation of his, so that it may
      be able to come up out of the chaos and go to his region. Adamas
      will attempt this. But I will take all thy powers from him and
      give them unto thee, and I will come to take them. Now, therefore,
      if they constrain thee at that time, then sing praises to the
      Light, and I will not delay to help thee. And I will quickly come
      unto thee to the regions which are below thee. And I will come
      down to their regions to take their light from them. And I will
      come to this region whither I have removed thee, and which is
      below the thirteenth æon, until I bring thee to thy region whence

      imprisoned his power in the chaos, and thinking that it was she
      who had taken its light from it. And he was exceedingly
      embittered; he piled wrath on wrath and emanated out of himself a
      dark emanation and another, chaotic and evil, the violent [one],
      so as through them to harass Pistis Sophia. And he made a dark
      region in his region, so as to constrain Sophia therein. And he
      took many of his rulers; they pursued after Sophia, in order that
      the two dark emanations which Adamas had emanated, might lead her
      into the dark chaos which he had made, and constrain her in that
      region and harass her, until they should take her whole light from
      her, and Adamas should take the light from Pistis Sophia and give
      it to the two dark violent emanations, and they should carry it to
      the great chaos which is below and dark, and cast it into his dark
      power which is chaotic, if perchance it might be able to come to
      his region, because it had become exceedingly dark, for I had
      taken its light-power from it.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then, when they pursued after Pistis Sophia, that
      she cried out again and sang praises to the Light, since I had
      said unto her: 'If thou shalt be constrained and singest praises
      unto me, I will come quickly and help thee.' It came to pass then,
      when she was constrained, -- and I sat with you in this region,
      that is on the Mount of Olives, -- that she sang praises to the
      Light, saying:<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>Sophia again singeth a song to the Light.</i><br>
      "'1. O Light of lights, I have had faith in thee. Save me from all
      these rulers who pursue after me, and help me,<br>
      <br>
      "'2. That in sooth they may never take from me my light, as the
      lion-faced power [did]. For thy light is not with me and thy
      light-stream to save me. Nay, Adamas is the more enraged against
      me, saying unto me: Thou hast imprisoned my power in the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Now, therefore, O Light of lights, if I have done this and
      have imprisoned it, if I have done any injustice at all to that
      power,<br>
      <br>
      "'4. Or if I have constrained it, as it hath constrained me, then
      let all these rulers who pursue after me, take my light from me
      and leave me empty;<br>
      <br>
      "'5. And let foe Adamas pursue after my power and seize upon it
      and take my light from me and cast it into his dark power which is
      in the chaos, and keep my power in the chaos.<br>
      <br>
      "'6. Now, therefore, O Light, lay hold on me in thy wrath and lift
      up thy power above my foes who have lifted themselves up against
      me to the very end.<br>
      <br>
      "'7. Quicken me quickly, as thou hast said unto me: I will help
      thee.'<br>

      And the First Mystery continued again and said unto the disciples:
      "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had finished uttering
      the words of this song, that she turned herself back to see
      whether Adamas and his rulers had turned back to go to their æon.
      And she saw them, how they pursued after her. Then she turned unto
      them and said unto them:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia addresseth Adamas and his rulers.</i><br>
      "'1. Why pursue ye after me and say: I should not have help, that
      it [sc. the Light] should save me from you?<br>
      <br>
      "'2. Now, therefore, my vindicator is the Light and a strong
      [one]; but it is long-suffering until the time of which it hath
      said unto me: I will come and help thee. And it will not bring its
      wrath upon you always. But this is the time of which he hath
      spoken unto me.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Now, therefore, if ye turn not back and cease not to pursue
      after me, then will the Light make ready its power, and it will
      make itself ready in all its powers.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. And in its power hath it made itself ready, so that it may
      take your lights which are in you, and ye may become dark; and its
      power hath brought it to pass, so that it may take your power from
      you and ye go to ground.'<br>
      <br>
      "And when Pistis Sophia had said this, she looked at the region of
      Adamas and saw the dark and chaotic region<big> </big>which he
      had made, and saw also the two dark exceedingly violent emanations
      which Adamas had emanated, in order that they might seize Pistis
      Sophia and cast her down into the chaos which he had made, and
      constrain and harass her in that region, until they should take
      her light from her. It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia had
      seen those two dark emanations and the dark region which Adamas
      had made, that she feared and cried unto the Light, saying:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia again singeth to the Light.</i><br>
      "'1. O Light, lo! Adamas, the doer of violence, is wrathful; he
      hath made a dark emanation,<br>
      <br>
      "'2. And he hath also emanated another chaos and hath made another
      dark and chaotic [one] and made it ready.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. Now, therefore, O Light, the chaos which he hath made, in
      order to cast me down therein and take from me my light-power,
      take then from him his own.<br>
      <br>

      It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished telling his
      disciples all the adventures which had befallen Pistis Sophia when
      she was in the chaos, and the way she had sung praises to the
      Light, that it should save her and lead her out of the chaos, and
      lead her into the twelve æons, and also the way it had saved her
      out of all her afflictions with which the rulers of the chaos had
      constrained her, because she longed to go to the Light, that Jesus
      continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It
      came to pass then after all this, that I took Pistis Sophia and
      led her into the thirteenth æon, shining most exceedingly, there
      being no measure for the light which was about me. I entered into
      the region of the four-and-twenty invisibles, shining most
      exceedingly. And they fell into great commotion; they looked and
      saw Sophia, who was with me. Her they knew, but me they knew not,
      who I was, but held me for some sort of emanation of the
      Light-land.<br>
      <br>
      "It came to pass then, when Pistis Sophia saw her fellows, the
      invisibles, that she rejoiced in great joy and exulted exceedingly
      and desired to proclaim the wonders which I had wrought on her
      below in the earth of mankind, until I saved her. She came into
      the midst of the invisibles, and in their midst sang praises unto
      me, saying:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Sophia singeth the praises of the Light to her
        fellow-invisibles.</i><br>
      "'1. I will give thanks unto thee, O Light, for thou art a
      saviour; thou art a deliverer for all time.<br>
      <br>
      "'2. I will utter this song to the Light, for it hath saved me and
      saved me out of the hand of the rulers, my foes.<br>
      <br>
      "'3. And thou hast preserved me in all the regions, thou hast
      saved me out of the height and the depth of the chaos and out of
      the æons of the rulers of the sphere.<br>
      <br>
      "'4. And when I was come out of the Height, I wandered round in
      regions in which is no light, and I could not return to the
      thirteenth æon, my dwelling-place.<br>
      <br>
      "'5. For there was no light in me nor power. My power was utterly
      weakened (?).<br>

      unto the Light, and it hearkened unto me, when I was constrained.<br>

      I failed of my light, thou didst fill me with purified light.<br>

      with the mighty fetters of the chaos, and no light was in me.<br>

      shall find, and to every one who knocketh it shall be opened.'
      Now, therefore, my Lord, who is it whom I shall seek, or who is it
      at whom we shall knock? Or who rather is able to give us the
      decision upon the words concerning which we shall question thee?
      Or who rather knoweth the power of the words concerning which we
      shall question? Because thou in the mind hast given us mind of the
      Light and hast given us sense and an exceedingly exalted thought;
      for which cause, therefore, no one existeth in the world of men
      nor any one in the height of the æons, who can give the decision
      on the words concerning which we question, save thee alone, who
      knoweth [sic] the universe, who is perfected in the universe;
      because we do not question in the manner in which the men of the
      world question, but because we question in the gnosis of the
      Height which thou hast given unto us, and we question moreover in
      the type of the excellent questioning which thou hast taught us,
      that we may question therein. Now, therefore, my Lord, be not
      wroth with me, but reveal unto me the matter concerning which I
      shall question thee."<br>

      <i>Of the glory of the four-and-twenty invisibles.</i><br>
      And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "What is there in this
      world which is like unto them, or rather what region is there in
      this world which is comparable to them? Now, therefore, to what am
      I to liken them, or rather what am I to say concerning them? For
      nothing existeth in this world to which I shall be able to liken
      them, and no form existeth in it which is able to be like them.
      Now, therefore, nothing existeth in this world which is of the
      quality of the heaven. [But] amēn, I say unto you: Every one of
      the invisibles is nine times greater than the heaven and the
      sphere above it and the twelve æons all together, as I have
      already said unto you at another time. And no light existeth in
      this world which is more excellent than the light of the sun.
      Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: The four-and-twenty invisibles shine
      ten-thousand times more than the light of the sun which is in this
      world, as I have already|184. said unto you at another time. For
      the light of the sun in its shape in truth is not in this world,
      for its light pierceth through many veils and regions. But the
      light of the sun in its shape in truth, which is in the region of
      the Virgin of Light, shineth ten-thousand times more than the
      four-and-twenty invisibles and the great invisible forefather and
      also the great triple-powered god, as I have already said unto you
      at another time.<br>
      <br>
      "Now, therefore, Mary, there is no form in this world, nor any
      light, nor any shape, which is comparable to the four-and-twenty
      invisibles, so that I may liken it to them. But yet a little while
      and I will lead thee and thy brethren and fellow-disciples into
      all the regions of the Height and will lead you into the three
      spaces of the First Mystery, save only the regions of the space of
      the Ineffable, and ye shall see all their shapes in truth without
      similitude.<br>
      <br>
      "And if I lead you into the height and ye shall see the glory of
      them of the height, then will ye be in very great amazement.<br>

      "And if I lead you into the region of the rulers of the Fate, then
      will ye see the glory in which they are, and because of their
      overtowering great glory ye will deem this world before you as
      darkness of darknesses, and ye will look at the whole world of
      men, how it will have the condition of a speck of dust for you
      because of the great distance it is far distant from it, and
      because of the great condition it is considerably greater than it.<br>
      <br>

      "And if I lead you into the twelve æons, then will ye see the
      glory in which they are; and because of the great glory the region
      of the rulers of the Fate will count for you as the darkness of
      darknesses, and it will have for you the condition of a speck of
      dust because of the great distance it is far distant from it and
      because of the great condition it is considerably greater than
      them, as I have already said unto you at another time.<br>

      "And if I lead you moreover into the thirteenth æon, then will ye
      see the glory in which they are; the twelve æons will count for
      you as the darkness of darknesses, and ye shall look at the twelve
      æons, how it [sc. their region] will have for you the likeness of
      a speck of dust because of the great distance it is far distant
      from it, and because of the great condition it is considerably
      greater than the former.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the glory of the Midst.</i><br>
      "And if I lead you into the region of those of the Midst, then
      will ye see the glory in which they are; the thirteen æons will
      count for you as the darkness of darknesses. And again ye will
      look at the twelve æons&nbsp; and upon the whole Fate and the
      whole ordering and all the spheres and all the others in which
      they are; they will have for you the condition of a speck of dust
      because of the great distance it [sc. their region] is distant

      greater than the former.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the glory of the Right.</i><br>
      "And if I lead you into the region of those of the Right, then
      will ye see the glory in which they are; the region of those of
      the Midst will count for you as the night which is in the world of
      men. And if ye look at the Midst, it will have for you the
      condition of a speck of dust because of the great distance the
      region of those of the Right is considerably distant from it.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the glory of the Treasury.</i><br>
      "And if I lead you into the Light-land, that is into the Treasury
      of the Light, and ye see the glory in which they are, then will
      the region of those of the Right count for you as the light at
      mid-day in the world of men, when the sun is not out; and if ye
      look at the region of those of the Right, it will have for you the
      condition of a speck of dust because of the great distance the
      Treasury of the Light is distant from it.<br>

      "And if I lead you into the region of those who have received the
      inheritances and have received the mysteries of the Light, and ye
      see the glory of the Light in which they are, then the Light-land
      will count for you as the light of the sun which is in the world
      of men. And if ye look upon the Light-land, then will it count for
      you as a speck of dust because of the great distance the
      Light-land is distant from it, and because of the greatness [by
      which] it is considerably greater than the former."<br>

      It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words
      unto his disciples, that Mary Magdalene started forward and said:

      of the interiors to the exterior of the exteriors, from that

      the mysteries of the Light, be superior to the emanations of the
      Treasury in thy kingdom? For I have heard thee say: If I lead you
      into the region of those who have received the mysteries of the
      Light, then will the region of the [emanations of the] Light-land
      count for you as a speck of dust because of the great distance in

      Mary, that I may speak with thee about the consummation of the æon
      and the ascension of the universe. It will not yet take place; but

      mysteries. And those of the region of the Midst and of the Right
      and those of the whole region of the Treasury, every one abideth
      in the region of the order into which he hath been set from the

      only in this world, but they also have no likeness with those of
      the Height of Righteousness from their region upwards. On this
      account, therefore, there existeth in fact no manner of describing
      them in this world because of the great glory of those of the

      <br>
      It came to pass then, when Jesus had finished speaking these words
      unto his disciples, that Mary Magdalene came forward and said unto
      Jesus: "My Lord, be not wroth with me if I question thee, because
      I trouble repeatedly. Now, therefore, my Lord, be not wroth with
      me if I question thee concerning all with precision and certainty.
      For my brethren will herald it among the race of men, so that they
      may hear and repent and be saved from the violent judgments of the
      evil rulers and go to the Height and inherit the Light-kingdom;
      because, my Lord, we are compassionate not only towards ourselves,
      but compassionate towards the whole race of men, so that they may
      be saved from all the violent judgments. Now, therefore, my Lord,
      on this account we question concerning all with certainty; for my
      brethren herald it to the whole race of men, in order that they
      may escape the violent rulers of the darkness and be saved out of
      the hands of the violent receivers of the outer-most darkness."<br>

      It came to pass, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words, that
      the Saviour answered in great compassion towards her and said unto
      her: "Question concerning what thou desirest to question, and I
      will reveal it unto thee with precision and certainty and without
      similitude."<br>

      It came to pass then, when Mary had heard the Saviour say these
      words, that she rejoiced with great joy and exulted exceedingly
      and said unto Jesus: "My Lord, by how much greatness then is the
      second Helper greater than the first Helper? By how much distance
      is he distant from him, or rather how many times more does he
      shine than the latter?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the second Helper.</i><br>
      Jesus answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the disciples:
      "Amēn, amēn, I say unto you: The second Helper is distant from the
      first Helper in great immeasurable distance in regard to the
      height above and the depth below and the length and the breadth.
      For he is exceedingly distant from him in great immeasurable
      distance through the angels and all the archangels and through the
      gods and all the invisibles. And he is very considerably greater
      than the latter in an incalculable measure through the angels and
      archangels and through the gods and all the invisibles. And he
      shineth more than the latter in an utterly immeasurable measure,
      there being no measure for the light in which he is, and no
      measure for him through angels and archangels and through the gods
      and all the invisibles, as I have already said unto you at another
      time.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the third, fourth, and fifth Helpers.</i><br>
      "In like manner also the third Helper and fourth and fifth
      Helper,-- one is greater than the other ... and shineth more than
      the latter and is distant from him in a great immeasurable
      distance through the angels and archangels and the gods and all
      the invisibles, as I have already said unto you at another time.

      the last Helper?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of those who receive the mystery in the last Helper.</i><br>
      And Jesus answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the
      disciples: "They who have received the mystery of the Light, if
      they come out of the body of the matter of the rulers, then will
      every one be in his order according to the mystery which he hath
      received. Those who have received the higher mysteries, will abide
      in the higher order; those who have received the lower mysteries
      will be in the lower orders. In a word, up to what region every
      one hath received mysteries, there will he abide in his order in
      the Inheritance of the Light. For which cause I have said unto you
      aforetime: 'Where your heart is, there will your treasure be,' --

      with precision and certainty; for thou, my Lord, hast promised me
      in a promise to make revelation unto us of all concerning which I
      shall question thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, hide nothing from us
      at all in the matter on which we shall question thee."<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus answered in great compassion and said unto John: "To
      thee also, blessed John, and beloved, I give commandment to speak
      the word which pleaseth thee, and I will reveal it unto thee face
      to face without similitude, and I will say unto thee all on which

      And Jesus continued again and said unto his disciples: "Still
      further, O my disciples, be sober and let every one of you bring
      hither the power of sensing the Light before him, that ye may
      sense with sureness. For from now on I will discourse with you

      Then Mary Magdalene came forward, threw herself at the feet of
      Jesus, kissed them and wept aloud and said: "Have mercy upon me,
      my Lord, for my brethren have heard and let go of the words which
      thou saidest unto them. Now, therefore, my Lord, concerning the
      gnosis of all the things which thou hast said, that they are in
      the mystery of the Ineffable; but I have heard thee say unto me:
      'From now on I will begin to discourse with you concerning the
      total gnosis of the mystery of the Ineffable, ' -- this word,
      therefore, which thou saidest, thou hast not gone forward to
      complete the word. For this cause, therefore, my brethren have
      heard and have let go and ceased to sense in what manner thou
      discoursest with them. Concerning the word which thou saidest unto
      them, now, therefore, my Lord, if the gnosis of all this is in
      that mystery, where is the man who is in the world, who hath the
      ability to understand that mystery with all its gnoses and the
      type of all these words which thou hast spoken concerning it?"<br>

      <br>
      It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words
      and knew that the disciples had heard and had begun to let go,
      that he encouraged them and said unto them: "Grieve no more, my
      disciples, concerning the mystery of, the Ineffable, thinking that
      ye will not understand it. Amēn, I say unto you: That mystery is
      yours, and every one's who will give ear unto you, so that they
      renounce this whole world and the whole matter therein and
      renounce all the evil thoughts therein and renounce all the cares
      of this æon.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus explaineth that that mystery is really simpler than all
        mysteries.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, I say unto you: For every one who will renounce
      the whole world and all therein and will submit himself to the
      godhead, that mystery is far easier than all the mysteries of the
      Light-kingdom and it is sooner to understand than them all and it
      is easier [?] than them all. He who reacheth unto the gnosis of
      that mystery, renounceth this whole world and all the cares
      therein.<br>

      "For this cause have I said to you aforetime: 'All ye who are
      heavy under your burden, come hither unto me, and I will quicken
      you. For my burden is easy and my yoke is soft.' Now, therefore,
      he who will receive that mystery, renounceth the whole world and
      the cares of all the matter therein. For this cause, therefore, my
      disciples, grieve not, thinking that ye will not understand that
      mystery. Amēn, I say unto you: That mystery is far sooner to
      understand than all mysteries. And amēn, I say unto you: That

      and the whole matter therein.<br>
      <br>
      "Now, therefore, hearken, my disciples and my companions and my
      brethren, that I may urge you on to the gnosis of the mystery of

      have in Booth gotten as far as to tell you the whole gnosis at the

      When then the Saviour had said this, Mary Magdalene started
      forward and said: "My Lord, bear with me and be not wroth with me,
      if I question on all things with precision and certainty. Now,
      therefore, my Lord, is then another the word of the mystery of the
      Ineffable and another the word of the whole gnosis?"<br>
      <br>
      The Saviour answered and said: "Yea, another is the mystery of the
      Ineffable and another the word of the whole gnosis."<br>
      <br>
      And Mary answered again and said unto the Saviour: "My Lord, bear
      with me, if I question thee, and be not wroth with me. Now,
      therefore, my Lord, unless we live and know the gnosis of the
      whole word of the Ineffable, shall we not be able to inherit the

      <br>
      <i>Of the distinction between the gnosis of the universe and the
        mysteries of the Light.</i><br>
      And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Surely; for every
      one who shall receive a mystery of the Light-kingdom, will go and
      inherit up to the region up to which he hath received mysteries.
      But he will not know the gnosis of the universe, wherefor all this
      hath arisen, unless he knoweth the one and only word of the
      Ineffable, which is the gnosis of the universe. And again in
      openness: I am the gnosis of the universe. And moreover it is
      impossible to know the one and only word of the gnosis, unless a
      man first receive the mystery of the Ineffable. But all the men
      who shall receive mysteries in the Light, -- every one will go and
      inherit up to the region up to which he hath received mysteries.<br>
      <br>
      "On this account I have said unto you aforetime: 'He who hath
      faith in a prophet, will receive a prophet's reward, and he who
      hath faith in a righteous [man] will receive a righteous [man's]
      reward,'--that is: Every one will go to the region up to which he
      hath received mysteries. He who receiveth a lesser mystery, will
      inherit the lesser mystery, and he who receiveth a higher mystery,
      will inherit the higher regions. And every one will abide in his
      region in the light of my kingdom, and every one will have power
      over the orders which are below him, but he will not have the

      in the region of the Inheritance of the Light of my kingdom, being
      in a great light immeasurable for the gods and all the invisibles,
      and he will be in great joy and great jubilation.<br>

      light of that soul. And that soul will go upwards and pass through
      all the regions of the rulers and all the regions of the

      apologies nor tokens in any single region of the Light nor in any
      single region of the rulers; but it will pass through all the
      regions and cross over them all, so that it goeth and ruleth over
      all the regions of the first saviour.<br>
      <br>
      "In like manner also he who shall receive the second mystery of
      the First Mystery and the third and fourth, until he shall receive
      the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery, if it shall be at the
      time that he cometh out of the body of the matter of the rulers,
      -- then the retributive receivers come and lead the soul of that
      man out of the body of matter. And those souls will become a great
      light-stream in the hands of the retributive receivers; and those
      receivers will be afraid of the light of those souls and will
      become powerless and fall on their faces. And those souls will
      straightway soar upwards and cross over all the regions of the
      rulers and all the regions of the emanations of the Light. They

      Mystery, will rule over all the regions of the second saviour in
      the inheritances of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "In like manner also those who receive the third mystery of the
      First Mystery and the fourth and fifth and sixth up to the
      twelfth, -- every one will rule over all the regions of the
      saviour up to whom he hath received the mystery.<br>

      discourse with you, --&nbsp; and he who, therefore, shall receive
      those twelve mysteries which belong to the First Mystery, if he

      It came to pass, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto
      his disciples, that Mary Magdalene came forward, kissed the feet
      of Jesus and said unto him: "My Lord, bear with me and be not
      wroth with me, if I question thee; but have mercy upon us, my
      Lord, and reveal unto us all things on which we shall question
      thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, how doth the First Mystery possess
      twelve mysteries, [and] the Ineffable possess a one and only
      mystery?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the three mysteries and five mysteries.</i><br>
      Jesus answered and said unto her: "Indeed it possesseth a one and
      only mystery, yet that mystery constituteth three mysteries,
      although it is the one and only mystery; but the type of every one
      of them is different. And moreover it constituteth five mysteries,
      although it is a one and only [one]; but the type of every one is
      different. So that these five mysteries are alike with one another
      in the mystery of the kingdom in the inheritances of the Light;
      but the type of each of them is different. And their kingdom is
      higher and more exalted than the whole kingdom of the twelve
      mysteries together of the First Mystery; but they are not alike in
      the kingdom [with the one and only mystery] of the First Mystery
      in the Light-kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      "In like manner also the three mysteries are not [?] alike in the

      configuration of each of them, is different from one another.<br>

      "The first [mystery of the First Mystery], -- if thou
      accomplishest its mystery altogether and standest and
      accomplishest it finely in all its figures, then dost thou come
      straightway out of thy body, become a great light-stream and pass
      through all the regions of the rulers and all the regions of the
      Light, while all are in fear of that soul, until it cometh to the

      <br>

      "The second mystery of the First Mystery, on the other hand, if
      thou accomplishest it finely in all its figures,-- the man,
      therefore, who shall accomplish its mystery, if he speaketh that
      mystery over the head of any man who goeth forth out of the body,
      and he speaketh it into his two ears, if indeed the man who goeth
      forth out of the body hath received mysteries for the second time
      and is sharing in the word of truth,--amēn, I say unto you: That
      man, if he goeth forth out of the body of matter, then will his
      soul become a great light-stream and pass through all the regions,
      until it cometh to the kingdom of that mystery.<br>
      <br>

      speaketh that mystery over the head of a man who cometh forth out
      of the body and who hath received no mysteries of the Light, and
      shareth not in the words of truth, -- amēn, I say unto you: That
      man, if he cometh forth out of the body, will be judged in no
      region of the rulers, nor can he be chastized in any region at
      all, nor will the fire touch him, because of the great mystery of
      the Ineffable which is with him.<br>
      <br>
      "And they will hasten quickly and hand him over one to another in
      turn and lead him from region to region and from order to order,
      until they bring him before the Virgin of Light, while all the
      regions are in fear of the mystery and the sign of the kingdom of
      the Ineffable which is with him.<br>
      <br>
      "And if they bring him before the Virgin of Light, then the Virgin
      of Light will see the sign of the mystery of the kingdom of the
      Ineffable which is with him; the Virgin of Light marvelleth and
      proveth him, but suffereth them not to bring him to the Light,
      until he accomplisheth the total citizenship of the light of that
      mystery, that is the purities of the renunciation of the world and
      also of the total matter therein.<br>
      <br>
      "The Virgin of Light sealeth him with a higher seal, which is this
      [ ...? ], and letteth him in that month in which he hath come out
      of the body of matter, light down into a body which will be
      righteous and find the godhead in truth and the higher mysteries,
      so that he may inherit them and inherit the Light eternal, which
      is the gift of the second mystery of the First Mystery of the
      Ineffable.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the third mystery.</i><br>
      "The third mystery of that Ineffable on the other hand, -- the man
      indeed who shall accomplish that mystery, not only if he [himself]
      cometh forth out of the body, will he inherit the kingdom of the
      mystery, but if he complete that mystery and accomplish it with
      all its figures, that is if he go through with that mystery and
      accomplish it finely and pronounce the name of that mysteryOf its
      efficacy. over a man who cometh forth out of the body and hath
      known that mystery, -- let the former have delayed or rather not
      have delayed, -- one who is in the dire chastisements of the
      rulers and in their dire judgments and their manifold fires, --
      amēn, I say unto you: The man who hath come forth out of the body,
      -- if the name of this mystery is pronounced on his behalf, they
      will hasten quickly to bring him over and hand him over one to
      another, until they bring him before the Virgin of Light. And the
      Virgin of Light will seal him with a higher. seal, which is this [
      ...?], and in that month will she let him light down into the

      the gift of the third mystery of the Ineffable.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the three and five mysteries.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, every one who shall receive one of the five
      mysteries of the Ineffable, -- if he cometh forth out of the body
      and inheriteth up to the region of that mystery, then is the
      kingdom of those five mysteries higher than the kingdom of the
      twelve mysteries of the First Mystery, and it is higher than all
      the mysteries which are below them. But those five mysteries of
      the Ineffable are alike with one another in their kingdom, yet are
      they not alike with the three mysteries of the Ineffable.<br>
      <br>
      "He on the other hand who receiveth of the three mysteries of the

      the kingdom of that mystery. And those three mysteries are alike
      with one another in the kingdom and they are higher and more

      <br>
      <i>Of the mysteries of the three spaces</i><br>
      "He on the other hand who receiveth the one and only mystery of
      the Ineffable, will inherit the region of the whole kingdom
      according to its whole glory, as I have already told you at
      another time. And every one who shall receive the mystery which is
      in the space of the universe of the Ineffable, and all the other

      Limbs are in it and all its economies, of which I will not tell
      you now, but when I come to the expansion of the universe I will
      tell you all severally,-- to wit, its expansions and its
      description, how it is, and the aggregation [?] of all its Limbs,
      which belong to the economy of the One and Only, the
      unapproachable God in truth, -- up to what region, therefore,
      every one shall receive the mysteries in the space of the
      Ineffable, up to that region will he inherit up to which he hath
      received. And those of the whole region of the space of that
      Ineffable give no answers in that region, nor give they apologies,
      nor give they tokens, for they are without tokens and they have no
      receivers, but they pass through all the regions, until they come
      to the region of the kingdom of the mystery which they have
      received.<br>
      <br>
      "In like manner also those who shall receive mysteries in the

      without tokens in that world, which is the space of the first
      mystery of the First Mystery.<br>
      <br>
      "And those of the third space, which is without, which is the

      space hath its receivers and its explanations and its apologies
      and its tokens, which I will one day tell you when I come to speak

      "Albeit at the dissolution of the universe, that is when the

      which the universe altogether hath risen, is completed, I will
      pass a thousand years according to the years of the Light, being

      <i>Andrew questioneth Jesus.</i><br>
      And Andrew answered and said: "My Lord, I am astonished and marvel
      exceedingly, how the men who are in the world and in the body of
      this matter, if they come forth out of this world, will pass
      through these firmaments and all these rulers and all lords and
      all gods and all these great invisibles and all those of the
      region of the Midst and those of the whole region of the Right and
      all the great [ones] of the emanations of the Light, and enter
      into them all and inherit the Light-kingdom. This matter,
      therefore, is hard for me."<br>
      <br>
      <i>That the disciples and the powers are all from the same
        Mixture.</i><br>
      When then Andrew had said this, the spirit of the Saviour was
      roused in him; he cried out and said: "How long am I to endure
      you? How long am I to bear with you? Have ye then not even yet
      understood and are ye ignorant? Know ye then not and do ye not
      understand that ye and all angels and all archangels and the gods
      and the lords and all the rulers and all the great invisibles and
      all those of the Midst and those of the whole region of the Right
      and all the great [ones] of the emanations of the Light and their
      whole glory, -- that ye all one with another are out of one and
      the same paste and the same matter and the same substance, and
      that ye all are out of the same Mixture.<br>
      <br>
      "And at the commandment of the First Mystery the Mixture was
      constrained, until all the great [ones] of the emanations of the
      Light and all their glory purified themselves, and until they
      purified themselves from the Mixture. And they have not purified
      themselves of themselves, but they have purified themselves by
      necessity according to the economy of the One and Only, the
      Ineffable.<br>
      <br>
      "They indeed have not at all suffered and have not at all changed
      themselves in the regions, nor at all torn themselves asunder nor
      poured themselves into bodies of different kinds and from one into
      another, nor have they been in any affliction at all.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of transcorporation and purification.</i><br>
      "Ye then in particular are the refuse of the Treasury and ye are
      the refuse of the region of the Right and ye are the refuse of the
      region of those of the Midst and ye are the refuse of all the
      invisibles and of all the rulers; in a word, ye are the refuse of
      all these. And ye are in great sufferings and great afflictions in
      your being poured from one into another of different kinds of
      bodies of the world. And after all these sufferings ye have
      struggled of your-selves and fought, having renounced the whole
      world and all the matter therein; and ye have not left off
      seeking, until ye found all the mysteries of the kingdom of the
      Light, which have purified you and made you into refined light,
      exceedingly purified, and ye have become purified light.<br>
      <br>
      "For this cause have I said unto you aforetime: 'Seek, that ye may
      find.' I have, therefore, said unto you: Ye are to seek after the
      mysteries of the Light, which purify the body of matter and make
      it into refined light exceedingly purified.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the purifying mysteries.</i><br>
      "Amēn, I say unto you: For the sake of the race of men, because it
      is material, I have torn myself asunder and brought unto them all
      the mysteries of the Light, that I may purify them, for they are
      the refuse of the whole matter of their matter; else would no soul
      of the total race of men have been saved, and they would not be
      able to inherit the kingdom of the Light, if I had not brought
      unto them the purifying mysteries.<br>
      <br>
      "For the emanations of the Light have no need of the mysteries,
      for they are purified; but it is the race of men which hath need
      of them, because they all are material refuse For this cause,
      therefore, have I said unto you aforetime: 'The healthy have no
      need of the physician, but the sick,' -- that is: Those of the
      Light have no need of the mysteries, for they are purified lights;
      but it is the race of men which hath need of them, for [they] are
      material refuse [pl.].<br>
      <br>
      "For this cause, therefore, herald to the whole race of men,
      saying: Cease not to seek day and night, until ye find the
      purifying mysteries; and say unto the race of men: Renounce the
      whole world and the whole matter therein. For he who buyeth and
      selleth in the world and he who eateth and drinketh of its matter
      and who liveth in all its cares and in all its associations,
      amasseth other additional matters to the rest of his matter,
      because this whole world and all therein and all its associations
      are material refuse [pl.], and they will make enquiry of every one
      concerning his purity.<br>
      <br>
      "For this cause, therefore, I have said unto you aforetime:
      Renounce the whole world and the whole matter therein, that ye may
      not amass other additional matter to the rest of your matter in
      you. For this cause, therefore, herald it to the whole race of
      men, saying: Renounce the whole world and all its associations,
      that ye may not amass additional matter to the rest of your matter
      in you; and say unto them: Cease not to seek day and night and
      remit not yourselves until ye find the purifying mysteries which
      will purify you and make you into a refined light, so that ye will
      go on high and inherit the light of my kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      <i>That all who are purified will be saved.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, Andrew and all thy brethren thy co-disciples,
      because of your renunciations and all your sufferings which ye
      have endured in every region, and because of your changes in every
      region and of your being poured from one into another of different
      kinds of bodies and because of all your afflictions, and after all
      this ye have received the purifying mysteries and are become
      refined light exceedingly purified,--for this cause, therefore, ye
      will go on high and penetrate into all the regions of all the
      great emanations of the Light and be kings in the Light-kingdom
      for ever.<br>
      <br>
      <i>That finally they will be higher than all powers.</i><br>
      "But if ye come forth out of the body and come on high and reach
      unto the region of the rulers, then will all the rulers be seized
      with shame before you, because ye are the refuse of their matter
      and have become light more purified than them all. And if ye reach
      unto the region of the Great Invisible and unto the region of
      those of the Midst and of those of the Right and unto the regions
      of all the great emanations of the Light, then will ye be revered
      among them all, because ye are the refuse of their matter and are
      became light more purified than them all. And all the regions will
      sing praises before you, until ye come to the region of the
      kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the answer to the words on which ye question. Now,
      therefore, Andrew, art thou still in unfaith and unknowing?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus pardoneth the ignorance of Andrew.</i><br>
      When then the Saviour said this, Andrew knew clearly, not only he
      but also all the disciples knew with precision that they should
      inherit the Light-kingdom. They all threw themselves down together
      at Jesus' feet, cried aloud, wept and besought the Saviour,
      saying: "Lord, forgive our brother the sin of unknowing."<br>
      <br>
      The Saviour answered and said: "I forgive and will forgive; for
      this cause, therefore, hath the First Mystery sent me, that I may
      forgive every one his sins."<br>

      Of the Limbs of the Ineffable."AND those who are worthy of the
      mysteries which abide in the Ineffable, which are those which have
      not gone forth,-- these exist before the First Mystery, and to use
      a likeness and similitude, that ye may understand it, they are as
      the Limbs of the Ineffable. And every one existeth according to
      the dignity of its glory: the head according to the dignity of the
      head and the eye according to the dignity of the eyes and the ear
      according to the dignity of the ears and the rest of the Limbs [in
      like fashion]; so that the matter is manifest: There is a
      multitude of limbs but one only body. Of this indeed have I spoken
      in a pattern and similitude and likeness, but not in a form in
      truth; nor have I revealed the word in truth, but the mystery
      [only] of the Ineffable.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The Saviour is their treasury.</i><br>
      "And all the Limbs which are in it,-- according to the word with
      which I have made comparison, -- that is, those which abide on the
      mystery of the Ineffable, and those which abide in it, and also
      the three spaces which are after them according to the mysteries,
      -- of all these in truth and verity I am their treasury beside
      whom there is no other treasury, who hath not his like in the
      world; but there are still words and mysteries and other regions.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the dignity of those who have received the mysteries.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, blessed is he who hath found the [words of the]
      mysteries [of the first space] which is from without; and he is a
      god who hath found these words of the mysteries of the second
      space, which is in the midst; and he is a saviour and an
      uncontainable who hath found the words of the mysteries of the
      third space, which is within, and he is more excellent than the
      universe and like unto those who are in that third space. Because
      he hath found the mystery in which they are and in which they
      stand, -- for this cause, therefore, is he like unto them. He on
      the other hand who hath found the words of the mysteries which I
      have described unto you according to a likeness, that they are the
      Limbs of the Ineffable, -- amēn, I say unto you: That man who hath
      found the words of these mysteries in divine truth, is the first
      in truth and like unto him [sc. the First, i.e. the Ineffable],
      for through those words and mysteries... and the universe itself
      standeth through that First. For this cause he who hath found the
      words of those mysteries, is like unto the First. For it is the
      gnosis of the gnosis of the Ineffable concerning which I have
      discoursed with you this day."<br>

      <i>Of the proclamation of the disciples.</i><br>
      JESUS continued again in the discourse and said unto his
      disciples: "When I shall have gone into the Light, then herald it
      unto the whole world and say unto them: Cease not to seek day and
      night and remit not yourselves until ye find the mysteries of the

      and be in the submission which I have just recounted unto you.
      Give unto them the mysteries of the Light-kingdom and hide them
      not from them at all; for it is because of sinfulness that I have
      brought the mysteries into the world, that I may forgive all their
      sins which they have committed from the beginning on. For this
      cause have I said unto you aforetime: 'I am not come to call the
      righteous.' Now, therefore, I have brought the mysteries that
      [their] sins may be forgiven for every one and they be received
      into the Light-kingdom. For the mysteries are the gift of the

      Mary questioneth the Saviour.It came to pass then, when Jesus had
      finished saying these words unto his disciples, that Mary came
      forward and said to the Saviour: "My Lord, will then a righteous
      man who is perfected in all righteousness, and that man who hath
      no sin at all, will such an one be tormented in the chastisements
      and judgments or not? Or will rather that man be brought into the
      kingdom of heaven or not?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the soul of the righteous man who hath not received the
        mysteries at death.</i><i><br>
      </i>And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "A righteous man
      who is perfected in all righteousness and who hath never committed
      any sin of any kind, and such an one who never hath received
      mysteries of the Light, if the time is at hand when he goeth forth
      out of the body, then straightway come the receivers of one of the
      great triple-powers, -- those among whom there is a great
      [one],--snatch away the soul of that man from the hands of the
      retributive receivers and spend three days circling with it in all
      the creatures of the world. After three days they lead it down
      into the chaos, so as to lead it into all the chastisements of the
      judgments and to dispatch it to all the judgments. The fires of
      the chaos do not trouble it greatly; but they will trouble it
      partly for a short time.<br>
      <br>
      "And with haste they take pity on it quickly, to lead it up out of
      the chaos and lead it on the way of the midst through all the
      rulers. And they [sc. the rulers] do not chastize it in their
      harsh judgments, but the fire of their regions troubleth it
      partly. And if it shall be brought into the region of
      Yachthanabas, the pitiless, then will he indeed not be able to
      chastize it in his evil judgments, but he holdeth it fast a short
      time, while the fire of his chastisements troubleth it partly.<br>
      <br>
      And again they take pity on it quickly, and lead it up out of
      those regions of theirs and they do not bring it into the æons, so
      that the rulers of the æons do not carry it away ravishingly; they
      bring it on the way of the sun and bring it before the Virgin of
      Light. She proveth it and findeth that it is pure of sins, but
      letteth them not bring it to the Light, because the sign of the
      kingdom of the mystery is not with it. But she sealeth it with a
      higher seal and letteth it be cast down into the body into the
      æons of righteousness, -- that body which will be good to find the
      signs of the mysteries of the Light and inherit the Light-kingdom
      for ever.<br>
      <br>
      "If on the contrary he hath sinned once or twice or thrice, then
      will he be cast back into the world again according to the type of
      the sins which he hath committed, the type of which I will tell
      you when I shall have told you the expansion of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      "But amēn, amēn, I say unto you: Even if a righteous man hath
      committed no sins at all, he cannot possibly be brought into the
      Light-kingdom, because the sign of the kingdom of the mysteries is
      not with him. In a word, it is impossible to bring souls into the
      Light without the mysteries of the Light-kingdom."<br>

      John questioneth Jesus.It came to pass then, when Jesus had
      finished saying these words unto his disciples, that John came
      forward and said: "My Lord, suppose a sinning and a law-breaking
      man is replete in all iniquities, and he hath ceased from these
      for the sake of the kingdom of heaven and renounced the whole
      world and the whole matter therein, and we give him from the
      be-ginning onwards the mysteries of the Light which are in the
      first space from without, and if he receiveth the mysteries, and
      after a little while again if he returneth and transgresseth, and
      thereafter again if he turneth and ceaseth from all sins and
      turneth and renounceth the whole world and the whole matter
      therein, so that he cometh again and is in great repentance, and
      if we know truly in truth that he longeth after God, so that we
      give him the second mystery of the first space which is from
      without; -- in like manner if he turneth anew and transgresseth
      and is again in the sins of the world, and again if he thereafter
      turneth and ceaseth from the sins of the world and again
      renounceth the whole world and the whole matter therein and again
      is in great repentance, and we know it with certainty that he is
      not a play-actor, so that we turn and give him the mysteries of
      the beginning, which [are] in the first space from without; -- in
      like manner, if he turneth again and sinneth and is in every type
      [of sin]; -- desirest thou that we forgive him unto seven times
      and give him the mysteries which are in the first space from
      without, unto seven times or not?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>The disciples are to forgive many times seven times.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered again and said unto John: "Not only forgive
      him unto seven times, but amēn, I say unto you: Forgive him unto
      many times seven times, and every time give him the mysteries from
      the beginning onwards which are in the first space from without.
      Perchance ye win the soul of that brother and he inheriteth the
      Light-kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      "For this cause, therefore, when ye questioned me aforetime,
      saying: 'If our brother sin against us, desirest thou that we
      forgive him unto seven times?' -- I answered and spake unto you in
      a similitude, saying: 'Not only unto seven times, but unto seventy
      times seven.'<br>

      this, John started forward and said: "My Lord, bear with me if I
      question thee, for from now on I will begin to, question thee on
      all things concerning the manner, how we are to herald it to
      mankind.<br>
      <br>
      "If, therefore, I give that brother a mystery out of the mysteries
      of the beginning which are in the first space from without, and if
      I give him many mysteries and he doeth not what is worthy of the
      kingdom of heaven, -- desirest thou that we let him pass through
      to the mysteries of the second space? Perchance we win the soul of
      that brother, and he turneth, repenteth and inheriteth the

      <i><br>
      </i><i>That the mysteries shall be given again unto a repentant
        brother even up to the three of the second space.</i><br>
      And the Saviour answered and said unto John: "If it is a brother
      who is not play-acting, but in truth longeth after God, if ye have
      given him many times the mysteries of the beginning and because of
      the necessity of the elements of the Fate he hath not done what is
      worthy of the mysteries of the Light-kingdom, then forgive him,
      let him pass through and give him the first mystery which is in
      the second space. Perchance ye win the soul of that brother.<br>
      <br>
      "And if he hath not done what is worthy of the mysteries of the
      Light and hath committed transgression and divers sins, and
      thereafter hath turned; again and been in great repentance and
      hath renounced the whole world and ceased from all the sins of the
      world, and ye know with certainty that he doth not play-act but in

      pass on through and give him the second mystery in the second
      space of the First Mystery. Perchance ye win the soul of that

      <br>
      "And again if he hath not done what is worthy of the mysteries,

      again hath turned and been in great repentance and hath renounced
      the whole world and the whole matter therein and ceased from the

      forgive him and receive his repentance, because the First Mystery
      is compassionate and merciful-minded; let also that man pass
      through and give him the three mysteries together which are in the
      second space of the First Mystery.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The limit of the power of the disciples to forgive sins.</i><br>
      "If that man [then] transgresseth and is in divers sins, from that

      repentance; but let him be among you as a stumbling-block and as a
      transgressor.<br>
      <br>

      witnesses for his last repentance, and he hath not repentance from
      this moment onwards. For, amēn, I say unto you: The soul of that
      man will not be cast back into the world above from this moment
      onwards, but will be in the abodes of the dragon of the outer
      darkness.<br>
      <br>
      <i>A former saying explained.</i><br>
      "For regarding the souls of such men I have spoken unto you
      aforetime in a similitude, saying: 'If thy brother sinneth against
      thee, bring him over between thee alone and him. If he hearkeneth
      unto thee, thou wilt win thy brother; if he hearkeneth not unto
      thee, take with thee yet another. If he hearkeneth not unto thee
      and the other, bring him to the assembly. If he hearken not unto
      the others, let him be for you as a transgressor and as a
      stumbling-block.' -- That is: If he is not usable in the first
      mystery, give him the second; and if he is not usable in the
      second give him the three, assembled together, which is 'the
      assembly'; and if he is not usable in the third mystery, let him
      be for you as a stumbling-block and as a transgressor.<br>

      <i>Of the master-mystery of the forgiveness of sins.</i><br>
      "And the word which I have spoken unto you aforetime: 'So that

      received, nor can he at all be hearkened to through any mystery,
      save through the first mystery of the First Mystery and through

      <i>John continueth his questioning.</i><br>
      When then the Saviour had said this, John continued again and said
      to the Saviour: "My Lord, suppose an exceedingly sinful brother
      who hath renounced the whole world and the whole matter therein
      and all its sins and all its cares, and we shall prove him and
      know that he is not in deceit and play-acting but that in
      uprightness and in truth he longeth [after God], and we know that
      he hath become worthy of the mysteries of the second space or of
      the third,-- desirest thou that we give him of the mysteries of
      the second space and of the third, before he hath at all received
      mysteries of the Inheritance of the Light or not? Desirest thou
      that we give or not?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Further of the forgiveness of sins.</i><br>
      And the Saviour answered and said unto John in the midst of the
      disciples: "If ye know with certainty that that man hath renounced
      the whole world and all its cares and all its associations and all
      its sins, and if ye know in truth that he is not in deceit,
      neither that he was play-acting nor that he was curious to know
      the mysteries, how they are brought to pass, but that he longeth
      after God in truth, hide them not from such an one, but give him
      of the mysteries of the second and third space and try even of
      what mystery he is worthy; and that of which he is worthy, give
      him and hide it not from him, for if ye hide it from him, ye may
      be guilty of a great condemnation.<br>
      <br>
      "If ye give him once [of the mysteries] of the second space or of
      the third and he turneth again and sinneth, ye are to continue
      again the second time up to the third time. If he still sinneth,
      ye shall not continue to give him, for those three mysteries will
      be witnesses unto him for his last repentance. And amēn, I say
      unto you: He who shall give that man anew mysteries of the second
      space or of the third, is guilty of a great condemnation. But let
      him be for you as a transgressor and as a stumbling-block.<br>
      <br>
      "Amēn, I say unto you: The soul of that man cannot be cast back
      into the world from this moment onwards; but his habitation is in
      the midst of the jaws of the dragon of the outer darkness, the
      region of howling and grinding of teeth. And at the dissolution of
      the world his soul will be frozen up [?] and perish in the violent
      cold and exceedingly violent fire and will be non-existent
      eternally.<br>
      <br>
      "Even if he yet again turneth and renounceth the whole world and
      all its cares and all its sins, and he is in great citizenship and
      great repentance, no mystery can receive from him his repentance;
      nor can it hearken unto him, to have mercy upon him and receive
      his repentance and forgive his sins, save the mystery of the First
      Mystery and the mystery of the Ineffable. It is these alone which
      will receive the repentance of that man and forgive his sins; for
      in sooth those mysteries are compassionate and merciful-minded and
      forgiving of sins at every time."<br>

      you unto themselves, give them a mystery. If they are worthy, ye
      will win their souls and they will inherit the Light-kingdom; but
      if they are not worthy but are deceitful against you, and if they
      also make a show of the mysteries, making trial of you and also of
      the mysteries, then invoke the first mystery of the First Mystery
      which hath mercy on every one, and say: Thou Mystery, which we

      as the dust of your house. And amēn, I say unto you: In that hour
      all the mysteries which ye have given unto them, will return unto

      which they have received figures, will be taken from them.<br>

      is worthy of the mysteries and in truth long after God, give them
      the mysteries of the Light-kingdom; but if they play-act with you
      and are deceitful against you, without your having known it, and

      When then Jesus had said this, Mary continued, threw herself at
      Jesus' feet, kissed them and said: "My Lord, still will I question
      thee. Reveal [it] unto us and hide [it] not from us."<br>
      <br>
      Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "Question on what ye question,
      and I will reveal [it] unto you in openness without similitude."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary continueth her questioning.</i><br>
      Mary answered and said: "My Lord, hast thou then not brought
      mysteries into the world because of poverty and riches, and
      because of weakness and strength, and because of . . . and healthy
      bodies, in a word because of all such, so that, if we go into the
      regions of the land, and they do not have faith in us and they
      hearken not unto our words, and we perform any such mysteries in
      those regions, they may know truly in truth that we herald the
      words [of the God] of the universe?"<br>
      <br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the
      disciples: "Concerning this mystery on which ye question me, I
      have given it unto you at another time; but I will repeat it and
      speak the word unto you:<br>
      <br>
      <i>The mystery of the raising of the dead.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, Mary, not only ye, but every man who shall
      accomplish the mystery of the raising of the dead,--that which
      healeth the demons and all pains and all sicknesses and the blind
      and the lame and the maimed and the dumb and the deaf, which I
      have given unto you aforetime, -- he who shall receive [that]
      mystery and accomplish it, thereafter then, if he ask for all
      things, for poverty and riches, for weakness and strength, for . .
      . and healthy body, and for all healings of the body and for the
      raising of the dead and for healing the lame and the blind and the
      deaf and the dumb and all sicknesses and all pains, -- in a word,
      he who shall accomplish that mystery and ask for all the things
      which I have just said, then will they quickly come to pass for
      him."<br>
      <br>
      <i>The disciples became frenzied at the sublimity of the prospect.</i><br>
      When then the Saviour had said this, the disciples came forward,
      cried out all together and said: "O Saviour, thou hath made us
      very exceedingly frenzied because of the great deeds of which thou
      tellest us; and because thou hast borne up our souls, they have
      pressed to go forth out of us unto thee, for we issue from thee.
      Now, therefore, because of these great deeds of which thou tellest
      us, our souls have become frenzied and they have pressed very
      exceedingly, yearning to go forth out of us on high to the region
      of thy kingdom."<br>

      <br>
      <i>How the disciples shall make proclamation.</i><br>
      When then the disciples had said this, the Saviour continued again
      and said unto his disciples: "If ye go into cities or kingdoms or
      countries, proclaim first unto them, saying:<br>
      <br>
      Search ever and cease not, until ye find the mysteries of the
      Light which will lead you into the Light-kingdom. Say unto them:
      Beware of the doctrines of error. For many will come in my name
      and say: It is I. And it is not I, and they will lead many astray.<br>
      <br>
      <i>What mysteries they shall give.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, unto all men who come unto you and have faith in
      you and hearken unto your words and do what is worthy of the
      mysteries of the Light, give the mysteries of the Light and hide
      them not from them. And unto him who is worthy of the higher
      mysteries, give them, and to him who is worthy of the lower
      mysteries, give them, and hide not anything from any one.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The mystery of the raising of the dead not to be given to any.</i><br>
      "The mystery of the raising of the dead and of the healing of the
      sick, on the other hand, give unto no one nor give instruction in
      it, for that mystery belongeth to the rulers, it and all its
      namings. For this cause, therefore, give it unto no one, nor give
      instruction in it until ye establish the faith in the whole world,
      in order that, if ye come into cities or into countries, and they
      do not receive you unto themselves, and do not have faith, and do
      not hearken unto your words, ye may raise the dead in those
      regions and heal the lame and the blind and manifold of sicknesses
      in those regions. And through all such they will have faith in
      you, that ye herald the God of the universe, and will have faith
      in all the words of you. For this cause, therefore, have I given
      unto you that mystery, until ye establish the faith in the whole
      world."<br>
      <br>
      When then the Saviour had said this, he continued again in the
      discourse and said unto Mary: "Now, therefore, hearken, Mary,
      concerning the word on which thou hast questioned me: Who
      constraineth the man until he sinneth? Now, therefore, hearken:<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the constitution of man.</i><br>
      "Is the babe born, the power is feeble in it, and the soul is
      feeble in it, and also the counterfeiting spirit is feeble in it;
      in a word, the three together are feeble, without any one of them
      sensing anything, whether good or evil, because of the load of
      forgetfulness which is very heavy. Moreover the body also is
      feeble. And the babe eateth of the delights of the world of the
      rulers; and the power draweth into itself from the portion of the
      power which is in the delights; and the soul draweth into itself
      from the portion of the soul which is in the delights; and the
      counterfeiting spirit draweth into itself from the portion of the
      evil which is in the delights and in its lusts. And on the other
      hand the body draweth into itself the matter which senseth not,
      which is in the delights. The destiny on the contrary taketh
      nothing from the delights, because it is not mingled with them,
      but it departeth again in the condition in which it cometh into
      the world.<br>
      <br>
      "And little by little the power and the soul and the
      counterfeiting spirit grow, and every one of them senseth
      according to its nature: the power senseth to seek after the light
      of the height; the soul on the other hand senseth to seek after
      the region of righteousness which is mixed, which is the region of
      the commixture; the counterfeiting spirit on the other hand
      seeketh after all evils and lusts and all sins; the body on the
      contrary senseth nothing unless it taketh up force out of the
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      "And straightway the three develop sense, every one according to
      its nature. And the retributive receivers assign the servitors to
      follow them and be witnesses of all the sins which they commit,
      with a view to the manner and method how they will chastize them
      in the judgments.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the counterfeiting spirit.</i><br>
      "And after this the counterfeiting spirit contriveth and senseth
      all sins and the evil which the rulers of the great Fate have
      commanded for the soul, and it maketh them for the soul.<br>
      <br>
      "And the inner power stirreth the soul to seek after the region of
      the Light and the whole god-head; and the counterfeiting spirit
      leadeth away the soul and compelleth it continually to do all its
      lawless deeds, all its mischiefs and all its sin, and is
      persistently allotted to the soul and is hostile to it, and making
      it do all this evil and all these sins.<br>
      <br>
      "And it goadeth on the retributive servitors, so that they are
      witnesses in all the sins which it will make it do. Moreover also
      if it will rest in the night [or] by day, it stirreth it in dreams
      or in lusts of the world, and maketh it to lust after all the
      things of the world. In a word, it driveth [?] it into all the
      things which the rulers have commanded for it and it is hostile to
      the soul, making it do what pleaseth it not.<br>
      <br>
      "Now, therefore, Mary, this is in fact the foe of the soul, and
      this compelleth it until it doeth all sins.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The state of the sinful soul after death.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, if the time of that man is completed, first
      cometh forth the destiny and leadeth the man unto death through
      the rulers and their bonds with which they are bound through the
      Fate.<br>
      <br>
      "And thereafter the retributive receivers come and lead that soul
      out of the body. And thereafter the. retributive receivers spend
      three days circling round with that soul in all the regions and
      dispatch it to all the æons of the world. And the counterfeiting
      spirit and the destiny follow that soul; and the power returneth
      to the Virgin of Light.<br>
      <br>
      "And after three days the retributive receivers lead down that
      soul to the Amente of the chaos; and when they bring it down to
      the chaos, they hand it over to those who chastize. And the
      retributive receivers return unto their own regions according to
      the economy of the works of the rulers concerning the coming-forth
      of the souls.<br>
      <br>
      "And the counterfeiting spirit becometh the receiver of the soul,
      being assigned unto it and transferring it according to the
      chastisement because of the sins which it hath made it commit, and
      is in great enmity to the soul.<br>
      <br>
      "And when the soul hath finished the chastisements in the chaos
      according to the sins which it hath committed, the counterfeiting
      spirit leadeth it forth out of the chaos, being assigned unto it
      and transferring it to every region because of the sins which it
      hath committed; and it leadeth it forth on the way of the rulers
      of the midst. And when it reacheth them, [the rulers] question it
      on the mysteries of the destiny; and if it hath not found them,
      they question their destiny. And those rulers chastize that soul
      according to the sins of which it is guilty. I will tell you the
      type of their chastisements at the expansion of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      <i>How a sinful soul is brought back to birth</i>.<br>
      "When, therefore, the time of the chastisements of that soul in
      the judgments of the rulers of the midst shall be completed, the
      counterfeiting spirit leadeth the soul up out of all the regions
      of the rulers of the midst and bringeth it before the light of the
      sun according to the commandment of the First Man, Yew, and
      bringeth it before the judge, the Virgin of Light. And she proveth
      that soul and findeth that it is a sinning soul, and ceaseth her
      light-power into it for its standing-upright and because of the
      body and the community of sense, -- the type of which I will tell
      you at the expansion of the universe. And the Virgin of Light
      sealeth that soul and handeth it over to one of her receivers and
      will have it cast into a body which is suitable to the sins which
      it hath committed.<br>
      <br>
      "And amēn, I say unto you: They will not discharge that soul from
      the changes of the body until it hath yielded its last circuit
      according to its merit. Of all these then will I tell you their
      type and the type of the bodies into which it will be cast
      according to the sins of each soul. All this will I tell you when
      I shall have told you the expansion of the universe."<br>

      <i>Of the ascension after death of the good soul that hath
        received the mysteries.</i><br>
      Jesus continued again in the discourse and said: "If on the
      contrary it is a soul which hath not hearkened unto the
      counterfeiting spirit in all its works, but hath become good and
      hath received the mysteries of the Light which are in the second
      space or even those which are in the third space which is within,
      when the time [of the coming-forth] of that soul out of the body
      is completed, then the counterfeiting spirit followeth that soul,
      it and the destiny; and it followeth it on the way on which it
      will go above.<br>
      <br>
      "And before it removeth itself above, it uttereth the mystery of
      the undoing of the seals and all the bonds of the counterfeiting
      spirit with which the rulers have bound it to the soul; and when
      it is uttered, the bonds of the counterfeiting spirit undo
      themselves, and it ceaseth to come into that soul and releaseth
      the soul according to the commandments which the rulers of the
      great Fate have commanded it, saying: 'Release not this soul until
      it tell thee the mystery of the undoing of all the seals with
      which we have bound thee to the soul.'<br>
      <br>
      "If then the soul shall have uttered the mystery of the undoing of
      the seals and of all the bonds of the counterfeiting spirit, and
      if it ceaseth to come into the soul and ceaseth to be bound to it,
      then it uttereth in that moment a mystery and releaseth the
      destiny to its region to the rulers who are on the way of the
      midst. And it uttereth the mystery and releaseth the
      counterfeiting spirit to the rulers of the Fate to the region in
      which it was bound to it.<br>
      <br>
      "And in that moment it becometh a great light-stream, shining
      exceedingly, and the retributive receivers who have led it forth
      out of the body, are afraid of the light of that soul and fall on
      their faces. And in that moment that soul becometh a great
      light-stream, it becometh entirely wings of light, and penetrateth
      all the regions of the rulers and all the orders of the Light,
      until it reacheth the region of its kingdom up to which it hath
      received mysteries.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the state after death of one who hath received the
        mysteries, and yet hath transgressed.</i><br>
      "If on the other hand it is a soul which hath received mysteries
      in the first space which is without, and if after it hath received
      the mysteries it hath accomplished them, it [then] turneth and
      committeth sin after the accomplishing of the mysteries, and if
      the time of the coming-forth of that soul is completed, then the
      retributive receivers come to lead that soul out of the body.<br>
      <br>
      "And the destiny and the counterfeiting spirit follow that soul.
      Because the counterfeiting spirit is bound to it with the seals
      and the bonds of the rulers, it followeth thus that soul which
      travelleth on the ways with the counterfeiting spirit.<br>
      <br>
      "It uttereth the mystery of the undoing of all the bonds and all
      the seals with which the rulers have bound the counterfeiting
      spirit to the soul. And when the soul uttereth the mystery of the
      undoing of the seals, straightway the bonds of the seals which are
      bound in the counterfeiting spirit to the soul undo themselves.
      And when the soul uttereth the mystery of the undoing of the
      seals, straightway the counterfeiting spirit undoeth itself and
      ceaseth to be assigned to the soul. And in that moment the soul
      uttereth a mystery and restraineth the counterfeiting spirit and
      the destiny and dischargeth them which follow it. But no one of
      them is in its power; but it is in their power.<br>
      <br>
      "And in that moment the receivers of that soul come with the
      mysteries which it hath received, come and snatch that soul out of
      the hands of the retributive receivers, and the [latter] receivers
      go back to the works of the rulers for the purpose of the economy
      of the leading-forth of the souls.<br>
      <br>
      "And the receivers of that soul on the other hand who belong to
      the Light, become wings of light for that soul and become vestures
      of light for it and they do not lead it into the chaos, because it
      is not lawful to lead into the chaos souls which have received
      mysteries, but they lead it on the way of the rulers of the midst.
      And when it reacheth the rulers of the midst, those rulers meet
      the soul, they being in great fear and violent fire and with
      different faces, in a word in great immeasurable fear.<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>The apology of the rulers of the ways of the midst.</i><br>
      "And in that moment the soul uttereth the mystery of their
      apology. And they are exceedingly afraid and fall on their faces,
      being in fear of the mystery which it hath uttered, and of their
      apology. And that soul surrendereth their destiny, saying unto
      them: Take your destiny! I come not to your regions from this
      moment onwards. I have become a stranger unto you for ever, being
      about to go unto the region of my inheritance.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The apology of the rulers of the Fate.</i><i><br>
      </i>"And when the soul shall have said this, the receivers of the
      Light fly with it on high and lead it into the æons of the Fate,
      it giving every region its apology and its seals,--which I will
      tell you at the expansion of the universe. And it giveth the
      counterfeiting spirit to the rulers and telleth them the mystery
      of the bonds with which it is bound to it, and sayeth unto them:
      There have ye your counterfeiting spirit! I come not to your
      region from this moment onwards. I have become a stranger unto you
      for ever. And it giveth every one his seal and his apology.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the ascension of that soul into the Inheritance.</i><br>
      "And when the soul shall have said this, the receivers of the
      Light fly with it on high and lead it out of the æons of the Fate
      and lead it up into all the æons [above], it giving to every
      region its apology and the apology of all the regions and the
      seals to the tyrants of the king, the Adamas. And it giveth the
      apology of all the rulers of all the regions of the Left,--whose
      collective apologies and seals I will one day tell you when I
      shall tell you the expansion of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      "And moreover those receivers lead that soul to the Virgin of
      Light and that soul giveth the Virgin of Light the seals and the
      glory of the songs of praise. And the Virgin of Light and also the
      seven other virgins of the Light together prove that soul and find
      together their signs in it and their seals and their baptisms and
      their chrism. And the Virgin of Light sealeth that soul and the
      receivers of the Light baptize that soul and give it the spiritual
      chrism; and every one of the virgins of the Light sealeth it with
      her seals.<br>
      <br>
      "And moreover the receivers of the Light hand it over to the great
      Sabaōth, the Good, who is at the gate of the Life in the region of
      those of the Right, who is called 'Father.' And that soul giveth
      him the glory of his songs of praise and his seals and his
      apologies. And Sabaōth, the Great and Good, sealeth it with his
      seals. And the soul giveth its science and the glory of the songs
      of praise and the seals to the whole region of those of the Right.
      They all seal it with their seals; and Melchisedec, the great
      Receiver of the Light who is in the region of those of the Right,
      sealeth that soul and all the receivers of Melchisedec seal that
      soul and lead it into the Treasury of the Light.<br>

      "And it giveth the glory and the honour and the laud of the songs
      of praise and. all the seals of all the regions of the Light. And
      all those of the region of the Treasury of the Light seal it with
      their seals and it goeth unto the region of the Inheritance."<br>

      When then the Saviour had said this unto his disciples he said
      unto them: "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary interpreteth from former sayings.</i><br>
      And Mary again started forward and said: "Yea, my Lord, I
      understand in what manner thou dost discourse with me, and I will
      comprehend them all [sc. thy words]. Now, therefore, concerning
      these words which thou sayest, my mind hath brought forward four
      thoughts in me and my light-man hath led me and exulted and
      seethed, desiring to come forth out of me and enter into thee.
      Now, therefore, my Lord, hearken that I may tell thee the four
      thoughts which have arisen in me.<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>The piece of money which was brought unto Jesus. </i><br>
      "The first thought hath arisen in me concerning the word which
      thou hast spoken: 'Now, therefore, the soul giveth the apology and
      seal unto all the rulers who are in the region of the king, the
      Adamas, and giveth the apology and the honour and the glory of all
      their seals and the songs of praise to the region of the Light,'
      -- concerning this word then thou hast spoken unto us aforetime,
      when they brought thee the piece of money and thou didst see that
      it was of silver and copper and didst ask: 'Whose is this image?'
      They said: 'The king's.' And when thou sawest that it was of
      silver and copper mixed, thou saidst: 'Give therefore the king's
      unto the king and God's unto God,' -- that is: If the soul
      receiveth mysteries, it giveth the apology to all the rulers and
      to the region of the king, the Adamas; and the soul giveth the
      honour and the glory to all those of the region of the Light. And
      the word: 'It hath glistened, when thou didst see that it is made
      up of silver and copper,'--it is the type thereof, that in it [sc.
      the soul] is the power of the Light, which is the refined silver,
      and that in it is the counterfeiting spirit, which is the material
      copper. This, my Lord, is the first thought.<br>
      <i><br>
      </i><i>A saying of Paul.</i><br>
      "The second thought is on the other hand that which thou hast just
      said unto us concerning the soul which receiveth the mysteries:
      'If it cometh into the region of the rulers of the way of the
      midst, they come forth to meet it in exceedingly great fear and
      they are afraid of it. And the soul giveth the mystery of the fear
      unto them and they are afraid before it. And it giveth the destiny
      to its region, and it giveth the counterfeiting spirit to its own
      region, and it giveth the apology and the seals to every one of
      the rulers who are on the ways, and it giveth the honour and the
      glory and the laud of the seals and the songs of praise to all
      those of the region of the Light,' -- concerning this word, my
      Lord, thou hast spoken aforetime through the mouth of our brother
      Paul : 'Give tax to whom tax is due, give fear to whom fear is
      due, give tribute to whom tribute is due, give honour to whom
      honour is due, and give laud to whom laud is due, and owe not any
      other anything,' -- that is, my Lord: The soul which receiveth
      mysteries, giveth apology to all regions. This, my Lord, is the
      second thought.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The foes of one's own house.</i><br>
      "The third thought on the other hand concerning the word which
      thou hast aforetime spoken unto us: 'The counterfeiting spirit is
      hostile to the soul, making it do all sins and all mischiefs, and
      it transferreth it in the chastisements because of all the . sins
      which it hath made it commit; in a word, it is hostile to the soul
      in every way,' -- concerning this word, therefore, thou hast said
      unto us aforetime: 'The foes of the man are the dwellers in his
      house,' -- that is: The dwellers in the house of the soul are the
      counterfeiting spirit and the destiny, which are hostile to the

      "The fourth thought on the other hand concerning the word which
      thou hast said: 'If the soul goeth forth out of the body and
      travelleth on the way with the counterfeiting spirit, and if it
      hath not found the mystery of the undoing of all the bonds and the
      seals which are bound to the counterfeiting spirit, so that it may
      cease to haunt or be assigned to it, -- if it then hath not found
      it, the counterfeiting spirit leadeth the soul to the Virgin of
      Light, the judge; and the judge, the Virgin of Light, proveth the
      soul and findeth that it hath sinned and, as she also hath not
      found the mysteries of the Light with it, she handeth it over to
      one of her receivers, and her receiver leadeth it and casteth it
      into the body, and it cometh not out of the changes of the body
      before it hath yielded its last circuit,' -- concerning this word,
      then, my Lord, thou hast said unto us aforetime: 'Be reconciled
      with thy foe as long as thou art on the way with him, lest
      perchance thy foe hand thee over to the judge and the judge hand
      thee over to the servant and the servant cast thee into prison,
      and thou shalt not come forth out of that region till thou hast
      yielded the last farthing.'<br>
      <br>
      "Because of this manifestly is thy word: Every soul which cometh
      forth out of the body and travelleth on the way with the
      counterfeiting spirit and findeth not the mystery of the undoing
      of all the seals and all the bonds, so that it may undo itself
      from the counterfeiting spirit which is bound to it, -- that soul
      which hath not found mysteries of the Light and hath not found the
      mysteries of detachment from the counterfeiting spirit which is
      bound to it, -- if then it hath not found it, the counterfeiting
      spirit leadeth that soul to the Virgin of Light, and the Virgin of
      Light, yea that judge, handeth over that soul to one of her
      receivers, and her receiver casteth it into the sphere of the
      æons, and it cometh not out of the changes of the body before it
      hath yielded the last circuit which is appointed for it. This
      then, my Lord, is the fourth thought."<br>

      It came to pass then, when Jesus had heard Mary say these words,

      are the solutions of the words which I have spoken."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary continueth to question Jesus.</i><br>
      Mary answered and said: "Still, my Lord, do I question thee,

      with sureness. For this cause, therefore, my Lord, be patient with
      us and reveal unto us all things on which we shall question thee
      for the sake of the manner, how my brethren are to herald it to
      the whole race of men."<br>

      And when she had said this to the Saviour, the Saviour answered

      say unto you: Not only will I reveal unto you all things on which
      ye shall question me, but from now on I will reveal unto you other
      things on which ye have not thought to question, which have not
      entered into the heart of man, and which also all the gods, who

      And Mary answered and said: "My Lord, in what type then do the
      baptisms forgive sins? I heard thee say: 'The retributive
      servitors follow the soul, being witnesses to it for all the sins
      which it committeth, that they may convict it in the judgments.'
      Now, therefore, my Lord, do the mysteries of the baptisms wipe out
      the sins which are in the hands of the retributive servitors, so
      that they forget them? Now, therefore, my Lord, tell unto us the
      type, how they forgive sins; nay, we desire to know it with
      sureness."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the retributive servitors.</i><br>
      And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Finely hast thou
      spoken. The servitors indeed are they who bear witness to all
      sins; but they abide in the judgments, seizing the souls and
      convicting all the souls of sinners who have received no
      mysteries; and they keep them fast in the chaos, chastizing them.
      And those retributive receivers cannot overstep the chaos to reach
      to the orders which are above the chaos, and convict the souls
      which come forth out of those regions. Now then it is not lawful
      to use force on the souls which receive mysteries, and lead them
      into the chaos, so that the retributive servitors may convict
      them. But the retributive servitors convict the souls of the
      sinners and they keep fast those who have received no mysteries
      which may lead them out of the chaos. The souls on the other hand
      which receive mysteries,--they have no power of convicting them,
      because they do not come forth out of their regions, and also, if
      they come forth into their regions, they are not able to obstruct
      them; nay, they cannot lead them into that chaos.<br>
      <br>
      <i>How the soul of the sinner is stamped with his sins.</i><br>
      "Hearken moreover that I may tell you the word in truth, in what
      type the mystery of baptism forgiveth sins. Now, therefore, if the
      souls sin when they are still in the world, the retributive
      servitors indeed come and are witnesses of all the sins which the
      soul committeth, lest in sooth they should come forth out of the
      regions of the chaos, in order that they may convict them in the
      judgments which are outside the chaos. And the counterfeiting
      spirit becometh witness of all the sins which the soul shall
      commit, in order that it may convict it in the judgments which are
      outside the chaos, not only that it may bear witness of them,
      but-- all the sins of the souls--it sealeth the sins and maketh
      them fast on to the soul, in order that all the rulers of the
      chastisements of the sinners may recognize it, that it is a
      sinning soul, and that they may know of the number of sins which
      it hath committed, by the seals which the counterfeiting spirit
      hath made fast on to it, so that it shall be chastized according
      to the number of sins which it hath committed. This do they with
      all sinning souls.<br>
      <br>
      <i>How the baptisms purify sins.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, he who shall receive the mysteries of the
      baptisms, then the mystery of them becometh a great, exceedingly
      violent, wise fire and it burneth up the sins and entereth into
      the soul secretly and consumeth all the sins which the
      counterfeiting spirit hath made fast on to it. And when it hath
      finished purifying all the sinsThe separation of the portions by
      the mystery of baptism. which the counterfeiting spirit hath made
      fast on to the soul, it entereth into the body secretly and
      pursueth all the pursuers secretly and separateth them off on the
      side of the portion of the body. For it pursueth the
      counterfeiting spirit and the destiny and separateth them off from
      the power and from the soul and putteth them on the side of the
      body, so that it separateth off the counterfeiting spirit and the
      destiny and the body into one portion; the soul and power on the
      other hand it separateth into another. The mystery of baptism on
      the contrary remaineth in the midst of the two, continually
      separating them from one another, so that it maketh them clean and
      purifieth them, in order that they may not be stained by matter.<br>

      "Now, therefore, Mary, this is the way in which the mysteries of
      the baptisms forgive sins and all iniquities."<br>

      <i>Mary interpreteth the same from a former saying.</i><br>
      Then Mary started forward and said: "Yea, my Lord, in truth I

      the word then of the forgiveness of sins thou hast spoken unto us
      in similitude aforetime, saying: 'I am come to cast fire on the
      earth,' and again: 'What will I that it burn?' And again thou hast
      distinguished it clearly, saying: 'I have a baptism, to baptize in
      it; and how shall I endure until it is accomplished? Think ye I am
      come to cast peace on the earth? Nay, but I am come to cast
      division. For from now on five will be in one house; three will be
      divided against two, and two against three.' This, my Lord, is the

      <br>
      "The word indeed which thou hast spoken: 'I am come to cast fire

      Thou hast brought the mysteries of the baptisms into the world,
      and thy pleasure is that they should consume all the sins of the
      soul and purify them. And thereafter again thou hast distinguished
      it clearly, saying: 'I have a baptism, to baptize in it; and how
      shall I endure until it is accomplished?' -- that is: Thou wilt
      not remain in the world until the baptisms are accomplished and
      purify the perfect souls.<br>
      <br>
      "And moreover the word which thou hast spoken unto us aforetime:
      'Think ye I am come to cast peace on the earth? Nay, but I am come
      to cast division. For from now on five will be in one house; three
      will be divided against two, and two against three,' -- that is:
      Thou hast brought the mystery of the baptisms into the world, and
      it hath effected a division in the bodies of the world, because it
      hath separated the counterfeiting spirit and the body and the
      destiny into one portion; the soul and the power on the other hand
      it hath separated into another portion; -- that is : Three will be
      against two, and two against three."<br>

      forgive sins. Now on the other hand the mystery of these three

      The Saviour answered again and said: "Nay, but all the mysteries

      without having repented and become strangers to the Light-kingdom
      for ever."<br>
      <br>
      When the Saviour had said this, Mary answered and said: "My Lord,
      great is the compassion of those mysteries which forgive sins at
      every time."<br>
      <br>
      <i>If even men on earth are compassionate, how much more then the
        highest mysteries?</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary in the midst of the
      disciples: "If to-day a king who is a man of the world, giveth a
      gift to men of his like, and also forgiveth murderers and those
      who have intercourse with males, and the rest of the very grievous
      sins which are deserving of death, -- if it becometh him who is a
      man of the world, to have done this, much more then have the
      Ineffable and the First Mystery, who are the lords of the
      universe, the authority to act in all things as it pleaseth them,
      that they forgive every one who shall receive mysteries.<br>
      <br>
      "Or if on the other hand a king to-day investeth a soldier with a
      royal vesture and sendeth him into foreign regions, and he
      committeth murders and other grievous sins which are deserving of
      death, then they will not impute them to him, and are not able to
      do him any evil because he is invested with the royal
      vesture,--how much more then those who wear the mysteries of the
      vestures of the Ineffable and those of the First Mystery, who are
      lords over all those of the height and all those of the depth!"<br>

      <i>Jesus trieth Peter.</i><br>
      Thereafter Jesus saw a woman who came to make repentance. He had
      baptized her three times, and yet she had not done what was worthy
      of the baptisms. And the Saviour desired to try Peter, to see if
      he was compassionate and forgiving, as he had commanded them. He
      said unto Peter: "Lo, three times have I baptized this soul, and
      yet at this third time she hath not done what is worthy of the
      mysteries of the Light. Wherefor then cloth she make her body good
      for nothing? Now, therefore, Peter, perform the mystery which
      cutteth off the souls from the inheritances of the Light; perform
      that mystery in order that it may cut off the soul of this woman
      from the Inheritance of the Light."<br>
      <br>
      When then the Saviour had said this, he tried [Peter] to see
      whether he was compassionate and forgiving.<br>
      <br>
      When then the Saviour had said this, Peter said: "My Lord, let her
      yet this time, that we may give her the higher mysteries; and if
      she is fit, then hast thou let her inherit the Light-kingdom, but
      if she is not fit, then hast thou [to] cut her off from the
      Light-kingdom."<br>

      When then Peter had said this, the Saviour knew that Peter was
      compassionate as he and forgiving.<br>

      When then all this was said, the Saviour said unto his disciples:
      "Have ye understood all these words and the type of this woman?"<br>

      <i>Mary interpreteth the incident from a former saying.</i><br>
      Mary answered and said: "My Lord, I have understood the mysteries
      of the things which have fallen to this woman's lot. Concerning
      the things then which have fallen to her lot, thou hast spoken
      unto us aforetime in similitude, saying: 'A man owned a fig-tree
      in his vineyard; and he came to look for its fruit, and he found
      not a single one on it. He said to the vine-dresser: Lo, three
      years do I come to look for fruit on this fig-tree, and I have not
      any produce at all from it. Cut it down then; why doth it make the
      ground also good for nothing? But he answered and said unto him:
      My lord, have patience with it still this year, until I dig round
      it and give it dung; and if it beareth in another year, thou hast
      let it, but if thou dost not find any [fruit] at all, then hast
      thou [to] cut it down.' Lo, my Lord, this is the solution of the
      word."<br>

      who hath received mysteries and hath not done what is worthy of
      them, but he hath turned and hath sinned, thereafter he hath again
      repented and hath been in great repentance, -- is it then lawful
      for my brethren to renew for him the mystery which he hath
      received, or rather give him a mystery out of the lower mysteries,
      -- is it lawful, or not?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>In the case of repentance only higher mysteries than those
        previously received can remit sins.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Amēn, amēn, I say unto
      you: Neither the mystery which he hath received, nor the lower
      hearken unto him, to forgive his sins; but it is the mysteries
      which are higher than those which he hath received, which hearken
      unto him and forgive his sins. Now, therefore, Mary, let thy
      brethren give him the mystery which is higher than that which he
      hath received, and they are to accept his repentance from him and
      forgive his sins, -- the latter indeed, because he hath received
      it once more, and the former, because he hath towered over them
      [the lower mysteries] upward, -- the latter indeed hearkeneth not
      unto him to forgive his sin; but it is the mystery which is higher
      than that which he hath received, that forgiveth his sins. But if
      on the other hand he hath received the three mysteries in the two
      spaces or in the third from within, and he hath turned and
      transgressed, no mystery hearkeneth unto him to help him in his
      repentance, neither the higher nor the lower, save the mystery of
      the First Mystery and the mysteries of the Ineffable, -- it is
      they which hearken unto him and accept his repentance from him."<br>
      <br>
      Mary answered and said: "My Lord, a man who hath received
      mysteries up to two or three in the second or third space, and he
      hath not transgressed, but is still in his faith in uprightness
      and without play-acting, [what will befall him]?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>There is no limit to the number of mysteries the faithful may
        receive.</i><br>
      And the Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Every man who hath
      received mysteries in the second and in the third space, and hath
      not transgressed, but is still in his faith without play-acting,
      it is lawful for such an one to receive mysteries in the space

      they both have come out of the body, -- which of them will get
      more suffering in the judgments?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>The fate of the gnostic who sinneth is more terrible than that

      The Saviour answered again and said unto Mary: "Amēn, amēn, I say
      unto thee: The man who hath known the godhead and hath received
      the mysteries of the Light, and sinned and hath not turned to
      repent, he will get suffering in the chastisements of the

      him much is required,'-- that is, my Lord: He who knew the godhead
      and hath found the mysteries of the Light and hath transgressed,

      neglectful of receiving mysteries, hoping that, if they come into

      "And these know not when the number of the perfect souls will be
      at hand; for if the number of the perfect souls shall be at hand,
      I will now shut the gates of the Light, and no one from this hour
      onwards will enter in, nor will any one hereafter go forth, for
      the number of the perfect souls is completed and the mystery of
      the First Mystery is completed, for the sake of which the universe
      hath arisen,--that is: I am that Mystery.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the time of the completion.</i><br>
      "And from this hour onwards no one will be able to enter into the

      the world, in order that it may purify the æons and the veils and

      are on it, mankind will be still existing.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Those who procrastinate are excluded from the Light.</i><br>
      "At that time then the faith will reveal itself still more and the

      circuits of the changes of the body, and coming back into the
      world are some of those in this present time who have hearkened
      unto me, how I taught, who at the completion of the number of the
      perfect souls will find the mysteries of the Light and receive
      them and come to the gates of the Light and find that the number
      of the perfect souls is complete, which is the completion of the
      First Mystery and the gnosis of the universe. And they will find
      that I have shut the gates of the Light and that it is impossible
      that any one should enter in or that any one should go forth from
      this hour.<br>

      whence ye are. And they will say unto me: We have received of thy
      mysteries and fulfilled thy whole teaching and thou hast taught us

      not, who ye are, ye who are doers of iniquity and of evil even

      they will go into the outer darkness, there where is howling and

      blasphemers and of those who are in the doctrines of error and of
      all who teach doctrines of error, and of those who have

      and that man is an impious [one] who hath committed all sins and
      is deserving of the outer darkness, and he hath not repented, or
      he hath completed his number of circuits in the changes of the
      body, and that man hath done nothing useful, and he hath come out
      of. the body, and we have known certainly of him, that he hath
      sinned&nbsp; and is deserving of the outer darkness, -- what are
      we to do with him, to save him from the chastisements of the
      dragon of the outer darkness, and that he may be removed into a
      righteous body which shall find the mysteries of the
      Light-kingdom, in order that it may be good and go on high and
      inherit the Light-kingdom?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>How to save the souls of sinners.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "If a sinner is deserving
      of the outer darkness, or hath sinned according to the
      chastisements of the rest of the chastisements and hath not
      repented, or a sinning man who hath completed his number of
      circuits in the changes of the body and hath not repented, -- if
      then these men of whom I have spoken, shall come out of the body
      and be led into the outer darkness, now, therefore, if ye desire
      to remove them out of the chastisements of the outer darkness and
      all the judgments and to remove them into a righteous body which
      shall find the mysteries of the Light, that it may go on high and
      inherit the Light-kingdom,--then perform this same mystery of the
      Ineffable which forgiveth sins at every time, and when ye have
      finished performing the mystery then say:<br>
      <br>
      <i>A summary of the formulæ.</i><br>
      "The soul of such or such a man of whom I think in my heart, --if
      it is in the region of the chastisements of the dungeons of the
      outer darkness, or if it is in the rest of the chastisements of
      the dungeons of the outer darkness and in the rest of the
      chastisements of the dragons, -- then is it to be removed out of
      them all. And if it hath completed its number of its circuits of
      the changes, then is it to be led before the Virgin of Light, and
      the Virgin of Light is to seal it with the seal of the Ineffable
      and cast it down in whatever month into a righteous body which
      shall find the mysteries of the Light, so that it may be good, go
      on high and inherit the Light-kingdom. And moreover if it hath
      completed the circuits of changes, then is that soul to be led
      before the seven virgins of the Light who [are set] over the
      baptisms, and they are to apply them to the soul and seal it with
      the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable and lead it into the
      orders of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "This then will ye say when ye perform the mystery.<br>
      <br>
      "Amēn, I say unto you: The soul for which ye shall pray, if it
      indeed is in the dragon of the outer darkness, he will draw his
      tail out of his mouth and let go that soul. And moreover if it is
      in all the regions of the judgments of the rulers, amēn, I say
      unto you: The receivers of Melchisedec will with haste snatch it
      away, whether the dragon let it go or it is in the judgments of
      the rulers; in a word, the receivers of Melchisedec&nbsp; will
      snatch it away out of all the regions in which it is, and will
      lead it into the region of the Midst before the Virgin of Light,
      and the Virgin of Light proveth it and seeth the sign of the
      kingdom of the Ineffable which is on that soul.<br>
      <br>
      "And if it hath not yet completed its number of circuits in the
      changes of the soul, or [in the changes] of the body, the Virgin
      of Light sealeth it with an excellent seal and hasteth to have it
      cast down in any month into a righteous body which shall find the
      mysteries of the Light, be good and go on high into the
      Light-kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      "And if that soul hath had its number of the circuits, then the
      Virgin of Light proveth it, and doth not have it chastized,
      because it hath had its number of circuits, but handeth it over to
      the seven virgins of the Light. And the seven virgins of the Light
      prove that soul, baptize it with their baptisms and give it the
      spiritual chrism and lead it into the Treasury of the Light and
      put it in the last order of the Light until the ascension of all
      the perfect souls. And when they prepare to draw apart the veils
      of the region of those of the Right, they cleanse that soul anew
      and purify it and put it in the orders of the first saviour who
      [is] in the Treasury of the Light."<br>

      It came to pass then, when the Saviour had finished speaking these
      words unto his disciples, that Mary answered and said unto Jesus:
      "My Lord, I have heard thee say: 'He who shall receive of the
      mysteries of the Ineffable or who shall receive of the mysteries
      of the First Mystery,--they become flames of light-beams and
      light-streams and penetrate all the regions until they reach the
      region of their inheritance.'"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the light beams and light-streams.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "If they receive the
      mystery when still in life, and if they come out of the body, they
      become light-beams and light-streams and penetrate all the regions
      until they reach the region of their inheritance.<br>
      <br>
      "But if they are sinners and are come out of the body and have not
      repented, and if ye perform for them the mystery of the Ineffable,
      in order that they may be removed out of all the chastisements and
      be cast into a righteous body, which is good and inheriteth the
      Light-kingdom or is brought into the last order of the Light, then
      they will not be able to penetrate the regions, because they do
      not perform the mystery [themselves]. But the receivers of
      Melchisedec follow them and lead them before the Virgin of Light.
      And the servitors of the judges of the rulers make frequent haste
      to take those souls and hand them over from one to the other until
      they lead them before the Virgin of Light."<br>

      <br>
      <i>Mary pleadeth for those who have neglected the mysteries.</i><br>
      And Mary continued and said unto the Saviour: "My Lord, if a man
      hath received the mysteries of the Light which [are] in the first
      space from without, and when the time of the mysteries up to which
      they reach, is completed, and if that man continueth anew to
      receive mysteries of the mysteries which [are] within the
      mysteries which he hath already received, and moreover that man
      hath become negligent, not having prayed in the prayer which
      taketh away the evil of the victuals which he eateth and drinketh,
      and through the evil of the victuals he is bound to the axle of
      the Fate of the rulers and through the necessity of the elements
      he hath sinned anew after the completion of the time up to which
      the mystery reacheth,--because he hath become negligent and hath
      not prayed in the prayer which taketh away the evil of the souls
      and purifieth them,--and that man is come out of the body before
      he hath repented anew and anew received the mysteries of the
      mysteries which [are] within the mysteries which he hath already
      received,--those which accept repentance from him and forgive his
      sins,--and when he I came forth out of the body and we knew with
      certainty that they have carried him into the midst of the dragon
      of the outer darkness because of the sins which he committed, and
      that that man hath no helper in the world nor any one
      compassionate, that he should perform the mystery of the Ineffable
      until he should be removed out of the midst of the dragon of the
      outer darkness and led into the Light-kingdom,--now, therefore, my
      Lord, what will befall him until he save himself from the
      chastisements of the dragon of the outer darkness? By no means, O
      Lord, abandon him, because he hath endured sufferings in the
      persecutions and in the whole godhood in which he is.<br>
      <br>
      "Now, therefore, O Saviour, have mercy with me, lest one of our
      kinsmen should be in such a type, and have mercy with all the
      souls which shall be in this type; for thou art the key which
      openeth the door of the universe and shutteth the door of the
      universe, and thy mystery comprehendeth them all. Have then mercy,
      O Lord, with such souls. For they have called on the name of thy
      mysteries, [were it but] for one single day, and have truly had
      faith in them and were not in play-acting. Give them then, O Lord,
      a gift in thy goodness and give them rest in thy mercy."<br>
      <br>
      When then Mary had said this, the Saviour called her most
      exceedingly blessed because of the words which she had spoken. And
      the Saviour was in great compassion and said unto Mary: "Unto all
      men who shall be in this type of which thou hast spoken, unto them
      while they [are] still in life, give ye the mystery of one of the
      twelve names of the dungeons of the dragon of the outer
      darkness,--those which I will give you when I have ended
      explaining unto you the universe from within without and from
      without within.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the efficacy of the names of the twelve angels.</i><br>
      "And all men who shall find the mystery of one of the twelve names
      of that dragon of the outer darkness, and all men even if they are
      very great sinners, and they have first received the mysteries of
      the Light and thereafter have transgressed, or they have performed
      no mystery at all, then if they have completed their circuits in
      the changes, and if such men go forth out of the body without
      having repented anew, and if they are led into the chastisements
      which [are] in the midst of the dragon of the outer darkness, and
      remain in the circuits and remain in the chastisements in the
      midst of the dragon,--these, if they know the mystery of one of
      the twelve names of the angels while they are in life and are in
      the world, and if they speak one of their names while they are in
      the midst of the chastisements of the dragon,--then, at the hour
      when they shall speak it, the whole dragon will be tossed about
      and most exceedingly convulsed, and the door of the dungeon in
      which the souls of those men are, openeth itself upward, and the
      ruler of the dungeon in which those men are, casteth the souls of
      those men out of the midst of the dragon of the outer darkness,
      because they have found the mystery of the name of the dragon.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The souls who know the names escape and are taken to Yew.</i><br>
      "And when the ruler casteth out souls, straight-way the angels of
      Yew, the First Man, who watch the dungeons of that region, hasten
      to snatch away those souls to lead them before Yew, the First Man,
      the Envoy of the First Commandment. And Yew, the First Man, seeth
      the souls and proveth them; he findeth that they have completed
      their circuits and that it is not lawful to bring them anew into
      the world, for it is not lawful to bring anew into the world all
      souls which are cast into the outer darkness. [But] if they have
      not yet completed their number of circuits in the changes of the
      body, the receivers of Yew keep them with them until they perform
      for them the mystery of the Ineffable, and remove them into a good
      body which shall find the mysteries of the Light and inherit the
      Light-kingdom.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of their subsequent fate.</i><br>
      "But if Yew proveth them and findeth that they have completed
      their circuits and that it is not lawful to [re]turn them anew to
      the world, and that also the sign of the Ineffable is not with
      them, then Yew hath compassion upon them and leadeth them before
      the seven virgins of the Light. They baptize them with their
      baptisms, but they do not give them the spiritual chrism. And they
      lead them into the Treasury of the Light, but they do not put them
      in the orders of the Inheritance, because no sign and no seal of
      the Ineffable is with them. But they save them from all
      chastisements and put them into the light of the Treasury,
      separated and apart by themselves alone until the ascension of the
      universe. And at the time when they will draw apart the veils of
      the Treasury of the Light, they cleanse those souls anew and
      purify them most exceedingly and give them anew mysteries and put
      them in the last order which [is] in the Treasury, and those souls
      will be saved from all the chastisements of the judgments."<br>
      <br>
      And when the Saviour had said this, he said unto his disciples:
      "Have ye understood in what manner I discourse with you?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary interpreteth the same from a former saying.</i><br>
      Mary then answered and said "My Lord, this is the word which thou
      hast spoken unto us aforetime, in a similitude, saying: 'Make to
      yourselves a friend out of the Mamōn of unrighteousness, so that
      if ye remain behind, he may receive you into I the everlasting
      tents.' Who then is the Mamōn of unrighteousness, if not the
      dragon of the outer darkness? This is the word: He who shall
      understand the mystery of one of the names of the dragon of the
      outer darkness, if he remaineth behind in the outer darkness or if
      he hath completed the circuits of the changes, and speaketh the
      name of the dragon, he will be saved and go up out of the darkness
      and be received into the Treasury of the Light. This is the word,
      my Lord."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the cup of forgetfulness.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered again and said unto Mary: "Well said,
      spiritual and pure [one]. This is the solution of the word."<br>
      <br>

      <div align="center"><b><big>CHAPTER 131</big></b><br>

      <br>
      Mary continued again and said: "My Lord, doth the dragon of the
      outer darkness come into this world or doth he not come?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the light of the sun and the darkness of the dragon.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "When the light of the
      sun is outside [? above the world], he covereth the darkness of
      the dragon; but if the sun is below the world, then the darkness
      of the dragon abideth as veiling of the sun and the breath of the
      darkness cometh into the world in form of a smoke in the night,--
      that is, if the sun withdraweth into himself his rays, then indeed
      the world is not able to endure the darkness of the dragon in its
      true form; otherwise would it be dissolved and go to ruin withal."<br>
      <br>
      When the Saviour had said this, Mary continued again and said unto
      the Saviour: "My Lord, still do I question thee and hide [it] not
      from me. Now, therefore, my Lord, who compelleth then the man
      until he sinneth?"<br>
      <br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "It is the rulers of the
      Fate who compel the man until he sinneth."<br>
      <br>
      Mary answered and said unto the Saviour: "My Lord, surely the
      rulers do not come down to the world and compel the man until he
      sinneth?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the cup of forgetfulness.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "They do not come down in
      this manner into the world. But the rulers of the Fate, when an
      old soul is about to come down through them, then the rulers of
      that great Fate who [are] in the regions of the head of the æons,
      -- which is that region which is called the region of the kingdom
      of Adamas, and which is that region which is in face of the Virgin
      of Light,--then the rulers of the region of that head give the old
      soul a cup of forgetfulness out of the seed of wickedness, filled
      with all the different desires and all forgetfulness. And
      straightway, when that soul shall drink out of the cup, it
      forgetteth all the regions to which it hath gone, and all the
      chastisements in which it hath travelled. AndOf the counterfeiting
      spirit. that cup of the water of forgetfulness becometh body
      outside the soul, and it resembleth the soul in all [its] figures
      and maketh [itself] like it, -- which is what is called the
      counterfeiting spirit.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the fashioning of a new soul.</i><br>
      "If on the other hand it is a new soul which they have taken out
      of the sweat of the rulers and out of the tears of their eyes, or
      far rather out of the breath of their mouths, -- in a word, if it
      is one of the new souls or one of such souls, if it is one out of
      the sweat, then the five great rulers of the great Fate take up
      the sweat of all the rulers of their æons, knead it together
      withal, portion it and make it into a soul. Or far rather if it is
      refuse of the purification of the Light, then Melchisedec taketh
      it up from the rulers. The five great rulers of the great Fate
      knead the refuse together, portion it and make it into different
      souls, so that every one of the rulers of the æons, every one of
      them putteth his portion into the soul. For this cause they knead
      it jointly, so that all may [par]take of the soul.<br>
      <br>
      "And the five great rulers, if they portion it and make it into
      souls, bring it out of the sweat of the rulers. But if it is one
      out of the refuse of the purification of the Light, then
      Melchisedec, the great Receiver of the Light, taketh it [sc. the
      refuse] up from the rulers, or far rather if it is out of the
      tears of their eyes or out of the breath of their mouth, -- in a
      word, out of such souls, when the five rulers portion it and make
      it into different souls, -- or far rather if it is an old soul,
      then the ruler who is in the head of the æons, himself mixeth the
      cup of forgetfulness with the seed of wickedness, and he mixeth it
      with every one of the new souls at the time when he is in the
      region of the head. And that cup of forgetfulness becometh the
      counterfeiting spirit for that soul, and bideth outside the soul,
      being a vesture for it and resembling it in every way, being
      envelope as vesture outside it.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the in-breathing of the power.</i><br>
      "And the five great rulers of the great Fate of the æons and the
      ruler of the disk of the sun and the ruler of the disk of the moon
      inbreathe within into that soul, and there cometh forth out of
      them a portion out of my power which the last Helper hath cast
      into the Mixture. And the portion of that power remaineth within
      in the soul, unloosed and existing on its own authority for the
      economy unto which it hath been inset, to give sense unto the
      soul, in order that it may seek after the works of the Light of
      the Height always.<br>
      <br>
      "And that power is like the species of the soul in every form and
      resembleth it. It cannot be outside the soul, but remaineth inside
      it, as I have commanded it from the beginning. When I willed to
      cast it into the first Commandment, I gave it commandment to
      remain outside [? inside] the souls for the economy of the First
      Mystery.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus promiseth to reveal all in detail.</i><br>
      "And so I will tell you at the expansion of the universe all these
      words concerning the power and also concerning the soul, after
      what type they are fashioned, or what ruler fashioneth them, or
      what are the different species of the souls. And so will I tell
      you at the expansion of the universe how many fashion the soul.
      And I will tell you the name of all of them who fashion the soul.
      And I will tell you the type, how the counterfeiting spirit and

      And I will tell you the name of all the decans who fashion the
      soul in the bodies of the soul in the world; and I will tell you
      in what manner the souls are fashioned. And I will tell you the

      the souls of the men and of those of the birds and of those of the
      wild beasts and of those of the reptiles. And. I will tell you the
      type of all the souls and of those of all the rulers which are
      sent into the world, in order that ye may be completed in all
      gnosis. All this will I tell you at the expansion of the universe.
      And after all this I will tell you wherefor all this hath come to
      pass.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the light-power and the counterfeiting spirit.</i><br>
      "Hearken, therefore, that I may discourse with you concerning the
      soul according as I have said: The five great rulers of the great
      Fate of the æons and the rulers of the disk of the sun and the
      rulers of the disk of the moon breathe into that soul, and there
      cometh out of them a portion of my power, as I have just said. And
      the portion of that power remaineth within the soul, so that the
      soul can stand. And they put&nbsp; the counterfeiting spirit
      outside the soul, watching it and assigned to it; and the rulers
      bind it to the soul with their seals and their bonds and seal it
      to it, that it may compel it always, so that it continually doeth
      its mischiefs and all its iniquities, in order that it may be
      their slave always and remain under their sway always in the
      changes of the body; and they seal it to it that it may be in all
      the sin and all the desires of the world.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The parents we are to abandon.</i><br>
      "For this cause, therefore, have I in this manner brought the
      mysteries into this world which undo all the bonds of the
      counterfeiting spirit and all the seals which are bound to the
      soul,-- those which make the soul free and free it from its
      parents the rulers, and make it into refined light and lead it up
      into the kingdom of its father, the first Issue, the First
      Mystery, for ever.<br>
      <br>
      "For this cause therefore, have I said unto you aforetime: 'He who
      doth not abandon father and mother and come and follow after me,
      is not worthy of me.' I have, therefore, said at that time: Ye are
      to abandon your parents the rulers, that I may make you sons of

      It came to pass then, when the Saviour had heard Mary say these
      words, that he called her most exceedingly blessed. The Saviour
      answered and said unto Mary: "I give commandment unto thee, Mary,
      that thou speak the solution of the word which Salome hath
      spoken."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Mary removeth the doubt of Salome.</i><br>
      And when the Saviour had said this, Mary started forward to
      Salome, embraced her and said unto her: "My sister Salome,
      concerning the word which thou hast spoken: It standeth written in
      the Law of Moses: 'He who shall abandon his father and his mother,
      let him die the death,' -- now, therefore, my sister Salome, the
      Law hath not said this concerning the soul nor concerning the body
      nor concerning the counterfeiting spirit, for all these are sons
      of the rulers and are out of them. But the Law hath said this
      concerning the power which hath came forth out of the Saviour, and
      which is the light-man within us to-day. The Law hath moreover
      said: Every one who shall remain without the Saviour and all his
      mysteries, his parents, will not only die the death but go to ruin
      in destruction."<br>
      <br>
      When then Mary had said this, Salome started forward to Mary and
      embraced her anew. Salome said: "The Saviour hath power to make me
      understanding like thyself."<br>
      <br>
      It came to pass, when the Saviour had heard the words of Mary,
      that he called her most exceedingly blessed. The Saviour answered
      and said unto Mary in the midst of his disciples: "Hearken,
      therefore, Mary, who it is who compelleth the man until he
      sinneth.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the charge given to the counterfeiting spirit.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, the rulers seal the counterfeiting spirit to the
      soul, [but] so that it doth not agitate it every hour, making it
      do all sins and all iniquities. And they give commandment moreover
      unto the counterfeiting spirit, saying: 'If the soul cometh out of
      the body, do not agitate it, being assigned to it and transferring
      it to all the regions of the judgments, region by region, on
      account of all the sins which thou hast made it do, in order that
      it may be chastized in all the regions of the judgments, so that
      it may not be able to go on high to the Light and return into
      changes of the body.'<br>
      <br>
      "In a word, they give commandment to the counterfeiting spirit,
      saying: 'Do not agitate it at all at any hour unless it doth not
      speak mysteries and undo all the seals and all the bonds with
      which we have bound thee to it. [But] if it sayeth the mysteries
      and undoeth all the seals and all the bonds and [sayeth] the
      apology of the region, and if it cometh, then let it go forth, for
      it belongeth to those of the Light of the Height and hath become a
      stranger unto us and unto thee, and thou wilt not be able to seize
      it from this hour onwards. If on the contrary it sayeth not the
      mysteries of the undoing of thy bonds and of thy seals and of the
      apologies of the region, then seize it and let it not out; thou
      shalt transfer it to the chastisements and all the regions of the
      judgments on account of all the sins which thou hast made it do.
      After this lead [such souls] before the Virgin of Light, who
      sendeth them once more into the circuit.'<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the charge given to the servitors.</i><br>
      "The rulers of the great Fate of the æons hand these over to the
      counterfeiting spirit; and the rulers summon the servitors of
      their æons, to the number of three-hundred-and-sixty-and-five, and
      give them the soul and the counterfeiting spirit, which are bound
      to one another. The counterfeiting spirit is the without of the
      soul, and the compound of the power is the within of the soul,
      being within both of them, in order that they may be able to
      stand, for&nbsp; it is the power which keepeth the two up-right.
      And the rulers give commandment to the servitors, saying unto
      them: This is the type which ye are to put into the body of the
      matter of the world.' They say unto them indeed: 'Put the compound
      of the power, the within of the soul, within them all, that they
      may be able to stand, for it is their up-rightness, and after the
      soul put the counterfeiting spirit.'<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of conception.</i><br>
      "Thus they give commandment to their servitors, that they may
      deposit it into the bodies of the antitype. And following this
      fashion the servitors of the rulers bring the power and the soul
      and the counterfeiting spirit, bring them down to the world, and
      pour [them] out into the world of the rulers of the midst. The
      rulers of the midst look after the counterfeiting spirit; and also
      the destiny, whose name is Moira, leadeth the man until it hath
      him slain through the death appointed unto him, which the rulers
      of the great Fate have bound to the soul. And the servitors of the
      sphere bind the soul and the power and the counterfeiting spirit
      and the destiny. And they portion them all and make them into two
      portions and seek after the man and also after the woman in the
      world to whom they have given signs, in order that they may send
      them into them. And they give one portion to the man and one
      portion to the woman in a victual of the world or in a breath of
      the air or in water or in a kind which they drink.<br>
      <br>
      "All this I will tell unto you and the species of every soul and
      the type, how they enter into the bodies, whether of men or of
      birds or of cattle or of wild beasts or of reptiles or of all the
      other species in the world. I will tell you their type, in what
      type they enter into men; I will tell it you at the expansion of
      the universe.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the compulsion of the parents.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, when the servitors of the rulers cast the one
      portion into the woman and the other into the man in the fashion
      which I have told you, then the servitors secretly compel them,
      even if they are removed at very great distance from one another,
      so that they concert to be in a concert of the world. And the
      counterfeiting spirit which is in the man, cometh to the portion
      which is entrusted to the world in the matter of his body, and
      lifteth it and casteth it down into the womb of the woman [into
      the portion] which is entrusted to the seed of wickedness.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the process of gestation.</i><br>
      "And in that hour the three-hundred-and-sixty-and-five servitors
      of the rulers go into her womb and take up their abode in it. The
      servitors bring the two portions the one to the other, and
      moreover the servitors withhold&nbsp; the blood of all the food of
      the woman which she will eat and which she will drink, and they
      withhold [it] in the womb of the woman up to forty days. And after
      forty days they knead the blood of the power of all the food and
      knead it well in the woman's womb.<br>
      <br>
      "After forty days they spend another thirty days in building its
      members in the image of the body of the man; each buildeth a
      member. I will tell you the decans who will build it [sc. the
      body]; I will tell them you at the expansion of the universe.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the incarnation of the soul.</i><br>
      "If then after this the servitors shall have completed the whole
      body and all its members in seventy days, after this the servitors
      summon into the body which they have built,--first indeed they
      summon the counterfeiting spirit; thereafter they summon the soul
      within them; and thereafter they summon the compound of the power
      into the soul; and the destiny they put outside them all, as it is
      not blended with them, [but] following them and accompanying them.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the sealing of the plasm.</i><br>
      "And after this the servitors seal them one to the other with all
      the seals which the rulers have given them. [And] they seal the
      day on which they have taken up their abode in the womb of the
      woman,--they seal [it] on the left hand of the plasm; and they
      seal the day on which they have completed the body, on the right
      hand; and they seal the day on which the rulers have handed it
      over to them, on the middle of the skull of the body of the plasm;
      and they seal the day on which the soul hath come forth out of the
      rulers, they seal it on the [left of] the skull of the plasm; and
      they seal the day on which they kneaded the members and separated
      them for a soul, they seal it on the right of the skull of the
      plasm; and the day on which they have bound the counterfeiting
      spirit to it [the soul], they seal on the back of the skull of the
      plasm; and the day on which the rulers have breathed the power
      into the body, they seal on the brain which is in the midst of the
      head of the plasm and also on the inside [? the heart] of the
      plasm; and the number of years which the soul will spend in the
      body, they seal on the forehead which is on the plasm. And so they
      seal all those seals on the plasm. I will tell you the names of
      all these seals at the expansion of the universe; and after the
      expansion of the universe I will tell you wherefor all hath come
      to pass. And, if ye could understand it, I am that mystery.<br>
      <br>
      "Now, therefore, the servitors complete the whole man. And of all
      these seals with which they have sealed the body, the servitors
      carry the whole peculiarity and bring it to all the retributive
      rulers who [are] over all the chastisements of the judgments; and
      these hand it over to their receivers, in order that they may lead
      their souls out of the bodies,--they hand over to them the
      peculiarity of the seals, in order that they may know the time
      when they are to lead the souls out of the bodies, and in order
      that they may know the time when they are to bring to birth the
      body, so that they may send their servitors in order that they may
      draw near and follow the soul and bear witness of all the sins it
      shall do,--they and the counterfeiting spirit,--on account of the
      manner and way, how they shall chastize it in the judgment.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the destiny.</i><br>
      "And when the servitors have given the peculiarity of the seals to
      the retributive rulers, they withdraw themselves to the economy of
      their occupations which is appointed unto them through the rulers
      of the great Fate. And when the number of months of the birth of
      the babe is completed, the babe is born. Small in it is the
      compound of the power, and small in it is the soul; and small in
      it is the counterfeiting spirit. The destiny on the contrary is
      large, as it is not mingled into the body for their economy, but
      followeth the soul and the body and the counterfeiting spirit,
      until the time when the soul shall come forth out of the body, on
      account of the type of death by which it shall slay it [the body]
      according to the death appointed for it by the rulers of the great
      Fate.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of how a man cometh by his death.</i><br>
      "Is he to die by a wild beast, the destiny leadeth the wild beast
      against him until it slay him; or is he to die by a serpent, or is
      he to fall into a pit by mischance, or is he to hang himself, or
      is he to die in water, or through such [kinds of death], or
      through another death which is worse or better than this,-- in a
      word, it is the destiny which forceth his death. upon him. This is
      the occupation of the destiny, and it hath no other occupation but
      this. And the destiny followeth every man until the day of his
      death."<br>

      Mary answered and said: "To all men then who are in the world,
      will all which is appointed them through the Fate, whether good or
      bad or sin or death or life, -- in a word, will all which is
      appointed them through the rulers of the Fate, have to come unto

      <br>
      <i>There is no escape from the destiny.</i><br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "Amēn, I say unto you:

      the Light-kingdom, be he a righteous or a sinner.<br>

      "For this cause, therefore, have I brought the keys of the
      mysteries into the world, that I may free the sinners who shall
      have faith in me and hearken unto me, so that I may free them from
      the bonds and the seals of the æons of the rulers and bind them to
      the seals and the vestures and the orders of the Light, in order
      that he whom I shall free in the world from the bonds and the
      seals of the æons of the rulers, may be freed in the Height from
      the bonds and seals of the æons of the rulers, and in order that
      he whom I shall bind in the world to the seals and the vestures
      and the orders of the Light, may be bound in the Light-land to the
      orders of the inheritances of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "For the sake of sinners, therefore, have I torn myself asunder at
      this time and have brought them the mysteries, that I may free
      them from the æons of the rulers and bind them to the inheritances
      of the Light, and not only the sinners, but also the righteous, in

      into the Light.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The mysteries are for all men.</i><br>
      For this cause, therefore, I have not hidden it, but I have cried
      it aloud clearly. And I have not separated the sinners, but I have
      cried it aloud and said it unto all men, unto sinners and
      righteous, saying: 'Seek that ye may find, knock that it may be
      opened unto you; for every one who seeketh in truth, will find,
      and who knocketh, to him it will be opened.' For I have said unto
      all men: They are to seek the mysteries of the Light-kingdom which
      shall purify them and make them refined and lead them into the

      concerning me, saying: 'I indeed have baptized you with water unto
      repentance for forgiveness of your sins. He who cometh after me,
      is stronger than me. Whose fan is in his hand, and he will purify
      his floor. The chaff indeed he will consume with unquenchable
      fire, but the wheat he will gather into his barn.' The power in
      John hath prophesied concerning me, knowing that I would bring the
      mysteries into the world and purify the sins of the sinners who
      shall have faith in me and hearken unto me, and make them into

      When then Jesus had said this, Mary answered and said: "My Lord,
      if men go to seek and they come upon the doctrines of error, I
      whence then are they to know whether they belong to thee or not?"<br>
      <br>
      The Saviour answered and said unto Mary: "I have said unto you

      north wind cometh, then ye know that there will be cold; if south
      wind cometh, then ye know that there will be burning and fervent
      heat.' Now, therefore, say unto them: 'If ye have known the face
      of the heaven and of the earth from the winds, then know ye
      exactly, if then any come now unto you and proclaim unto you a
      godhead, whether their words have harmonized and fitted with all
      your words which I have spoken unto you through two up to three
      witnesses, and whether they have harmonized in the setting of the
      air and of the heavens and of the circuits and of the stars and of
      the light-givers and of the whole earth and all on it and of all
      waters and all in them.' Say unto them: 'Those who shall come unto
      you, and their words fit and harmonize in the whole gnosis with
      that which I have said unto you, I will receive as belonging unto
      us.' This is what ye shall say unto men, if ye make proclamation
      unto them in order that they may guard themselves from the

      <i>The Books of Yew.</i><br>
      "Now, therefore, for the sake of sinners have I rent myself
      asunder and am come into the world, that I may save them. For even
      for the righteous, who have never done any evil and have not
      sinned at all, it is necessary that they should find the mysteries
      which are in the Books of Yew, which I have made Enoch write in
      Paradise, discoursing with him out of the tree of the Gnosis and
      out of the tree of the Life. And I made him deposit them in the
      rock Ararad, and set the ruler Kalapataurōth, who is over Skemmūt,
      on whose head is the foot of Yew, and who surroundeth all æons and
      Fates,--I set up that ruler as watcher over the Books of Yew on
      account of the flood, and in order that none of the rulers may be
      envious of them and destroy them. These will I give you, when I
      shall have told you the expansion of the universe."<br>

      When then the Saviour had said this, Mary answered and said: "My
      Lord, who now then is the man in the world who hath not sinned at
      all, who is pure of iniquities? For if he is pure of one, he will
      not be able to be pure of another, so that he may find the
      mysteries which are in the Books of Yew? For I say: A man in this

      one, he will not be able to be pure of another."<br>

      accomplishment of the mystery of the First Mystery. This will I
      tell unto you when I have explained to you the expansion of the

      <i>The invocation of Jesus.</i><br>
      At that time Jesus stood with his disciples on the water of the
      Ocean and made invocation with this prayer, saying: "Hear me, my
      Father, father of all fatherhood, boundless Light: aeēiouō iaō aōi
      ōia psinōther thernōps nōpsither zagourē pagourē nethmomaōth
      nepsiomaōth marachachtha thōbarrabau tharnachachan zorokothora
      ieou [= Yew] sabaōth."<br>
      <br>
      <i>The grouping of the disciples.</i><br>
      And while Jesus said this,&nbsp; Thomas, Andrew, James and Simon
      the Cananite were in the west with their faces turned towards the
      east, and Philip and Bartholomew were in the south turned towards
      the north, and the rest of the disciples and the women-disciples
      stood back of Jesus. But Jesus stood at the altar.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The interpretation of iaō.</i><br>
      And Jesus made invocation, turning himself towards the four
      corners of the world with his disciples, who were all clad in
      linen garments, and saying: "iaō iaō iaō." This is its
      interpretation: iōta, because the universe hath gone forth; alpha,
      because it will turn itself back again; ōmega, because the
      completion of all the completeness will take place.<br>
      <br>
      <i>He continueth to make invocation.</i><br>
      And when Jesus had said this, he said: "iaphtha iaphtha mounaēr
      mounaēr ermanouēr ermanouēr." That is: "O father of all fatherhood
      of the boundless [spaces], hear me for the sake of my disciples
      whom I have led before thee, that they may have faith in all the
      words of thy truth, and grant all for which I shall invoke thee;
      for I know the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light."<br>
      <br>
      <i>The apocalypse of the heavens.</i><br>
      Again did Jesus, - that is Aberamenthō, -- make invocation,
      speaking the name of the father of the Treasury of the Light, and
      said: "Let all the mysteries of the rulers and the authorities and
      the angels and the archangels and all powers and all things of the
      invisible god Agrammachamarei and Barbēlō draw near the Leech
      [Bdella] on one side and withdraw to the right."<br>
      <br>
      And in that hour all the heavens went to the west, and all the
      æons and the sphere and their rulers and all their powers flew
      together to the west to the left of the disk of the sun and the
      disk of the moon.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The figures of the disk of the sun and of the moon. </i><i><br>
      </i>And the disk of the sun was a great dragon whose tail was in
      his mouth and who reached to seven powers of the Left and whom
      four powers in the form of white horses drew.<br>
      <br>
      And the base of the moon had the type of a ship which a male and a
      female dragon steered and two white bulls drew. The figure of a
      babe was on the stern of the moon who guided the dragons who
      robbed the light from the rulers. And on its prow was a cat's
      face.<br>
      <br>
      And the whole world and the mountains and the seas fled together
      to the west to the left.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus and the disciples are transported to the ways of the
        midst.</i><br>
      And Jesus and his disciples remained in the midst in an aëry
      region on the ways of the way of the midst, which lieth below the
      sphere. And they came to the first order of the way of the midst.
      And Jesus stood in the air of its region with his disciples.<br>
      <br>
      The disciples of Jesus said unto him: "What is this region in
      which we are?<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the repentant and unrepentant rulers.</i><br>
      Jesus said: "These are the regions of the way of the midst. For it
      came to pass, when the rulers of Adamas mutinied and persistently
      practised congress, procreating rulers, archangels, angels,
      servitors and decans, that Yew, the father of my father, came
      forth from the Right and bound them to a Fate-sphere.<br>
      <br>
      "For there are twelve æons; over six Sabaōth, the Adamas, ruleth,
      and his brother Yabraōth ruleth over the other six. At that time
      then Yabraōth with his rulers had faith in the mysteries of the
      Light and was active in the mysteries of the Light and abandoned
      the mystery of congress. But Sabaōth, the Adamas, and his rulers
      have persisted in the practice of congress.<br>
      <br>
      "And when Yew, the father of my father, saw that Yabraōth had
      faith, he carried him and all the rulers who had had faith with
      him, took him unto himself out of the sphere and led him into a
      purified air in face of the light of the sun between the regions
      of those of the midst and between [?] the regions of the invisible
      god. He posted him there with the rulers who had had faith in him.<br>
      <br>
      "But he carried Sabaōth, the Adamas, and his rulers who had not
      been active in the mysteries of the Light, but have been
      persistently active in the mysteries of congress, and inbound them
      into the sphere.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the hierarchies of the un-repentant rulers and the names of
        their five regents.</i><br>
      "He bound eighteen-hundred rulers in every æon, and set
      three-hundred-and-sixty over them, and he set five other great
      rulers as lords over the three-hundred-and-sixty and over all the
      bound rulers, who in the whole world of mankind are called with
      these names: the first is called Kronos, the second Arēs, the
      third Hermēs, the fourth Aphroditē, the fifth Zeus."<br>

      <br>
      <i>Of the powers which Yew bound into the five regents.</i><br>
      Jesus continued and said: "Hearken then, that I may tell you their
      mystery. It came to pass then, when Yew had thus bound them, that
      he drew forth a power out of the great Invisible and bound it to
      him who is called Kronos. And he drew another power out of
      Ipsantachounchaïnchoucheōch, who is one of the three
      triple-powered gods, and bound it to Arēs. And he drew a power out
      of Chaïnchōōōch, who also is one of the three triple-powered gods,
      and bound it to Hermēs. Again he drew a power out of the Pistis
      the Sophia daughter of Barbēlō and bound it to Aphroditē.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the functions of Zeus, the chief regent.</i><br>
      "And moreover he perceived that they needed a helm to steer the
      world and the æons of the sphere, so that they might not wreck it
      [the world] in their wickedness. He went into the Midst, drew
      forth a power out of the little Sabaōth, the Good, him of the
      Midst, and bound it to Zeus, because he is a good [regent], so
      that he may steer them in his goodness. And he set thus
      established the circling of his order, that he should spend
      thirteen [? three] months in every æon confirming [it], so that he
      may set free all the rulers over whom he cometh, from the evil of
      their wickedness. And he gave him two æons, which are in face of
      those of Hermēs, for his dwelling.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The incorruptible names of the regents.</i><br>
      "I have told you for the first time the names of these five great
      rulers with which the men of the world are wont to call them.
      Hearken now then that I may tell you also their incorruptible
      names, which are: Ōrimouth correspondeth to Kronos;
      Mounichounaphōr correspondeth to Arēs; Tarpetanouph correspondeth

      Jesus and said "Blessed are we beyond all men, because thou hast
      revealed unto us these great wonders."<br>

      <i>Mary questioneth Jesus on the ways of the midst.</i><br>
      And Mary drew nigh unto him, fell down, adored his feet and kissed
      his hands and said: "Yea, my Lord, reveal unto us: What is the use
      of the ways of the midst? For we have heard from thee that they
      are set over great chastisements. How then, my Lord, will we
      remove or escape from them? Or in what way do they seize the
      souls? Or how long a time do they spend in their chastisements?
      Have mercy upon us, our Lord, our Saviour, in order that the
      receivers of the judgments of the ways of the midst may not carry
      off our souls and judge us in their evil judgments, so that we

      and destitute of thee."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the mysteries which Jesus will give unto his disciples.</i><br>
      When then Mary said this weeping, Jesus answered in great
      compassion and said unto them: "Truly, my brethren and beloved,
      who have abandoned father and mother for my name's sake, unto you
      will I give all mysteries and all gnoses.<br>

      "And I will give you the mystery of the baptism of those of the

      thereafter, that the father of my father,-- that is Yew,-- came
      and took of the constitution of the way of the midst. other
      three-hundred-and-sixty rulers from the rulers of Adamas who had
      not had faith in the mystery of the Light, and bound them into
      these aërial regions, in which we are now, below the sphere. He
      established another five great rulers over them,-- that is these
      who are on the way of the midst.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of Paraplēx. </i><br>
      "The first ruler of the way of the midst is called Paraplēx, a
      ruler with a woman's shape, whose hair reacheth down to her feet,
      under whose authority stand five-and-twenty archdemons which rule
      over a multitude of other demons. And it is those demons which
      enter into men and seduce them, raging and cursing and slandering;
      and it is they which carry off hence and in ravishment the souls
      and dispatch them through their dark smoke and their evil
      chastisements."<br>

      Mary said: "I shall behave badly to question thee. Be not wroth

      understand it."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of Yew and Melchisedec.</i><br>
      Jesus,-- that is Aberamenthō,-- said: "Since indeed the father of
      my father,-- that is Yew,-- is the fore-minder of all the rulers,
      gods and powers who have arisen out of the matter of the Light of
      the Treasury, and Zorokothora Melchisedec is the envoy to all the
      lights which are purified in the rulers, leading them into the
      Treasury of the Light,-- these two alone are the great Lights, and
      their ordinance is that they down go to the rulers and purify
      them, and that Zorokothora Melchisedec carrieth away the
      purification of the lights which they have purified in the rulers
      and leadeth them into the Treasury of the Light,-- when the cipher
      and the time of their ordinance cometh, that they go down to the
      rulers and oppress and constrain them, carrying away the
      purification from the rulers.<br>
      <br>
      "But straightway when they shall cease from the oppressing and
      constraining and return to the regions of the Treasury of the
      Light, it cometh to pass that, if they reach the regions of the
      Midst, Zorokothora Melchisedec carrieth off the lights and leadeth
      them unto the gate of those of the Midst and leadeth them into the
      Treasury of the Light, and that Yew withdraweth himself into the
      regions of those of the Right.<br>
      <br>
      <i>How the demon rulers carry off souls.</i><br>
      "Up to the time of the cipher for them to come forth again, the
      rulers mutiny through the wrath of their wickedness, going
      straightway up to the lights, because they [Yew and Melchisedec]
      are not with them at that time, and they carry off the souls which
      they may be able to snatch away in ravishment, and destroy them
      through their dark smoke and their evil fire.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The chastisements of Paraplēx. </i><br>
      "At that time then this authority, with name Paraplēx, along with
      the demons which stand under her, carrieth off the souls of the
      violently passionate, of cursers and of slanderers and dispatcheth
      them through the dark smoke and destroyeth them through her evil
      fire, so that they begin to be undone and dissolved.
      One-hundred-and-thirty-and-three years and nine months do they
      spend in the chastisements of her regions, while she tormenteth
      them in the fire of her wickedness.<br>
      <br>
      "It cometh to pass then after all these times, when the sphere
      turneth itself and the little Sabaōth, Zeus, cometh to the first

      "The souls then which Hekatē beareth hence in ravishment, she

      <i>Jesus encourageth his disciples.</i><br>
      Jesus said unto his disciples: "Be comforted and be not afraid,
      for ye are blessed, because I will make you lords over all these
      and put them in subjection under your feet. Remember that I have
      already said unto you before I was crucified: 'I will give you the
      keys of the kingdom of heaven.' Now, therefore, I say unto you: I
      will give them unto you."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus and his disciples ascend higher. </i><br>
      When then Jesus said this, he chanted a song of praise in the

      and Jesus and his disciples remained in an air of exceedingly
      strong light.<br>

      <i>He breatheth into their eyes.</i><br>
      Jesus said unto his disciples: "Draw near unto me." And they drew
      near unto him. He turned himself towards the four corners of the
      world, said the great name over their heads, blessed them and
      breathed into their eyes.<br>

      Jesus said unto them: "Look up and see what ye may see."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Their eyes are opened.</i><br>
      And they raised their eyes and saw a great, exceedingly mighty
      light, which no man in the world can describe.<br>
      <br>
      He said unto them anew: "Look away out of the light and see what
      ye may see."<br>
      <br>
      They said: "We see fire, water, wine and blood."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus explaineth the vision of fire and water, and wine and
        blood</i>.<br>
      Jesus,-- that is Aberamenthō,-- said unto his disciples: "Amēn, I
      say unto you: I have brought nothing into the world when I came,
      save this fire, this water, this wine and this blood. I have
      brought the water and the fire out of the region of the Light of
      the lights of the Treasury of the Light; and I have brought the
      wine and the blood out of the region of Barbēlō. And after a
      little while my father sent me the holy spirit in the type of a
      dove.<br>
      <br>
      "And the fire, the water and the wine are for the purification of
      all the sins of the world. The blood on the other hand was for a
      sign unto me because of the human body which I received in the
      region of Barbēlō, the great power of the invisible god. The
      breath on the other hand advanceth towards all souls and leadeth
      them unto the region of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      <i>The same explained from former sayings.</i><br>
      "For this cause have I said unto you: 'I am come to cast fire on
      the earth,'-- that is: I am come to purify the sins of the whole
      world with fire.<br>
      <br>
      "And for this cause have I said to the Samaritan woman: 'If thou
      knewest of the gift of God, and who it is who saith unto thee:
      Give me to drink,--thou wouldst ask, and he would give thee living
      water, and there would be in thee a spring which welleth up for
      everlasting life.'<br>
      <br>
      "And for this cause I took also a cup of wine, blessed it and give
      it unto you and said: 'This is the blood of the covenant which
      will be poured out for you for the forgiveness of your sins.'<br>
      <br>
      "And for this cause they have also thrust the spear into my side,
      and there came forth water and blood.<br>
      <br>
      "And these are the mysteries of the Light which forgive sins; that
      is to say, these are the namings and the names of the Light."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Jesus and his disciples descend to earth. </i><br>
      It came to pass then thereafter that Jesus gave command: "Let all
      the powers of the Left go to their regions." And Jesus with his
      disciples remained on the Mount of Galilee. The disciples
      continued and besought him: "For how long then hast thou not let
      our sins which we have committed, and our iniquities be forgiven
      and made us worthy of the kingdom of thy father?<br>
      <br>
      And Jesus said unto them: "Amēn, I say Jesus promiseth to give
      them the mystery of the forgiveness of sins.unto you: Not only
      will I purify your sins, but I will make you worthy of the kingdom
      of my father. And I will give you the mystery of the forgiveness
      of sins, in order that to him whom ye shall forgive on earth, it
      will be forgiven in heaven, and he whom ye shall bind on earth,
      will be bound in heaven. I will give you the mystery of the
      kingdom of heaven, in order that ye your-selves may perform them
      [sc. the mysteries] for men."<br>

      And Jesus said unto them: "Bring me fire and vine branches." They
      brought them unto him. He laid out the offering, and set down two
      wine-vessels, one on the right and the other on the left of the

      deformed body, so that all despise it persistently.<br>

      "This is the chastisement of the arrogant and overweening man."<br>

      <i>Of the chastisement of the blasphemer.</i><br>
      Thomas said: "A persistent blasphemer, what is his chastisement?"<br>
      <br>
      Jesus said: "If the time of such an one is completed through the
      sphere, the receivers of Yaldabaōth come after him and bind him by
      his tongue to a great demon with a horse's face; they spend three
      days travelling round with him in the world, and take vengeance on
      him.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they lead him into the region of the cold and of the
      snow, and take vengeance on him there eleven years.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they lead him down into the chaos before Yaldabaōth
      and his forty-and-nine demons, and every one of his demons taketh
      vengeance on him another eleven years.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they lead him into the outer darkness until the day
      when the great ruler with the dragon's face who encircleth the
      darkness, shall be judged. And that soul becometh frozen up [?]
      and destroyed and dissolved.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the judgment of the blasphemer."<br>

      <i>Of the chastisement of him who hath intercourse with males.</i><br>
      Bartholomew said: "A man who hath intercourse with a male, what is
      his vengeance?"<br>
      <br>
      Jesus said: "The measure of the man who hath intercourse with
      males and of the man with whom he lieth, is the same as that of
      the blasphemer.<br>
      <br>
      "When then the time is completed through the sphere, the receivers
      of Yaldabaōth come after their soul, and he with his
      forty-and-nine demons taketh vengeance on it eleven years.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they carry it to the fire-rivers and seething
      pitch-seas, which are full of demons with pigs' faces. They eat
      into them and take vengeance on them in the fire-rivers another
      eleven years.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they carry them into the outer darkness until the day
      of judgment when the great darkness is judged; and then they will
      be dissolved and destroyed."<br>
      <br>
      Thomas said: "We have heard that there are some on the earth who
      take the male seed and the female monthly blood, and make it into
      a lentil porridge and eat it, saying: 'We have faith in Esau and
      Jacob.' Is this then seemly or not?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the chastisement of a foul act of sorcery.</i><br>
      Jesus was wroth with the world in that hour and said unto Thomas:
      "Amēn, I say: This sin is more heinous than all sins and
      iniquities. Such men will straightway be taken into the outer
      darkness and not be cast back anew into the sphere, but they shall
      perish, be destroyed in the outer darkness in a region where there
      is neither pity nor light, but howling and grinding of teeth. And
      all the souls which shall be brought into the outer darkness, will
      not be cast back anew, but will be destroyed and dissolved."<br>
      <br>
      John answered [and said]: "A man who hath committed no sin, but
      done good persistently, but hath not found the mysteries to pass
      through the rulers, when he cometh out of the body, what will
      happen unto him?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the after-death state of the righteous man who path not been
        initiated.</i><i><br>
      </i>Jesus said: "If the time of such an one is completed through
      the sphere, the receivers of Bainchōōōch, who is one of the
      triple-powered gods, come after his soul and lead his soul with
      joy and exultation and spend three days circling round with it and
      instructing it concerning the creations of the world with joy and
      exultation.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they lead it down into the Amente and instruct it
      concerning the instruments of chastisement in the Amente; but they
      will not take vengeance on it therewith. But they will only
      instruct it concerning them, and the smoke of the flame of the
      chastisements catcheth it only a little.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they carry it up unto the way of the midst and
      instruct it concerning the chastisements of the ways of the midst,
      the smoke from the flame catching it a little.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter they lead it unto the Virgin of Light, and she judgeth
      it and depositeth it with the little Sabaōth, the Good, him of the
      Midst, until the sphere turneth itself, and Zeus and Aphrodite
      come in face of the Virgin of Light, while Kronos and Arēs come
      behind her.<br>
      <br>
      "At that hour she taketh that righteous soul and handeth it over
      to her receivers, that they may cast it into the peons of the
      sphere. And the servitors of the sphere lead it forth into a water
      which is below the sphere; and a seething fire ariseth and eateth
      into it until it purifieth it utterly.<br>
      <br>
      "Thereafter cometh Yaluham, the receiver of Sabaōth, the Adamas,
      who giveth the cup of forgetfulness unto the souls, and he
      bringeth the water of forgetfulness and handeth it to the soul;
      [and it drinketh it] and forgetteth all things and all the regions
      to which it had gone.<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the cup of wisdom.</i><br>
      "Thereafter there cometh a receiver of the little Sabaōth, the
      Good, him of the Midst. He himself bringeth a cup filled with
      thoughts and wisdom, and soberness is in it; [and] he handeth it
      to the soul. And they cast it into a body which can neither sleep
      nor forget because of the cup of soberness which hath been handed
      unto it; but it will whip its heart persistently to question about
      the mysteries of the Light until it find them, through the
      decision of the Virgin of Light, and inherit the Light for ever."<br>

      Mary said: "A man who hath committed all sins and all iniquities
      and hath not found the mysteries of the Light, will he receive the
      chastisements for them all at once?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>A sinner suffereth for each separate sin.</i><br>
      Jesus answered: "Yea, he will receive it; if he hath committed
      three sins, he will receive chastisement for three."<br>
      <br>
      John said: "A man who hath committed all sins and all iniquities,
      but at last hath found the mysteries of the Light, is it possible
      for him to be saved?"<br>
      <br>
      <i>Even the greatest of sinners, if he repent, shall inherit the
        kingdom.</i><br>
      Jesus said: "Such a man who hath committed all sins and all
      iniquities, and he findeth the mysteries of the Light, and
      performeth and fulfilleth them and ceaseth not nor doeth sins,
      will inherit the Treasury of the Light."<br>
      <br>
      <i>Of the time favourable for the birth of those who shall find
        the mysteries.</i><br>
      Jesus said unto his disciples: "When the sphere turneth itself,
      and Kronos and Arēs come behind the Virgin of Light and Zeus and
      Aphrodite come in face of the Virgin, they being in their own
      æons, then the veils of the Virgin draw themselves aside and she
      falleth into joy in that hour when she seeth these two light-stars
      before her. And all the souls which she shall cast at that hour
      into the circuit of the æons of the sphere, that they may come
      into the world, will be righteous and good and find at this time
      the mysteries of the Light; she sendeth them anew that they may
      find the mysteries of the Light.<br>
      <br>
      "If on the other hand Arēs and Kronos come in face of the Virgin
      and Zeus and Aphroditē behind her, so that she seeth them not,
      then all the souls which she shall cast in that hour into the
      creatures of the sphere, will be wicked and wrathful and do not
      find the mysteries of the Light."<br>
      <br>
      <i>The disciples beseech Jesus to have mercy upon them.</i><br>
      When then Jesus said this unto his disciples in the midst of the
      Amente, the disciples cried and wept, [saying]: "Woe, woe unto
      sinners, on whom the negligence and the forgetfulness of the
      rulers lie until they come out of the body and are led to these
      chastisements! Have mercy upon us, have mercy upon us, son of the
      Holy [One], and have compassion with us, that we may be saved from
      these chastisements and these judgments which are prepared for the
      sinners; for we also have sinned, our Lord and our Light."<br>

      the Christ inworking with them through the words of confirmation
      and the signs&nbsp; and the wonders which followed them. And thus
