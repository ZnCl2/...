      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Discussion of the Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] A litany of human diseases and other ailments are
      characterized by neuromuscular degeneration and muscle weakness.
      The term “neuromuscular disease” refers to disorders that
      adversely affect muscle function and/or the control thereof by the
      central nervous system (CNS). In general, neuromuscular diseases
      encompass a wide range of physical ailments characterized by
      impaired muscle function. The following (non-limiting) list of
      conditions is generally recognized as neuromuscular diseases or
      conditions: multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid
      arthritis, fibromyalgia, myopathy, inflammatory bowel disease
      (IBD), incontinence, inflexibility, impaired fine motor skills,
      and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS” or Lou Gehrig's disease).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] A stroke, formerly known as a cerebrovascular accident
      (CVA), often results in severe neurological impairment.
      Post-stroke, many individuals suffer one or more neurological
      impairments including, but not limited to: loss of fine motor
      control, paralysis, speech impairment/loss (aphasia and/or
      dysarthria), altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision, ptosis,
      ocular and facial muscle weakness, diminished reflexes, loss of
      balance, altered heart rate, apraxia, loss of memory, and/or
      confusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Numerous therapeutic methodologies are presently available
      for the treatment of neurological conditions such as the ones
      listed above. Efficacious treatments have proven elusive, however,
      and existing drugs with the most promise often exhibit the most
      undesirable side effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Two of the most prominent diseases associated with impaired
      neurological function are MD, MS and RA. These diseases and
      currently available treatments therefore, are discussed in greater
      detail herein below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Muscular Dystrophy</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The term Muscular Dystrophy (MD) actually refers to a group
      of diseases characterized by muscle weakness and/or impaired
      muscle function. The specific diseases include, but are not
      limited to Becker, Duchenne, and Emery-Dreifuss. Over 100
      diseases, however, display symptoms similar to MD. All are
      characterized by reduced muscle function and muscle weakness.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] No cure exists for MD and many of the related pathologies.
      Physical and occupational therapy may help those afflicted with MD
      manage life with the disease, but neither therapy ameliorates or
      reverses the disease's underlying causes or symptoms. Antisense
      oligonucleotides have shown promise as a treatment, but are costly
      and difficult to obtain for many MD patients. As a result, a
      significant need exists for a cost-effective, widely available
      treatment for MD (and related pathologies).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Multiple Sclerosis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease diagnosed
      in 350,000-500,000 people in the United States. The disease is
      characterized by multiple areas of inflammation and scarring of
      the myelin in the brain and spinal cord. Patients inflicted with
      the disease exhibit varying degrees of neurological impairment
      depending on the location and extent of the myelin scarring.
      Typical MS symptoms include fatigue, weakness, spasticity, balance
      problems, bladder and bowel problems, numbness, loss of vision,
      tremors, and depression. Available treatments of MS generally only
      alleviate symptoms or delay the progression of the disability.
      Recently developed treatments for MS (including stem cell
      implantation and gene therapy) appear to be only conservatory.
      Consequently, improved approaches for the treatment of MS are
      needed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Rheumatoid Arthritis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0012] Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is another troublesome disorder
      associated with inflammation. It is signified by chronic
      inflammation in the membrane lining (the synovium) of the joints
      and/or other internal organs. These inflammatory cells can also
      damage bone and cartilage. For example, a joint inflicted with RA
      may lose its shape and alignment, which can result in the loss of
      range of motion. RA is characterized by pain, stiffness, warmth,
      redness and swelling in the joint, and other systemic symptoms
      like fever, fatigue, and anemia. RA currently affects roughly 1%
      of the entire U.S. population (approximately 2.2 million people).
      The pathology of RA is not fully understood, although it has been
      hypothesized to result from a cascade of aberrant immunological
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In many cases, conventional treatments for RA have proven
      inefficient. For example, RA responds only partially to
      symptomatic medications such as corticosteroids and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medications have been
      around since the 1950's, and possess a significant risk of
      contraindications. Moreover, the therapeutic effects of
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as Methotrexate (MTX) are
      frequently inconsistent and only temporary. The latest class of
      “biologic” DMARDs (including ENBREL®, REMICADE®, HUMIRA®, and
      KINERET®) have shown promising treatment results, but significant
      concerns exist regarding their long term safety profile. For
      example, studies have shown an association between the use of both
      ENBREL® or REMICADE® and the development of lymphoma. Other
      reports have demonstrated that patients treated with either drug
      exacerbate their congestive heart failure and develop serious
      infection and sepsis, and aggravate symptoms of MS and other
      central nervous system problems. As with MS, a need exists for
      more effective treatments of RA.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lyme Disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0014] Lyme disease is a bacterial infection (borrelia
      burgdorferi) spread by ticks. The number of reported cases of Lyme
      disease, and the number of geographical areas in which it is
      found, has been increasing. In addition to causing arthritis, lyme
      disease can also cause heart, brain, and nerve problems. Early
      symptoms include skin-rash, flu-like symptoms (.e.g. chills,
      fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, muscle
      aches/pains, and joint pain). More advanced symptoms include nerve
      problems and arthritis. Currently, there is no available vaccine
      on the market in the US for lyme disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Lyme Disease Co-Infection</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0015] Often, ticks can become infected with multiple
      disease-causing microbes, resulting in co-infection. This may be a
      potential problem for humans, due to Borrelia burgdorferi, and
      other harmful pathogens carried and transmitted by some ticks.
      Possible co-infections with viruses such as lyme borreliosis,
      anaplasmosis, babesiosis, or encephalitis may occur. It is not
      known how co-infection may affect disease transmission and
      progression, but may help in diagnosing and treating lyme and
      other such diseases. Currently, there is no reliable and regular
      treatment for lyme disease co-infection.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Gastroparesis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] Gastroparesis is a condition characterizes by the inability
      of the stomach to empty its contents, when there is no blockage
      (obstruction). The cause of gastroparesis is not known. There is
      some evidence that it may be caused by a disruption of nerve
      signals to the stomach. The condition is a complication of
      diabetes and of some surgeries. Risk factors associated with
      gastroparesis may include diabetes, gastrectomy (surgery to remove
      part of the stomach), systemic sclerosis, use of medication that
      blocks certain nerve signals (anticholinergic medication).
      Symptoms may include abdominal distention, hypoglycemia (in people
      with diabetes), nausea, premature abdominal fullness after meals,
      weight loss, and vomiting. If gastroparesis is caused by a
      condition that is reversible (e.g. pancreatitis), when the
      condition is resolved, the symptoms will subside. For some
      diabetics, better control of their blood sugar can also improve
      the symptoms. If there is no reversible cause, gastroparesis
      rarely resolves itself and the symptoms often grow more sever with
      time. When accompanied by motility disorders of the muscles of the
      small intestine, gastroparesis is particularly difficult to treat.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>

      obesity, alopecia, burns, stretch marks, scars, Attention Deficit
      Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD),
      and erectile dysfunction. The treatment of the present invention
      comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a compound of
      formula C12H10ClCuN2O4 (e.g., “Formula I”):<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the subject is first diagnosed with one of the disease
      listed above before treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In an alternate embodiment, the present invention is
      further directed to pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement
      compositions for treating post-stroke symptoms, including, but not
      limited to: loss of fine motor control, paralysis, speech
      impairment/loss (aphasia and/or dysarthria), altered smell, taste,
      hearing, or vision, ptosis, ocular and facial muscle weakness,
      diminished reflexes, loss of balance, altered heart rate, apraxia,
      loss of memory, and/or confusion. The treatment of the present
      invention comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a
      compound of formula C12H10ClCuN2O4 (e.g., “Formula I”):<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Advantageously, the present invention is further directed
      to pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement compositions for
      promoting one or more desired health benefits. In a preferred
      embodiment, the compositions of the present invention promote hair
      growth, skin healing, scar removal, nerve growth, muscle growth,
      enhanced athletic performance, reduced post-traumatic healing
      time, post-surgery healing, and/or enhanced libido.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Optionally, the compositions of the present invention are
      used in combination with additional active or inert agents or
      alternative therapies (e.g. other anti-inflammatory agents,
      diluents, and/or excipients). In a preferred embodiment, the
      alternative therapy is ozone therapy. Preferably, use of the
      compositions of the present invention enhances the effectiveness
      of the alternative therapy.<br>
      <br>
      Preparations and Administrations:<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The invention may be used to treat an animal with a disease
      or physical ailment or disorder including, but not limited to, one
      or more of the following: fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis,
      muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, dementia,
      ALS, depression, pain, fatigue, sleeplessness, inflexibility,
      myopathy, lyme disease, lyme disease co-infection, gastroparesis
      (GP), chronic inflammation, incontinence, impaired fine motor
      skills, high cholesterol, low sperm count, obesity, alopecia,
      burns, stretch marks, scars, ADD, ADHD, and/or erectile
      dysfunction, wherein it is preferable that the animal is a mammal
      and more preferable that the mammal is a human.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Formula I is comprised of an anhydrous chlorobis copper I
      complex (nicotinic acid). Preferably, the pharmaceutical
      composition containing an effective amount of Formula I further
      comprises copper ascorbate (esterified Vitamin C), ascorbic acid
      (Vitamin C), and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient
      (carrier). More preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier is an inert diluent.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Frequency of dosage may vary depending on the purity of the
      compound and the particular disease or physical ailment treated.
      However, for treatment of most diseases and physical ailments, a
      dosage regimen of (4) 2.5 mg capsules (for a total of 10 mg/day)
      containing Formula I is preferred. As will be understood by one
      skilled in the art, however, the optimal dosage level for a
      particular subject will vary depending on a plurality of factors
      including the potency and activity of the pharmacologically active
      ingredient (e.g., Formula I), as well as the age, body weight,
      general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of
      administration and rate of excretion, drug combination (if any)
      and the severity of the particular disease or physical ailment
      undergoing therapy. Subject to the above factors, a generally
      effective amount of Formula I is between 1 mg and 20 mg per day.
      More preferably, the effective amount of Formula I is between 5 mg
      and 10 mg per day. Advantageously, the effective amount of Formula
      I is between 7.5 mg to 10 mg per day. Most preferably (subject to
      the factors listed above), the effective amount of Formula I is 10
      mg/per day.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Formula I may also comprise a component of an overall
      pharmaceutical treatment regime for reducing and/or treating a
      disease or physical ailment or other disorder including, but not
      limited to: fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy,
      rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, dementia, ALS, depression,
      pain, fatigue, sleeplessness, inflexibility, myopathy,
      incontinence, impaired fine motor skills, high cholesterol, low
      sperm count, obesity, alopecia, burns, stretch marks, scars, ADD,
      ADHD, and/or erectile dysfunction, the treatment regime
      comprising: administering to a subject at the least the following
      pharmacologically active ingredient(s) within a 24-hour period: a
      compound of Formula I, and optionally a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier, wherein the pharmacologically active
      ingredient(s) is in an amount sufficient to reduce the symptoms of
      the ailment.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Optionally, the pharmaceutical treatment regime including
      Formula I may include (or be combined with) additional
      pharmacologically active ingredients or other complementary
      treatments in order to provide synergistic therapeutic effects.
      For example, Formula I may be administered in combination with
      additional pharmacologically active agents including, but not
      limited to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
      corticosteroids, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
      biologic DMARDs, and/or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. In a
      preferred embodiment, Formula I is administered in combination
      with ozone therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement compositions
      (containing Formula I) of the present invention may take a variety
      of forms specially adapted to the chosen route of administration.
      The compositions may be administered orally, topically,
      parenterally, by inhalation or spray, or by any other conventional
      means. Preferably, the compositions are prepared and administered
      in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic
      pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. In
      one preferred embodiment, the composition is administered
      sublingually. It is further understood that the preferred method
      of administration may be a combination of methods. Oral
      administration in the form of a capsule, pill, elixir, syrup,
      lozenge, troche, or the like is particularly preferred. The
      pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention (containing
      Formula I) are preferably in a form suitable for oral use, for
      example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily
      suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or
      softgel capsules, or syrups or elixirs.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared
      according to any method known in the art for manufacture of
      pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one
      or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening
      agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in
      order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable
      preparations. Tablets may contain the active ingredient in
      admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
      suitable for the manufacture of tablets. Such excipients may
      include, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate,
      sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate;
      granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch,
      or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or
      acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate,
      stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be
      coated by techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the
      gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over
      a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as
      glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard
      gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an
      inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium
      phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the
      active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for
      example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in
      admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous
      suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example
      sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,
      hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate,
      polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; and
      dispersing or wetting agents, which may be a naturally-occurring
      phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of
      ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols—for example,
      heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene
      oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol
      anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The
      aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives,
      for example ethyl, or n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more
      coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more
      sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active
      ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive
      oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid
      paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for
      example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents
      such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added
      to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be
      preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid
      and/or copper ascorbate.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation
      of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the
      active ingredient (Formula I) in admixture with a dispersing or
      wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more preservatives.
      Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are
      exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional
      excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents,
      may also be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in
      the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a
      vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral
      oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable
      emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring gums, for example
      gum acacia or gum tragacanth; naturally-occurring phosphatide, for
      example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived
      from fatty acids and hexitol; anhydrides, for example sorbitan
      monooleate; and condensation products of the said partial esters
      with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan
      monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and
      flavoring agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening
      agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or
      sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a
      preservative, and flavoring or coloring agents. The pharmaceutical
      compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or
      oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according
      to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents
      and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. The
      sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable
      solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable
      diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.
      Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed
      are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride
      solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally
      employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any
      bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- and
      diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use
      in the preparation of injectables.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Alternatively, the compositions can be administered
      parenterally in a sterile medium. Formula I, depending on the
      vehicle and concentration used, can either be suspended or
      dissolved in the vehicle. Advantageously, adjuvants such as local
      anesthetics, preservatives and buffering agents can be dissolved
      in the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] For administration to non-human animals, the composition
      containing Formula I may be added to the animal's feed or drinking
      water. Optionally, one skilled in the art will recognize that
      animal feed and drinking products may be formulated such that the
      animal takes in an effective amount of Formula I via their diet.
      For example, Formula I may constitute a component of a premix
      formulated for addition to the feed or drinking water of an
      animal. Compositions containing Formula I may also be formulated
      as food or drink supplements for humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Preferred embodiments of compositions containing Formula I
      will have desirable pharmacological properties that include, but
      are not limited to, oral bioavailability, low toxicity, and
      desirable in vitro and in vivo half-lives. The half-life of
      Formula I is inversely proportional to the frequency of dosage of
      Formula I.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] It is to be understood that the foregoing describes
      preferred embodiments of the present invention and that
      modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope
      or spirit of the present invention as set forth in the claims.
      Such scope is limited only by the claims below as read in
      connection with the above specification. Many additional
      advantages of applicant's invention will be apparent to those
      skilled in the art from the descriptions, drawings, and the claims
      set forth herein.<br>
      <br>
      Representative Elemental and SEM Analysis<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The following Tables (1-2) illustrate the results of an
      elemental analysis of a composition comprising Formula I. The
      elemental analysis depicts only one preferred embodiment of the
      invention and is no way intended to limit the scope of the

      [0055] As indicated in Tables 1-2, a representative sample of
      Formula I comprises 15.73% copper. Given this data, one can
      calculate the amount of copper in a particular dose of Formula I.
      For example, a 2.5 mg dose (i.e. one capsule) yields 0.39 mg of
      copper. Similarly, a 10 mg dose (the preferred dose) yields 1.57
      mg of copper. As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the
      art, however, the actual percentage of copper present in any given
      sample of Formula I will vary depending on a number of factors
      including, but not limited to, the purity, consistency and source
      of the sample, as well as the synthetic methodology employed to
      obtain the sample.<br>

        acid (21.4 g, 0.12 mol) and 90% aqueous ethanol (2 L) then
        placed in an appropriately sized heating mantle. The resultant

      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] This application relates to pharmaceutical and/or dietary
      supplement compositions comprising copper (I) complexes and the
      methods of preparing such copper (I) complexes. The application
      also encompasses methods of treating mitochondria, neuromuscular,
      and other diseases, and pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement
      compositions and methods of treating other physical ailments and
      disorders, including but not limited to pain, fatigue,
      sleeplessness, loss of fine motor control, speech loss,
      inflexibility, Lyme disease, Lyme disease co-infection,
      gastroparesis (GP), myopathy, chronic inflammation and/or
      incontinence.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Copper (as copper amino acid chelate) plays a role in
      transporting oxygen throughout the body. The production of
      collagen, which determines the integrity of bones, skin,
      cartilage, and tendons, is copper dependent. Copper is also
      crucial for making melanin, which provides color to skin and hair.
      Copper helps keep blood vessels elastic, is needed for the
      formation of elastin, functions as an iron oxidizer, and is needed
      for the proper functioning of vitamin C.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Copper is also an important cofactor for metalloenzymes,
      and is a necessary cofactor for superoxide dismutase (Beem J BIOL
      CHEM 249:7298 (1974)). Copper has been shown to decrease in
      individuals over 70 years of age and to be basically zero in
      cataractous lenses (Swanson BIOCHEM BIPHY RES COMM 45:1488-96
      (1971)). If copper is significantly decreased, superoxide
      dismutase has been shown to have decreased function, thereby
      hampering an important protective lens mechanism (Williams PEDIAT
      RES 1:823 (1977)). For these and many other reasons, copper is
      required for optimal human health.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The two principal oxidation states of copper are +1 and +2
      although some +3 complexes are known. Copper (I) compounds are
      expected to be diamagnetic in nature and are usually colorless,
      except where color results from charge transfer or from the anion.
      The +1 ion has tetrahedral or square planar geometry. In solid
      compounds, copper (I) is often the more stable state at moderate
      temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The copper (II) ion is usually the more stable state in
      aqueous solutions. Compounds of this ion, often called cupric
      compounds, are usually colored. They are affected by Jahn Teller
      distortions and exhibit a wide range of stereochemistries with
      four, five, and six coordination compounds predominating. The +2
      ion often shows distorted tetrahedral geometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Complexes of copper (I) are thought to have a unique
      mechanism of action in promoting aerobic respiration via the
      electron transport chain. By causing the mitochondria in the cells
      to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) more efficiently and
      avoiding the production of lactic acid and ethanol that
      accompanies anaerobic respiration, pharmaceutical preparations and
      dietary supplements with copper (I) may alleviate and treat many
      illness and diseases. Among these diseases are those involving
      neuromuscular degeneration and muscle weakness. Accordingly, there
      is a need to develop novel copper (I) compounds that may stimulate
      ATP production in the mitochondria.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0008] The objective of the present invention is to provide
      pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement compositions and methods
      of making and using the same to treat and reduce many of the
      symptoms of several diseases. The compositions contain an active
      pharmacological ingredient comprised of a copper (I) complex. The
      pharmacologically active ingredient may be administered alone or
      in combination with additional active or inert agents or therapies
      (e.g. other anti-inflammatory agents, diluents, and/or
      excipients).<br>

      invention possesses a chemical structure selected from:<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The present invention is also directed to a method of
      treating diseases and other physical ailments or disorders. In a
      preferred embodiment the method comprises the step of
      administering to a subject in need thereof a copper (I) complex
      having a formula of Formula (I), Formula (II), Formula (III) or
      Formula (IV) to reduce and/or treat a disease or physical ailment
      or disorder. Preferably the disease or physical ailment being
      treated is a mitochondrial or neuromuscular disease. The treated
      diseases or disorders (or other physical ailments) include, but
      are not limited to fibromyalgia, spinal cord injury, multiple
      sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, pain,
      fatigue, sleeplessness, loss of fine motor control, speech loss,
      inflexibility, Lyme disease, Lyme disease co-infection,
      gastroparesis (GP), chronic inflammation, myopathy, chronic
      inflammation, and/or incontinence. It is also preferable that the
      subject be diagnosed with one of the diseases and/or disorders
      prior to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The present invention encompasses a method of treating a
      mitochondrial disease selected from the group consisting of
      Myoclonic Epilepsy with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF); Mitochondrial
      Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactacidosis, and Stroke (MELAS);
      Diabetes mellitus and deafness (DAD); Maternally Inherited
      Diabetes and Deafness (MIDD), Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy
      (LHON); chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO); Leigh
      Disease; Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS); Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA);
      Co-Enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) Deficiency; Neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis
      pigmentosa, and ptosis (NARP); Myoneurogenic gastrointestinal
      encephalopathy (MNGIE); Complex I Deficiency; Complex II
      Deficiency; Complex III Deficiency; Complex IV Deficiency; Complex
      V Deficiency; and other myopathies that effect mitochondrial
      function.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] The verb “comprise” as is used in this description and in
      the claims and its conjugations are used in its non-limiting sense
      to mean that items following the word are included, but items not
      specifically mentioned are not excluded. In addition, reference to
      an element by the indefinite article “a” or “an” does not exclude
      the possibility that more than one of the elements are present,
      unless the context clearly requires that there is one and only one
      of the elements. The indefinite article “a” or “an” thus usually
      means “at least one.”<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The terms “copper (I) complex” and “copper (I) compound” as
      used herein are interchangeable and refer to a chemical compound
      in which copper is present in its +1 oxidation state and interacts
      with at least one other element through ionic or covalent bonding.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The term “extended release” herein refers to any
      formulation or dosage form that comprises an active drug and which
      is formulated to provide a longer duration of pharmacological
      response after administration of the dosage form than is
      ordinarily experienced after administration of a corresponding
      immediate release formulation comprising the same drug in the same
      amount. Controlled release formulations include, inter alia, those
      formulations described elsewhere as “controlled release”, “delayed
      release”, “sustained release”, “prolonged release”, “programmed
      release”, “time release” and/or “rate controlled” formulations or
      dosage forms. Further for the purposes of this invention refers to
      release of an active pharmaceutical agent over a prolonged period
      of time, such as for example over a period of 8, 12, 16 or 24
      hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As used herein, the term “subject” or “patient” refers to
      any vertebrate including, without limitation, humans and other
      primates (e.g., chimpanzees and other apes and monkey species),
      farm animals (e.g., cattle, sheep, pigs, goats and horses),
      domestic mammals (e.g., dogs and cats), laboratory animals (e.g.,
      rodents such as mice, rats, and guinea pigs), and birds (e.g.,
      domestic, wild and game birds such as chickens, turkeys and other
      gallinaceous birds, ducks, geese, and the like). In some
      embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In other embodiments, the
      subject is a human.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Compositions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0036] The compositions of the present invention may comprise an
      effective amount of a copper (I) complex having a formula selected
      from:<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the pharmaceutical composition further comprises
      copper ascorbate (esterified Vitamin C), ascorbic acid (Vitamin
      C), and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient (carrier). More
      preferably, the pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is an inert
      diluent.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The compositions of the present invention may comprise a
      delivery vehicle. Suitable delivery vehicles include a liposome, a
      microsome, a nanosome, a picosome, a pellet, a granular matrix, a
      bead, a microsphere, a nanoparticle formulation, or an aqueous
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Liposomes can aid in the delivery of the copper (I)
      compounds to a particular tissue and can also increase the blood
      half-life of the compounds. Liposomes suitable for use in the
      invention are formed from standard vesicle-forming lipids, which
      generally include neutral, positively or negatively charged
      phospholipids and, optionally, a sterol, such as cholesterol. The
      selection of lipids is generally guided by consideration of
      factors such as the desired liposome size and half-life of the
      liposomes in the blood stream. A variety of methods are known for
      preparing liposomes, for example as described in Szoka et al.
      (1980), Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 9: 467; and U.S. Pat. Nos.
      4,235,871, 4,501,728, 4,837,028, and 5,019,369, the entire
      disclosures of which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Polyacrylates represent a further example of a suitable
      delivery vehicle for use in the present invention. By way of
      example, a terpolymer of styrene and hydroxyethyl methacrylate
      cross-linked with a difunctional azo-compound may be employed. The
      system depends on cleavage of the azo bond by intestinal
      microflora resulting in degradation of polymer. Similarly, a pH
      responsive poly (methacrylic-g-ethylene glycol) hydrogel may be
      employed as an oral delivery vehicle. Once inside the basic and
      neutral environment of the small intestine, the gels rapidly swell
      and dissociate.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In another embodiment, a microcapsule formulation may be
      employed for peroral delivery. In more detail, aqueous colloidal
      terpolymers of ethylacrylate/methyl methacrylate/2-hydroxylethyl
      methacrylate (poly (EA/MME/HEMA), for example as synthesized by
      emulsion polymerization technique(s) may be employed. These
      polymers exhibit delayed release profiles, which were
      characterized by a long lag time and subsequent rapid release of
      the entrapped moiety.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In another embodiment, orally administered nanoparticles
      may serve as suitable delivery vehicles. By way of example, loaded
      nanoparticles may be entrapped into pH sensitive microspheres,
      which serve to deliver the incorporated nanoparticle to the
      desired site of action. Nanoparticles have a large specific
      surface, which is indicative of high interactive potential with
      biological surfaces. Thus, bioadhesion can be induced by binding
      nanoparticles with different molecules. By way of example,
      nanoparticles may be prepared from gliadin protein isolate from
      wheat gluten and then conjugated with lectins (glycoproteins of
      non-immune origin which provide specific bioadhesion).
      Accordingly, nanoparticles are provided, which have a high
      capacity for non-specific interaction with intestine.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The compositions of the present invention may take the form
      of differently sized particles. In some embodiments, particles are
      microparticles (aka microspheres or microsomes). In general, a
      “microparticle” refers to any particle having a diameter of less
      than 1000 μm. In some embodiments, particles are nanoparticles
      (aka nanospheres or nanosomes). In general, a “nanoparticle”
      refers to any particle having a diameter of less than 1000 nm. In
      some embodiments, particles are picoparticles (aka picospheres or
      picosomes). In general, a “picoparticle” refers to any particle
      having a diameter of less than 1 nm. In some embodiments,
      particles are micelles.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In one embodiment, a delivery vehicle based on an
      albumin-chitosan mixed matrix microsphere-filled coated capsule
      formulation may be employed. In this regard, a preparation of a
      copper (I) compound of the invention is filled into hard gelatin
      capsules and enteric coated.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In one embodiment, albumin microspheres may be employed as
      the oral delivery system.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] In one embodiment, squalane oil-containing multiple
      emulsions may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In one embodiment, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres
      may be employed as the oral delivery vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In one embodiment, a delivery coating comprising a mixture
      of pH-responsive enteric polymer (Eudragit S) and biodegradable
      polysaccharide (resistant starch) in a single layer matrix film
      may be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In one embodiment, delivery capsules such as liposomes,
      micro- or nanocapsules (e.g. chitosan nanocapsules) may be
      chemically modified with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). The typical
      degree of PEGylation is in the range of 0.1% to 5%, such as 0.5%
      to 2%, for example 0.5% or 1%. The presence of PEG, whether alone
      or grafted to chitosan, improves the stability of the delivery
      capsules in the gastrointestinal fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] PEGylated delivery vehicles such as liposomes, micro- or
      nanocapsules have an intrinsic ability to accumulate at disease
      sites and facilitate transfection of target cells. Unlike many
      viral vectors, PEGylated liposomes are generally considered to be
      non-immunogenic.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In one embodiment, a branched PEGylating reagent is
      employed as branched PEG protecting groups are more effective than
      linear PEG molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In one embodiment, the copper (I) compounds of the
      invention are prepared with carriers that will protect the
      compound against rapid elimination from the body, such as an
      extended release formulation, including implants and
      microencapsulated delivery systems. Biodegradable, biocompatible
      polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,
      polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and
      polylactic acid. Methods for preparation of such formulations will
      be apparent to those skilled in the art. The materials can also be
      obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Other embodiments of the invention are directed to a single
      crystalline form of the copper (I) complexes characterized by a
      combination of the characteristics of any of the single
      crystalline forms discussed herein. The characterization can be
      any combination of one or more of the XRPD, TGA, DSC, moisture
      sorption/desorption measurements and single crystal structure
      determination described for a particular crystalline form. For
      example, the single crystalline form of a copper (I) complex can
      be characterized by any combination of the XRPD results regarding
      the 2θ position of the major peaks in an XRPD scan; and/or any
      combination of one or more of the unit cell parameters derived
      from data obtained from the single crystal structure analysis. DSC
      determinations of the temperature associated with the maximum heat
      flow during a heat flow transition and/or the temperature at which
      a sample begins to undergo a heat flow transition may also
      characterize the crystalline form. Weight change in a sample
      and/or change in sorption/desorption of water per molecule of a
      copper (I) complex of the present invention as determined by
      moisture sorption/desorption measurements over a range of relative
      humidity can also characterize a single crystalline form of a
      copper (I) complex.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Examples of combinations of single crystalline form
      characterizations using multiple analytical techniques include the
      2θ positions of at least one of the major peaks of an XRPD scan
      and the temperature associated with the maximum heat flow during
      one or more heat flow transitions observed by a corresponding DSC
      measurements; the 2θ positions of at least one of the major peaks
      of an XRPD scan and one or more weight losses associated with a
      sample over a designated temperature range in a corresponding TGA
      measurement; the 2θ positions of at least one of the major peaks
      of an XRPD scan, and the temperature associated with the maximum
      heat flow during one or more heat flow transitions observed by a
      corresponding DSC measurements, and one or more weight losses
      associated with a sample over a designated temperature range in a
      corresponding TGA measurement; the 2θ positions of at least one of
      the major peaks of an XRPD scan, and the temperature associated
      with the maximum heat flow during one or more heat flow
      transitions observed by a corresponding DSC measurements, one or
      more weight losses associated with a sample over a designated
      temperature range in a corresponding TGA measurement, and the
      change in sorption/desorption measurements over a range of
      relative humidity. As well, each of the aforementioned examples
      can replace the use of 2θ positions of at least one of the major
      peaks of an XRPD scan with one or more unit cell parameters of the
      single crystalline form.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The combinations of characterization that are discussed
      above can be used to describe any of the single crystalline forms
      of a copper (I) complex of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The D90 particle size diameter of the copper (I) complexes
      of the present invention may be 1 to 500 microns; e.g., any range
      within 1 and 500 microns, such as 1 to 100 microns, 50 to 250
      microns, 100 to 300 microns, 250 to 500 microns, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Indications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0056] The compositions of the present invention may be used to
      effectively treat numerous human diseases and other ailments
      characterized by neuromuscular degeneration and muscle weakness.
      These diseases are described in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The copper (I) complexes of the present invention are
      particularly effective in treating mitochondrial diseases.
      Mitochondrial diseases are often the result a deficiency in ATP
      production, via the oxidative phosphorylation, which makes high
      energy-demanding tissues or organs such as heart, brain, and
      muscles, the main targets for these disorders. By restoring ATP
      production to normal, the copper (I) complexes may prevent, treat,
      or reverse mitochondrial disease.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Impairments in oxidative phoshporylation are often referred
      to as mitochondrial dysfunction (and are associated with
      mitochondrial disease). They can result from hereditary and
      somatic mutations in nuclear genes or mtDNA, or functional
      impairments by drugs or toxins. Mutations in over 100 genes
      constituting the oxidative phosphorylation machinery are linked
      with mitochondrial encephalopathies in humans, which are the most
      common metabolic diseases with an incidence of over 1/5000 in live
      births.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Respiratory chain Complex I deficiency is a cause of
      mitochondrial diseases in many cases. Twenty-five of at least
      fifty known genes implicated in Complex I biogenesis are found
      associated with mitochondrial diseases. Pathogenic mutations in
      structural subunits (e.g., NDUFA 1, 2, 11; NDUFS 1-4, 6-8; NDUFV
      1, 2) and assembly factors (e.g., NDUFAF1-6) have been identified.
      Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease,
      Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease are also associated
      with mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, mtDNA mutations are found
      associated with almost all types of cancers. Type 2 diabetes is
      also linked with declining mitochondrial function in relevant
      tissues such as β-cells and muscles. Type 2 diabetes represents a
      major clinical challenge due to the sharp rise in obesity-induced
      disease. Thus, in some embodiments, methods are provided for
      treating a mitochondrial disease or a mitochondrial dysfunction.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases usually include slow
      growth, loss of muscle coordination, muscle weakness, visual
      defect, hearing defects, learning disabilities, mental
      retardation, heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease,
      gastrointestinal disorders, respiratory disorders, neurological
      problems, and dementia.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The copper (I) complexes of the present invention may be
      used to treat mitochondrial diseases such as Myoclonic Epilepsy
      with Ragged Red Fibers (MERRF); Mitochondrial Myopathy,
      Encephalopathy, Lactacidosis, and Stroke (MELAS); Diabetes
      mellitus and deafness (DAD); Maternally Inherited Diabetes and
      Deafness (MIDD), Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON);
      chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO); Leigh
      Disease; Kearns-Sayre Syndrome (KSS); Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA);
      Co-Enzyme Q10 (Co-Q10) Deficiency; Neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis
      pigmentosa, and ptosis (NARP); Myoneurogenic gastrointestinal
      encephalopathy (MNGIE); Complex I Deficiency; Complex II
      Deficiency; Complex III Deficiency; Complex IV Deficiency; Complex
      V Deficiency; and other myopathies that effect mitochondrial
      function.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The copper (I) complexes of the present invention may also
      be used to treat a neuromuscular disease. The term “neuromuscular
      disease” refers to disorders that adversely affect muscle function
      and/or the control thereof by the central nervous system (CNS). In
      general, neuromuscular diseases encompass a wide range of physical
      ailments characterized by impaired muscle function. The following
      (non-limiting) list of conditions is generally recognized as
      neuromuscular diseases or conditions: multiple sclerosis, muscular
      dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, myopathy,
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), incontinence, inflexibility,
      impaired fine motor skills, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (“ALS” or Lou Gehrig's disease).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] A stroke, formerly known as a cerebrovascular accident
      (CVA), often results in severe neurological impairment.
      Post-stroke, many individuals suffer one or more neurological
      impairments including, but not limited to: loss of fine motor
      control, paralysis, speech impairment/loss (aphasia and/or
      dysarthria), altered smell, taste, hearing, or vision, ptosis,
      ocular and facial muscle weakness, diminished reflexes, loss of
      balance, altered heart rate, apraxia, loss of memory, and/or
      confusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Three of the most prominent diseases associated with
      impaired neurological function are muscular dystrophy (MD),
      multiple sclerosis (MS), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The term Muscular Dystrophy (MD) actually refers to a group
      of diseases characterized by muscle weakness and/or impaired
      muscle function. The specific diseases include, but are not
      limited to Becker, Duchenne, and Emery-Dreifuss. Over 100
      diseases, however, display symptoms similar to MD. All are
      characterized by reduced muscle function and muscle weakness.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease diagnosed
      in 350,000-500,000 people in the United States. The disease is
      characterized by multiple areas of inflammation and scarring of
      the myelin in the brain and spinal cord. Patients inflicted with
      the disease exhibit varying degrees of neurological impairment
      depending on the location and extent of the myelin scarring.
      Typical MS symptoms include fatigue, weakness, spasticity, balance
      problems, bladder and bowel problems, numbness, loss of vision,
      tremors, and depression. Available treatments of MS generally only
      alleviate symptoms or delay the progression of the disability<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is another troublesome disorder
      associated with inflammation. It is signified by chronic
      inflammation in the membrane lining (the synovium) of the joints
      and/or other internal organs. These inflammatory cells can also
      damage bone and cartilage. For example, a joint inflicted with RA
      may lose its shape and alignment, which can result in the loss of
      range of motion. RA is characterized by pain, stiffness, warmth,
      redness and swelling in the joint, and other systemic symptoms
      like fever, fatigue, and anemia. RA currently affects roughly 1%
      of the entire U.S. population (approximately 2.2 million people).
      The pathology of RA is not fully understood, although it has been
      hypothesized to result from a cascade of aberrant immunological
      reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The compositions of the present invention are particularly
      effective in treating Lyme disease and Lyme disease co-infections.
      Lyme disease is a bacterial infection (Borrelia burgdorferi)
      spread by ticks. The number of reported cases of Lyme disease, and
      the number of geographical areas in which it is found, has been
      increasing. In addition to causing arthritis, Lyme disease can
      also cause heart, brain, and nerve problems. Early symptoms
      include skin-rash, flu-like symptoms (e.g. chills, fever, swollen
      lymph nodes, headaches, fatigue, muscle aches/pains, and joint
      pain). More advanced symptoms include nerve problems and
      arthritis.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Lyme disease is often associated with muscle degeneration
      and/or muscle weakness. In one aspect of the present invention,
      treatment of Lyme disease in a subject with a copper (I) complex
      results in improved muscle health and/or muscle tone. In some
      embodiments, the Lyme disease is chronic Lyme disease that
      persists in spite of treatment with standard antibiotic
      treatments.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Often, ticks can become infected with multiple
      disease-causing microbes, resulting in co-infection. This may be a
      potential problem for humans, due to Borrelia burgdorferi, and
      other harmful pathogens carried and transmitted by some ticks.
      Possible co-infections with viruses such as Lyme borreliosis,
      anaplasmosis, babesiosis, or encephalitis may occur. It is not
      known how co-infection may affect disease transmission and
      progression, but may help in diagnosing and treating Lyme and
      other such diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to a
      method of treating a tickborne disease with a copper (I) complex.
      Tickborne diseases include Babesiosis, Ehrlichiosis and
      Anaplasmosis, Lyme Disease, Relapsing Fever, Rocky Mountain
      Spotted Fever, and Tularemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Tickborne diseases can be found throughout the United
      States. For example, Lyme disease, first discovered in Connecticut
      in the early 1970s, has since spread to every state except Hawaii.
      Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a bacterial disease transmitted by
      the dog tick, was first identified in 1896.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] One of the newest tickborne diseases to be identified in
      the United States is called Southern tick-associated rash illness
      (STARI). This disease has a bull's-eye rash similar to that found
      in Lyme disease, which is caused by bacteria transmitted by the
      deer tick. Although researchers know that the lone star tick
      transmits the infectious agent that causes STARI, they do not yet
      know what microbe causes it.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Ticks transmit ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis, both
      bacterial diseases. Babesiosis is caused by parasites carried by
      deer ticks. These diseases are found in several states.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Tularemia, a less common tickborne bacterial disease, can
      be transmitted by ticks as well as other vectors (carriers) such
      as the deerfly. Public health experts are concerned that the
      bacterium that causes tularemia (Francisella tularensis) could be
      used as a weapon of bioterrorism.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Transmission of tickborne diseases is not limited to ticks.
      In addition, tickborne diseases may be spread via other vectors
      (e.g., mosquitoes, flies, or other insects), via contaminated body
      fluids (e.g., blood transfusions), via sexual transmission or any
      other number of ways.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] The copper (I) complexes may be used to treat
      gastroparesis. Gastroparesis is a condition characterizes by the
      inability of the stomach to empty its contents, when there is no
      blockage (obstruction). The cause of gastroparesis is not known.
      There is some evidence that it may be caused by a disruption of
      nerve signals to the stomach. The condition is a complication of
      diabetes and of some surgeries. Risk factors associated with
      gastroparesis may include diabetes, gastrectomy (surgery to remove
      part of the stomach), systemic sclerosis, use of medication that
      blocks certain nerve signals (anticholinergic medication).
      Symptoms may include abdominal distention, hypoglycemia (in people
      with diabetes), nausea, premature abdominal fullness after meals,
      weight loss, and vomiting. If gastroparesis is caused by a
      condition that is reversible (e.g. pancreatitis), when the
      condition is resolved, the symptoms will subside. For some
      diabetics, better control of their blood sugar can also improve
      the symptoms. If there is no reversible cause, gastroparesis
      rarely resolves itself and the symptoms often grow more sever with
      time. When accompanied by motility disorders of the muscles of the
      small intestine, gastroparesis is particularly difficult to treat.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The invention may be used to treat an animal with a disease
      or physical ailment or disorder including, but not limited to, one
      or more of the following: fibromyalgia, multiple sclerosis,
      muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's, dementia,
      ALS, depression, pain, fatigue, sleeplessness, inflexibility,
      myopathy, Lyme disease, Lyme disease co-infection, gastroparesis
      (GP), chronic inflammation, incontinence, impaired fine motor
      skills, high cholesterol, low sperm count, obesity, alopecia,
      burns, stretch marks, scars, ADD, ADHD, and/or erectile
      dysfunction, wherein it is preferable that the animal is a mammal
      and more preferable that the mammal is a human.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In an alternate embodiment, the present invention is
      further directed to pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement
      compositions for treating post-stroke symptoms, including, but not
      limited to: loss of fine motor control, paralysis, speech
      impairment/loss (aphasia and/or dysarthria), altered smell, taste,
      hearing, or vision, ptosis, ocular and facial muscle weakness,
      diminished reflexes, loss of balance, altered heart rate, apraxia,
      loss of memory, and/or confusion.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Advantageously, the present invention is further directed
      to pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement compositions for
      promoting one or more desired health benefits. In a preferred
      embodiment, the compositions of the present invention promote hair
      growth, skin healing, scar removal, nerve growth, muscle growth,
      enhanced athletic performance, reduced post-traumatic healing
      time, post-surgery healing, and/or enhanced libido.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In one embodiment, the subject is first diagnosed with one
      of the diseases listed above before treatment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Modes of Administration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0082] Frequency of dosage may vary depending on the purity of the
      compound and the particular disease or physical ailment treated.
      However, for treatment of most diseases and physical ailments, a
      dosage regimen of (4) 2.5 mg capsules (for a total of 10 mg/day)
      containing copper (I) complexes of the present invention is
      preferred. As will be understood by one skilled in the art,
      however, the optimal dosage level for a particular subject will
      vary depending on a plurality of factors including the potency and
      activity of the pharmacologically active ingredient, as well as
      the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of
      administration, route of administration and rate of excretion,
      drug combination (if any) and the severity of the particular
      disease or physical ailment undergoing therapy. Subject to the
      above factors, a generally effective amount of the copper (I)
      complexes of the present invention is between 1 mg and 20 mg per
      day. More preferably, the effective amount of is between 5 mg and
      10 mg per day. Advantageously, the effective amount of is between
      7.5 mg to 10 mg per day. Most preferably (subject to the factors
      listed above), the effective amount is about 10 mg/per day.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Copper (I) complexes of the present invention may also
      comprise a component of an overall pharmaceutical treatment regime
      for reducing and/or treating a disease or physical ailment or
      other disorder including, but not limited to: fibromyalgia,
      multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis,
      Alzheimer's, dementia, ALS, depression, pain, fatigue,
      sleeplessness, inflexibility, myopathy, incontinence, impaired
      fine motor skills, high cholesterol, low sperm count, obesity,
      alopecia, burns, stretch marks, scars, ADD, ADHD, and/or erectile
      dysfunction, the treatment regime comprising: administering to a
      subject at the least the following pharmacologically active
      ingredient(s) within a 24-hour period: copper (I) complexes of the
      present invention, and optionally a pharmaceutically acceptable
      carrier, wherein the pharmacologically active ingredient(s) is in
      an amount sufficient to reduce the symptoms of the ailment.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Optionally, the pharmaceutical treatment regime including
      copper (I) complexes of the present invention may include (or be
      combined with) additional pharmacologically active ingredients or
      other complementary treatments in order to provide synergistic
      therapeutic effects. For example, copper (I) complexes of the
      present invention may be administered in combination with
      additional pharmacologically active agents including, but not
      limited to, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
      corticosteroids, disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
      biologic DMARDs, and/or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors. In a
      preferred embodiment, copper (I) complexes of the present
      invention is administered in combination with ozone therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The pharmaceutical and/or dietary supplement compositions
      of the present invention may take a variety of forms specially
      adapted to the chosen route of administration. The compositions
      may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation
      or spray, or by any other conventional means. Preferably, the
      compositions are prepared and administered in dosage unit
      formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically
      acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles. In one preferred
      embodiment, the composition is administered sublingually. It is
      further understood that the preferred method of administration may
      be a combination of methods. Oral administration in the form of a
      capsule, pill, elixir, syrup, lozenge, troche, or the like is
      particularly preferred. The pharmaceutical compositions of the
      present invention are preferably in a form suitable for oral use,
      for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily
      suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsion, hard or
      softgel capsules, or syrups or elixirs.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared
      according to any method known in the art for manufacture of
      pharmaceutical compositions, and such compositions may contain one
      or more agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening
      agents, flavoring agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in
      order to provide pharmaceutically elegant and palatable
      preparations. Tablets may contain the active ingredient in
      admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients
      suitable for the manufacture of tablets. Such excipients may
      include, for example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate,
      sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate;
      granulating and disintegrating agents, for example, corn starch,
      or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or
      acacia; and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate,
      stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be
      coated by techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the
      gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over
      a longer period. For example, a time delay material such as
      glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be utilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard
      gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with an
      inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate, calcium
      phosphate or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the
      active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for
      example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in
      admixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous
      suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example
      sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,
      hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate,
      polyvinylpyrrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; and
      dispersing or wetting agents, which may be a naturally-occurring
      phosphatide, for example, lecithin, or condensation products of
      ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols—for example,
      heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene
      oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol
      anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The
      aqueous suspensions may also contain one or more preservatives,
      for example ethyl, or n-propyl-p-hydroxybenzoate, one or more
      coloring agents, one or more flavoring agents, and one or more
      sweetening agents, such as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active
      ingredients in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive
      oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid
      paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for
      example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents
      such as those set forth above, and flavoring agents may be added
      to provide palatable oral preparations. These compositions may be
      preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid
      and/or copper ascorbate.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation
      of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide the
      active ingredient (i.e., copper (I) complex) in admixture with a
      dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more
      preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and
      suspending agents are exemplified by those already mentioned
      above. Additional excipients, for example sweetening, flavoring
      and coloring agents, may also be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in
      the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a
      vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral
      oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable
      emulsifying agents may be naturally occurring gums, for example
      gum acacia or gum tragacanth; naturally-occurring phosphatide, for
      example soy bean, lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived
      from fatty acids and hexitol; anhydrides, for example sorbitan
      monooleate; and condensation products of the said partial esters
      with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan
      monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and
      flavoring agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening
      agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or
      sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a
      preservative, and flavoring or coloring agents. The pharmaceutical
      compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or
      oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according
      to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents
      and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. The
      sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile injectable
      solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable
      diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol.
      Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed
      are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride
      solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally
      employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose, any
      bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono- and
      diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use
      in the preparation of injectables.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Alternatively, the compositions can be administered
      parenterally in a sterile medium. The copper (I) complexes of the
      present invention, depending on the vehicle and concentration
      used, can either be suspended or dissolved in the vehicle.
      Advantageously, adjuvants such as local anesthetics, preservatives
      and buffering agents can be dissolved in the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] For administration to non-human animals, the composition
      containing copper (I) complexes of the present invention may be
      added to the animal's feed or drinking water. Optionally, one
      skilled in the art will recognize that animal feed and drinking
      products may be formulated such that the animal takes in an
      effective amount of copper (I) complexes of the present invention
      via their diet. For example, copper (I) complexes of the present
      invention may constitute a component of a premix formulated for
      addition to the feed or drinking water of an animal. Compositions
      containing copper (I) complexes of the present invention may also
      be formulated as food or drink supplements for humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] Preferred embodiments of compositions containing copper (I)
      complexes of the present invention will have desirable
      pharmacological properties that include, but are not limited to,
      oral bioavailability, low toxicity, and desirable in vitro and in
      vivo half-lives. The half-life of copper (I) complexes of the
      present invention is inversely proportional to the frequency of
      dosage of the compounds.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Synthesis of the Copper (I) Complexes</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method
      of synthesizing a copper (I) glycinate complex. The method
      comprises: a) charging a glycinate salt under a stream of inert
      gas in an alcohol or water; b) heating the glycinate salt in the
      alcohol or water at between 40° C. to 45° C.; c) adding a copper
      (I) salt to the alcohol and allowing to reflux for at least 12
      hours; and d) evaporating the alcohol or water and washing the
      copper (I) glycinate complex with alcohol and/or water to remove
      impurities. In a preferred embodiment, the inert gas is nitrogen.
      In some implementations, the glycinate salt is charged under a
      stream of inert gas with an ascorbate salt in an alcohol. In one
      aspect, the glycinate salt in alcohol is heated for 30 minutes. In
      a preferred embodiment, the mixture of copper (I) salt and
      glycinate salt in water is refluxed for between 12 to 16 hours. In
      some implementations, the mixture of the glycinate salt and copper
      (I) salt in water is cooled to about 37° C., in a preferred
      embodiment, the mixture is further cooled by stirring. In a
      preferred implementation, evaporating the alcohol or water and
      washing the copper (I) glycinate complex with alcohol and/or water
      takes place under nitrogen-purge. For example, the water is dried
      by flushing a pressure filter with nitrogen. Once the collected
      products on the filter is semi-dry, the drying process continues
      in a drying plate, under vacuum conditions, at a temperature of
      41° C. The isolated crystals of copper (I) glycinate complex
      prepared in the absence of the ascorbate salt have a lavender
      purple color, whereas isolated crystals of copper (II) glycinate
      complex have a blue color.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In an alternate embodiment, the present invention provides
      a method of synthesizing a copper (I) pyruvate complex. The method
      comprises: a) charging a pyruvate salt under a stream of inert gas
      in an alcohol; b) heating the pyruvate salt in the alcohol at
      about 45° C.; c) adding a copper (I) salt to the alcohol and
      allowing to reflux for at least 12 hours; and d) evaporating the
      alcohol and washing the copper (I) pyruvate complex with water to
      remove impurities. In some implementations, the pyruvate salt is
      charged under a stream of inert gas with an ascorbate salt in an
      alcohol. In one aspect, the pyruvate salt in alcohol is heated for
      30 minutes. In a preferred embodiment, the mixture of copper (I)
      salt and pyruvate salt in water is refluxed for between 12 to 16
      hours. The isolated crystals of copper (I) pyruvate complex
      prepared in the absence of the ascorbate salt have an
      orange-yellow color.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In another embodiment, the present invention provides a
      method of synthesizing a copper (I) succinate complex. The method
      comprises: a) charging a succinate salt under a stream of inert
      gas in an alcohol; b) heating the succinate salt and the ascorbate
      salt in the alcohol at about 45° C.; c) adding a copper (I) salt
      to the alcohol and allowing to reflux for at least 12 hours; and
      d) evaporating the alcohol and washing the copper (I) succinate
      complex with water to remove impurities. In some implementations,
      the pyruvate salt is charged under a stream of inert gas with an
      ascorbate salt in an alcohol. In one aspect, the succinate salt in
      alcohol is heated for 30 minutes. In a preferred embodiment, the
      mixture of copper (I) salt and succinate salt in water is refluxed
      for between 12 to 16 hours. The isolated crystals of copper (I)
      succinate complex prepared in the absence of the ascorbate salt
      have a pink color.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In preferred embodiments of the methods of synthesizing a
      copper (I) glycinate complex, a copper (I) pyruvate complex, or a
      copper (I) succinate complex, the copper (I) salt is copper (I)
      chloride. The molar ratios of glycinate salt, pyruvate salt, or
      succinate salt to the copper (I) salt may be about 3:1, about
      3:1.1, about 3:1.2, about 3:1.3, about 3:1.4, about 3:1.5, about
      3:1.6, about 3:1.7, or about 3:1.8. The ascorbate salt used may be
      sodium ascorbate, and the alcohol may be ethanol. The molar ratios
      of glycinate salt/pyruvate salt/succinate salt to ascorbate salt
      to copper (I) salt may be about 3:1:1, about 3:1.1:1.1, about
      3:1.2:1.2, about 3:1.3:1.3, about 3:1.4:1.4, about 3:1.5:1.5,
      about 3:1.6:1.6, about 3:1.7:1.7, or about 3:1.8:1.8. In one
      embodiment, the alcohol is 90% ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The methods of synthesizing copper (I) complexes may
      further comprise trituration with organic solvents and/or
      recrystallization to further purify the copper (I) complexes.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] It is to be understood that the foregoing describes
      preferred embodiments of the present invention and that
      modifications may be made thereto without departing from the scope
      or spirit of the present invention as set forth in the claims.
      Such scope is limited only by the claims below as read in

      glycinate product. Proton NMR (dissolved in D2O) of the red powder
      ( ̃100 mg) indicated no presence of starting material or product.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Proton NMR (dissolved in D2O) of the concentrated mother
      liquor indicated a single peak at 3.677 ppm and other small peaks
      between 3.7-4.7 ppm (see FIG. 1). The D2O solvent peak is at 4.8
      ppm.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Proton NMR (dissolved in D2O) of sodium glycinate indicated
      a single peak at 3.157 ppm, which corresponds to the methylene
      (CH2) (see FIG. 2). Proton NMR (dissolved in D2O) of sodium
      ascorbate indicated the following peaks: 3.70-3.73 (CH2), 3.99
      (CHOH), and 4.49 (CH) ppm that correspond to the expected sodium
      L-ascorbate peaks (see FIG. 3).<br>
      <br>
      [0108] In the proton NMR spectrum of the mother liquor there is no
      presence of sodium glycinate (3.157 ppm) (see FIG. 1). There is a
      singlet peak at 3.67 ppm believed to correspond to the desired Cu
      (I) chelated methylene (CH2) product, copper (I) glycinate.<br>

        nitrogen-purged 500 ml reaction flask equipped with a mechanical
        stirrer, temperature probe/controller, reflux condenser, solid
        addition funnel and heating mantle and nitrogen purge. Under
        nitrogen purge, the reaction flask is charged with glycine (6.7
        g or 0.0893 mol) and deionized water (70 ml). The resulting
        mixture is stirred to complete dissolution. The dissolved
        mixture is heated to 40-45° C. while remaining under nitrogen.
        The reaction flask is then charge with ethanol (350 ml) under
        nitrogen and then heated back to 40-45° C. Via solid addition
        funnel, charge the cuprous chloride slowly while maintaining a
        temperature of 40-5° C. during the addition. Turn off the heat
        and allow the mixture to exothermal (about 5-10° C. exothermal
        is typical). The mixture is cooled to about 37° C. and stirred
        for approximately one hour. Afterwards, the reaction is removed
        from heat and sparged with nitrogen for approximately one hour.
        The final product is filtered using a pressure filter under

        for at least 45 minutes until semi-dry. The collected product on
        the filter is transferred to a drying dish and dried under
        vacuum at 41° C. The drying dish is placed at an angle of 30° to
        45° to facilitate drying and formation of clean crystals. Yield:

      [0117] Because succinic acid possesses two acidic groups, there
      are at least two different species of salt possible. The first is
      the hemi form, in which only one of the carboxylic acids is in the
      copper salt form, while the other is the full salt form in which
      there are two coppers to one succinate, one at each carboxylate.

      [0119] The copper (I) glycinate complex synthesized in Example 1b
      was used in a mitochondrial stress test using the XF Cell Mito
      Stress Test kit (Agilent, Wilmington, Del.). The cells studies
      were lymphoblasts from normal subjects (C), lymphoblasts from
      autistic donors without mitochondrial dysfunction (N), and
      lymphoblasts from autistic donors with mitochondrial dysfunction
      (A). ATP-linked respiration, proton leak, maximal respiratory
      capacity, and reserve capacity were determined as measured by the
      cells' oxygen consumption rate. FIG. 16 depicts the time points
      during the course of mitochondrial stress tests that are relevant
      for determining ATP-linked respiration, proton leak, maximal
      respiratory capacity, and reserve capacity. FIG. 17 depicts the
      results of the stress test with that compares the administration
      of 100 μM or 500 μM of the copper (I) glycinate to the respiration
      of these cells without administration of the copper (I) complex.
      Panel B of FIG. 17 shows that 500 μM of the copper (I) glycinate
      significantly reduced proton leak lymphoblasts with mitochondrial
      dysfunction. Mitochondrial dynfunction in cells was determined

      The first recorded medical use of copper is found in the Smith
      Papyrus, one of the oldest books known. The Papyrus is an Egyptian
      medical text, written between 2600 and 2200 B.C., which records
      the use of copper to sterilize chest wounds and to sterilize
      drinking water. Other early reports of copper's medicinal uses are
      found in the Ebers Papyrus, written around 1500 B.C. The Ebers
      Papyrus documents medicine practiced in ancient Egypt and in other
      cultures that flourished many centuries earlier. Copper compounds
      were recommended for headaches, "trembling of the limbs" (perhaps
      referring to epilepsy or St. Vitus' Dance), burn wounds, itching
      and certain growths in the neck, some of which were probably
      boils. Forms of copper used for the treatment of disease ranged
      from metallic copper splinters and shavings to various naturally
      occurring copper salts and oxides. A "green pigment" is spoken of
      which was probably the mineral, malachite, a form of copper
      carbonate. It could also have been chrysocolla, a copper silicate,
      or even copper chloride, which forms on copper exposed to
      seawater. In the first century A.D., Dioscorides, in his book De
      Materia Medica, described a method of making another green pigment
      known as verdigris by exposing metallic copper to the vapors of
      boiling vinegar. In this process, blue-green copper acetate forms
      on the copper surface. Verdigris and blue vitriol (copper sulfate)
      were used, among other things, in remedies for eye ailments such
      as bloodshot eyes, inflamed or "bleary" eyes, "fat in the eyes"
      (trachoma?), and cataracts.<br>
      <br>
      In the Hippocratic Collection (named for, although not entirely
      written by, the Greek physician Hippocrates, 460 to 380 B.C.),
      copper is recommended for the treatment of leg ulcers associated
      with varicose veins. To prevent infection of fresh wounds, the
      Greeks sprinkled a dry powder composed of copper oxide and copper
      sulfate on the wound. Another antiseptic wound treatment at the
      time was a boiled mixture of honey and red copper oxide. The
      Greeks had easy access to copper since the metal was readily
      available on the island of Kypros (Cyprus) from which the Latin
      name for copper, cuprum, is derived.<br>
      <br>
      By the time the Roman physician Aulus Cornelius Celsus began
      practicing medicine, during the reign of Tiberius (14 to 37 A.D.),
      copper and its derivatives had been firmly established as an
      important drug in the medical practitioner's pharmacopoeia. In
      Celsus' series, De Medicina, books one through six list many
      purposes for which copper was used together with the preparation
      and the form of copper most effective for each ailment. For the
      treatment of venereal disease, for example, Celsus prescribed a
      remedy consisting of pepper, myrrh, saffron, cooked antimony
      sulfide, and copper oxide. These were first pounded together in
      dry wine and when dry, once again pounded together in raisin wine
      and heated until dry. For a non-healing chronic ulcer, treatment
      consisted of copper oxide and other ingredients including enough
      rose oil to give a soft consistency.<br>
      <br>
      Pliny (23 to 79 A.D.) described a number of remedies involving
      copper. Black copper oxide was given with honey to remove
      intestinal worms. Diluted and injected as drops into nostrils, it
      cleared the head and, when taken with honey or honey water, it
      purged the stomach. It was given for "eye roughness," "eye pain
      and mistiness," and ulceration of the mouth. It was blown into the
      ears to relieve ear problems.<br>
      <br>
      In the New World the Aztecs also used copper for medical purposes.
      Don Francisco de Mendoza commissioned two learned Aztec Indian
      physicians to record the pharmacological treatments known by the
      Aztecs at the time of the Conquest. For the treatment of "Faucium
      Calor" (literally, heat of the throat, or, sore throat) they
      prescribed gargling with a mixture of ingredients containing
      copper.<br>
      <br>
      Copper was also employed in ancient India and Persia to treat lung
      diseases. The tenth century book, Liber Fundamentorum
      Pharmacologiae describes the use of copper compounds for medicinal
      purposes in ancient Persia. Powdered malachite was sprinkled on
      boils, copper acetate as well as and copper oxide were used for
      diseases of the eye and for the elimination of "yellow bile."
      Nomadic Mongolian tribes treated and healed ulcers of venereal
      origin with orally administered copper sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      Turning to more modern times, the first observation of copper's
      role in the immune system was published in 1867 when it was
      reported that, during the cholera epidemics in Paris of 1832, 1849
      and 1852, copper workers were immune to the disease. More recently
      copper's role in the immune system has been supported by
      observations that individuals suffering from Menke's disease (an
      inherited disease in which there is defective copper absorption
      and metabolism) generally die of immune system-related phenomena
      and other infections. Further, animals deficient in copper have
      been shown to have increased susceptibility to bacterial pathogens
      such as Salmonella and Listeria. Evidence such as this has led
      researchers to suggest strongly that copper compounds not only
      cure disease but also aid in the prevention of disease.<br>
      <br>
      In 1885, the French physician, Luton, reported on using copper
      acetate in his practice to treat arthritic patients. For external
      application he made a salve of hog's lard and 30% neutral copper
      acetate. For internal treatment, he used pills containing 10 mg.
      of copper acetate. In 1895, Kobert published his review of the
      pharmacological actions of copper compounds. Copper arsenate had
      been used to treat acute and chronic diarrhea as well as dysentery
      and cholera. A variety of inorganic copper preparations were found
      to be effective in treating chronic adenitis, eczema, impetigo,
      scorphulosis, tubercular infections, lupus, syphilis, anemias,
      chorea and facial neuralgia. An organic complex of copper
      developed by Bayer was shown to have curative powers in the
      treatment of tuberculosis. Copper treatment for tuberculosis
      continued until the 1940s, and various physicians reported on
      their success in using copper preparations in intravenous
      injections.<br>
      <br>
      In 1939, the German physician, Werner Hangarter, noticed that
      Finnish copper miners were unaffected by arthritis as long as they
      worked in the mining industry. This was particularly striking
      since rheumatism was a widespread disease in Finland, and workers
      in other industries and other towns had more rheumatic diseases
      than did the copper miners. This observation led Finnish medical
      researchers plus the Germans, Hangarter and Lübke, to begin their
      now classic clinical trials using an aqueous mixture of copper
      chloride and sodium salicylate. They successfully treated patients
      suffering from rheumatic fever, rheumatoid arthritis, neck and
      back problems, as well as sciatica.<br>
      <br>
      Until recently, just as in Pliny's time, the medical profession
      used copper sulfate as a means to clinically induce vomiting. This
      is based on the fact that one of the body's natural physiological
      responses to prevent copper intoxication is vomiting. A Manual of
      Pharmacology and its Applications to Therapeutics and Toxicology,
      published by W. B. Saunders Company in 1957 recommends the use of
      0.5 gram of copper sulfate, dissolved in a glass of water, in a
      single dose, or three doses of 0.25 gram fifteen minutes apart,
      for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      Since 1934, it has been known that individuals suffering from such
      diseases as scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, arthritis,
      malignant tumors and lymphogranulomas exhibit an elevation of
      copper in their blood plasma. Since then, the list of maladies
      bringing about such elevation has been extended to fever, wounds,
      ulcers, pain, seizures, cancers, carcinogenesis, diabetes,
      cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases, and irradiation and
      tissue stresses, including restricted blood flow. This suggests
      that this redistribution of copper in the body has a general role
      in responding to physiological, disease, or injury stress. On the
      other hand, the elevation of copper in the affected organ has led
      some to postulate that it was this excess of copper that caused
      the disease. Nonetheless, this elevation of copper in diseased
      states is suggested to account for the natural synthesis of
      copper-dependent regulatory proteins and enzymes in the body
      required for biochemical responses to stress. It may be that these
      natural copper complexes expedite the relief of stress and the
      repair of tissues. Thus, it appears that in addition to the
      anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activity of inorganic copper
      compounds as recognized by the ancients, metallo-organic complexes
      of copper have medicinal capabilities that are fundamental to the
      healing process itself.<br>
      <br>
      Copper is known to be an essential element in human metabolism.
      However, copper does not exist in the body in measurable amounts
      in ionic form. All measurable amounts of copper in the body exist
      in tissues as complexes with the organic compounds of proteins and
      enzymes. Therefore, it has been concluded that copper becomes and
      remains intimately involved in body processes. Some copper
      complexes serve to store copper, others to transport it, and yet
      others play important roles in key cellular and metabolic
      processes. Studies into the roles that these copper complexes play
      and the mechanisms of these roles have further confirmed that
      copper enters into the prevention and control of a number of
      disease states in the body. As will be discussed below, the key to
      the effective use of copper-based pharmaceuticals is not the use
      of inorganic compounds of copper, as used by the ancients, but
      rather the use of metallo-organic complexes or chelates of copper.
      The process of chelating metals allows them to be smuggled in the
      transport process across the intestinal wall and thereby enter
      into the mainstream of nutrient flow and usage in the body.<br>
      <br>
      The first modern research on the subject of copper medicinal
      substances was by Professor John R. J. Sorenson, of the University
      of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, who, in
      1966, demonstrated that copper complexes have therapeutic efficacy
      in the treatment of inflammatory diseases using doses that are
      nontoxic. Since then, copper metallo-organic complexes have been
      used to successfully treat patients with arthritic and other
      chronic degenerative diseases. More than 140 copper complexes of
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (aspirin and ibuprofen, for
      example) have been shown to be more active than their parent
      compounds. Copper aspirinate has been shown not only to be more
      effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis than aspirin
      alone, but it has been shown to prevent or even cure the
      ulceration of the stomach often associated with aspirin therapy.
      Based on these experiences, the work of Professor Sorenson and
      other researchers around the world has progressed into the
      medicinal benefits of organic complexes of copper in a number of
      disease states. This work, thus far mainly based on animal
      research, has opened a whole new vista both into the understanding
      of copper's many-fold role in the body and in the practicality of
      using supplementary copper in the treatment of wound healing and
      inflammation-related disease states. Some of these potential
      indications are:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ulcer and Wound-Healing
        Activities of Copper Complexes</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      It has been demonstrated that copper complexes such as copper
      aspirinate and copper tryptophanate, markedly increase healing
      rate of ulcers and wounds. For example, copper complexes heal
      gastric ulcers five days sooner than other reagents. Further, it
      has been shown that, whereas non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs, such as ibuprofen and enefenamic acid suppress wound
      healing, copper complexes of these drugs promote normal wound
      healing while at the same time retaining anti-inflammatory
      activity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anticonvulsant Activities of
        Copper Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The brain contains more copper than any other organ of the body
      except the liver, where copper is stored for use elsewhere. This
      fact suggests that copper plays a role in brain functions. With
      reports of seizures in animals and humans following the protracted
      consumption of copper-deficient diets, it was reasoned that copper
      has a role to play in the prevention of seizures. It was
      subsequently discovered that organic compounds that are not
      themselves anti-convulsants exhibit anticonvulsant activity when
      complexed with copper. Further, it was found that copper complexes
      of all anti-epileptic drugs are more effective and less toxic than
      their parent drugs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anticancer Activities of Copper
        Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      As early as 1912, patients in Germany were treated for facial
      epithelioma with a mixture of copper chloride and lecithin.
      Success of such treatment suggested that copper compounds have
      anticancer activity. Work at the University of Liverpool in 1913
      demonstrated that subcutaneous and intravenous injections of a
      copper salt or colloidal copper softened and degenerated
      carcinomas transplanted into mice. In 1930, work in France
      indicated that injections of colloidal copper mobilized and
      expelled tumor tissue. Recent work with mice in the USA has shown
      that, indeed, treatment of solid tumors with non-toxic doses of
      various organic complexes of copper markedly decreased tumor
      growth and metastasis and thus increased survival rate. These
      copper complexes did not kill cancer cells but caused them to
      revert to normal cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Anticarcinogenic Activity of
        Copper Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Based on work in the treatment of cancers using copper complexes,
      researchers have found that these same complexes may prevent or
      retard the development of cancers in mice under conditions where
      cancers are expected to be induced.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Radiation Protection and
        Radiation Recovery of Copper Complexes</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Ionizing radiation, such as that used in the treatment of cancer,
      has been shown to induce massive systemic inflammation. Ideally,
      such radiation-induced injury might be prevented or ameliorated by
      chemical repair mechanisms in the body. Thus, pharmacological
      approaches to the repair of radiation-damaged tissue are needed.
      As early as 1984, copper metallo-organic complexes have been shown
      to have radiation protection and radiation recovery activities.
      They are capable of causing rapid recovery of immunocompetence and
      recovery from radiation induced tissue changes. The mechanism of
      this activity appears to be tied to the ability of certain copper
      complexes to deactivate the superoxide, or "free," radicals
      liberated by ionizing radiation. In addition, since radiation has
      the capability of breaking the bonds of natural copper enzymes in
      the body, supplementing these with non-toxic doses of
      pharmaceutical copper complexes restores the lost tissue-repair
      capability. Since these complexes may also have anticarcinogenic
      activity, it is suggested that there would be merit in using
      copper complexes in the treatment of cancer and in particular,
      treating patients undergoing ionizing radiation therapy for their
      cancer, accidental exposure to radiation, and astronauts
      undertaking space travel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Heart Disease and Copper
        Complexes</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Numerous studies have drawn attention to the relationship between
      copper deficiency and heart disease. First observed in rats in
      1936, this effect has now been traced to both a deficiency in
      copper and an imbalance in the copper-to-zinc ratio in the body.
      Work by Dr. L.M. Klevay at the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
      Human Nutrition Research Center in 1973 has led to the postulation
      that copper has a direct effect on the control of cholesterol. In
      continuing work published in 1975, he theorized that a metabolic
      imbalance between zinc and copper - with more emphasis on copper
      deficiency than zinc excess - is a major contributing factor to
      the etiology of coronary heart disease. Subsequent work by other
      investigators has shown that copper complexes also can have a
      valuable role in the minimization of damage to the aorta and heart
      muscle as oxygenated blood reperfuses into tissues following
      myocardial infarction. This action is based on the
      anti-inflammatory action of copper complexes. These and other
      studies suggest the use of copper dietary supplements as a means
      of preventing and controlling such diseases as atherosclerosis (a
      form of arteriosclerosis), coronary heart disease, aortic
      aneurysms and myocardial infarction. It has been speculated that
      the reason that the heart attack rate in France is lower than in
      the rest of Europe is because of the French practice of drinking
      red wine. Red wine has a higher copper content than white wine
      because it is prepared with the skin of the grape intact. The
      copper originates in the wine from the copper fungicides used on
      the grapes in the field.<br>
      <br>
      Based on an abundance of historical data such as the foregoing,
      many researchers anticipate that copper will become an
      increasingly important component of tomorrow's medical treatments.<br>

      Copper(II) aspirinate is an aspirin chelate of copper(II) cations

      <br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Preparation</span><br>
      <br>
      Copper aspirinate can be prepared by several methods. In one route
      of preparation, an excess of acetylsalicylic acid is dissolved in
      aqueous sodium carbonate. Sodium hydroxide is not suitable for
      this purpose, because it will hydrolyse acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)
      into salicylic acid and sodium acetate.<br>
      <br>
      2 HC9H7O4 + Na2CO3 ? 2 NaC9H7O4 + CO2? + H2O<br>
      <br>
      The resulting solution is then filtered to remove any undissolved
      acetylsalicylic acid and is mixed with a solution containing Cu2+
      cations (copper(II) sulfate is suitable), precipitating bright
      blue crystals of copper aspirinate immediately. The crystals can
      then be filtered from solution, washed, and dried. An excess of
      acetylsalicylic acid is used in the first step, because it
      eliminates the possibility of unreacted carbonate anions
      precipitating the copper in this step.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Medicinal Use</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Copper aspirinate has been proven effective as a treatment for <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">rheumatoid arthritis</span>.[1] The
      studies on animal models suggest that copper aspirinate is very
      promising in treating against <span style="font-weight: bold;">thrombotic






        diseases</span> and it has all the prospects of success in
      becoming an antithrombotic drug that prevents and treats
      thrombotic diseases in humans.[2]<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other uses</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">

      The use of copper aspirinate as a pigment in PVC and Polystyrene
      has also been investigated.[3]<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Disclaimer:</span> The following
      is a summary of the procedure I used to make copper aspirinate. I
      offer it here for informational purposes to show that copper
      aspirinate can be made with commonly available materials and
      equipment. A similar procedure is typically done by second-year
      college chemistry students as a laboratory exercise in a setting
      supervised by a professional instructor. I do NOT recommend that
      people do this at home. Some aspects of these procedures are
      hazardous, and the typical home kitchen simply has too many
      distractions and interruptions for a student to carry out these
      procedures safely. Your wife ( or mom) will also be furious if you
      get copper sulfate stains on her kitchen counter!<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Copper Aspirinate synthesis
        (kitchen method)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Equipment and Materials required<br>
      <br>
      1. Saturated copper acetate solution. See procedure below.<br>
      <br>
      2. Pure aspirin crystals. See procedure below.<br>
      <br>
      3. Ethanol&nbsp; (95%; liquor store ethanol like Everclear (190
      proof, UPC 088352100036) is what was used here.<br>
      <br>
      4. Vacuum filtration facilities (Büchner funnel, coarse and medium
      porosity filter paper, aspirator, filter flask, seals, tubing,
      clamps, stand, etc. These common lab tools are not absolutely
      necessary, but can speed things up considerably.)<br>
      <br>
      5. Containers for liquid such as Rubbermaid 24 fl. oz. servin'
      saver tm (used here as a "beaker").<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Procedure</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Add 1 fl. oz. of saturated copper acetate solution to a beaker.<br>
      <br>
      2. Dissolve 1 tsp (teaspoon) pure aspirin crystals in about 1 fl.
      oz. of ethanol (95%) in another beaker<br>
      <br>
      3. Pour the aspirin solution into the copper acetate solution.
      Stir occasionally.<br>
      <br>
      4. Dark blue crystals will gradually form on the sides and bottom
      of the beaker. The initial layer will form immediately if the
      beaker has been freshly cleaned and scoured. The layer will
      gradually thicken and become bluer and darker. This process may
      take several hours. The endpoint is reached when the liquid has
      turned a light blue and no more blue crystals are forming on the
      walls of the beaker. (You can verify the endpoint by siphoning the
      clear liquid, evaporating it in a separate container, and checking
      the residue. The residue should be mostly aspirin crystals.)<br>
      <br>
      This procedure requires no heating. If you heat the liquid to
      increase the reaction rate, be aware that aspirin can hydrolyze
      into acetic and salicylic acids in a moist or liquid environment.
      If that happens, the liquid will turn dark green, and the yield
      of&nbsp; copper aspirinate will be greatly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      5. Cool the mixture in a refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      6. Scrape the crystals off the sides and bottom of the beaker.
      Then vacuum filter the whole mixture. (Save the first filtrate in
      a separate container if you do ethanol solvent recycling.)<br>
      <br>
      7. Wash the blue powder on the filter with cold distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      8. Dry the powder and filter paper in an oven at about 120F. Store
      the dry powder in a small dark bottle with a label identifying the
      contents and the date of creation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Alternative Procedure</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Substitute isopropanol (99%)&nbsp; for the ethanol in step #2 and
      use 1/2 teaspoon, instead of 1 teaspoon, of aspirin crystals and
      1/2 fl. oz. isopropanol instead of 1 fl. oz of ethanol. After
      several hours of initial crystallization,&nbsp; add 1/2 fl. oz. of
      distilled water and place the beaker in the refrigerator and wait
      a few more hours for more crystals. This variation gives about the
      same results as the ethanol procedure. Its advantages are that it
      uses less excess aspirin and a less expensive alcohol.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Aspirin purification (kitchen
        method)</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Equipment and Materials required<br>
      <br>
      1. One bottle of 1000 commercial aspirin tablets (preferably the
      uncoated kind).<br>
      <br>
      2. A pint or two of isopropyl alcohol (99%). This is usually
      available from a hardware store. Sometimes it can be found in a
      drugstore (UPC: 341226909730 ) Isopropanol is extremely flammable,
      so be very careful not to expose vapors to hidden or unexpected
      ignition sources.<br>
      <br>
      3. A couple of gallons of deionized or distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      4. Three, 24 fl. oz.&nbsp; wide-mouthed polypropylene containers
      with covers, such as Rubbermaid servin' saver tm.<br>
      <br>
      5. Oven thermometer (easily read dial type is best)<br>
      <br>
      6. Modified turkey baster (see construction procedure below)<br>
      <br>
      7. One kitchen (with sink, refrigerator, oven, etc)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Procedure:</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Dump a few hundred aspirin tablets into a wide-mouthed
      container.<br>
      <br>
      2. Add distilled water to the container and stir. This will break
      up the aspirin tablets and dissolve the hydroxypropyl
      methycelluose coating that is usually used to coat aspirin
      tablets. Let the mixture settle for an hour or so in the
      refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      3. Siphon most of the water out with a modified turkey baster.<br>
      <br>
      4. Repeat steps #2 and #3 a total of three to five
      times.&nbsp;&nbsp; This will largely get rid of the methycellulose
      coating, which tends to clog filters. You might not need to repeat
      these steps if you&nbsp; use uncoated aspirin.<br>
      <br>
      5. Vacuum filter the mixture from #4 and dry the powder in air.
      (Caution: aspirin tends to decompose when heated in a moist
      environment).<br>
      <br>
      6. Add the powder to a quart container. Add about a half-cup of
      isopropyl alcohol (99%). Stir. This will dissolve part, but not
      all, of the aspirin. Let the mixture settle.<br>
      <br>
      7. Vacuum filter the above mixture using medium porosity filter
      paper. Pour the filtrate into a clear glass container for
      inspection. If the filtrate is not clear, re-establish vacuum on
      the filter, and filter it again. (Sometimes simply letting the
      mixture settle and then siphoning the clear liquid with a turkey
      baster is more effective than filtration; the latter, however, may
      be faster.)<br>
      <br>
      8. Pour the clear filtrate containing the dissolved aspirin into
      the second container, cover it,&nbsp; and place it in the freezer
      (about 5 F or so). After an hour or so the aspirin will
      crystallize out of solution. Return the powder on the filter to
      its original quart container.<br>
      <br>
      9. After the aspirin crystals have formed,&nbsp;&nbsp; remove the
      container from the freezer. Carefully decant the liquid back into
      the first container that contains the impure aspirin powder. Then
      scrape out the pure aspirin crystals into a third container.<br>
      <br>
      10.&nbsp; Cover this first container (impure aspirin powder and
      recovered isopropanol) and let it warm to room temperature.
      Agitate it occasionally so that more aspirin will again dissolve.<br>
      <br>
      11. Repeat steps 7 through 10 until you have recovered all the
      aspirin, and the filter paper has only a thin layer of the
      excipients (typically calcium phosphate, starch, talc, etc. These
      impurities are added to the tablets to help them break up in
      water). Discard the filter paper. Dump the isopropanol down the
      drain, and wash it down with some tap water.<br>
      <br>
      12. Using new&nbsp; filter paper (medium porosity),&nbsp; filter
      any remaining isopropanol from the recovered aspirin crystals
      (third container).&nbsp; Rinse the third container with distilled
      water and wipe it dry. Dump the filtered crystals back into the
      third container and cover them with cold distilled water.
      Re-establish vacuum on the filter and filter the crystals again.
      This will rinse off any remaining isopropanol. Discard the liquid.
      (Repeat the procedure if you can still smell isopropanol on the
      crystals).<br>
      <br>
      13. Finally, gently dry the aspirin crystals. (I dried mine in an
      oven at 120 F. If you do this, BE SURE you have rinsed the
      crystals well enough so that there are no isopropanol vapors
      present. Isopropanol forms explosive vapors with air, and allowing
      these to accumulate in a confined space is a recipe for serious
      trouble. Also, aspirin tends to decompose when heated, especially
      in hot water, so I use only a warm temperature setting. )<br>

      Equipment and Materials required<br>
      <br>
      1. Copper sulfate pentahydrate 99%. This is usually available from
      a hardware store in the form of a product used to kill tree roots
      in sewers and septic tanks, such as Roebic K-77.<br>
      <br>
      2. Arm and Hammer Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate).<br>
      <br>
      3. A couple of quarts of distilled vinegar (5% acetic acid).<br>
      <br>
      4. A Pyrex casserole dish (22 x 11 x 6 cm or similar)<br>
      <br>
      5. Vacuum filtration facilities.<br>
      <br>
      6. Various clean, quart containers.<br>

        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of filtered copper
        sulfate solution</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Dissolve 3/4 cupful of copper sulfate crystals in about a quart
      of warm distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      2. Vacuum filter the solution through coarse porosity filter
      paper. This will filter out suspended solids (metal flecks,
      "dirt", etc.). Pour the filtrate off into a clear inspection
      container. Vacuum filter the solution again with medium porosity
      paper until it is clear blue. Note that the filtrate may still
      contain significant impurities (lead, arsenic, cadmium, etc.) at
      this point. Remember that this product is normally used in sewers.<br>
      <br>
      3. Save the clear blue solution for later use.<br>
      <br>
      (4. If you want higher purity copper sulfate, you can
      re-crystallize it at this point.)<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of sodium carbonate
        solution</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. Pour a cup full of sodium bicarbonate into a Pyrex casserole
      dish. Add distilled water sufficient to dissolve it.<br>
      <br>
      2. Heat the solution in an oven to about 200F. This will cause the
      bicarbonate to decompose into the carbonate with the evolution of
      carbon dioxide.&nbsp; The end result will be a solution of sodium
      carbonate.<br>
      <br>
      3. Let the solution cool to room temperature. Carbonates are
      somewhat less soluble than bicarbonates; add more distilled water
      if necessary to keep the material in solution.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of copper carbonate</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      1. In a large container, gradually combine the copper sulfate
      solution with the sodium carbonate solution. A blue-green
      precipitate will immediately form along with the vigorous release
      of carbon dioxide. Let the precipitate settle out.<br>
      <br>
      2. At this point the liquid portion will have either an excess of
      sodium carbonate or of copper sulfate. If you add a drop of sodium
      carbonate and see some precipitate form, then the bulk mixture
      needs more sodium carbonate solution added. Likewise, if you add a
      drop of copper sulfate and see a precipitate, then the bulk
      mixture needs more copper sulfate solution added. Make these
      adjustments as necessary until there is no longer an unambiguous
      formation of the blue-green precipitate.<br>
      <br>
      3. Vacuum filter the mixture with a coarse porosity paper filter.
      Discard the liquid. Wash with cold distilled water and then
      refilter. This will wash out any excess sodium carbonate or copper
      sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Preparation of copper acetate
        solution</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      4. To a quart container, add the still moist copper carbonate
      powder from the previous step. Then slowly pour vinegar into the
      container. Carbon dioxide will evolve and copper acetate will
      form. The solution will gradually become a deep blue color. A
      blue-green precipitate may also settle to the bottom of the
      container.<br>
      <br>
      5. Let the solution settle out. If there is a substantial amount
      of blue-green precipitate at the bottom of the container, add more
      vinegar. Try to dissolve most, but not all, of this precipitate.
      An excess of vinegar is harder to remove than a little of the
      precipitate.<br>
      <br>
      6. Using coarse paper, vacuum filter the resulting copper acetate
      solution. Repeat until clear. Discard the paper. Save the blue
      filtrate.<br>
      <br>
      7. Slowly evaporate the blue filtrate in a Pyrex casserole dish in
      an oven (150F) for several hours. Periodically scrape down the
      sides of the dish to prevent a build up of crystals. Continue the
      evaporation until some blue-black crystals of copper acetate begin
      to form (and do not redissolve). The mixture may also have some
      blue-green "pond scum" in it too.<br>
      <br>
      8. Cool and filter the dark blue solution. Store it in a clear
      glass container for observation (a one quart vinegar bottle works
      fine). This is the saturated copper acetate solution that will be
      used to make copper aspirinate.<br>
      <br>
      9. If you want to make copper acetate crystals, continue the
      evaporation process until blue-black crystals form. This will
      require evaporating most, but not all, of the solution. Impurities
      (and excess vinegar) tend to remain in solution instead of
      crystallizing out. Hence, it is necessary to discard a small
      portion of the original solution. Collect the crystals on the
      vacuum filter and discard the leftover liquid. Wash the blue-black
      crystals with a little bit of cold distilled water. Then dry and
      store them in a labeled container.<br>

      <br>
      1. Put about 4 tsp of pure aspirin crystals (see above) and 1/2
      cup distilled water into a small, clean&nbsp; jar (such as one
      used for canning pickles or olives).<br>
      <br>
      2. Place jar on a hot pad in a shallow pan in an oven set to about
      225F.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the aspirin hydrolyze into acetic and
      salicylic acids for an hour or two. (Add a little more water if
      all the crystals have not dissolved in the hot liquid.)<br>
      <br>
      3. Cool the liquid in the refrigerator. You should see needle-like
      crystals.<br>
      <br>
      4. Vacuum filter and wash the crystals with cold distilled water.
      This will remove acetic acid residue.<br>
      <br>
      5. Dump the crystals out of the filter and air dry them. (they
      usually come out as a mat of fine needles). Store in a properly
      labeled bottle.<br>

      until all the crystals dissolve.<br>
      <br>
      3. Test the pH. Add more salicylic acid or bicarbonate to get pH
      of about 6 (slightly acid). This is now a solution of sodium

      solution in sequence to prepare the nanocopper, and the nanocopper
      is thinner in grain size, smaller in distribution range and more
      uniform.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical field</b><br>
      The invention relates to the technical field of metal copper
      powder preparation, in particular to a three-step reduction
      preparation process of nano copper powder.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background technique</b><b><br>
      </b>There are many kinds of preparation methods for copper powder,
      and there are high energy ball milling method and vapor phase
      deposition method in physical methods. The ball milling method
      selects a suitable ball mill and ball milling material, and uses
      the rotation or vibration of the ball mill to make the hard ball
      strongly impact, crush and grind the material, and break the
      copper block into ultrafine particles. The advantages of the ball
      milling method are simple. The yield is high, and the disadvantage
      is that the obtained copper powder has a wide particle size
      distribution, many impurities, and low purity. Vapor deposition is
      a method of preparing copper powder by rapidly cooling metal
      copper after heating and melting in an inert gas such as argon gas
      or helium gas. Electrolytic preparation of copper powder is a
      relatively common and industrial method for the production of
      copper powder. Generally, in a copper electrolysis cell, the
      copper powder deposited on the cathode is scraped off at intervals
      of 20 minutes to avoid particle growth. The scraped copper powder
      is subjected to ball milling, sieving and the like to obtain the
      finally obtained copper powder. Ultrasonic electrolysis is an
      improved electrolysis process that uses ultrasonic vibration and
      cavitation to generate high pressure or jets to cause deposited
      copper particles to detach from the surface of the cathode and to
      suspend the particles in the electrolyte. In addition, there are
      high temperature, high pressure hydrothermal method, ?-ray
      irradiation method, polyol method and microwave polyol method.
      Among the numerous preparation methods of copper powder, the
      method of preparing copper powder by reducing soluble copper salt
      is one of the common methods for preparing copper powder in
      laboratory and industry. The commonly used reducing agents include
      reducing agents such as glucose, ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide,
      formaldehyde, sodium hypophosphite, hydrazine hydrate, and
      potassium borohydride. In many laboratory experiments, copper
      powder is mostly prepared by the application of a reducing
      reagent. For example, Liao Wei prepared 40-200 nm copper powder
      with formaldehyde as a reducing agent; Zhao Bin prepared hydrazine
      hydrate as a reducing reagent. With ~500nm copper powder, the
      prepared copper powder has a very wide particle size.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the invention</b><b><br>
