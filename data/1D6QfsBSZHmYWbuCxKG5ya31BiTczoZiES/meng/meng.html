        <div align="left"> Imagine a day when a submarine could blast a
          target to smithereens using nothing more than acoustic energy.
          That’s the idea behind a recently granted U.S. Navy patent for
          a cavitation weapon. The powerful weapon would use sonar to
          generate "acoustic remote cavitation," i.e. a big pressure
          bubble, that would destroy everything from torpedoes to mines.
          As the patent describes:<br>
          <br>
          A method is disclosed of generating a predetermined field of
          cavitation around a remote target in an underwater
          environment. The method includes the steps of identifying a
          remote target location, generating at least two acoustic
          beams, each at a high power output, from an underwater
          acoustic source, and controlling the generated acoustic beams
          to intersect with each other at the remote target location and
          thereby create a destructive cavitation field at the
          intersection of the beams. The acoustic source and target can
          be located in unconfined underwater space and at a distance of
          at least 100 m apart.<br>
          <br>
          Underwater cavitation is being looked at for a number of
          applications — including superfast sub and missiles, but this
          is different; it would actually use pure acoustic energy to
          destroy things, i.e. no bombs or missiles involved. The
          potential applications include "mine neutralization; torpedo
          self-defense, melee close-in encounter; and any sources or
          communication systems that must be left behind."<br>
          <br>
          The underlying physics is based on the intense heat and
          high-pressure pulse from the sonar sources 12, 14, and 16 as
          the damage mechanisms by virtue of the intense acoustic power
          of the sonar sources. An ensuing cavitation bubble formation
          and collapse and shock propagation will also inflict damages
          on underwater objects 18 targeted for removal. The technical
          drivers are the cavitation lethality on the undesirable
          objects 18 and the acoustic power of the sonar sources versus
          range and depth.<br>
          <br>
          In an intriguing note on other uses, the patent says: "In view
          of the above detailed description, it is anticipated that the
          invention herein will have far reaching applications other
          than those of underwater destruction of undesirable objects."<br>
          <br>
          Any ideas what that could be?<br>

          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>(1) Field of the Invention</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          This invention generally relates to an environmentally clean
          device to eliminate or destroy unwanted underwater objects
          remotely without using explosive materials. More particularly,
          the invention uses a general-purpose active sonar array to
          remotely eliminate or destroy unwanted underwater objects.<br>
          <br>
          <b>(2) Description of the Prior Art</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The current art for the underwater destruction of unwanted
          objects is as varied as the devices to be destroyed.<br>
          <br>
          The following patents, for example, disclose a generating a
          cavitation area at a very close range and/or within an
          enclosed space and at high frequencies, but do not disclose
          generating a cavitation in an essentially free water space and
          at relatively low frequencies in order to destroy a target
          within that free space.<br>
          <br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 4,244,749 to Sachs et al.;<br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 4,681,264 to Johnson, Jr.<br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,035,363 to Somoza;<br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,209,221 to Reidlinger;<br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,681,396 to Madanshetty; and<br>
          U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,204 to Grandia et al.<br>
          <br>
          Specifically, Sachs et al. discloses removal of biofouling
          from the external surfaces of spaced apart pipes of a heat
          exchanger which are in contact with a liquid by positioning a
          plurality of ultrasonic transducers between the pipes and
          operating the transducers at sufficient power levels to cause
          cavitation within the liquid to effect the desired cleaning
          action. The transducers are arranged in a planar configuration
          to produce bi-directional acoustic radiation. Various types of
          instrumentation are provided for determining the extent of
          biofouling and effectiveness of cleaning as well as for
          monitoring transducer operation parameters.<br>
          <br>
          The patent to Johnson, Jr. discloses a process and apparatus
          for enhancing the erosive intensity of a high velocity liquid
          jet when the jet is impacted against a surface for cutting,
          cleaning, drilling or otherwise acting on the surface. A
          preferred method comprises the steps of forming a high
          velocity liquid jet, oscillating the velocity of the jet at a
          preferred Strouhal number, and impinging the pulsed jet
          against a solid surface to be eroded. Typically the liquid jet
          is pulsed by oscillating the velocity of the jet mechanically
          or by hydrodynamic and acoustic interactions. The invention
          may be applied to enhance cavitation erosion in a cavitating
          liquid jet, or to modulate the velocity of a liquid jet
          exiting in a gas, causing it to form into discrete slugs,
          thereby producing an intermittent percussive effect.<br>
          <br>
          Somoza discloses reducing the particle size of energetic
          explosive materials by slurrying the particulate explosive
          materials in an inert liquid such as water or an aqueous
          solution, and subjecting the slurry to intense acoustic
          cavitation from an ultrasonic generator for a short time. The
          particulate explosive materials are rapidly ground to a small
          particle size while minimizing the danger of detonation.<br>
          <br>
          Riedlinger discloses a device for generating sonic signal
          forms for limiting, preventing or regressing the growth of
          pathological tissue that comprises an ultrasonic transmission
          system for transmitting sound waves, focused on the tissue to
          be treated, by way of a coupling medium. An ultrasonic signal
          produced at the focus of the system comprises brief pulses
          having at least one rarefaction phase with a negative sonic
          pressure amplitude with a value greater than 2*10&lt;5 &gt;
          Pa. The ultrasonic signal is radiated with a carrier frequency
          exceeding 20 kHz, a sonic pulse duration T of less than 100
          [mu]s and a pulse recurrence rate of less than 0/(5T). The
          device produces controlled cavitation in the tissue to be
          treated.<br>
          <br>
          The patent to Madanshetty discloses the surgical cleaning of a
          semiconductor wafer through the inducement of cavitation on
          the surface of the wafer at the location of an adherent
          particle. Cavitation is induced by focusing two acoustic
          fields on the surface of the wafer. The two acoustic fields
          include a cavitation field having relatively low frequency
          focused on the wafer surface from a direction perpendicular to
          the wafer and a coaxing field of relatively high frequency
          focused on the wafer surface from a direction between 0 and 25
          degrees from the wafer surface.<br>
          <br>
          Grandia et al. discloses medical noninvasive operations using
          focused modulated high power ultrasound that generally
          includes a transmitter for exciting a multifrequency
          ultrasound wave for causing vaporous cavitation bubbles in a
          small focal zone of a medical target region. Focused
          ultrasound can be used for both dissolving tissues as well as
          causing clots in order to destroy cancerous growths. The
          multifrequency wave includes an underlying low frequency
          signal for enabling optimal growth of microbubbles and at
          least one high frequency signal for enabling a narrow zone of
          focus of the ultrasound. A cavitation monitor may be provided
          for sensing a level of cavitation as well as providing
          feedback to the transmitter. In addition, an imaging system is
          provided for enabling viewing of the medical target area
          during the therapy.<br>
          <br>
          It should be understood that the present invention would in
          fact enhance the functionality of the above patents by
          providing an array of intersecting acoustic beams in free
          water space, the acoustic beams being generated at a frequency
          and range to create a destructive cavitation field around an
          undesirable remote target.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          Therefore it is an object of this invention to provide a
          self-defense weapon utilizing acoustic remote cavitation.<br>

          beams, each at a peak power output, from an underwater energy
          source, and controlling the generated acoustic beams to
          intersect with each other at the remote target location and
          thereby create a destructive cavitation field at the
          intersection of the beams.<br>

          <b> </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b>In general, the present invention is directed to an
          environmentally clean self-defense weapon, generally shown in
          operation in FIG. 1. The weapon 10 includes an array of
          selectively activated sonar devices 12, 14, 16, that will
          eliminate or destroy unwanted underwater objects 18 remotely
          without using explosive materials. It is a characteristic of
          the present invention that the underwater environment is that
          of free and open underwater space such as that found in lakes,
          oceans and other large bodies of water.<br>
          <br>
          The underwater object 18 targeted for destruction is shown
          generically in FIG. 1 and may include mines, incoming
          torpedoes, marine fouling barnacles, and emergency rescue
          operations. It will be understood that the position of the
          underwater object 18 is not necessarily specifically
          identifiable, yet is within a range of about 100 meters to
          about 1 Km from a source vessel such as a submarine 20.<br>
          <br>
          The weapon 10, including the array of sonar devices 12, 14,
          16, is mounted to or formed in connection with the submarine
          20 or similar underwater vehicle capable of transporting and
          providing power to the weapon array 10. In the subject of FIG.
          1, the weapon array 10, including three sonar devices 12, 14,
          16, is shown to be targeting the object 18 located a distance
          22 from the submarine 20. The sonar sources 12, 14, 16 of the
          weapon 10 are mounted on the submarine 20 at predetermined
          intervals. For example, a first sonar source 12 may be mounted
          at the nose 30 of the submarine 20, a second sonar source 14
          mounted at a mid-section 32 of the submarine 20, and a third
          sonar source 16 mounted at a tail 34 of the submarine 20. This
          array spacing and number of sonar sources is by way of example
          only and will be modified to suit the particular underwater
          transport source. Regardless of the spacing of the array 10 or
          number of sonar sources used, the beams 12b, 14b, 16b from the
          sonar sources 12, 14, and 16, respectively, will be directed
          to intersect at a cavitating focal point coinciding with the
          determined location of the target 18. The intersecting beams
          at the cavitating focal point of the sonar sources will create
          a destructive cavitation field generally identified at 24 in
          FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          The sonar sources 12, 14, and 16 of the weapon 10 are
          activated to generate a focused beam at a frequency of 10 KHz
          to 15 KHz. All calculations for target 18 location, output
          frequencies, intersecting focal points of the sonar sources
          12, 14, 16, and required signals to control "firing" of the
          sonar sources is by way of an on-board computer 26 connected
          to the sonar sources.<br>
          <br>
          Any general-purpose active sonar source can be used to
          assemble a weapon array 10 as in the present invention. The
          underlying physics is based on the intense heat and
          high-pressure pulse from the sonar sources 12, 14, and 16 as
          the damage mechanisms by virtue of the intense acoustic power
          of the sonar sources. An ensuing cavitation bubble formation
          and collapse and shock propagation will also inflict damages
          on underwater objects 18 targeted for removal. The technical
          drivers are the cavitation lethality on the undesirable
          objects 18 and the acoustic power of the sonar sources versus
          range and depth.<br>
          <br>
          Any sonar array can be used in this mode. The stand off
          distance is the focal length of the array as defined by the
          intersection of the separate sonar sources 12, 14, 16. A
          function of physical dimension of the array is that the longer
          the span of the array along the support member 20, the farther
          away the standoff or target distance may be.<br>
          <br>
          Historically, an acoustic array is always designed to avoid
          cavitation. This invention seeks to operate the acoustic array
          weapon 10 at its peak power output to maximize cavitation at
          the focal point of the array. The key elements of the
          operation are: computation of the focal point location and
          acoustic beamforming to cover the object location.<br>
          <br>
          There are several advantages to the present invention
          including a lack of environmentally detrimental residues that
          will be generated. Further, beamforming greatly reduces
          response time so that more objects can be removed in a given
          time. Also, the present invention reduces cost per object
          removed. This concept also enables all sonar to be used as a
          device to remove undesirable objects. Furthermore, without any
          explosives and the increased standoff distance from the
          device, the operating platform of the underwater vessel 20
          with the sonar array 10 will not suffer any damage.<br>

          FIG. 2 is a graph illustrating linear and non-linear
          absorption losses over a temperature range of 0 to 13 degrees
          Celsius and a frequency of 1 to 30 KHz. FIG. 3 is a graph
          illustrating acoustic power requirement versus range and depth
          at 30 KHz.<br>
          <br>
          The potential applications are numerous, and include without
          limitation thereto: mine neutralization; torpedo self-defense,
          melee close-in encounter; and any sources or communication
          systems that must be left behind.<br>
          <br>
          In view of the above detailed description, it is anticipated
          that the invention herein will have far reaching applications
          other than those of underwater destruction of undesirable
          objects.<br>
