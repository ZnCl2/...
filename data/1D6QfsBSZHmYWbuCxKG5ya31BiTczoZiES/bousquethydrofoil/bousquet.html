        <i>Autonomous glider can fly like an albatross, cruise like a
          sailboat.</i><br>
        <b>by Jennifer Chu</b><br>

      <br>
      MIT engineers have designed a robotic glider that can skim along
      the water's surface, riding the wind like an albatross while also
      surfing the waves like a sailboat.<br>
      <br>
      In regions of high wind, the robot is designed to stay aloft, much
      like its avian counterpart. Where there are calmer winds, the
      robot can dip a keel into the water to ride like a highly
      efficient sailboat instead.<br>
      <br>
      The robotic system, which borrows from both nautical and
      biological designs, can cover a given distance using one-third as
      much wind as an albatross and traveling 10 times faster than a
      typical sailboat. The glider is also relatively lightweight,
      weighing about 6 pounds. The researchers hope that in the near
      future, such compact, speedy robotic water-skimmers may be
      deployed in teams to survey large swaths of the ocean.<br>
      <br>
      "The oceans remain vastly undermonitored," says Gabriel Bousquet,
      a former postdoc in MIT's Department of Aeronautics and
      Astronautics, who led the design of the robot as part of his
      graduate thesis. "In particular, it's very important to understand
      the Southern Ocean and how it is interacting with climate change.
      But it's very hard to get there. We can now use the energy from
      the environment in an efficient way to do this long-distance
      travel, with a system that remains small-scale."<br>
      <br>
      Bousquet will present details of the robotic system this week at
      IEEE's International Conference on Robotics and Automation, in
      Brisbane, Australia. His collaborators on the project are
      Jean-Jacques Slotine, professor of mechanical engineering and
      information sciences and of brain sciences; and Michael
      Triantafyllou, the Henry L. and Grace Doherty Professor in Ocean
      Science and Engineering.<br>

      <br>
      <b>The physics of speed</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Last year, Bousquet, Slotine, and Triantafyllou published a study
      on the dynamics of albatross flight, in which they identified the
      mechanics that enable the tireless traveler to cover vast
      distances while expending minimal energy. The key to the bird's
      marathon voyages is its ability to ride in and out of high- and
      low-speed layers of air.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the researchers found the bird is able to perform a
      mechanical process called a "transfer of momentum," in which it
      takes momentum from higher, faster layers of air, and by diving
      down transfers that momentum to lower, slower layers, propelling
      itself without having to continuously flap its wings.<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, Bousquet observed that the physics of albatross
      flight is very similar to that of sailboat travel. Both the
      albatross and the sailboat transfer momentum in order to keep
      moving. But in the case of the sailboat, that transfer occurs not
      between layers of air, but between the air and water.<br>
      <br>
      "Sailboats take momentum from the wind with their sail, and inject
      it into the water by pushing back with their keel," Bousquet
      explains. "That's how energy is extracted for sailboats."<br>
      <br>
      Bousquet also realized that the speed at which both an albatross
      and a sailboat can travel depends upon the same general equation,
      related to the transfer of momentum. Essentially, both the bird
      and the boat can travel faster if they can either stay aloft
      easily or interact with two layers, or mediums, of very different
      speeds.<br>
      <br>
      The albatross does well with the former, as its wings provide
      natural lift, though it flies between air layers with a relatively
      small difference in windspeeds. Meanwhile, the sailboat excels at
      the latter, traveling between two mediums of very different speeds
      -- air versus water -- though its hull creates a lot of friction
      and prevents it from getting much speed. Bousquet wondered: What
      if a vehicle could be designed to perform well in both metrics,
      marrying the high-speed qualities of both the albatross and the
      sailboat?<br>
      <br>
      "We thought, how could we take the best from both worlds?"
      Bousquet says.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>Out on the water</b><br>
      <br>
      The team drafted a design for such a hybrid vehicle, which
      ultimately resembled an autonomous glider with a 3-meter wingspan,
      similar to that of a typical albatross. They added a tall,
      triangular sail, as well as a slender, wing-like keel. They then
      performed some mathematical modeling to predict how such a design
      would travel.<br>
      <br>
      According to their calculations, the wind-powered vehicle would
      only need relatively calm winds of about 5 knots to zip across
      waters at a velocity of about 20 knots, or 23 miles per hour.<br>
      <br>
      "We found that in light winds you can travel about three to 10
      times faster than a traditional sailboat, and you need about half
      as much wind as an albatross, to reach 20 knots," Bousquet says.
      "It's very efficient, and you can travel very fast, even if there
      is not too much wind."<br>
      <br>
      The team built a prototype of their design, using a glider
      airframe designed by Mark Drela, professor of aeronautics and
      astronautics at MIT. To the bottom of the glider they added a
      keel, along with various instruments, such as GPS, inertial
      measurement sensors, auto-pilot instrumentation, and ultrasound,
      to track the height of the glider above the water.<br>
      <br>
      "The goal here was to show we can control very precisely how high
      we are above the water, and that we can have the robot fly above
      the water, then down to where the keel can go under the water to
      generate a force, and the plane can still fly," Bousquet says.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers decided to test this "critical maneuver" -- the
      act of transitioning between flying in the air and dipping the
      keel down to sail in the water. Accomplishing this move doesn't
      necessarily require a sail, so Bousquet and his colleagues decided
      not to include one in order to simplify preliminary experiments.<br>
      <br>
      In the fall of 2016, the team put its design to the test,
      launching the robot from the MIT Sailing Pavilion out onto the
      Charles River. As the robot lacked a sail and any mechanism to get
      it started, the team hung it from a fishing rod attached to a
      whaler boat. With this setup, the boat towed the robot along the
      river until it reached about 20 miles per hour, at which point the
      robot autonomously "took off," riding the wind on its own.<br>
      <br>
      Once it was flying autonomously, Bousquet used a remote control to
      give the robot a "down" command, prompting it to dip low enough to
      submerge its keel in the river. Next, he adjusted the direction of
      the keel, and observed that the robot was able to steer away from
      the boat as expected. He then gave a command for the robot to fly
      back up, lifting the keel out of the water.<br>
      <br>
      "We were flying very close to the surface, and there was very
      little margin for error -- everything had to be in place,"
      Bousquet says. "So it was very high stress, but very exciting."<br>
      <br>
      The experiments, he says, prove that the team's conceptual device
      can travel successfully, powered by the wind and the water.
      Eventually, he envisions fleets of such vehicles autonomously and
      efficiently monitoring large expanses of the ocean.<br>
      <br>
      "Imagine you could fly like an albatross when it's really windy,
      and then when there's not enough wind, the keel allows you to sail
      like a sailboat," Bousquet says. "This dramatically expands the
      kinds of regions where you can go."<br>

        <b>FLYING CRAFT WITH REALTIME CONTROLLED HYDROFOIL</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Inventor: BOUSQUET GABRIEL</b><br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This disclosure describes a vehicle configured and arranged to
      generate lift and drag using a plurality of lifting or control
      surfaces including a water-piercing hydrofoil disposed below said
      vehicle, and a method for real-time control of said lifting or
      control surfaces by controlling at least the hydrofoil with an
      actuator that is actuated responsive to measured input signals
      including forces on said hydrofoil.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>&nbsp;Technical Field</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present application relates generally to the design and
      control of vehicles, including craft having lifting or control
      surfaces for generating lift, and specifically flying and sailing
      craft where the craft's dynamics are affected by both airborne
      lifting surfaces and hydrofoil design and operation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Vehicles that travel over land and water include aircraft,
      which have airborne lifting control surfaces, commonly referred to
      as wings, generating upward lift to counter the downward force of
      gravity acting on the aircraft, and other lifting surfaces as
      needed to steer and stabilize the aircraft. Ships, boats and other
      watercraft, especially sail boats, are known to generate fluid
      dynamic forces with their lifting surfaces to propel these craft
      from one location to another on the surface of a body of water. In
      general, the operation of wind-propelled systems relies on three
      functions: one function counters the force of gravity, such as the
      buoyancy of the hull of a sailboat, another function slows down
      the wind, providing a generally down-wind and forward force such
      as provided by the sail of a sailboat, and yet another function
      generates a balancing upwind force by applying force on a slow
      medium, such as the keel of a sailboat in water. In some prior
      systems with a hydrofoil in water, the hydrofoil may not always be
      structurally able to withstand the forces it could otherwise
      generate under certain travel conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Some craft designs have been proposed to travel on or above
      the surface of water using a plurality of airborne and waterborne
      lifting or control surfaces. It is unclear whether all such
      designs are practical, safe, economical, efficient or even
      feasible. Existing systems have difficulties to contact and leave
      the water surface repeatedly especially if the water surface is
      not extremely flat. For instance, hydrofoil boats fail when their
      hydrofoil leaves the water as reentry is often a catastrophic
      event (due to the large forces at play, and their complicated and
      unsteady nature due to surface effect and transient ventilation
      and cavitation), and hydroplanes can only land on sheltered
      waters.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] U.S. Pat. No. 3,800,724 is directed to a winged sailing
      craft having two elongated and equivalent aerial wings (one
      vertical and the other horizontal) as well as a water-piercing
      hydrofoil disposed vertically beneath said sailing craft to
      generate upwind force. U.S. Pat. No. 6,341 ,571 is directed to a
      wind-powered air/water interface craft having pivoting wings with
      various angles and configurations, including a combination of
      aerial dihedral wings and a water-piercing hydrofoil arranged in a
      triangular configuration with respect to one another. And U.S.
      Pat. No. 6,032,603 is directed to a method and apparatus to
      purportedly increase the velocity of sailing vessels,
      incorporating aerial sails above water and below-water
      (water-piercing) lift and keel rudder elements. Each of the
      foregoing references, given by way of example, are hereby
      incorporated by reference.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] One problem the present system and method can address is
      that of dynamic stability and robustness. Some prior art designs
      of flying sailboats rely on concept wings that purportedly act as
      sails and vice-versa when tacking between starboard and port. The
      dihedral arrangement of such wings makes them sensitive in roll to
      wind gusts. Other prior attempts to make flying sailboats suffer
      from over complex mechanical designs such as hinged wings, costly
      or unwieldy form factors, and other challenges such as floats and
      hydrofoils at the wing tips which are potentially the source of
      unacceptable yawing moments. As another example of prior art
      challenges, external forces such as pitching forces and frictional
      forces on a craft would cause the craft to stumble
      catastrophically if the craft encounters external drag forces
      causing it to develop excessive moments about some axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The above-mentioned and similar references purport to solve
      certain problems and offer certain advantages. However, the state
      of the art solutions are generally impractical, unstable, and are
      less than ideal for many applications.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>Detailed Description</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] An object of this invention is to provide useful vehicle
      systems and methods for operating and controlling such vehicles or
      craft. The present craft are at least sometimes operated proximal
      to an interface of two fluids. In the most general case,
      embodiments hereof can operate at or near an interface separating
      two fluids of different densities, including two liquids, a liquid
      and a gas, or two gases. In a preferred embodiment, the present
      invention can be operated at an air-water interface such as would
      be found at the surface of an ocean, lake, river or other natural
      or man- made body of water. By design, the present systems and
      methods can provide a craft body and a plurality of foils or
      lifting or control surfaces coupled, rigidly and/or moveably, to
      said craft body. In an embodiment, at least one aerial lifting or
      control surface or wing of the craft is disposed so as to move
      through the air above the air- water interface, while at least one
      hydrofoil of the craft is disposed so as to move through the water
      below the air-water interface. [0026] Generally, the present
      system and method can provide a vessel, vehicle or craft that can
      travel substantially in the air, at, or near and above the surface
      of water. The craft may have both airborne and water-piercing
      control surfaces to provide needed lift, drag or other forces to
      stabilize and/or drive the craft. Other modes of operation of the
      present craft are also possible, as will be described below and
      understood by those of skill in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The present craft is adaptable for operation with an
      external and/or internal propulsion system. For example, the craft
      may be towed or co-propelled with another vessel, e.g., in
      side-car mode. In another example, the craft may use an onboard
      electric, gasoline, solar or other propulsion mechanism, i.e.,
      pushing itself through the air and/or water.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Fig. 1 A illustrates a vehicle, vessel or craft 10, and in
      particular a perspective view of said craft 10, according to an
      embodiment hereof. Craft 10 comprises a vehicle or craft body 100,
      which may be constructed, dimensioned and arranged according to
      any reasonable form, for example to carry persons, a payload, or
      test equipment, or to conform to any desired application. Craft
      body 100 is elongated for aerodynamic performance and has a
      forward or nose section near its front and an aft section 104 near
      its tail 130. Some embodiments hereof may further incorporate
      canard control surfaces, V-shaped tails, or other elements as
      suits a given application.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The materials of construction of body 100 may be of
      appropriate solid materials providing rigidity and structural
      integrity, yet preferably light in weight so as to allow for
      practical flight of the craft 10 without undue structural load.
      For example, body 100 may be formed from a polymer resin,
      fiberglass, carbon fiber, composite, wood, thin shell aluminum
      panels, or other suitable sheet, cast or molded material. In some
      embodiments, craft 10 is configured and designed as a small craft
      for scientific observation, measurement and similar test purposes,
      and may be dimensioned to have a length and/or span on the order
      of one meter (1 m). However, this disclosure and invention are not
      so limited, and can scale as needed for other applications, the
      scaling of such vessels being a subject known to those skilled in
      the art. The craft 10 is designed to travel in a forward direction
      12, generally along a long axis of body 100 as show by the arrow
      in Fig. 1 A.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] Mechanically coupled to body 100 is a wing structure 1 10,
      which in the shown embodiment comprises a port section 1 12 and a
      starboard section 1 14 that may be formed as a single structure or
      as separate structures, as would be appreciated by those skilled
      in the arts of aircraft design. The wing 1 10 is designed to
      provide aerodynamic lift perpendicular to a direction of air flow
      over said control surface, or generally perpendicular to an upper
      face 1 13 of wing 1 10. The lift can be quantified by the
      dimensions, including the chord distribution, span and profile or
      cross-sectional geometry of wing 1 10 as known to those skilled in
      the art of aircraft design. The wing 1 10 may be fixed in some
      specific embodiments, but wing 1 10 may also be mechanically
      articulated about one or more degrees of freedom in other<br>
      <br>
      embodiments, or wing 1 10 may have one or more ailerons that are
      mechanically positionable according to a need so as to modify the
      provided lift of wing 1 10. As with body 100, wing 1 10 may be
      constructed and arranged according to methods and designs known to
      those skilled in the art, and may be constructed of a same or
      different material as body 100 (e.g., using the materials
      mentioned above by way of example). [0031] Tail section 130 is
      coupled to body 100 as would be appreciated by those skilled in
      the art of aircraft design. Tail section 130 may comprise one part
      or may comprise several parts, for example having both horizontal
      planes 132 and one or more vertical tail section sails 134, each
      providing lift in the respective dimension depending on its
      orientation. Also, a tail member having a V-shaped configuration
      may be used in other examples.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] In the shown embodiment, a vertical aerial control member
      or sail 120 is coupled to body 100, the sail 120 extending from
      its coupling point upwardly along the upward direction 14 as shown
      in Fig. 1 , where the upward direction 14 is perpendicular to the
      forward direction 12 of craft 10. The sail 120 may be actuated
      about a generally vertical axis, of lift controllable by means of
      flaps, or it may be fixed in which case the sail lift may be
      controlled by yawing the craft's body.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In addition, craft 10 is equipped with an elongated
      downwardly-pointing hydrofoil 140, which is mechanically coupled
      to craft body 100 and which defined a span, cord distribution and
      cross-sectional foil profile to be discussed in more detail below.
      Hydrofoil 140 is designed to penetrate the air-water surface above
      which craft 10 travels so that at least a (distal or lower)
      portion of the span of hydrofoil 140 is beneath the air-water
      interface during flight of craft 10, while some (proximal or
      upper) portion of the span is in air above the air-water
      interface. As would be appreciated, when craft 10 is traveling
      forward along general direction 12, the actuation of any of its
      control surfaces, wings, foils, etc., such as hydrofoil 140 would
      cause a corresponding interaction with the respective surrounding
      fluid (e.g., air, water) and cause a corresponding fluid dynamic
      force or moment. [0034] Hydrofoil 140 is configured and arranged
      to be mechanically actuated by an actuator that provides rotation
      of hydrofoil 140 about a long axis thereof as illustrated by
      rotation arrow 142. As will be described in more detail below, the
      actuation, rotation, or turning of hydrofoil 140 can be used to
      controllably stabilize the movement of craft 10 under load (during
      flight) including by controlling lift and drag forces generated by
      hydrofoil 140, especially using the distal (lower) portion of
      hydrofoil 140 that is submerged beneath the surface of an
      air-water interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Fig. 1 C is a side view of craft 10 in one example
      embodiment. We see that the control members (e.g., sails, wings,
      foils) can extend upwardly or downwardly from the body 100 of
      craft 10. These control members, or portions thereof, can be
      controllable using actuators to mechanically position the members
      or the controllable portions. For example, vertical sail 120 may
      be rotatable about its vertical axis, in its entirety, and/or it
      may be modified by adjustment of an aileron 121 at the trailing
      edge of sail 120. The same can be said for vertical tail member
      and aileron 131 . The figure also shows a global positioning
      system (GPS) antenna or sensor or communicator 170. As will be
      described in more detail below, GPS sensor 170 is used to obtain
      real-time absolute position and/or speed data for craft 10, which
      are used in some embodiments as input data to a processor used to
      control the flight of craft 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] It should be appreciated that the present concepts may be
      applied to other fluid media than air and water, whether in an
      artificial environment or naturally occurring. For example, any
      gas may be substituted for the examples of air herein, and any
      liquid may be substituted for the examples of water herein, so
      long as these fluid media and interfaces support a given
      application of interest and are consistent with the present
      engineering and physical principles. [0037] Fig. 2 illustrates a
      top view of craft 10, where craft body 100 is in this example an
      elongated aerodynamic body designed for forward travel in a
      direction 12 generally in-line with a long axis of said body. The
      top view of vertical sail 120 illustrates that said sail 120 has
      an aerodynamic foil profile as suitable for a given application
      and to provide aerodynamic lift and/or drag to craft 10. In some<b>
      </b>embodiments, one or more of: wings 1 10, vertical sail 120
      and/or tail section(s) 130 may include controllable flaps,
      spoilers, ailerons, or similar control surfaces 1 15, or fully
      moveable pitch actuation for added control of an aerodynamic force
      provided thereby. For the sake of generality, such fluid dynamic
      surfaces are referred to as " lifting surfaces" , "control
      surfaces" or "control members" herein. Semantically speaking, it
      should be noted that the pitch as well as the angle of attack of a
      hydrofoil, sail or other vertically-disposed control surface may
      be about an axis of said member (e.g., about a vertical axis)
      whereas the overall pitch or angle of attack of the craft itself
      may be about another axis if the craft pitches during travel.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Fig. 3 illustrates a (port) side view of craft 10, which is
      designed and operated to travel to the left, generally along the
      long axis 12 of craft body 100. As described earlier, craft body
      100 is mechanically coupled to several wings, sails, foils or
      other fluid dynamic surfaces. Here, a vertical sail 120 is
      provided generally at a midsection of said body 100, a tail
      section 130 is affixed to body 100 at an aft end thereof. One or
      more (e.g., a horizontal and/or vertical) sections of sail 120
      and/or tail control surface(s) 130 may comprise
      mechanically-hinged ailerons 121 , 131 or subsections that are
      usable to assist in the craft's dynamics. For example, the
      ailerons 121 , 131 may be actuated by manually or
      computer-controlled means by way of electromechanical drives,
      servos, or hydraulic actuators. [0039] A downward-extending
      vertical hydrofoil 140 is mechanically coupled to body 100, in an
      embodiment, at or near a midsection of body 100 as shown.
      Hydrofoil 140 is generally an elongated fluid dynamic member,
      foil, blade, wing or similar member. Hydrofoil 140 has a first
      (upper, proximal) end 142 closest to craft body 100, and an
      opposing second (lower, distal, or terminal) end or tip 144
      furthest from craft body 100.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In typical operation, craft 10 is operated in a flying mode
      at or proximal to and above an air-water interface 15. Depending
      on the prevailing conditions, air-water interface 15 may be calm
      (having a generally linear cross-section as shown), or it may be
      wavy due to the presence of surface waves, for instance
      wind-driven gravity waves, on the surface of a body of water such
      as an open sea. In any case, craft 10 flies forward along
      direction 12, generally parallel to an undisturbed (or average)
      surface of such body of water. The actual dimensions of craft 10,
      its speed of travel and its altitude (a) above the surface 15 are
      all design matters and can depend on the desired operational
      characteristics of craft 10, prevailing physical conditions, and
      other factors. As will be discussed below, craft 10 is dynamically
      stable during flight, and for at least some periods of time,
      sustains a lower (distal) portion of its hydrofoil 140 in the
      lower fluid medium (here, and typically, water) as shown. Again,
      downward-extending hydrofoil 140 may be fixed with respect to the
      craft body, or it may be moveable in its entirety (e.g., rotating
      about an axis), and/or it may be equipped with ailerons or
      subsections that are moveable or separately articulated,
      especially at its trailing (aft) edge, which may be used for
      fine-tuning the forces provided by said hydrofoil during use.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] If craft 10 is in steady state motion, the mean lift and
      drag and gravitational and buoyancy forces thereon can lead to
      steady movement of craft 10 in the forward direction 12, generally
      cross-wind (e.g., at 90 degrees to the wind with up to a 45 degree
      or more variation thereabout) with little or no lateral
      (side-to-side) or vertical (up-and-down) movement, as well as
      little or no roll, pitch or yaw. For instance, roll can be set to
      zero by trimming the ailerons to compensate any roll moment
      generated by the hydrofoil or other lifting surfaces. In practical
      situations, as has been tested in open water bodies by the
      inventor, external time-varying forces act on craft 10 so as to
      disturb craft 10 somewhat from its nominal flight path. Primary
      examples are non-uniform water currents, eddies, turbulence and
      surface waves that affect craft 10 through the resulting unsteady
      hydrodynamic and aerodynamic forces of said water acting on the
      submerged portion of hydrofoil 140 and aerial control surfaces. It
      should be noted that the depth of immersion of hydrofoil 140 will
      typically be time-varying, which exposes varying surface area of
      hydrofoil 140 to the prevailing water forces thereon. That is,
      during times that craft 10 rises higher above the air-water
      interface 15 (i.e., elevation distance, a, increases) the surface
      area of hydrofoil 140 lower, submerged portion of hydrofoil 140
      exposed to water forces decreases, and hydrofoil 140 may even
      entirely rise above the water if the elevation distance, a,
      exceeds the length of the hydrofoil. The opposite occurs when
      craft 10 drops lower (i.e., elevation distance, a, decreases), as
      more of hydrofoil 140 dips into the water below surface 15,
      resulting in greater surface area of the hydrofoil exposed to the
      forces of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] If the overall span (active length in the elongated
      direction) of the hydrofoil 140 is b, we may consider its upper
      portion operating outside of (above) surface 15 at a given time t
      to bT (t) and its submerged (lower) portion operating below the
      surface 15 to be b2(t) where b=bT (t)+b2(t). In some embodiments,
      b1(t) may be equal to the reference height or flight altitude, a,
      of said craft. In some of the present mathematical discussion, the
      length of the immersed hydrofoil section may be referred to as " h
      " .<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Fig. 2 illustrates a more detailed exemplary cross-section
      of the portion of a craft 20 including a vertical sail 230
      extending upwardly from craft body 200 and a hydrofoil 240
      extending downwardly from craft body 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] A computer-controlled actuator, or plurality of actuators
      210 are used to control the one or more control surfaces of craft
      20. In an example, a plurality of sensors and environmental inputs
      deliver input signals to a processor or computer on board said
      craft 20. The processor or computer then uses said inputs, and
      stored machine-readable instructions, models, programs, data or
      other information to collectively generate output control signals
      for controlling one or more craft control surfaces. For example,
      actuator 210 may include an electro-mechanical actuator, servo, or
      similar apparatus 210. The actuator 210 is mechanically coupled to
      a coupling (e.g., gears, reduction mechanism, or direct drives)
      220 controlling an angular rotation 230 of shaft 220. More
      generally, direct or indirect pitch control may be employed and/or
      compliance or damping control may be used for the same or
      equivalent result. In addition, the system may control the
      equilibrium (rotation) angle of the hydroplane coupling shaft. In
      yet another aspect, a trailing edge flap or aileron can be used to
      set the equilibrium angle of attack of the hydrofoil's coupling
      shaft.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The present inventor has determined and tested a craft such
      as the one illustrated in the foregoing figures and has confirmed
      that with suitable real-time control of the craft's control
      surfaces, especially hydrofoil 140, the craft can be successfully
      operated and be stabilized under real conditions, including in the
      presence of surface waves that cause the elevation distance, a, to
      increase and decrease. [0046] In one embodiment, but not limiting
      of the present invention, one or both of vertical sail 120, 220
      and/or hydrofoil 140, 240 may be disposed at or proximal to a
      center of gravity of craft 10, 20 or craft body 100, 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] We now discuss some aspects of the dynamic operation of the
      present craft. Those skilled in the art would be able to take the
      present disclosure and generalize it or apply it to specific
      designs and modes of operation as desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In one aspect, the present system and method is controlled
      by a processor or computer that accepts a manageable number of
      inputs from sensors so as to generate real-time output control
      signals. Prior systems and methods lacked the present sensors,
      processors, outputs and actuators configured and adapted for a
      craft of suitable design. The present disclosure offers some
      non-limiting examples illustrating the operation of the present
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Hydrofoils generally may operate in fully wetted condition,
      or in partially or fully ventilated or cavitating condition or a
      combination thereof. Ventilation is the phenomenon where air in
      entrained to the region of low pressure on e.g. the suction side
      of a hydrofoil and forms a cavity. Ventilation is enabled by
      cavitation, flow separation and or connection of the trailing edge
      vortex to the free surface. Cavitation is when the local pressure
      on the suction face of the hydrofoil falls below the pressure of
      water vaporization. Like ventilation, cavitation is associated
      with a severe loss of lift and increase of drag. As a rule of
      thumb, cavitation starts being a possibility for high lift
      surfaces near 20kts and is very likely to be present on most
      airfoils above 50 kts. Ventilation and cavitation are favored at
      large lift coefficients. As a rule of thumb, hydrofoils designed
      for fully wetted flows don't perform well when ventilation or
      cavitation occurs, and conversely, hydrofoils designed for
      cavitating or ventilated flows relatively don't perform well in
      fully wetted flows.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In an aspect, the present system and method can overcome
      the adverse effects of cavitation and/or ventilation, which can
      occur under certain fluid dynamic conditions. The hydrofoils may
      be designed to operate at small lift coefficients. With careful
      airfoil selection and hydrofoil control as explained below,
      cavitation is unlikely to appear until at least 30 kts and
      ventilation may be avoided. On hydrofoils designed for
      non-ventilating flows, ventilation induces a loss of lift as well
      as a significant increase in drag, which might be sufficient to
      create a significant pitch down moment onto the airplane, which
      can lead to the failure of the flight process if not properly
      controlled or avoided. The small lift coefficients of the
      hydrofoil in the present application are not favorable to
      ventilation inception. The present system and method are designed
      to detect and/or avoid these effects in the first place prior to
      failure of the traveling craft takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In another aspect, the foil may be designed to induce
      ventilation or cavitation (rather than a rounded nose airfoil
      profile, it could for instance be a wedge profile, as one skilled
      in the field would know.). In this instance, non-
      ventilating/cavitating flow is an undesired mode of operation and
      can be detected and avoided with the sensors discussed in this
      disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Fig. 3 illustrates an exemplary hydrofoil 340 according to
      one or more embodiments hereof, coupled to a craft body 300, and
      extending downwardly therefrom. Hydrofoil 340 includes a forward
      -facing leading edge 342 and a rear-facing or trailing edge 344.
      Hydrofoil 340 may be further actuated and rotated about its long
      axis at shaft 310, e.g., using a servo as described above. We
      discussed measuring and taking inputs for real-time control of the
      present system. In an aspect, one or more strain gauges, force
      sensors/ meters, accelerometers, or displacement gauges 343, 345
      (generally "force gauges") are provided on hydrofoil 340, or to a
      shaft or coupling connecting the hydrofoil 340 to the rest of the
      craft. The aim being that the hydrodynamic forces and moments on
      the hydrofoil can be measured. The force gauges 343, 345 are used
      to measure forces on hydrofoil 340. Specifically, force gauge 343
      may be used to measure a sideways force or moment 343a in a
      direction or about an axis corresponding to a sensitivity of force
      gauge 343 (for example, along a direction normal to the main
      surfaces of the hydrofoil). In a particular, but not limiting
      example, force gauge 343 comprises one or more strain gauges
      measuring a strain resulting from deflection of hydrofoil 340
      during its travel as a portion of the hydrofoil is submerged in a
      liquid (e.g., water) and subject to the forces exerted by the
      water on the surface of hydrofoil 340. Those skilled in the art
      will understand that additional force gauges, such as strain
      gauges or others as mentioned above, can be used to measure
      strains or forces or moments about other directions. For
      illustrative purposes, Fig. 3 shows a second force gauge 345
      disposed on hydrofoil 340 and measuring a second force or moment
      345a (for example, in a fore-to-aft direction). In a basic
      embodiment demonstrated by the inventor, a single strain gauge 343
      was used to generate an electrical signal corresponding to a force
      or moment 343a on hydrofoil 340. This signal was input, with other
      input signals and parameters, to a processor, which was used in
      turn to actively control the pitch (or angle of rotation) of shaft
      310 by way of an electro-mechanical servo.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In an aspect, a height or distance sensor 350 is disposed
      at a practical location on craft 30. For example, an ultrasonic
      time-of-f light (echo or sonar) device 350 is mounted to an
      under-body portion of craft body 300, e.g., below a wing or
      fuselage thereof. The height sensor 350 measures the distance
      between a reference point on craft 30 and the surface of the water
      below 15. The surface 15 may be calm (undisturbed) or may be wavy
      (disturbed) as will be discussed below, which leads to varying
      depths of insertion of hydrofoil 340 into the water under craft
      30, and subsequently to varying forces of lift and drag
      corresponding to the state of submersion of the hydrofoil 340.
      Other embodiments of a height sensor may be used as well, for
      example optical cameras, lasers, conductivity meters, capacitance
      meters, etc. The reference measurements indicating the depth of
      insertion of hydrofoil 340 into the water at a given moment may be
      repeated rapidly (for example at 1 Hz, 10 Hz, 100 Hz or another
      rate as called for).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] An exemplary system was set up by the inventor to stabilize
      a flying sailboat or air-water craft about one meter long and
      having a wing span on the order of one meter, e.g., about 3
      meters, such as those described above, which was flown at a height
      (a) of several centimeters above the surface of a natural river at
      speeds on the order of 10 meters/sec. Those skilled in the art
      will appreciate how such a system can be scaled upwards or
      downwards in size, speed or other parameters using non-
      dimensional fluid dynamic analysis or other theoretical,
      empirical, or numerical techniques. In addition, the present
      system and method can utilize and include such force sensors on
      any or all of the control surfaces thereof to measure a force,
      moment, or deflection along any corresponding direction. The
      following discussion elaborates on the dynamics of the present
      craft, its controls system and method, with particular emphasis on
      the hydrofoil and a model-based control system and method for
      achieving useful flight therefrom. [0055] We consider the
      surface-piercing hydrofoil of Fig. 4, whose base is traveling
      through water of density p in the forward direction 1 2 or (— ex)
      at speed U (without waves, the flow would be coming at the vehicle
      at +Uex). The small-angle foil pitch is T. Its beam and reference
      chord are b, c, respectively. As an example, the foil flexibility
      lumped into a single degree of freedom f represented by a
      localized hinge bending at the hydrofoil base, of stiffness k and
      negligible damping. The foil is immersed at a depth h(t) &lt; b.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The foil dynamics may be modeled as J F = Mhinge+
      Mhydrowhere J is the moment inertia and the terms on the
      right-hand side are the moment due to the hinge stiffness, for
      instancehinge=— k§, and the moment applied at the hinge point due
      to hydrodynamic forces respectively. The hydrodynamic forces may
      include added mass, lift and drag forces, as well as surface
      effect forces such as wave- making and spray. Those skilled in the
      art will understand that the present models are but examples
      facilitating the understanding of the operation of the system and
      method. Other models, including optional physical conditions and
      factors can be added or removed from the present illustrative
      models as needed.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrodynamic forces may depend on the hydrofoil geometry, the
      hydrofoil pitch, craft yaw, f, the hydrofoil's water-relative
      position (including the hydrofoil depth immersion h) and
      orientation, the local water velocity and its derivatives (due to
      for instance waves or currents), and time-derivatives up to any
      order of those quantities. For instance, by way of example, in
      still water with no yaw, the moment due to hydrodynamic forces on
      the non-ventilating, non-cavitating foil may be modeled with the
      form hydro = qchCM;e6 +—^-M^ f - m22f where CM;g and CM^ and
      m22are coefficients that may depend on the foil geometry, h and
      other parameters for instance the Froude number, and may be
      computed with various degrees of precision.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Collecting the above terms, within the example model, the
      hydrofoil dynamics is<br>
      <br>
      &lt;3&gt;f&lt;'&gt;F +&lt;3&gt;f F +&lt;3&gt;fF = bgG with the
      time-varying coefficients qch&lt;3&gt;<br>
      a3/4&gt;&lt;=&gt;J +&lt;m&gt;22&lt;&lt;3&gt;f&lt;=&gt;y ^?,f' = k1<br>
      be = qch&lt;2&gt;CM;e,q= -pu&lt;2&gt;,<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Regarding lift forces and moments, and the non-dimensional
      and non- constant aerodynamic coefficients CM^ and CM;g, they may
      be computed in the following way. Considering only the immersed
      part or the hydrofoil, and H the point of the foil that is at the
      water surface at time t, the local angle of attack at that point
      is a?= T + (f (b— h) + uy)/U. The force and moment at point H on
      the hydrofoil due to hydrodynamic lift are<br>
      <br>
      L = qch(CL;aaH+ CL;P, f h/(2U))<br>
      <br>
      MH=qch&lt;2&gt;(ClaaH+ Clp,^h/(2U)) where CL aand CL p, are the
      force coefficients due to angle of attack and roll rate,
      respectively, and Cl ctand Cl p, are the moment coefficients due
      to angle of attack and roll rate, respectively. In general, those
      coefficients are non-trivial, due to surface wave-making effects
      they are dependent on the Froude number Fr= U/^gc . In practice,
      for Fr&lt; 0.1 or Fr&gt; 1, the dependence is weak, and the
      coefficients are mostly sensitive to the immersed aspect ratio AR
      = h/c. For large Froude numbers, the flow may be approximated with
      the method of images where the horizontal surface plane is a plane
      of anti-symmetry for the flow. As such, the coefficients can be
      computed with a panel method such as AVL. In the limit of large
      aspect ratios, the coefficients tend to 2tt, p and 4p/3. In the
      present model, the hydrodynamic coefficients may be computed and
      fitted with a third order polynomial, but any other suitable or
      practical modeling of these coefficients can be similarly or
      equivalently substituted. Also, the moment due to lift at the
      hinge is ML= (b— h)L + MH, which can be rewritten as<br>
      <br>
      ML= qch&lt;2&gt;CM,e(0 + uy/U) + f with<br>
      <br>
      ^?,f&lt;= 2&gt;CL,cc + ,cc + CLjP, + Cj p, and h = (b/h— 1).
      Following a similar procedure, one skilled in the art may adapt
      the procedure to compute the coefficients CM^ and CM;g, as small
      Froude numbers and/or for ventilated or cavitated hydrofoils. The
      lift, moment due to lift generated by the hydrofoil, or bending
      (all computable from the aforementioned equations within the
      limits of the example model by one skilled in the art), may be
      controlled with a tracking Linear Time Varying (LTV) controller.
      For instance, it was determined experimentally that<br>
      <br>
      measurement/estimation of U and h in order to compute in real time
      the estimates §?, §f, 6Tof ?f, ?f, beconstituted a model
      sufficiently accurate to control f with satisfactory performance,
      i.e., the craft remained stable, tracked approximately a reference
      value fGand the hydrofoil didn't break due to too large forces,
      all despite changes in U and h, with the control law&lt;? =&gt;r
      DQ (3/4 *&lt;+&gt;^F F&lt;+&gt;3/4(*&lt;r + k&gt;i
      (*r&lt;~&gt;F)&lt;+ K2&gt;^&lt;R ~&gt;F) +&lt;FC3&gt;J f
      (F&lt;G&gt;- F) where the coefficients k1k2k3can be selected by
      pole placement by one skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] This example of a control strategy based on online
      measurement of h and<br>
      <br>
      U with dedicated sensors to reconstitute the highly time-varying
      coefficients of the linear model proved experimentally a
      satisfactory approach.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] As to the controls and control objectives in an
      illustrative aspect, these can include 1) maintaining at all times
      the loading of the hydrofoil below its strength limit, 2)
      performing robust command following of a commanded loading k
      &gt;m(t) despite fast and order-of-magnitude variations of the
      plant due to variations in U and h, and 3) performing noise
      rejection while maintaining the error within acceptable limits.
      For instance, assuming that the roll f of the craft on which the
      hydrofoil is to be mounted has a known linear dynamics of the form
      f = ?( )1 : f where k f is the loading error, a bound on the
      allowed error in the vehicle roll constrains the allowable
      spectrum of the loading error. One particular exemplary hydrofoil
      system may be designed for a vehicle whose roll dynamics are
      dominated by damping such that H(s) = 0.03/s with a maximum
      allowable roll |f| &lt; 2°. As stated elsewhere, it must be
      understood that the present examples are illustrative and are not
      limiting of the scope of the present system, method, or exhaustive
      as to the possible useful embodiments achievable by the system and
      method.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The hydrofoil equations for control can be stated in a
      simplified form. In term a^, the added mass, approximately m22=
      ?tt?&lt;2&gt;/4, typically dominates the material inertia J by
      over one order of magnitude. Therefore, a^/a^, ~ U/c. For small-
      scale, high-speed applications, the ratios may be in the 500's to
      1000's rad/s, much faster than, e.g., un-modeled pitch actuator
      dynamics. Therefore, it is possible to ignore, for control, the
      terms a^,&lt;'&gt;f, such that a good approximation for the
      hydrofoil system is<br>
      <br>
      Image available on "Original document"<br>
      <br>
      which is a first-order linear time-varying (LTV) system. Note that
      the plant poleImage available on "Original document"<br>
      may vary by one order of magnitude and the steady-state gain
      hs/a^, may vary by two orders of magnitude, as the hydrofoil's
      immersion h varies between zero and 20 cm in an example, and the
      velocity U ranges from 4 to 10 m/s.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Exemplary controller model: We use a LTV controller,
      implemented by<br>
      <br>
      Euler integration, e.g., at 512 Hz ?<br>
      h<br>
      (s&lt;2&gt;/Psonar + V2s/Psonar + l)&lt;'&gt;<br>
      1<br>
      s/Pu + 1<br>
      <br>
      Image available on "Original document"<br>
      <br>
      In the above equations, the estimates for the immersion depth and
      vehicle velocity h and U are obtained by filtering sonar and G PS
      velocity measurements and used to compute the time-varying
      coefficients. The sonar in an example may be operated at 40 Hz
      withSonar&lt;=&gt;12/second, and the GPS at 1 0 Hz with ??=
      1/second. However, of course, this is only an example, and other
      operational parameters are equally as justified. When the
      hydrofoil is immersed, the reference loading ftis directly read
      from manual remote controller stick input. In the present model,
      the error signals are computed and the control law is formed. When
      the hydrofoil is immersed, ? = 1 such that if the model is
      perfectly known, the system reduces to (s + /?)&lt;2&gt;/ f = 0.
      The integral aspect of the controller is important as due to
      misalignments of the rig, T is known up to a constant bias.
      Besides the noise due to wave forcing, those skilled in the art
      may also model the operation of the actuator servo, which can be
      approximated as a rate-limited, critically-damped second-order
      system of poorly known cutoff rate Pservo i&lt;n&gt;the 20 to
      60/second range. In an example, ß = 10/second provides a
      reasonable performance/robustness trade-off with a 8 dB gain
      margin and 50 degree phase margin for a^/a^ = 15/second and pservo
      = 40/second). [0063] Figs. 4A and 4B show side, front and top
      views of a hydrofoil 440 according to the present system and
      method (excluding the representation of the rest of the system for
      clarity), and further showing certain quantities used in the
      present model by way of illustration.<br>
      [0064] Fig. 5 illustrates one flight scenario of said craft over a
      disturbed fluid interface. The undisturbed interface (e.g.,
      air-water interface) is denoted as 15, and the actual or disturbed
      surface is denoted as 16. The craft 50 may travel in a general
      direction 12 as described before over said interface. Three
      snapshots of said craft 50 are depicted as 50a, 50b, and 50c, as
      they may be found at successive times t7, t2, and t3,
      respectively. It can be seen that hydrofoil 540 dips in and out of
      the lower fluid (water) as the height of the surface 16 rises and
      falls, therefore exposing more or less (or none) of the hydrofoil
      540 to the forces of the water below. Specifically, a maximum
      insertion of hydrofoil 540 occurs at wave crests (and/or times) t1
      and t3 while least (or no) hydrofoil insertion takes place at t2.
      The craft 50 continues therefore more or less straight along route
      12 with respect to an undisturbed water surface 15, skimming the
      wave tops as it travels, and having an acceptable and controlled
      mean state of flight.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In another flight scenario shown at Fig. 6, craft 60 moves
      from right to left and is depicted at snapshots in time (t7, t2,
      t6). Here, in a hopping flight scenario or mode of operation, the
      craft 60's trajectory may be a generally cyclic up-and-down
      trajectory. Craft 60 thus has an elevation height above water from
      some reference point thereon that increases and decreases in time.
      At some times (e.g., t7 and t5) the hydrofoil 640 beneath craft 60
      is inserted into the water below, while at other times (e.g., t2,
      t3, t4 and ??) it is only slightly in the water, or not at all.
      Such a trajectory may be energetically beneficial, if enough
      hydrofoil lift is generated during phases t1 and t5, while the
      hydrofoil drag during phases t2-t4 and t6 is reduced compared to
      phases t1 and t5. Again, though having a different flight path,
      craft 60 has an acceptable and controlled mean state of flight in
      a general direction 12. Hybrid and compound flight scenarios are
      also possible, including over calm or rough water surfaces. For
      instance, if the system is hopping in a non-flat water surface, it
      may be beneficial to perform dips at other locations than the wave
      crests.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Fig. 7 illustrates a control method 70 for achieving stable
      flight of a craft as described herein. Generally, the control
      method includes receiving sensor signals, e.g.,
      GPS/location/speed, sonar height, or other camera sensor signals
      and/or force gauges at step 700. State estimation (i.e. fusion of
      sensory information to infer/improve some or all but not reduced
      to the estimates/belief of: the craft's position, attitude,
      velocity and angular velocity, hydrodynamic force and/or moment on
      the hydrofoil, water surface altitude, craft height above water,
      water velocity, wind field, etc. For instance, in the example
      control law the water speed is assumed to be 0, h which is
      directly related to vehicle height above water is computed by
      fusing GPS, static pressure, accelerometer and sonar information,
      and the vehicle's speed is estimated by filtering GPS information)
      is performed at step 710. A high-level, long term desired craft
      trajectory is generated at step 720 by the trajectory planner
      (e.g., running at a 1 to 10 sec rate, although this could be
      slower or faster), for instance based on a preset desired height
      and flight direction, or the result of an online trajectory
      generation, for instance the result of an optimization algorithm
      balancing rewards from mission objective accomplishments, safety
      requirements in terms of, for instance, minimum height and/or
      maximum g-force, etc.). The trajectory planning method outputs a
      desired state and controls command (for instance, desired vehicle
      attitude and short-term desired position, along with desired lift
      distribution on the airborne and waterborne lifting surfaces step
      730. A control loop process (for instance faster than the planning
      algorithm, perhaps running at a 50 to 500Hz rate), such as that
      exemplified previously for the hydrofoil but which one skilled in
      the art may design for the aerial control surfaces 740 is carried
      out in real-time to achieve the desired flight. The physical craft
      and environment (plant) evolve according to their respective
      equations of motion 750.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Fig. 8A illustrates a flying craft 80 with a
      downward-extending hydrofoil 840 which is controllable in
      real-time to achieve some or all of the above characteristics. In
      particular, physical sensors such as the described position,
      speed, flight height, or force sensors (e.g., hydrofoil strain
      sensors) are used individually or together in any combination to
      control a rotation 842 of hydrofoil 840 to obtain the needed
      flight dynamics and lift/drag forces on craft 80. The example of
      Fig. 8 includes a craft body 800 and a conventional tail 830 and
      wings 810. However, as explained above, other suitable aerodynamic
      designs may be employed just as well, including with additional
      canards, ailerons, and so on. The embodiment of Fig. 8 has been
      demonstrated by the present inventor to have useful flight
      dynamics without the use of a vertical aerial sail.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Fig. 8B illustrates a side (port) view of flying craft 80
      with water-piercing and real-time controllable hydrofoil 840,
      which can be flown at a height, a, above an air-water interface
      15. As stated herein, the craft 80 may maintain a steady distance
      from a reference point thereon to the surface of the water 15, or
      the craft 80 may rise and fall above the surface 15 in a given
      flight mode of operation, especially where the surface 15 is wavy.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Fig. 9A shows a time lapse illustrating a mode of operation
      of flying craft 80 over the surface of a body of water according
      to an embodiment. In this top view, craft 80 travels generally to
      the left and is shown at successive times t7, t2, t5 (which is the
      same configuration as in time t7). Craft 80 has a controlled
      water-piercing hydrofoil as described before, which dips into the
      water below and rises from the water at various times during
      flight. At time t7, the main functions of the craft's lifting
      surfaces are to counteract gravity with airborne lifting surfaces,
      and provide upwind force with the hydrofoil; at time t2, the main
      functions of the craft's lifting surfaces are to counteract
      gravity, and generate a generally forward and downwind; at
      optional time t3, the craft's wings 810 are in a generally
      vertical (flying at a 90-degree roll) configuration such that main
      function of the craft's lifting surfaces is to generate a
      generally forward and downwind force; at time t4, the craft is in
      a similar dynamic as it was at time t2; and at time t5 the craft
      is in a similar dynamic as it was at time t7.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Fig. 9B shows the time lapse of Fig. 9A from a side
      (windward) view. We see that controlled hydrofoil 840 pierces the
      surface of the air-water interface 15 at least at times t7 (and
      t5) so that craft 80 goes upwards and downwards in elevation above
      surface 15 while rolling through the phases of its flight. It can
      be seen that the embodiments described in Figs. 8A, 8B, 9A and 9B
      the craft 80 may be flown so that its wings function to provide
      the lift and drag forces previously associated with wings 1 10 and
      sail 120 of Figs. 1 A, 1 B and 1 C, by timed and controlled
      rotation of the craft's control surfaces with respect to the plane
      of the air-water interface (i.e., a direction defined by Earth's
      gravitational force). Those skilled in the art would appreciate
      that hybrid modes of operation of such craft can also be achieved,
      whether such operation is a steady state or cyclic or aperiodic
      state of operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In the foregoing specification, the invention has been
      described with reference to specific embodiments. However, one of
      ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications
      and changes can be made without departing from the scope of the
      disclosure and embodiments described herein. Accordingly, the
      specification and figures are to be regarded in an illustrative
      rather than a restrictive sense, and all such modifications are
      intended to be included within the scope of this disclosure.<br>
