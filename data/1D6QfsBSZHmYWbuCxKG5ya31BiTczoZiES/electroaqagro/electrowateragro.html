          electrolysed water on crops</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>Sallese Gibson</b><br>

      <br>
      Tasmanian vegetable farmers could soon be using electrolysed water
      on their crops as an alternative to some chemicals, if tests
      confirm suspected benefits.<br>
      <br>
      Electrolysed water works as a surface sanitiser, and is produced
      by passing an electrical current through salt water.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers said it has been used extensively in some overseas
      countries as a cleaning agent, but little is known about its
      effectiveness in production horticulture.<br>
      <br>
      The Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association (TFGA) has
      partnered with the Tasmanian Institute of Agriculture to
      investigate its use in the vegetable industry.<br>
      <br>
      The institute's Professor Roger Stanley said he was confident
      electrolysed water had potential.<br>
      <br>
      "The future here is probably very good," Professor Stanley said.<br>
      <br>
      "We can use it to extend the shelf life of food.<br>
      <br>
      "The other use could be as a field sanitiser, for controlling the
      fungal bacteria infection in crops.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a contact sanitiser so it doesn't have systemic effects but
      will prevent the infection from getting into the plant."<br>
      <br>
      TFGA expects 'broad applications'<br>
      <br>
      Karine Cadoret from the TFGA agreed.<br>
      <br>
      "The applications really are quite broad and they can stretch from
      in-field use, right the way through to packaging," Ms Cadoret
      said.<br>
      <br>
      "Electrolysed water technology [could be used for] disease
      suppression in-field or cleaning of equipment perhaps for
      biosecurity purposes, right the way through washing fresh produce
      to extend the shelf life."<br>
      <br>
      She said she hoped the technology would reduce the industry's
      reliance on chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      "Disease in production systems is obviously a big issue," she
      said.<br>
      <br>
      "We do have, in conventional farming, an array of chemicals that
      can be used - but obviously there are risks associated with that.<br>
      <br>
      "So to have another tool, part of the array of the things that
      [they] can use to ensure that their production will yield good
      results has obviously got a lot of potential benefits."<br>
      <br>
      Professor Stanley said he hoped the move would help the industry
      move away from some chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      "At the moment, a lot of crops develop around spray programs using
      fungicides and insecticides," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "[Electrolysed water] has the potential to lower the use of
      fungicides by preventing the infection in the first place.<br>
      <br>
      "It's a novel and innovative use of an old technology and we
      really want our farmers to be up and taking advantage of these new
      uses."<br>
      <br>
      Agronomist backs electrolysed water<br>
      <br>
      Mark Parkinson has been using electrolysed water in his agronomy
      business in Queensland for the past two years.<br>
      <br>
      "It's made a big difference in helping me getting my farmers to
      point A to point B, without getting crucified with diseases," he
      said.<br>
      <br>
      Mr Parkinson said he found it effective in reducing the occurrence
      of white rot in onion crops.<br>
      <br>
      "Instead of a 90 per cent destruction of the paddocks, it's been a
      90 per cent keepsake or more, 95 per cent.<br>
      <br>
      "I don't believe in golden bullets and this is not a golden
      bullet, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty close."<br>
      <br>
      He said it was a much cheaper alternative to most chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      "The inputs in agriculture... [are] beginning to cripple the
      farming industry," he said.<br>
      <br>
      "[Electrolysed water] costs three cents a litre to make.<br>
      <br>
      "So you can throw on your $150 or $100-a-hectare chemicals, they
      just don't work.<br>
      <br>
      "This is three cents a litre, at 750 litres a hectare, and it does
      work."<br>
      <br>
      Karine Cadoret agreed.<br>
      <br>
      "In terms of production, it's got great, sort of productivity and
      cost reduction ... applications," she said.<br>
      <br>
      She said she believed it could also further enhance the reputation
      of Tasmania's agriculture industry.<br>
      <br>
      "The clean and green and safe image of the Tasmanian produce would
      definitely benefit from having technology like this," she said.<br>
      <br>
      "The technology has actually been certified for organic production
      systems and it's safe for the environment, as well as being safe
      for humans."<br>
      <br>
      Nathan Richardson is a farmer on Tasmania's north-west coast.<br>
      <br>
      He said he was excited at the prospect of using electrolysed water
      as part of his farming enterprise.<br>
      <br>
      "As soon as I heard about it I thought 'right, does that work in
      my poultry operation, for either sanitisation or water consumption
      for the animals?'" he said.<br>
      <br>
      "I care about the soil and the environment and the people that are
      eating our food.<br>
      <br>
      "Anything we can do to lessen the impact on the flora and fauna
      through the use of pesticides has got to be a great thing."<br>

      Ionized Water. Alkaline Water. Electrically Activated Water.
      Ionized Alkaline Water. Anti Microbial Ionized Water. Functional
      Electrolyzed Water.<br>
      <br>
      These are just a few of the many names being used to describe the
      next generation of water technology. The first generation of water
      products produced only clean water. Water filters, water
      purifiers, ion exchange or water softeners, distillers – all just
      removed contaminants or constituents from water.<br>
      <br>
      This website will help to inform the reader of the History and
      Science behind the Technology of Functional Electrolyzed Water.<br>
      <br>
      Water technology has now evolved to Ionization. A water ionizer is
      a form of water technology that can actually alter the properties
      of the water.<br>
      <br>
      This alteration in water is creating “Functional Electrolyzed
      Water”(FEW) – a different kind of water. This is not simply clean
      water, but water that has acquired very different properties that
      give it powerful functionality or uses at different levels of
      alteration.<br>
      <br>
      Functional Water technology is available now and can significantly
      impact your efficiency, operational effectiveness, environmental
      footprint and bottom line.<br>
      <br>
      The technology behind Functional Electrolyzed Water (FEW) is based
      on the science of Electrolysis, the origins of which date back to
      the 19th Century when the prominent Scottish scientist Michael
      Faraday first began experimenting with water and electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What is Functional Electrolyzed Water (FEW)?</b><br>
      <br>
      Restructured water produced through a controlled electrolysis
      process is referred to as Functional Electrolyzed water.&nbsp;
      Based upon electrolytes and the application of electrical current
      to tap water, the controlled electrolysis process transformed tap
      water into a functional agricultural water.<br>
      <br>
      The term “functional” describes a&nbsp; newly-designated
      descriptor.&nbsp; The term describes the ability of the generic
      element or component to possess secondary benefits that were
      previously unknown.&nbsp; When an element that triggers a
      beneficial result is researched and found, this mechanism is
      designated as a “functional” contributor to the beneficial result.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, grapes are commonly known to be small, round and
      juicy berries found in clusters, growing on a grapevine.&nbsp;
      Grapes have been historically consumed as a fruit or known to be
      the key element in the production of an alcoholic beverage, Wine.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, it has become scientifically known that wine, a
      by product created from grapes, possessing valuable antioxidant
      elements, polyphenols, provides valuable antioxidant properties
      effective in their controlling of excess of free radical damage
      within the human body.<br>
      <br>
      Based upon the finding, grape and wine are now considered to be a
      “functional” fruit and a “functional” beverage, in other words and
      effective “functional” medium that collaterally provides a benefit
      as an end result<br>
      <br>
      Likewise, resulting from the unique properties that are instilled
      into tap water, through the controlled electrolysis process, we
      have been able to produce a “functional” water capable of
      controlling mildew and fungus, along with serving as an effective
      soil nutrients and plant wellness and medium.&nbsp; And the end
      results that are attained are larger yields, more effective root
      systems, stronger plants and minimal usage of chemicals<br>

      There are significant applications of FEW in the agricultural
      arena. FEW has been in use in Japanese dairy farms for many years,
      the measurable results have long been accessible on the Internet.
      The increase in milk production ranging from 18-20%, and the
      decrease in hormones, and antibiotics in the animal feed received
      major attention when the data was first published on line in 1996.<br>
      <br>
      A small study was conducted in Colorado in 2002, which bore out
      some of the milk production statistics. In 2008, EAU, an American
      publicly traded Company, in conjunction with the University of
      Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine conducted and published
      a significant study on the effects of their Empowered Water on a
      Holstein dairy herd. Empowered Water has the same characteristics
      as FEW...<br>
      <br>
      What is also significant is the use of Anti Microbial Ionized
      Water (AMI) Water on livestock. Due to it’s anti-microbial
      properties, (AMI) Water is used as a foot rinse, anointed on
      wounds, cuts, abrasions etc, with a high degree of effectiveness.
      Wounds appear to heal much faster than using typical veterinary
      methodologies.<br>
      <br>
      Due to its’ characteristics, it is not harmful to the animals,
      there no long term effects, which can be experienced with the use
      of antibiotics.<br>
      <br>
      Here are some Agricultural Applications of FEW<br>

      Equine applications,<br>
      Bovine applications.<br>
      Sterilization of agricultural devices.<br>
      Silage Making.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to Animal husbandry, there are areas in crop
      production where FEW is used to great effect<br>
      <br>
      Pesticidal and insecticidal reduction on plants.<br>

      Microbial control of postharvest diseases has been extensively
      studied and appears to be a viable technology. Food safety must be
      ensured at each postharvest processing step, including handling,
      washing of raw materials, cleaning of utensils and pipelines, and
      packaging. Several commercial products are available for this
      purpose. The time is ripe for developing new techniques and
      technologies. The use of electrolyzed water (EW) is the product of
      a new concept developed in Japan, which is now gaining popularity
      in other countries. Little is known about the principle behind its
      sterilizing effect, but it has been shown to have significant
      bactericidal and virucidal and moderate fungicidal properties.
      Some studies have been carried out in Japan, China, and the USA on
      the pre- and postharvest application of EW in the field of food
      processing. EW may be produced using common salt and an apparatus
      connected to a power source. As the size of the machine is quite
      small, the water can be manufactured on-site. Studies have been
      carried out on the use of EW as a sanitizer for fruits, utensils,
      and cutting boards. It can also be used as a fungicide during
      postharvest processing of fruits and vegetables, and as a
      sanitizer for washing the carcasses of meat and poultry. It is
      cost-effective and environment-friendly. The use of EW is an
      emerging technology with considerable potential. <br>

      <br>
      A method of producing strong oxidized water using three-cell
      electrodialysis stack by membrane electrodialysis was
      proposed.Operating priniciples and processing data were
      provided,and the selections of composition materials were
      discussed.Depending on the experiment,the optimal conditions for
      producing strong oxidized water were obtained,i.e.when the
      distance of electrode pairs is 10 cm,the concentration of NaCl is
      5.32% and the voltage is 32V,the efficiency for producing strong
      oxidized water with this kind of device is the highest.The

      The method extracting humic acid with NaOH is used widely at home
      and abroad, while it has some short-comings. Electrolytic water
      not only is an especial and functional water with sterilization,
      deodorization, activation and oxidation, but also is economical
      and environmental-friendly, and easy to be produced. In this
      paper, multi-experiments were designed to analyze the extracting
      effect and rule from peat using two-step method, i.e., pretreated
      with acidic electrolytic water fi rstly, and then extracted with
      alkaline electrolytic water. Some optimal parameters were defi ned
      finally, such as the initial concentration of NaCl in electrolytic
      water was 5%, the ratios of acid-peat and alkaline-peat were 10∶1
      and 15∶1, and the reaction temperature and reaction time were 40
      ℃and 3 h, respectively. This paper also analyzed the practical
      value of this method, and would provide references for industrial
      application.<br>

      For the special efficacy of electrolyzed water and the status that
      electrolyzed water is less studied on leafy vegetables,in order to
      provide basis for electrolyzed water used in the cultivation of
      Chinese cabbage and other leafy vegetables,the effect of soaking
      Chinese cabbage seeds with electrolyzed water was studied under
      laboratory conditions.The results showed that pH value of the
      electrolyzed water was an important factor that affected the
      Chinese cabbage seeds germination.The acidic electrolyzed water of
      pH 3.30 could accelerate seeds germinating and raise fresh weight
      of shoots significantly;strong acidic electrolyzed water and
      alkaline electrolyzed water would slow down the speed of seeds
      germination and inhibit both germination rate and fresh weight of
      shoots;besides,neutral electrolyzed water have no clear effect on
      germination potential,germination rate and fresh weight of
      shoots.Preliminary view was that,In addition,the results also
      showed that 2h of soaking time was appropriate;when soaking time
      was too short,the electrolyzed water could not have any effect,and
      soaking too long would have a negative effect on the seeds
      germination.<br>

      ABSTRACT:  The ability of power ultrasound, acidic electrolyzed
      water (AEW), and gamma irradiation to inactivate Escherichia coli
      O157:H7 inoculated onto alfalfa and broccoli seeds was examined.
      The treatment conditions under which the alfalfa and broccoli
      seeds treated with sterile deionized water (SW), AEW, ultrasound
      cleaning tank (UST), ultrasound probe (USP), and irradiation (IR)
      would retain a germination percentage of &gt;85% were first
      determined for each disinfection hurdle. E. coli O157:H7
      inactivation tests were then conducted with the experimental
      conditions determined in the germination tests to find out the
      maximum inactivation ability of each disinfection hurdle. AEW
      treatment at 55 oC for 10 min reduced E. coli O157:H7 population
      by 3.4 and 3.3 log CFU/g for the alfalfa and broccoli seeds,
      respectively. IR at 8 kGy resulted in a 5-log reduction with seed
      germination of &gt;85% for both seed types, but a reduction in the
      length and thickness of the sprouts was observed. None of the
      ultrasound treatments achieved over a 2-log reduction in E. coli
      O157:H7 population without lowering the germination to below 85%.
      The results of this study demonstrated that AEW and ultrasound,
      when applied individually or in combination with thermal treatment
      at 55 oC, were not able to deliver a satisfactory inactivation of
      E. coli O157:H7. A combination of several hurdles must be used to
      achieve a complete elimination of E. coli O157:H7 cells on alfalfa
      and broccoli seeds.<br>

      <br>
      Definitive identification of free teliospores of Tilletia indica,
      causal agent of Karnal bunt of wheat, requires polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic tests. Since direct PCR
      amplification from teliospores has not been reliable, teliospores
      first must be germinated in order to obtain adequate DNA. We have
      routinely surface-sterilized teliospores for 2 min with 0.4%
      (vol/vol) sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) to stimulate germination and
      produce axenic cultures. However, we observed that some spores
      were killed even with a 2-min NaOCl treatment, the shortest
      feasible duration. Decreasing the NaOCl concentration in our study
      from 0.4% to 0.3 and 0.2%, respectively, increased teliospore
      germination, but treatment times longer than 2 min still
      progressively reduced the germination percentages. In testing
      alternative methods, we found “acidic electrolyzed water” (AEW),
      generated by electrolysis of a weak solution of sodium chloride,
      also surface-sterilized and increased the rate of T. indica
      teliospore germination. In a representative experiment comparing
      the two methods, NaOCl (0.4%) for 2 min and AEW for 30 min
      increased germination from 19% (control) to 41 and 54%,
      respectively, by 7 days after treatment. Because teliospores can
      be treated with AEW for up to 2 h with little, if any, loss of
      viability, compared with 1 to 2 min for NaOCl, treatment with AEW
      has certain advantages over NaOCl for surface sterilizing and
      increasing germination of teliospores of suspect T. indica.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electrolyzed functional water possesses a wide variety of
      antimicrobial activities. Electrolyzed functional water, which
      used to take place of tap water in producing mung bean sprouts,
      was studied in this paper. The results showed that electrolyzed
      water can not only reduce the quantity of microorganism on the
      surface of mung bean sprouts, but also promote the growth of
      sprouts. Further research showed that electrolyte leakage rate of
      mung bean soaked in electrolyzed water was the lowest, while the
      catalase’s activity of mung bean soaked in electrolyzed water was
      the highest. All of these contribute to the high activity of mung
      bean.<br>
