        <p><b><font size="+1">Coal Burns Best in Pipes that Hum</font></b>
        </p>

      </center>
      <p>A coal-burning system with a central tubal chamber that
        resonates like an organ pipe during combustion has been designed
        by a Georgia engineer. The system’s 70-Hz hum is no accident,
        but instead a design feature that should catapult its
        energy-conversion efficiency well above the norm, says Ben Zinn
        of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. </p>
      <p>There are two goals in optimizing combustion efficiency: to
        burn fuel as completely as possible, and to burn it with as
        little air as possible. Incomplete combustion obviously wastes
        fuel; less obvious is the fact that use of too much air robs the
        system of heat. The acoustic waves resonating through the
        prototype ;pulsating combustor’ make it possible for Zinn to
        obtain virtually complete combustion with almost no ‘excess
        air’. Says Zinn, ‘I’m not aware of anyone ever getting the
        results we have. I think we have something unique. </p>
      <p>Burning can only take place in the presence of oxygen. Just as
        an auto engine must breath in a certain critical ratio of air
        along with its fuel, so must any other combustion system.
        Theoretically, the amount of air required to bur a given amount
        of fuel completely is usually not enough, in practice, to
        prevent the production of smoke. As a result, combustion
        engineers must always budget in a certain amount of excess air.
        The Dictionary of Energy (Schocken Books, NY 1983) cites as
        typical values ‘50% excess air for coal-fired [combustion units]
        20% for oil-fired&nbsp; and 10% for gas-fired installations’.
        Any excess air in the system will be heated by the hot
        combustion process and eventually be exhausted with other waste
        gases. The more excess air is used, the more heat robbed from
        the system. </p>
      <p>Zinn can get 92% combustion efficiency -- a figure many energy
        managers could live with -- using no excess air. Y adding 6 or 7
        % excess air he achieves greater than 97% combustion efficiency,
        a value electric utilities strive for with their better systems.
        Moreover, Sinn points out, to achieve comparable efficiencies,
        most of those other systems require use of ‘at least 20% and
        sometimes 30% extra air. That, he emphasizes, ‘ is a huge
        difference’. </p>
      <p>Zinn’s system taps an acoustic principle formulated during the
        19th century by a physicist named Rijke: By heating gases within
        a tube at a critical point, the resulting excitation of gas
        molecules will generate acoustic oscillations that make the pipe
        sing. The heat source in Zinn’s device is the combustion process
        itself, which occurs on a porous metal grid inside the pipe.
        Fuel entering the chamber from a portal along one wall drops
        onto the grid where it meets cold air that’s been pumped in from
        below. </p>
      <p>In his model, the combustion tube is 9 feet long and 5.5 inches
        in diameter. Its dimensions determine the oscillation frequency,
        which for this system ‘means that the molecules in each
        direction are moving back and forth 70 times a second’, Zinn
        says. ‘I have such superior combustion because the acoustics
        give me much better mixing of fuel and air.’ But the
        oscillations have a second benefit: It turns out they increase
        the transfer of heat from the hot combustion-exhaust gases to
        the walls of the combustion chamber, increasing the energy
        available to do work -- for example to heat the steam that drive
        a turbine to generate electricity. </p>
      <p>‘The implication of these advantages is that for the same
        energy output, pulsating combustors can be smaller than
        conventional ones and therefore less expensive’, Zinn says.
        Another advantage of his system is that it doesn’t require use
        of pulverized coal, a slightly more costly form of fuel. Georgia
        Tech has a patent pending on Zinn’s design. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Georgia Tech researchers have created a new combustor
        (combustion chamber where fuel is burned to power an engine or
        gas turbine) designed to burn fuel in a wide range of devices -
        with next to no emission of nitrogen oxide (NOx) and carbon
        monoxide (CO), two of the primary causes of air pollution. </p>
      <p>The device has a simpler design than existing state-of-the-art
        combustors and could be manufactured and maintained at a much
        lower cost, making it more affordable in everything from jet
        engines and power plants to home water heaters. </p>
      <p>"We must burn fuel to power aircrafts and generate electricity
        for our homes. The combustion community is working very hard to
        find ways to burn the fuel completely and derive all of its
        energy while minimizing emissions," said Dr. Ben Zinn, Regents'
        professor, the David S. Lewis Jr. Chair in Georgia Tech's
        Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering and a key
        collaborator on the project. "Our combustor has an unbelievably
        simple design, and it would be inexpensive to make and
        inexpensive to maintain." </p>
      <p>Attaining ultra low emissions has become a top priority for
        combustion researchers as federal and state restrictions on
        pollution continuously reduce the allowable levels of NOx and CO
        produced by engines, power plants and industrial processes. </p>
      <p>Called the Stagnation Point Reverse Flow Combustor, the Georgia
        Tech device significantly reduces NOx and CO emissions in a
        variety of aircraft engines and gas turbines that burn gaseous
        or liquid fuels. It burns fuel with NOx emissions below 1 parts
        per million (ppm) and CO emissions lower than 10 ppm,
        significantly lower than emissions produced by other combustors.
      </p>
      <p>The project's initial goal was to develop a low emissions
        combustor for aircraft engines and power-generating gas turbines
        that must stably burn large amounts of fuel in a small volume
        over a wide range of power settings (or fuel flow rates). But
        the design can be adapted for use in a variety of applications,
        including something as large as a power generating gas turbine
        or as small as a water heater in a home. </p>
      <p>"We wanted to have all the clean-burning advantages of a low
        temperature combustion process while burning a large amount of
        fuel in a small volume," Zinn said. </p>
      <p>The combustor burns fuel in low temperature reactions that
        occur over a large portion of the combustor. By eliminating all
        high temperature pockets through better control of the flow of
        the reactants and combustion products within the combustor, the
        device produces far lower levels of NOx and CO and avoids
        acoustic instabilities that are problematic in current low
        emissions combustors. </p>
      <p>To reduce emissions in existing combustors, fuel is premixed
        with a large amount of swirling air flow prior to injection into
        the combustor. This requires complex and expensive designs, and
        the combustion process often excites instabilities that damage
        the system. </p>
      <p>But Georgia Tech's design eliminates the complexity associated
        with premixing the fuel and air by injecting the fuel and air
        separately into the combustor while its shape forces them to mix
        with one another and with combustion products before ignition
        occurs. </p>

      <p><b>BENEFIT CLAIMS TO PRIOR APPLICATIONS</b> </p>
      <p>[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional
        Application No. 60/578,554 filed on Jun. 10, 2004 and is a
        continuation in part of U.S. Utility application Ser. No.
        10/927,205 filed on Aug. 26, 2004. </p>
      <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] This invention relates to a combustion system in general
        and more particularly to a combustion system which utilizes a
        combustion chamber design for low pollutant emissions by
        creating a stagnation region for anchoring a flame and reverse
        flow of combustion products that partially mixes with the
        incoming reactants. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] Combustion and its control are essential features to
        everyday life. Approximately eighty-five percent of the energy
        used in the United States alone is derived via combustion
        processes. Combustion of combustible resources is utilized for,
        among other things, transportation, heat and power. However,
        with the prevalent occurrences of combustion, one of the major
        downsides of these processes is environmental pollution. In
        particular, the major pollutants produced are nitrogen oxides
        (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), soot
        and sulfur dioxides. Emissions of NOx in particular, have
        exceeded over twenty-five million short tons in preceding years.
        Such pollutants have raised public concerns. </p>
      <p>[0005] In response to public concerns, governments have
        initiated laws regulating the emission of pollutants. As a
        result, current combustion systems must efficiently convert the
        fuel energy into thermal energy with low emissions of NOx, CO,
        UHC, and soot. </p>
      <p>[0006] To burn, the fuel must first mix with an oxidant such as
        air. The resulting mixture must then be supplied with sufficient
        heat and, if possible, free radicals, which are highly reactive
        chemical species such as H, OH and O, to ignite. Once ignition
        occurs, combustion is generally completed within a very short
        time period. After initial ignition, combustion proceeds via an
        internal feedback process that ignites the incoming reactants by
        bringing them into contact within the combustor with hot
        combustion products and, on occasion, with reactive gas pockets
        produced by previously injected reactants. </p>
      <p>[0007] To maintain the flame in the combustor, it must be
        anchored in a region where the velocity of the incoming
        reactants flow is low. Low velocities, or long residence times,
        allow the reactants sufficient time to ignite. In the well known
        Bunsen burner, the flame is anchored near the burner's rim and
        the required feedback is accomplished by molecular conduction of
        heat and molecular diffusion of radicals from the flame into the
        approaching stream of reactants. In gas turbines, the flame
        anchoring and required feedback are typically accomplished by
        use of one or more swirlers that create recirculation regions of
        low velocities for anchoring the flame and back flow of hot
        combustion products and reacting pockets that ignites the
        incoming reactants. In ramjets and afterburners, this is
        accomplished by inserting bluff bodies, such as a V-shaped
        gutter, into the combustor to generate regions of low flow
        velocities and recirculation of hot combustion pockets and
        reacting gas pockets to anchor the flame and ignite the
        reactants. </p>
      <p>[0008] More recently, in an effort to reduce NOx emissions in
        industrial processes, the use of high velocity fuel and air jets
        to attain what is referred to as flameless combustion has been
        advocated. U.S. Pat. No. 5,570,679 discloses a flameless
        combustion system. In the '679 patent, an impulse burner is
        disclosed. Fuel and air jets that are spatially separated by
        specified distances are injected into the combustor or process
        with high velocities. The system incorporates two separate
        operating states. In the first state, the burner is first
        switched such that a first fuel valve is opened and a second
        fuel valve is closed. The fuel and oxidant are mixed in a
        combustion chamber and ignited with stable flame development and
        the flame gases emerge through an outlet opening in the
        combustion chamber to heat up the furnace chamber. As soon as
        the furnace chamber is heated to the ignition temperature of the
        fuel, a control unit switches the burner over to a second
        operating state by closing of the first fuel valve and opening a
        second fuel valve. In this second operating state, no fuel is
        introduced into the combustion chamber and as a consequence, the
        burning of the fuel in a flame in the combustion chamber is
        essentially suppressed entirely. The fuel is fed into the
        furnace chamber exclusively. </p>
      <p>[0009] Because of their high momentum, the incoming fuel and
        oxidant jets act as pumps entraining large quantities of hot
        combustion products within the furnace chamber. Since the
        furnace chamber has been heated up to the ignition temperature
        of the fuel, the reaction of the fuel with the combustion
        oxidant takes place in a distributed combustion process along
        the vessel without a discernible flame. Consequently, this
        process has been referred to as flameless combustion or
        flameless oxidation. Since this process requires that the
        incoming reactants jets mix with large quantities of hot
        products, its combustion intensity, i.e., amount of fuel burned
        per unit volume per second, is low. Also, the system requires
        high flow velocity of the fuel jets to create the pump action
        necessary for mixing the fuel with the hot combustion products.
        Additionally, since a significant fraction of the large kinetic
        energy of the injected reactants jets is dissipated within the
        furnace, the process experiences large pressure losses.
        Consequently, in its current design, this process is not
        suitable for application to land-based gas turbines and aircraft
        engine's combustors and other processes which require high
        combustion intensity and/or low pressure losses. </p>
      <p>[0010] In another combustion system, often referred to as well
        stirred or jet stirred combustor, fuel and oxidant are mixed
        upstream of the combustion chamber and the resulting combustible
        mixture is injected via one or more high velocity jets into a
        relatively small combustor volume. The high momentum of the
        incoming jets produces very fast mixing of the incoming
        reactants with the hot combustion products and burning gases
        within the combustor, resulting in a very rapid ignition and
        combustion of the reactants in a combustion process that is
        nearly uniformly distributed throughout the combustor volume. </p>
      <p>[0011] Generally, existing combustion systems minimize NOx
        emissions by keeping the temperatures throughout the combustor
        volume as low as possible. A maximum target temperature is
        approximately 1800 K, which is the threshold above which thermal
        NOx starts forming via the Zeldovich mechanism. Another
        requirement for minimizing NOx formation is that the residence
        time of the reacting species and combustion products in high
        temperature regions, where NOx is readily formed, be minimized.
        On the other hand, temperatures and the residence times of the
        reacting gases and hot combustion products inside these
        combustors must be high enough to completely burn the fuel and
        keep the emissions of CO, UHC, and soot below government limits.
      </p>
      <p>[0012] Gas turbine systems are known to include a compressor
        for compressing air; a combustor for producing a hot gas by
        reacting the fuel with the compressed air provided by the
        compressor, and a turbine for expanding the hot gas to extract
        shaft power. The combustion process in many older gas turbine
        engines is dominated by diffusion flames burning at or near
        stoichiometric conditions with flame temperatures exceeding
        3,000 degrees F. Past the combustion zone and prior to the
        turbine inlet the hot gases are diluted by extra "cold" air from
        the compressor discharge to limit the turbine inlet temperature
        to a permissible level. Such combustion will produce a high
        level of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Current emissions regulations
        have greatly reduced the allowable levels of NOx emissions. Lean
        premixed combustion has been developed to reduce the peak flame
        temperatures and to correspondingly reduce the production of NOx
        in gas turbine engines. In a premixed combustion process, fuel
        and air are premixed in a premixing section upstream of the
        combustor. The fuel-air mixture is then introduced into a
        combustion chamber where it is burned. U.S. Pat. No. 6,082,111
        describes a gas turbine engine utilizing a can annular premix
        combustor design. Multiple premixers are positioned in a ring to
        provide a premixed fuel/air mixture to a combustion chamber. A
        pilot fuel nozzle is located at the center of the ring to
        provide a flow of pilot fuel to the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>[0013] The design of a gas turbine combustor is complicated by
        the necessity for the gas turbine engine to operate reliably
        with a low level of emissions at a variety of power levels. High
        power operation tends to increase the generation of oxides of
        nitrogen. Low power operation at lower combustion temperatures
        tends to increase the generation of carbon monoxide and unburned
        hydrocarbons due to incomplete combustion of the fuel. Under all
        operating conditions, it is important to ensure the stability of
        the flame to avoid unexpected flameout, damaging levels of
        acoustic vibrations, and damaging flashback of the flame from
        the combustion chamber into the fuel premix section upstream of
        the combustor. A relatively rich fuel/air mixture will improve
        the stability of the combustion process but will have an adverse
        affect on the level of emissions. A careful balance must be
        achieved among these various constraints in order to provide a
        reliable machine capable of satisfying very strict contemporary
        and future emissions regulations. </p>
      <p>[0014] With respect to gas turbines, FIG. 9 illustrates a
        schematic diagram of a typical gas turbine system 80. A
        compressor 82 draws in ambient air 84 and delivers compressed
        air 86 to a combustor 88. A fuel supply 90 delivers fuel 92 to
        combustor 88 where it reacts with the compressed air to produce
        high temperature combustion gas 94. The combustion gas 94 is
        expanded through a turbine 96 to produce shaft horsepower
        driving shaft 95 for driving compressor 82 and a load such as an
        electrical generator 98. Gas turbines having an annular
        combustion chamber exist including a plurality of burners
        disposed in one or more concentric rings for providing fuel into
        a single toroidal annulus. U.S. Pat. No. 5,400,587 describes one
        such annular combustion chamber design. </p>
      <p>[0015] With respect to gas turbines for jet engines, FIG. 10
        illustrates a prior art LM6000 engine commercially available
        from General Electric Aircraft Engines, Cincinnati, Ohio. Gas
        turbine engine 100 includes a low pressure compressor 102, a
        high pressure compressor 104, and a combustor 106. Engine 100
        also includes a high pressure turbine 108 and a low pressure
        turbine 110. Compressor 102 and turbine 110 are coupled by a
        first shaft 112, and compressor 104 and turbine 108 are coupled
        by a second shaft 114. Engine 100 also includes a center
        longitudinal axis of symmetry 116 extending there through. </p>
      <p>[0016] For jet engine design, there are historically three
        types of combustion chambers. There are multiple chambers, the
        turbo-annular chamber, and the annular chamber. These designs
        utilize a combustion chamber which has an inlet for receiving
        compressed air in the proximity of the compressor and a gas
        discharge at the opposite end in the proximity of the turbine.
        In operation, air flows through the low pressure compressor and
        compressed air is supplied from the low pressure compressor to
        the high pressure compressor. The highly compressed air is
        delivered to the combustor on the compressor side of the system.
        Gas flow from the combustor drives the turbines and exits the
        gas turbine engine through a nozzle. </p>
      <p>[0017] As gas turbines and jet engines employ combustion
        systems, there is a need to develop a simple combustion system
        which produces low NOx emissions while being used in gas
        turbines and jet engine systems. In addition to gas turbine
        generators and jet engines, combustors are also utilized for
        industrial boilers to assist in generating steam to produce
        electricity and the like. Also, combustors are utilized in
        domestic and industrial heating processes such as water and air
        heating and material drying. </p>
      <p>[0018] A primary problem with most combustion systems as
        mentioned above is the generation of pollutants such as NOx
        among others during the combustion of the fuel and air. This
        results because of the stoichiometry of the reacting fuel and
        oxidant streams. The stoichiometric quantity of an oxidizer is
        just that amount needed to completely burn the quantity of fuel.
        If more than a stoichiometric quantity of oxidizer is supplied,
        the mixture is said to be fuel lean, while supplying less than
        the stoichiometric oxidizer results in a fuel-rich mixture. The
        equivalence ratio is commonly used to indicate if the mixture is
        rich or lean. Typically to produce low NOx, the combustion is
        run fuel-lean. This requires a larger quantity of oxidant to be
        present and typically the utilization of swirlers to mix the
        fuel and the air prior to combustion. A typical combustion
        process is configured along an axis with the oxidant and fuel
        mixed upstream of a flame with combustion products exiting the
        combustor downstream from the flame. While suitable for their
        intended purposes, such systems utilize complicated structures
        to mix the air and fuel and are not always effective in their
        mixing. Furthermore, reducing the oxidants generally results in
        higher combustion process temperatures which produce higher NOx
        emissions. </p>
      <p>[0019] The object of the invention is to create a simple and
        low cost combustion system that uses its geometrical
        configuration to attain complete combustion of fuels over a wide
        range of fuel flow rates, while generating low emissions of NOx,
        CO, UHC and soot. </p>
      <p>[0020] Another object of the invented combustion system is to
        provide means for complete combustion of gaseous and liquid
        fuels when burned in premixed and non-premixed modes of
        combustion with comparable low emissions of NOx, CO, UHC and
        soot. </p>
      <p>[0021] Another object of this invention is to provide
        capabilities for producing a robust combustion process that does
        not excite detrimental combustion instabilities in the
        combustion system when it burns fuels in premixed and
        non-premixed modes of combustion. </p>
      <p>[0022] Another object of this invention is to use the
        geometrical arrangement of the combustion system to establish
        the feedback between incoming reactants and out flowing hot
        combustion products that ignites the reactants over a wide range
        of fuel flow rates while keeping emissions of NOx, CO, UHC and
        soot below mandated government limits. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0023] A method for combusting reactants includes providing a
        vessel having an opening near a proximate end and a closed
        distal end defining a combustion chamber. Combustible reactants
        are presented into the combustion chamber. The combustible
        reactants are ignited creating a flame and combustion products.
        The closed end of the combustion chamber is utilized for
        directing combustion products toward the opening of the
        combustion chamber creating a reverse flow of combustion
        products within the combustion chamber. The reverse flow of
        combustion products is intermixed with the incoming flow of
        combustible reactants to maintain the flame. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b> </p>
      <p>[0048] Referring now in more detail to the drawings, the
        invention will now be described in more detail. </p>
      <p>[0049] As shown in FIG. 1A, a system and method of combusting
        are disclosed. Combustion system A includes a vessel 10 which
        has a proximate end 12 and a distal closed end 14 defining a
        combustion chamber 16. Proximate end 12 may define opening 13.
        Also, opening 13 may be located near proximate end 12 in either
        sidewall 17. A fuel supply 18 and oxidant supply 19 are provided
        into the combustion chamber for combustion. An igniter (not
        shown) ignites the reactants creating a flame 20 and combustion
        products 22. Due to the geometry of combustion chamber 16, the
        incoming reactants flow, which initially flows toward the distal
        closed end, is reversed and the combustion products flow 22 and
        23 exit via opening 13. </p>
      <p>[0050] FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate the adaptability of the
        combustion system A. As shown in FIG. 2A, the downstream end of
        the flame may be established at different locations within the
        stagnation zone utilizing the combustion chamber design having a
        distal closed wall and sidewalls when operated with different
        reactants flow rates. For a first operating condition having a
        predetermined flow rate, the downstream end of the flame may be
        at location A. For another operating condition utilizing a
        higher flow rate of reactants, the downstream end of the flame
        may be stabilized at location B which is closer to the
        combustion chamber endwall than for the lower flow rate
        reactants. As FIG. 2A illustrates, the downstream end of the
        flame stabilizes itself within the proximity of the stagnation
        zone near the distal end wall where the velocity of the incoming
        reactants flow is low. As shown in FIG. 2B, the shape of the
        stabilized flame varies as the equivalence ratio of the
        reactants changes and a stable flame is attained at different
        reactants equivalence ratios. </p>
      <p>[0051] The stagnation zone acts to produce the low velocity,
        long residence time conditions that are conducive to stabilizing
        the flame under a wide range of fuel flow rates and equivalence
        ratios. Thus, even at high inlet velocities, the stagnation
        region is distinguished by low local velocities. Similarly the
        flame remains stable even for very low equivalence ratios. </p>
      <p>[0052] As shown in FIG. 1A, one embodiment of the system is for
        a non-premixed combustion system. In a non-premixed combustion
        system, fuel and oxidant are provided separately into the
        combustion chamber and mixed within the combustion chamber. In
        the preferred embodiment, a fuel jet 18 provides fuel via a
        central stream. Adjacent the central fuel jet is an oxidant jet
        19. In the preferred embodiment, oxidant jet 19 is annular which
        surrounds the central fuel jet. However, various oxidant jet
        configurations may be had which provide for a flow of oxidant to
        encircle the fuel flow. The fuel and oxidant are mixed within
        the combustion chamber to provide a combustible reactants
        mixture. As shown in FIG. 1A, the jets have their outlets
        aligned to prevent any pre-mixing and are preferably axially
        aligned with vessel 10. These jets may be located within the
        combustion chamber or in a close proximity outside of the
        combustion chamber. The combustible reactants are capable of
        being injected into the combustion chamber at different rates
        via a nozzle, and the combustion process may have a turndown
        ratio of at least 1.5 and can be greater. </p>
      <p>[0053] As shown in FIG. 1B, the separate fuel and oxidant flows
        interact within the combustion chamber. As fuel flow 32 flows
        toward the end wall of the combustion chamber, it interacts with
        oxidant flow 34, which is also flowing toward the end wall of
        the combustion chamber. The interaction of the fuel and oxidant
        flows creates an inner shear layer 40. While this is occurring,
        combustion products and burning gas pockets flow 36 is flowing
        toward the open end of the combustion chamber away from the
        distal end of the combustion chamber. The combustion product and
        burning gas pockets flow 36 is simultaneously interacting with
        the downward oxidant flow 34 creating a second, outer shear
        layer 42. The oncoming reactants flows are also slowed down as
        they approach the closed end wall of the combustion chamber,
        producing a stagnation flow zone 38 near the end wall. </p>
      <p>[0054] In the outer shear layer 42, the oxidant mixes with the
        hot products and in the inner shear layer, the oxidant mixes
        with the fuel. Since the outer shear layer is located between
        two counter flowing streams, the mixing inside this shear layer
        is much more intense than the mixing within the inner shear
        layer that involves mixing between fuel and oxidant streams that
        move in the same direction. The resulting streams of
        fuel-oxidant and oxidant-hot combustion products and burning gas
        pockets that form in the inner and outer shear layers,
        respectively, come into contact and burn in a manner similar to
        a premixed mode of combustion, which produces low NOx emissions
        when the equivalence ratio of the reactants mixture is low.
        Thus, this mixing between the incoming reactants and out flowing
        hot products and reacting gas pockets establishes the feedback
        of heat and radicals needed to attain ignition over a wide range
        of fuel flow rates. Since the presence of radicals in a mixture
        of reactants lowers its ignition temperature, some of the fuel
        ignites and burns at lower than normal temperatures, which can
        lead to a reduced amount of NOx generated in this combustion
        system. </p>
      <p>[0055] The intensity of mixing in the shear layers between the
        incoming reactants and out flowing hot combustion products and
        burning gas pockets generally controls the ignition and rate of
        consumption of the fuel. Specifically, an increase in the mixing
        intensity within these shear layers accelerates ignition and the
        rate of consumption of the fuel. Since in this invention the
        velocities of the co- and counter-flowing streams on both sides
        of the shear layers increase as the fuel supply rate to the
        combustion chamber increases, the intensity of the mixing rates
        inside the shear layers increases as more reactants are burned
        inside the combustor, thus accelerating the ignition and
        combustion of the reactants. Consequently, since the rates of
        the processes that consume the reactants automatically increase
        in this invention as the reactants injection rates into the
        combustion chamber increase, the invented combustion system can
        operate effectively over a wide range of reactants supply rates,
        and thus power levels. It also follows that the invented
        combustion chamber can burn reactants efficiently at rates
        needed for a wide range of applications, including land based
        gas turbines, aircraft engines, water and space heaters, and
        energy intensive industrial processes such as aluminum melting
        and drying. </p>
      <p>[0056] In the embodiment of FIG. 1A, as the hot gases leave the
        combustion chamber, they move around the pipes that supply the
        cold reactants into the combustor. This contact transfers heat
        from the hot combustion products into the reactants stream, thus
        increasing the temperature of the reactants prior to their
        injection into the combustor. This, in turn, reduces the time
        required to burn the fuel or allows the combustion of leaner
        mixtures. </p>
      <p>[0057] FIGS. 3A and 3B illustrate the operation of the
        combustion invention in a premixed combustion mode. As shown in
        FIG. 3A, the system is generally the same as that for the non
        premixed system described with respect to FIG. 1A, except that
        the fuel jet 46 is positioned to provide for the fuel to mix
        with the oxidant flow 48 prior to entering into the combustion
        chamber. As shown in FIG. 3B, the premixed reactants flow 50
        interacts with counter flowing combustion products flow 52 to
        establish only one shear layer 54 between the counter flowing
        streams. The injected combustible mixture is ignited in the
        shear layer 54 at its outer boundary where it mixes with hot
        combustion products and radicals supplied by the stream of gases
        flowing in the opposite direction out of the combustion chamber.
        As the flow of reactants decelerates as it approaches the closed
        end of the combustion chamber, the rate of mixing between the
        reactants and hot products and reacting gas pockets is increased
        by the formation of vortices in the flow. This, in turn, causes
        a larger fraction of reactants to ignite and burn as the flow
        approaches the closed end of the combustion chamber. </p>
      <p>[0058] The invented combustion system can also burn liquid
        fuels in premixed and non premixed modes of combustion. When
        burned in a premixed mode, the liquid fuel is first prevaporized
        and then premixed with the oxidant to form a combustible mixture
        that is then injected into the combustion chamber. The resulting
        mixture is then burned in a manner similar to that in which a
        combustible gaseous fuel-oxidant mixture is burned in a premixed
        mode, as described in the above paragraphs. When the liquid fuel
        is burned in a non premixed mode, the fuel is injected
        separately into the combustor through an orifice aligned with
        the axis of the combustion chamber and the combustion oxidant is
        injected in through an annular orifice surrounding the fuel
        orifice in the manner similar to that used to burn gaseous fuel
        in a non premixed mode, as described above. As in the non
        premixed gaseous fuel combustion case, the oxidant stream is
        confined within two shear layer at its inside and outside
        boundaries. In the inside shear layer, the oxidant mixes with
        the injected liquid fuel stream. In the process, liquid fuel is
        entrained into the shear layer where it is heated by the air
        stream. This heating evaporates the liquid fuel and generates
        fuel vapor that mixes with the oxidant to form a combustible
        mixture. In the outer shear layer, the oxidant mixes with the
        counter flowing stream of hot combustion products and reacting
        gas pockets. The resulting fuel-oxidant mixture that is formed
        in the inner shear layer is ignited and burned in essentially
        premixed mode of combustion when it comes into contact with the
        mixture of oxidant-hot combustion products-reacting gas pockets
        mixture that formed in the outer shear layer. </p>
      <p>[0059] FIG. 4 illustrates a utilization of the combustion
        system when applied to a jet engine. Fuel and oxidant are
        provided via source 56 and directed toward the closed end wall
        58 of combustion chamber 60. The combustion products generated
        in the flame region in the stagnation zone 64 near the closed
        end wall 58, are forced by the closed wall 58 to reverse flow
        direction and move towards the combustor exhaust outlet 66. As
        shown in this embodiment, the combustor exhaust outlet 66 is
        defined as the point within the overall vessel which is
        proximate to the inlet position of the reactants 56. Hence, as
        shown in this embodiment, the combustion chamber itself may be
        part of a larger vessel. In the example as shown, the combustor
        is connected to a transition section 69 with an exhaust nozzle
        68 which enables the combustion products to exit the combustor.
        This exit is to be distinguished from the combustion exhaust
        outlet 66 as utilized herein. </p>
      <p>[0060] FIGS. 5 and 6 illustrate examples of measured average
        temperature distributions within the present invention. FIG. 5
        shows the approximate shape of a flame created when gaseous fuel
        was burned in the present invention. A key feature of the
        present invention is the elimination of high temperature regions
        within the combustion chamber. By eliminating such high
        temperature regions, NOx emissions are minimized. As shown in
        FIG. 5, a section of the flame is stabilized in a location in
        the vicinity of the stagnation zone 70. Also, the average
        temperatures within the invented combustor are generally below
        1800 degrees K. Since the invented combustion systems
        essentially burns gaseous and liquid fuels in a premixed mode of
        combustion, even if the fuel and oxidant are injected separately
        into the combustion chamber, the temperature of the resulting
        flame can be kept below the threshold value of 1800 K that
        produces NOx by controlling the amounts of oxidant and fuel
        supplied into the combustion chamber. When the overall air-fuel
        ratio is high, the resulting flame temperature is low, resulting
        in low NOx emissions. </p>
      <p>[0061] FIG. 6 shows the average temperature distribution within
        the invented combustor for a particular example when burning a
        liquid fuel at an equivalence ratio of 0.48 and injected air
        velocity of 112 m/s. A stagnation zone between 74 and the wall
        was established providing a low velocity region near the distal
        wall where a section of the flame is stably anchored around line
        74. Again, no high temperature regions are evident. </p>
      <p>[0062] FIG. 7 illustrates the dependence of the NOx emissions
        within the combustion chamber shown in FIG. 1, when burning
        heptane liquid fuel in a non premixed mode of combustion, upon
        the injection air velocity and global equivalence ratio. As
        shown by the chart, the power density of the system increased as
        the equivalence ratio increased and the velocity of the oxidant
        increased. This chart illustrates that depending on the ultimate
        utilization of the combustion system of FIG. 1, NOx emissions as
        low as 1 part per million could be obtained with good power
        density or if more power or slower flow rates were desired the
        NOx emissions could still be maintained at low levels without
        changing the combustor size. </p>
      <p>[0063] FIG. 8 illustrates the results of multiple tests
        conducted utilizing the combustion system shown in FIGS. 1 and
        3. The combustion system produced extremely low NOx emissions
        while burning gaseous and liquid over a wide range of reactants
        flow rates and equivalence ratios. Furthermore, since in this
        invention the generated fuel-air mixture is mixed with hot
        combustion products and radicals, such as O, OH and H, the
        combustor can be operated at low equivalence ratios, and thus
        low temperatures, reducing NOx emissions. In fact, FIGS. 7 and 8
        illustrate that tests with the invented combustion system
        produced NOx emissions as low as 1 ppm at 15% O.sub.2 when
        burning gases and liquid fuels in premixed and non premixed
        modes of combustion. </p>
      <p>[0064] In operation as previously described, a method for
        combusting a fuel includes providing a vessel having an opened
        proximate end and a closed distal end defining a combustion
        chamber. A fuel and oxidant are presented into the combustion
        chamber. The fuel is ignited creating a flame and combustion
        products. The closed end of the combustion chamber is utilized
        for slowing the approaching flow, creating a stagnation region,
        and for redirecting combustion products toward the open end of
        the combustion chamber, thus creating a reverse flow of
        combustion products within the combustion chamber. The reverse
        flow of combustion products is intermixed with the oncoming
        reactants maintaining the flame. The utilization of a reverse
        flow of combustion products within the combustion chamber and
        the creation of a stagnation zone maintain a stable flame, even
        at low temperatures. In operation a power density of 100
        MW/m.sup.3 has been achieved. </p>
      <p>[0065] FIGS. 11 and 12 illustrate a first embodiment of a
        combustor assembly 120 for implementing the above described
        technology into a combustion system such as a boiler or a gas
        turbine. FIGS. 13-17 illustrate a combustor assembly for use in
        a jet engine system. Combustor assembly 120 includes primary
        combustor vessel 121 which has a proximate end 122 and a distal
        closed end 124 defining a combustion chamber 126. Proximate end
        122 may define combustion products exit opening 123. Combustion
        products exit opening 123 is preferably concentrically
        positioned within vessel 121. Reactants, which primarily are a
        fuel supply and an oxidant supply are provided into the
        combustion chamber for combustion. The fuel may be either in a
        gas or liquid state and the oxidant from an oxidant supplier
        which is preferably compressed air from a compressor but may be
        from any external source such as a fan. An igniter (not shown)
        ignites the reactants creating a flame and combustion products.
        Due to the geometry of primary combustor vessel 121, the
        incoming reactants flow, which initially flows toward the distal
        closed end, is reversed and the combustion products exit via
        combustion products exit 123. </p>
      <p>[0066] As shown in FIG. 12, combustor assembly 120 includes
        combustor vessel 121, a outer casing or secondary housing 130
        and an air-fuel manifold 140. Outer casing or secondary housing
        130 includes a outer casing or secondary housing interior 131
        which is preferably designed for matingly receiving combustor
        vessel 121. Outer casing or secondary housing interior 131 has a
        larger width than the outside width of combustor vessel 121.
        Outer casing or secondary housing 130 includes an air inlet 132
        for receiving an oxidant supply from compressor, and a flanged
        lower periphery 133 for mating engagement with air fuel manifold
        140. When combustor vessel 121 is received within outer casing
        or secondary housing interior 131, an air channel 134 is defined
        enabling air from the compressor to flow around combustor vessel
        121. In the preferred embodiment, combustor vessel 121 includes
        cooling fins 135 which extend outward from the periphery of
        combustor vessel 121 into air channel 134. In the preferred
        embodiment, outer casing or secondary housing 130 and combustor
        vessel 121 are concentric. Outer casing or secondary housing 130
        may also be a cylindrical sleeve enveloping combustor vessel
        121. </p>
      <p>[0067] Combustor vessel 121 includes a combustor outer wall
        portion 151 defining an outer periphery and a combustor interior
        wall portion 153 defining combustion chamber 126. Combustor
        vessel 121 is preferably cylindrical or a torus having proximate
        end 122 and distal closed end 124. In the preferred embodiment,
        an oxidant supply is provided by a compressor, and travels
        through air channel 134 over outer wall 151 and is directed into
        combustion chamber 126 via proximate end 122 via oxidant supply
        inlet 155. In this configuration the oxidant supply is utilized
        as a cooling agent for cooling the exterior walls of combustor
        vessel 121 and also enables the oxidant supply to be preheated.
      </p>
      <p>[0068] Combustor assembly 120 includes fuel supply inlet 158
        for directing fuel supply into combustion chamber 126. Fuel
        supply inlet 158 may be a nozzle if the fuel is a liquid. Fuel
        supply inlet 158 is positioned in the vicinity of proximate end
        122 for providing fuel into combustion chamber 126 adjacent to
        oxidant supply inlet 155. In the preferred embodiment the
        relationship of the oxidant supply inlet and fuel supply inlet
        is such that the oxidant supply envelopes the fuel supply
        keeping the fuel removed from exiting combustion products until
        mixing with the oxidant. In operation, the mass of the oxidant
        is significantly greater than the mass of the fuel and the
        enveloping enables the fuel and oxidant to thoroughly mix prior
        to combusting. Hence, in operation, as the combustion products
        exit the combustion chamber along a central axis, the entering
        oxidant supply is positioned to flow between the exiting
        combustion products and the entering fuel supply preventing
        premature combustion of the fuel. </p>
      <p>[0069] FIGS. 13-17 illustrate a second embodiment of the
        combustor assembly for use with a turbine system incorporating a
        shaft for driving a compressor. In this embodiment, outer casing
        or secondary housing 130 includes an outer sleeve 172 and an
        inner sleeve 173. Inner sleeve 173 is offset from outer sleeve
        172 defining a combustor vessel cavity 174 for receiving
        combustor vessel 180. Internal sleeve 173 is preferably
        cylindrical having an interior defining a shaft channel 175 for
        receiving turbine compressor shaft 176. Combustor vessel 180 is
        preferably a torus. The torus configuration defines an interior
        wall 186 and an exterior wall 188 both having an interior
        portion and is positioned within combustor vessel cavity 174
        such that an outer air channel 182 is defined between the
        exterior wall of combustor vessel 180 and outer sleeve 172 and
        an inner air channel 184 is defined between the interior wall of
        combustor vessel 180 and inner sleeve 173. Also air-fuel
        manifold consists of a first air-fuel manifold component 190
        which is matingly attached to outer sleeve 172 and second
        air-fuel manifold component 192 which is matingly attached to
        inner sleeve 173. First air-fuel manifold component 190 is
        preferably annular defining a combustion products exhaust port
        194 in conjunction with the open proximate end of the combustor
        vessel. Second air-fuel manifold component 192 is annular
        defining a turbine shaft channel. Second air-fuel manifold is
        preferably concentric with first air-fuel manifold component. </p>
      <p>[0070] FIG. 15 is an exploded view of the combustor vessel 180
        and secondary housing 130. Outer sleeve 172 and inner sleeve 173
        define the combustor vessel cavity 174 for receiving combustor
        vessel 180. Combustor vessel 180 is toroidal having interior
        wall 186 and exterior wall 188. </p>
      <p>[0071] FIGS. 16 and 17 illustrate a close up view of the
        oxidant and fuel supply passages and their interrelationship.
        Oxidant passage 132 defined by the spacing between the combustor
        vessel and the outer casing or secondary housing enables oxidant
        flow to pass over the exterior of the combustion vessel thereby
        providing cooling. The air is preferably provided by a
        compressor. The oxidant passage 132 is in fluid communication
        with manifold oxidant supply channel 160. Manifold oxidant
        supply channel redirects the flow of oxidant from being
        downstream along the exterior of the combustion vessel to
        upstream entering the combustion vessel in the open proximate
        end via oxidant outlet 196. Fuel inlet 210 is defined within the
        manifold for supplying a fuel supply to fuel outlets 212 which
        direct fuel into the combustion vessel. A fuel/air wall
        interface 214 separates oxidant passage 132 from fuel outlets
        212. In one embodiment, oxidant outlet 196 is an annular slit
        circumferentially located along the annular manifold. Also, in a
        similar embodiment, fuel outlet 212 is an annular slit
        circumferentially located along the annular manifold with the
        oxidant outlet 196 disposed between the fuel outlet 212 and
        combustion products exit 123. In this configuration, the oxidant
        and fuel are presented into the combustion vessel such that the
        oxidant supply envelopes the fuel separating the fuel from the
        exiting combustion products. With this separation, the fuel and
        oxidants are allowed to mix as they travel into the combustion
        chamber towards the closed distal end where they reach a region
        of low velocity where the downstream end of the flame is
        stabilized. </p>
      <p>[0072] As shown in FIG. 11, air-fuel manifold 140 is preferably
        annular having a combustor facing surface received within the
        proximate end of the combustor vessel. The manifold includes a
        central void which in conjunction with the open proximate end
        defines combustion products exit 123. Preferably combustion
        products exit is axially aligned with a portion of the closed
        distal end. The manifold carries a plurality of combustible
        reactant ports for directing combustible reactants into the
        combustion vessel from the region of the proximate end towards
        the closed distal end. If the fuel and oxidant are pre-mixed,
        then the pre-mixed combustible reactants are dispersed through
        the combustible reactant ports. In some configurations, the
        oxidant and fuel are supplied separately. </p>
      <p>[0073] The relationship of combustion products exit 123 and the
        combustible reactants ports is important. By directing the
        combustible reactants from the proximate open end towards the
        closed distal end, the combustible reactants reach a position of
        low velocity near the closed distal end. Also, shear layers are
        created between the combustible reactants and the out flowing
        combustion products. In the toroid configuration, the manifold
        includes an outer annular ring having a first plurality of
        combustible reactant inlets, and an interior manifold member
        having a second plurality of combustible reactants inlets which
        are positioned in the proximity of the interior wall of the
        combustion vessel. In these configurations, combustible
        reactants are presented to the combustion chamber in two
        distinct upstream flowing streams which separate the interior
        walls of the inner and outer combustion walls from the
        outflowing of combustion products. The combustible reactant
        inlets may include a first set of inlets for oxidants and a
        second set for fuel if the combustible reactants are not
        premixed. </p>
      <p>[0074] The design of the combustor assembly is suitable for gas
        turbines as shown in FIG. 18, jet engines as shown in FIG. 19,
        and boilers as shown in FIG. 20. As shown in FIGS. 18, 19, and
        20, the combustor assembly is positioned with the closed distal
        end in the direction of the compressor. The air inlet of
        combustor assembly 300 receives compressed air from compressor
        302. The air travels along the exterior wall 310 of the
        combustor vessel cooling the exterior wall and also preheating
        the compressed air. The air and fuel are presented to the
        combustor vessel in the vicinity of the combustor vessel's open
        end 122 which defines a combustion product exhaust port. The
        combustion products exit opening 123 is in the vicinity of the
        system's turbine or turbines 400 and is positioned in the
        direction of the turbines. The air and fuel reach a point of low
        velocity within the combustor vessel due to the closed distal
        wall of the combustor vessel where a fraction of the fuel is
        burned. This combustion is initiated by the interaction of the
        air and fuel with the combustion products which are exiting via
        the combustion product exit opening toward the turbine. By
        directing the oxidant supply over the exterior portion of the
        combustor vessel, the combustor vessel is cooled and the oxidant
        supply is preheated. For a gas turbine system, a generator 410
        is driven, for a jet engine the hot product gases pass through a
        nozzle 420. </p>
      <p>[0075] As shown in FIG. 20 with respect to boilers, the
        combustion vessel 120 is located outside a central boiler 430
        and the combustion reactants are introduced into the boiler from
        the combustion vessel. An exit flue 432 is provided for
        exhausting the gases. </p>
      <p>[0076] The advantages provided by the combustion system are
        capabilities to burn gaseous and liquid fuels with an oxidant in
        either premixed or non-premixed modes of combustion with high
        stability, high combustion efficiency, low NOx and CO emissions
        over a wide range of supply fuel air ratios, pressure and
        temperature, and high power densities. Such a combustion system
        design is especially suitable for gas turbines, jet engines and
        boilers. </p>
      <p>[0077] This invention is using the geometrical arrangement of
        the combustion system to establish the feedback between incoming
        reactants and out flowing hot combustion products that ignites
        the reactants over a wide range of fuel flow rates while keeping
        emissions of NOx, CO, UHC and soot below mandated government
        limits. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A system for real time identification of modes
        of oscillation includes a sensor, an observer, a controller and
        an actuator. The sensor senses a controlled system such as a
        combustor, and generates a signal indicative of the modes of
        oscillation in the controlled system. For example, these modes
        of oscillation can be combustion instabilities. The observer
        receives the signal from the sensor, and uses the signal to
        determine modal functions and frequencies of the modes of
        interest with a pair of integrals with changing time limits. The
        controller receives the modal functions and frequency for each
        mode of interest from the observer, and effects a gain and phase
        shift for each mode. Based on the modal functions, the
        frequency, the gain and the phase shift, the controller
        generates and outputs a control signal, that is supplied to the
        actuator. The actuator controls the modes of oscillation of the
        controlled system, based on the control signal. The system of
        this invention can be used to damp or enhance oscillation modes
        of the controlled system, depending upon whether the oscillation
        modes are beneficial or detrimental to system performance. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract:</b> A pulse combustor apparatus for burning solid
        fuel comprises a Rijke-type combustor tube and has a rotating
        fuel bed for defining a primary combustion zone adjacent the
        fuel bed. The rotating fuel bed tends to minimize agglomeration
        of solid fuel and accumulation of ash during combustion by
        agitating the solid fuel. An inlet conduit is provided for
        introducing a low nitrogen gaseous fuel to the combustion air
        upstream of the combustion zone to minimize the formation of NOx
        in the primary combustion zone. In other embodiments, inlets are
        provided downstream of the primary combustion zone for
        introducing additional air or gaseous, low nitrogen fuel for air
        staging or reburning to minimize the emission of NOx. Sorbents,
        such as limestone, are introduced above the bed to minimize SO2
        emissions. <br>
