      Billions of pounds of plastic waste are littering the world's
      oceans. Now, a Ph.D. organic chemist and a sailboat captain report
      that they are developing a process to reuse certain plastics,
      transforming them from worthless trash into a valuable diesel fuel
      with a small mobile reactor. They envision the technology could
      someday be implemented globally on land and possibly placed on
      boats to convert ocean waste plastic into fuel to power the
      vessels.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers will present their results today at the 253rd
      National Meeting &amp; Exposition of the American Chemical Society
      (ACS). <br>
      <br>
      A sailor for 40 years, James E. Holm says he has watched the sea
      and coastline become more and more polluted. "A few years ago, I
      was sailing through the Panama Canal, and when I stopped at an
      island on the Atlantic side, I was stunned by the amount of
      plastic covering the beach. I thought if I had a chance to do
      something about it, I should."<br>
      <br>
      His partner, Swaminathan Ramesh, Ph.D., was driven by the desire
      and excitement of searching for a new "killer idea" with the power
      to change the world. Ramesh took early retirement in 2005 from
      BASF after 23 years as a research chemist and began looking for
      new opportunities. Ramesh formed EcoFuel Technologies and coupled
      his chemical knowledge with Holm's concerns about plastic wastes
      and ocean pollution. In the meantime, Holm had formed Clean Oceans
      International, a nonprofit organization.<br>
      <br>
      They sought to optimize a technology that can use waste
      hydrocarbon-based plastics as a feedstock for valuable diesel
      fuel. Their goal was to rid the world of plastic waste by creating
      a market for it.<br>
      <br>
      For years, Ramesh explains, pyrolysis technologies have been used
      to break down or depolymerize unwanted polymers, such as plastic
      wastes, leaving a hydrocarbon-based fuel. But the process usually
      calls for complex and costly refining steps to make the fuel
      useable.<br>
      <br>
      Ramesh set out to change the game and developed a metallocene
      catalyst deposited on a porous support material that, coupled with
      a controlled pyrolysis reaction, yields diesel fuels directly
      without further refining. It is also cost-effective on a small
      scale, runs at lower temperatures and is mobile.<br>
      <br>
      "The catalyst system also allows us to perform the pyrolysis as a
      continuous-feed process and shrink the footprint of the whole
      system," Ramesh says. "We can scale the capacity to handle
      anywhere from 200 pounds per 10-hour day to 10,000 or more pounds
      per 10-hour day. Because of its small size, we also can take the
      technological process to where the plastic wastes are." The whole
      system can fit in a 20-foot shipping container or on the back of a
      flat-bed truck, Holm says.<br>
      <br>
      The next step, they say, is to show the technology works well and
      that it can create a useable drop-in diesel fuel. They will soon
      conduct a demonstration project for the government of the city of
      Santa Cruz, California. Officials there are interested in
      implementing the technology to address waste plastics that
      currently cannot be recycled, as well as to formulate diesel fuel
      the city can use for its vehicles, Holm adds.<br>
      <br>
      "If we can get people around the world to pick this up and use it
      to shift waste plastics to fuel and make money, we are winning,"
      Holm says. "We can even eliminate plastic waste before it gets to
      the oceans by creating value for it locally on a global basis."<br>

      <b>FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present disclosure generally relates to a method for recycling
      a plastic. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to a
      method of recycling the plastic in the presence of a catalyst
      including a depolymerization catalyst component and a reducing
      catalyst component.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Plastics are typically made from non-renewable petroleum resources
      and are often non-biodegradable. In the United States, plastics
      are produced in amounts exceeding 115,000 million pounds annually.
      Plastics are used in many industries to form products for sale in
      both industrial and residential markets. In industrial markets,
      plastics are used to form packaging, insulation, construction
      products, etc. In residential markets, plastics are used to form
      bottles, containers, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density
      polyethylene (HDPE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), have commonly
      accepted Recycling Codes of from 1 to 3, respectively, as
      developed by the American Plastics Council. These aforementioned
      plastics are more widely recycled and re-used than many other
      types of plastics. However, plastics such as polyethylenes having
      Recycling Codes of 2, 4, and 7, polypropylene having a Recycling
      Code of 5, and polystyrene having a Recycling Code of 6, can also
      be recycled. Yet, recycling efforts for polyethylenes,
      polypropylene, and polystyrene have not been maximized.<br>
      <br>
      Only a small fraction of the plastics produced each year are
      recycled and re-used. To ease in recycling, the plastics are
      usually crushed, melted, and/or broken down. Plastics that are not
      recycled and re-used present potential environmental pollution
      risks when discarded, are not utilized for energy or raw
      materials, and contribute to an increased reliance on
      non-renewable petroleum resources. Traditionally, plastics are
      recycled according to one of two methods including open- and
      closed-loop recycling. Closed-loop recycling involves using the
      plastic as an input to make the same product again. Open-loop
      recycling involves using the plastic as an input to make other
      products. For example, open-loop recycling may be used to form
      diesel fuel using the plastic as an input. However, neither of
      these methods are particularly efficient because of the
      complexities involved in processing plastics of different colors,
      textures, and consistencies and producing other products.<br>
      <br>
      One particular type of open loop recycling includes decomposition
      of a plastic by heating, in the absence of a catalyst, to reverse
      polymerize the plastic and form monomers. After the plastic is
      decomposed, the monomers can then be used in a variety of
      manufacturing or commercial processes. Traditionally, this
      decomposition through heating forms monomers having an
      inconsistent and/or unpredictable number of carbon atoms, while
      leaving much of the plastic unusable. Formation of monomers having
      unpredictable numbers of carbon atoms inhibits the monomers from
      being effectively recycled into other products.<br>
      <br>
      Another particular type of open-loop recycling includes catalytic
      cracking, which improves on the decomposition of plastic by
      heating alone. As is known in the art, catalytic cracking involves
      reverse polymerizing a plastic, in the presence of a catalyst, to
      form monomers. Traditionally, the catalysts used in catalytic
      cracking procedures include classic Lewis acids such as AlCl3,
      metal tetrachloroaluminates, zeolites, superacids, gallosilicates,
      metals on carbon, and basic oxides. However, many of these
      catalysts are ineffective in selectively cracking the plastics to
      form specific monomers. Although traditional catalytic cracking is
      more efficient in forming monomers than simple decomposition of
      plastics through heating alone, many of these traditional
      catalysts still form monomers having an inconsistent and/or
      unpredictable number of carbon atoms and still leave much of the
      plastic unusable and un-cracked. Accordingly, there remains an
      opportunity to develop an improved method for recycling plastics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE AND ADVANTAGES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present disclosure provides a method of recycling a plastic.
      The method includes decomposing the plastic in the presence of a
      catalyst to form hydrocarbons. The catalyst includes a porous
      support having an exterior surface and defining at least one pore
      therein. The catalyst also includes a depolymerization catalyst
      component disposed on the exterior surface of the porous support
      for depolymerizing the plastic. The depolymerization catalyst
      component includes a Ziegler-Natta catalyst, a Group IIA oxide
      catalyst, or a combination thereof. The catalyst further includes
      a reducing catalyst component disposed in the at least one pore.<br>
      <br>
      The method of the instant disclosure tends to allow for controlled
      and efficient formation of specific hydrocarbons e.g. having from
      4 to 40 carbons, which can be used as fuel. The method also tends
      to allow for increased decomposition of plastic thereby reducing
      reliance on, and slowing depletion of, non-renewable energy
      sources. The method further tends to reduce a need for new mining
      and drilling operations on unused land and also reduces energy
      expenditure associated with refining petroleum to form fuels.
      Still further, the method tends to reduce potential environmental
      pollution by allowing for the decomposition of the plastics that
      are discarded in landfills and by reducing runoff and soil erosion
      from the mining and drilling operations. The catalyst of the
      method tends to contribute to decomposition of the plastic and
      direct formation of these hydrocarbons, typically without a need
      for additional processing or purification. Also, the catalyst
      tends to be inexpensive to dispose of or recycle...<br>
