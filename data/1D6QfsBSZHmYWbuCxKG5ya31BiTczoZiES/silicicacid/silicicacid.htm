      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Silicon (Si) is the most abundant element present in the Earth's
      crust besides oxygen. However, the exact biological roles of
      silicon remain unknown. Moreover, the ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4),
      as a major form of bioavailable silicon for both humans and
      animals, has not been given adequate attention so far. Silicon has
      already been associated with bone mineralization, collagen
      synthesis, skin, hair and nails health atherosclerosis, Alzheimer
      disease, immune system enhancement, and with some other disorders
      or pharmacological effects. Beside the ortho-silicic acid and its
      stabilized formulations such as choline chloride-stabilized
      ortho-silicic acid and sodium or potassium silicates (e.g. M2SiO3;
      M= Na,K), the most important sources that release ortho-silicic
      acid as a bioavailable form of silicon are: colloidal silicic acid
      (hydrated silica gel), silica gel (amorphous silicon dioxide), and
      zeolites. Although all these compounds are characterized by
      substantial water insolubility, they release small, but
      significant, equilibrium concentration of ortho-silicic acid
      (H4SiO4) in contact with water and physiological fluids. Even
      though certain pharmacological effects of these compounds might be
      attributed to specific structural characteristics that result in
      profound adsorption and absorption properties, they all exhibit
      similar pharmacological profiles readily comparable to
      ortho-silicic acid effects. The most unusual ortho-silicic
      acid-releasing agents are certain types of zeolites, a class of
      aluminosilicates with well described ion(cation)-exchange
      properties. Numerous biological activities of some types of
      zeolites documented so far might probably be attributable to the
      ortho-silicic acid-releasing property. In this review, we
      therefore discuss biological and potential therapeutic effects of
      ortho-silicic acid and ortho-silicic acid -releasing silicon
      compounds as its major natural sources.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Silicon (Si) is the most abundant element (27.2%) present in the
      earth's crust following oxygen (45.5%) [1]. Silicon is known for a
      number of important chemical and physical properties, i.e.
      semiconductor property that are used in various scientific and
      technical applications. These Si features, along with structural
      complexity of its compounds, have attracted researchers from the
      earliest times [2]. In particular, silicon dioxide or silica
      (SiO2) is the most studied chemical compound following water, and
      the most important Si-containing inorganic substance [1].
      Formally, silica (SiO2) is a silicic acid anhydride of monomeric
      ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4), which is water soluble and stable in
      highly diluted aqueous solutions. Moreover, several “lower”
      hydrated forms of ortho-silicic acid exist in aqueous solutions as
      well including meta-silicic acid (H2SiO3 or lower oligomers like
      di-silicic (H2Si2O5) and tri-silicic acids (H2Si3O7) including
      their hydrated forms pentahydro-silicic (H10Si2O9), and
      pyro-silicic acids (H6Si2O7) [1]. These are water soluble, formed
      in reversible equilibrium reactions from H4SiO4 and stable in
      diluted aqueous solutions. During a prolonged storage period, at
      increased concentration or in an acidic environment, these low
      molecular silicic acids undergo further condensation by
      cross-linking and dehydration. This process results in formation
      of poly-silicic acids chains of variable composition [SiOx(OH)4-2x
      and complex structure [1]. The end product is a jelly-like
      precipitate, namely hydrated silica (SiO2·xH2O; often referred as
      “colloidal silicic acid” or “hydrated silica gel”). Further
      condensation follows which is accompanied by dehydration yielding
      less hydrated silicon dioxide (SiO2) phases, also known as “silica
      gel” or “amorphous silicon dioxide”.<br>
      <br>
      Lower molecular forms, especially the ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4;
      Figure ?Figure1),1), play a crucial role in delivering silicon to
      the living organisms’ cells and thus represent major sources of
      silicon for both humans and animals. Most of the silica in aqueous
      systems and oceans is available in the form of H4SiO4, which makes
      it an important compound in environmental silicon-chemistry and
      biology [3]. In this paper, we critically review the most recent
      findings on biological effects of Si and ortho-silicic acid on
      animals and human beings. Moreover, we propose that previously
      observed positive biological effects of various colloidal silicic
      acids (various hydrated silica gels) as well as some zeolites
      [4-6], e.g. zeolite A (Figure ?(Figure2)2) and clinoptilolite
      (Figure ?(Figure3),3), might be, at least partially, ascribed to
      the ortho-silicic acid-releasing property.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b>Silicon represents the third most abundant trace element in
      the human body [7,8]. For example, it is present in 1–10
      parts-per-million (ppm) in hair [9], nails [10], in the cornfield
      epidermis, and in the epicuticle of hair [11,12]. Silicon is
      naturally present in food as a silicon dioxide (SiO2), free
      ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4), silicic acids bounded to certain
      nutrients, and in the silicate form. Although silicon is a
      life-important micronutrient mineral, in our opinion it has not
      received adequate attention. Considering the abundance of silicon,
      both in the nature and humans, it is expected that it should play
      an important role in human and animal health.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Silicon bioavailability and consumption</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Presently, many biological roles of silicon remain unknown [13].
      Consequently, the recommended daily silicon intake (RDI) has not
      yet been set [13,14]. Considering the risk assessment of amorphous
      silicon dioxide as common silicon source (e.g. food additive
      E551), the safe upper intake level (UIL) may be estimated as 700
      mg/day for adults, that is the equivalent to 12 mg silicon/kg
      bw/day for a 60 kg adult [15]. These numbers refer to the
      amorphous silicon dioxide form and only small amounts of silicon
      (as H4SiO4) are actually released in the gastrointestinal (GI)
      tract and subsequently absorbed in the systemic circulation. Due
      to lack of data, it is difficult to set a recommended upper intake
      level for silicon. Moreover, little information on the intake of
      dietary silicon by humans is available. A mean intake of daily
      silicon has been reported in Finland [16], (29 mg silicon/day) and
      in a typical British diet (20–50 mg silicon/day) [17-19]. This
      corresponds to 0.3-0.8 mg/silicon/kg bw/day for a 60 kg person.
      These data are in the same range as the estimated mean intakes of
      silicon in the USA (30 and 33 mg silicon/day in men, and 24 and 25
      mg silicon/day in women, respectively) [8]. Silicon intake
      decreases with age to less than 20 mg silicon/day (18.6 ± 4.6 mg
      silicon/day for elderly British woman in an unrelated randomised
      controlled intervention study) [20].<br>
      <br>
      Generally, silicon is abundantly present in foods derived from
      plants such as: cereals, oats, barley, white wheat flour, and
      polished rice. In contrast, silicon levels are lower in animal
      foods including meat or dairy products. Furthermore, silicon is
      present in drinking waters, mineral waters, and in beer as well
      [17]. However, Jugdaohsingh et al. [21] raised some doubt on
      utilisation of silicon from drinking water in an animal rat study
      as no significant differences were found in the silicon bone
      concentration when the drinking water was supplemented with
      silicon in the ortho-silicic acid form. Indeed, the major sources
      of silicon in the typical Western hemisphere diet comes from
      cereals (30%), followed by fruits, beverages and vegetables, which
      altogether comprise around 75% of total silicon intake [20]. Even
      though plant food contains high levels of silicon, its
      bioavailability from these sources is questionable, due to poor
      solubility of actual silicon forms present in these foods
      [18,19,22]. Efficient absorption in the GI tract would require
      their breakdown to soluble species such as ortho-silicic acid,
      present in drinking and mineral waters in the range of 2 to 5 mg
      silicon/L [23] and in beer ranging from 9 to 39 mg silicon/L
      [18,24]. Absorption studies indicate that the ortho-silicic acid
      is a main readily bioavailable source of silicon for humans,
      whereas its higher polymers are not of significant absorbability
      [25]. In a placebo-controlled study on eight volunteers,
      Jugdaohsingh et al. [25] showed that 53% of administered
      ortho-silicic acid is excreted in the urine, whereas the ingestion
      of polymeric silicic acid causes only a marginal increase of
      silicon in the urine. This result substantiates the statement that
      polymeric silicic acids and amorphous silicon dioxide are of poor
      bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      Besides the ortho-silicic acid, water soluble silicates are
      bioavailable silicon forms as well. For instance, pharmaceutically
      acceptable alkali metals silicates (M2SiO3; M= Na, K) in
      adequately diluted aqueous solutions, release ortho-silicic acid
      (H4SiO4) upon contact with stomach hydrochloric acid (HCl).
      Popplewell et al. [26] employed a tracer dose of radiolabelled
      ammonium silicate to measure total uptake and urine excretion.
      Their results revealed that 36% of ingested dose was absorbed and
      completely excreted in urine within 48h. However, elimination
      occurred in two steps where the major dose (90%) has been excreted
      within the first 2.7 hours. They suggested that excess silicon is
      eliminated from the body through two distinct processes, differing
      significantly in the duration. The ‘slower process’ is thought to
      include the intracellular uptake and release of silicon, whilst
      the ‘faster process’ probably includes retention of silicon in the
      extracellular fluids [26]. These data report on increased silicon
      levels in serum upon consumption of silicon-rich food [7,27],
      showing that at least some silicon is available from food as well.
      Indeed, selective silicon deprivation in rats showed a significant
      drop of urinary silicon excretion and fasting silicon serum
      concentration, suggesting that the rats actively regulate silicon
      levels via urinary conservation, perhaps through renal
      re-absorption [21]. Most of silicon present in the serum is
      filtered by the kidney [7,28] suggesting the kidney as its major
      excretion route; silicon levels in serum correlate with those in
      urine. However, it is still not clear how and if the body can
      efficiently retain adequate doses of silicon.<br>
      <br>
      In concentrated solutions, ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4) has to be
      stabilized to avoid its polymerization into poly-silicic acids and
      eventually into silica gel, resulting in a decreased silicon
      bioavailability. This issue has been solved in the field of
      pharmaceutical technology by use of choline chloride in aqueous
      glycerol solution. This resulted in development of a liquid
      formulation known as choline-stabilized ortho-silicic acid
      (ch-OSA). Choline chloride-stabilized ortho-silicic acid is not a
      new chemical entity of ortho-silicic acid, but a complex of H4SiO4
      and choline chloride formed by several possible hydrogen bonds
      between these two compounds. Subsequently, from the standpoint of
      nutrition and pharmacology, the effects of ch-OSA must involve
      effects of both H4SiO4 and choline chloride rather than a new
      chemical entity. Due to a possible impact of choline chloride on
      the chemical stability of H4SiO4, certain specific biological
      effects different from those of a pure ortho-silicic acid or its
      immediate releasing compounds (e.g. sodium silicate), must be
      taken in account. Ch-OSA has been approved for human consumption
      and is known to be non-toxic. Its lethal doses (LD) exceed 5000
      mg/kg bw in humans [29] and 6640 mg/kg bw in animals [30]. The
      ch-OSA represents the most bioavailable source of silicon [22,29].
      Moreover, in a randomized placebo-controlled study [29], the
      bioavailability of ch-OSA during maternal transfer to the
      offspring was investigated in a supplementation study with pigs.
      The authors correlated significantly higher silicon concentrations
      in the serum of weanling piglets from supplemented sows and
      maternal transfer of absorbed silicon between sows and their
      offspring during lactation with high bioavailability of silicon
      from ch-OSA. Importantly, highly bioavailable silicon from ch-OSA
      did not altered calcium, phosphorus and magnesium levels in blood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Therapeutic and biological effects of ortho-silicic acid and
        certain ortho-silicic acid-releasing compounds</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It was reported that silicon is connected with bone mineralization
      and osteoporosis [31], collagen synthesis and ageing of skin [11],
      condition of hair and nails [32], atherosclerosis [33,34],
      Alzheimer disease [9,35,36], as well as with other biological
      effects and disorders. Trace minerals are known to generally play
      a vital role in the human body homeostasis [37] and the serum
      levels of silicon are similar to other trace elements, i.e. of
      iron, copper, and zinc [38]. Silicon is excreted through the urine
      in similar orders of magnitude as calcium. Some researches claim
      that silicon does not act as a protein-bounding element in plasma
      and is believed to exist almost entirely as un-dissociated
      monomeric ortho-silicic acid [28]. While early analyses showed
      that serum contains 50–60 µg silicon/dL [38,39], more recent
      analyses indicate that human serum contains 11–25 µg silicon/dL,
      or levels ranging between 24 and 31 µg/dL (8.5 and 11.1 µmol/L),
      detected by absorption spectrometry in large population groups
      [40]. Interestingly, pregnant women had very low serum silicon
      concentrations (3.3-4.3 µg/dL) in comparison with infants that
      have high concentrations between 34 and 69 µg/dL [27,41].
      Moreover, silicon concentrations in serum showed a statistically
      significant age and sex dependency, as it seems that silicon
      concentrations decrease with age, especially in woman [40].<br>
      <br>
      Biological importance of silicon might be analysed in the context
      of its bio-distribution in the body. For example, the highest
      silicon concentration has been measured in connective tissues,
      especially in the aorta, tracheas, bone, and skin. Low levels of
      silicon in the form of ortho-silicic acid [42-44] may be found in
      liver, heart, muscle, and lung [45]. It is therefore plausible to
      assume that observed decrease of silicon concentration in the
      ageing population may be linked to several degenerative disorders,
      including atherosclerosis. Supplementation of the regular diet
      with bioavailable forms of silicon may therefore have a
      therapeutic potential including prevention of degenerative
      processes. Several experiments have already confirmed this
      hypothesis. For example, in a controlled animal study,
      spontaneously hypertensive rats had lower blood pressure upon
      supplementation with soluble silicon [44], whilst silicon
      deficiency in animals has been found to be connected with bone
      defects and impaired synthesis of connective tissue compounds,
      such as collagen and glycosaminoglycans [46-48]. It is therefore
      reasonable to assume that silicon deficiency or lower
      bioavailability may be linked to problems with bone structure and
      collagen production. Moreover, silicon was shown to be uniquely
      localized in active growth areas in young bones of animals where a
      close relationship between silicon concentration and the degree of
      mineralization has been assessed [46,49]. Studies confirmed the
      essential role of silicon in the growth and skeletal development
      of chicks that during silicon deprivation showed significantly
      retarded skeletal development [50]. Experimental silicon
      deprivation in rats [51-53] and chicks [46,47] demonstrated
      striking effects on skeletal growth and bone metabolism as well.
      On the other hand, the controlled animal study of Jugdaohsingh et
      al. [21] showed no profound effects of a silicon-deficient diet on
      the bone growth and skeletal development in rats. Silicon
      concentrations in the tibia and soft tissues did not differ from
      those in rats on a silicon-deficient diet where the silicon was
      supplemented in drinking water. Nevertheless, silicon levels in
      tibia were much lower compared to the reference group fed by a
      silicon rich diet. Body and bone lengths were also found to be
      lower in comparison with the reference group, while reduction in
      bone growth plate thickness was found in silicon deprived rats
      [21].<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, Reffit et al. [54] found that ortho-silicic acid
      stimulates collagen type 1 synthesis in human osteoblast-like
      cells and skin fibroblasts and enhances osteoblastic
      differentiation in the MG-63 cells in vitro. Ortho-silicic acid
      did not alter collagen type 1 gene expression, but it modulated
      the activity of prolyl hydroxylase, an enzyme involved in the
      production of collagen [55]. Similarly, Schütze et al. [56]
      reported that the zeolite A stimulated DNA synthesis in
      osteoblasts and inhibited osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in
      vitro. This is probably attributable to the ortho-silicic
      acid-releasing property of zeolite A.<br>
      <br>
      The mechanism underlying observed biological effects of silicon
      may probably be ascribed to its interrelationships with other
      elements present in the body such as molybdenum [57] aluminium
      [9,35,58,59], and calcium [46,49,50]. For instance, it was proven
      that silicon levels are strongly affected by molybdenum intake,
      and vice versa[59]. Furthermore, silicon accelerates the rate of
      bone mineralization and calcification as shown in controlled
      animal studies, in a similar manner that was demonstrated for
      vitamin D [11,50]. It is well known that vitamin D increases the
      rate of bone mineralization and bone formation [60], and that its
      deficiency leads to less mature bone development. Vitamin D is
      known to be important in calcium metabolism, but silicon-deficient
      cockerels’ skulls in a controlled animal study showed lower
      calcification and collagen levels irrespective of the vitamin D
      dietary levels suggesting a vitamin D-independent mechanism of
      action [61]. Jugdaohsingh et al. [21] found that silicon
      supplementation in drinking water did not significantly altered
      silicon concentrations in bones and suggested that some other
      nutritional co-factor is required for maximal silicon uptake into
      bone and that this co-factor was absent in rats fed with a
      low-silicon diet compared to the reference group fed by a
      silicon-rich diet. They suggested vitamin K as such co-factor,
      which is important in bone mineralisation through carboxylation of
      osteocalcin, and whose deficiency might influence incorporation of
      minerals such as silicon in the bones.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Osteoporosis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Osteoporosis is among leading causes of morbidity and mortality
      worldwide [62]. It is defined as a progressive skeletal disorder,
      characterised by low bone mass (osteopenia) and
      micro-architectural deterioration [63]. Interestingly, the
      administration of silicon in a controlled clinical study induced a
      significant increase in femoral bone mineral density in
      osteoporotic women [31]. Direct relationship between silicon
      content and bone formation has been shown by Moukarzel et al.
      [64]. They found a correlation between decreased silicon
      concentrations in total parenterally fed infants with a decreased
      bone mineral content. This was the first observation of a possible
      dietary deficiency of silicon in humans. A randomized controlled
      animal study on aged ovariectomized rats revealed that long-term
      preventive treatment with ch-OSA prevented partial femoral bone
      loss and had a positive effect on the bone turnover [65]. Dietary
      silicon is associated with postmenopausal bone turnover and bone
      mineral density at the women's age when the risk of osteoporosis
      increases. Moreover, in a cohort study on 3198 middle-aged woman
      (50–62 years) it was shown that silicon interacts with the
      oestrogen status on bone mineral density, suggesting that
      oestrogen status is important for the silicon metabolism in bone
      health [66].<br>

      <b>Skin and hair</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Typical sign of ageing skin is fall off of silicon and hyaluronic
      acid levels in connective tissues. This results in loss of
      moisture and elasticity in the skin. Appearance of hair and nails
      can also be affected by lower silicon levels, since they are
      basically composed of keratin proteins. As previously discussed,
      ortho-silicic acid may stimulate collagen production and
      connective tissue function and repair. For example, Barel et al.
      [67] conducted experiments on females, aged between 40–65 years,
      with clear clinical signs of photo-ageing of facial skin. Their
      randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled study illustrates
      positive effects of ch-OSA taken as an oral supplement on skin
      micro relief and skin anisotropy in woman with photo-aged skin.
      Skin roughness and the difference in longitudinal and lateral
      shear propagation time decreased in the ch-OSA group, suggesting
      improvement in isotropy of the skin. In addition, ch-OSA intake
      positively affected the brittleness of hair and nails. Oral
      supplementation with ch-OSA had positive effects on hair
      morphology and tensile strengths, as shown in a randomized
      placebo-controlled double blind study by Wickett et al. [68].<br>

      <b>Alzheimer disease</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Aluminium (as Al3+ ion) is a well-known neurotoxin. Aluminium
      salts may accelerate oxidative damage of biomolecules.
      Importantly, it has been detected in neurons bearing
      neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease
      with dementia as shown in controlled studies [69,70]. Amorphous
      aluminosilicates have been found at the core of senile plaques in
      Alzheimer's disease [69,71], and have consequently been implicated
      as one of the possible causal factors that contribute to
      Alzheimer’s disease. Since aluminosilicates are water insoluble
      compounds, the transport path to the brain is still not well
      understood. By reducing the bioavailability of aluminium, it may
      be possible to limit its neurotoxicity. Consumption of moderately
      high amounts of beer in humans and ortho-silicic acid in animals
      has shown to reduce aluminium uptake from the digestive tract and
      slow down the accumulation of this metal in the brain tissue
      [36,72]. Silicic acid has also been found to induce
      down-regulation of endogenous antioxidant enzymes associated with
      aluminium administration and to normalize tumour necrosis factor
      alpha (TNFa) mRNA expression [35]. Although the effect of silicic
      acid on aluminium absorption and excretion from human body
      produced conflicting results so far as shown in an open-label
      clinical study [7], in a controlled clinical study it was shown
      that silicic acid substantially reduces aluminium bioavailability
      to humans [73]. In fact, it was already found that silicon reduces
      the aluminium toxicity and absorption in some plants and animals
      that belong to different biological systems [74-76]. This is
      possible as silicon competes with aluminium in biological systems
      such as fresh water, as suggested by Birchall and Chappell study
      perfomed on the geochemical ground [77], and later confirmed by
      Taylor et al. in randomized double blind study [78]. They found
      that soft water contains less silicic acid and more aluminium,
      while hard waters contain more silicic acid and less aluminium.<br>
      <br>
      Removal of aluminium from the body and its reduced absorption by
      simultaneous administration of silicic acid was tested and proven
      by Exley et al. in controlled clinical study [59]. They showed
      reduced urinary excretion of aluminium along with unaltered
      urinary excretion of trace elements such as iron in persons to
      whom silicic acid-rich mineral water was administered. Moreover,
      they documented that regular drinking of a silicon-rich mineral
      water during a period of 3 months significantly reduced the body
      burden of aluminium. Similar results were obtained by Davenward et
      al. [79] who showed that silicon-rich mineral waters can be used
      as a non-invasive method to reduce the body burden of aluminium in
      both Alzheimer's patients and control group by facilitating the
      removal of aluminium via the urine without any concomitant effect.
      They also showed clinically relevant improvements of cognitive
      performances in at least 3 out of 15 individuals with Alzheimer
      disease. This implies a possible use of ortho-silicic acid as
      long-term non-invasive therapy for reduction of aluminium in
      Alzheimer's disease patients. The mechanism through which
      aluminium bioavailability reduction occurs involves interaction
      between aluminium species and ortho-silicic acid where highly
      insoluble hydroxyaluminosilicates (HAS) forms are produced
      [77,80]. This process makes aluminium unavailable for absorption.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Immunostimulatory effects</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Quartz as a form of crystalline silicon dioxide has been connected
      with severe negative biological effects. However, in controlled
      studies on mouse and rats it was shown that sub-chronic and
      short-term exposure to this compound can actually have beneficial
      effects on respiratory defence mechanisms by stimulating immune
      system through the increase of neutrophils, T lymphocytes and NK
      cells. It also activates phagocytes and consequently additional
      ROS production [81-83] which can help the pulmonary clearance of
      infectious agents. In rats, crystalline silica caused
      proliferation and activation of CD8+ T cells and, to a lesser
      amount, of CD4+ T cells.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, an “anionic alkali mineral complex” Barodon® has shown
      immunostimulatory effects in horses [84], pigs [85] and other
      animals. Barodon® is a mixture of sodium silicate (M2SiO3, M=
      Na,K) and certain metal salts in an alkaline solution (pH= 13.5),
      where sodium-silicate (sodium water glass) represents 60% of the
      total content. In a placebo-controlled experiment in pigs, the
      immunostimulatory effect of Barodon® was assessed by measurement
      of proliferation and activation of porcine immune cells,
      especially CD4+ CD8+ double-positive (dpp) T lymphocytes in
      peripheral blood and in the secondary lymphoid organ [85]. As this
      type of T lymphocyte cells are characterized by a specific memory
      cell marker CD29, they may play a role during activation of
      secondary immune responses as shown in a cross-sectional and
      longitudinal study on pigs [86]. Moreover, Barodon® acted mainly
      on the lymphoid organs, implying a role in antigenic stimulation
      of immune tissues [85]. Barodon® induced increased levels of
      MHC-II lymphocytes and non-T/non-B (N) cells as well along with
      increased stimulatory mitogen activity including the activity of
      PHA, concanavalin A, and pokeweed mitogen [85,87]. In a
      placebo-controlled experiment on pigs, it was shown that this
      mineral complex exerts an adjuvant effect with hog cholera and
      Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccines by increasing the
      antibody titres and immune cell proportions [88]. Moreover,
      Barodon® showed nonspecific immunostimulating effects in racing
      horses and higher phagocytic activity against Staphylococcus equi
      subsp. equi and Staphylococcus aureus as well in a controlled
      study [84]. Administration of Barodon® in horse herds reduced many
      clinical complications, including stress-induced respiratory
      disease, suggesting activation of immune cell populations
      similarly to the treatment with inactivated Propionibacterium
      acnes[89,90]. The exact mechanism of Barodon® immunostimulatory
      effect is not known, although it has been suggested that sodium
      silicate, the main mineral ingredient, might be responsible for
      the observed immune-enhancing properties. Indeed, sodium silicate
      is known to decompose quantitatively into bioavailable
      ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4) in the acidic gastric juice (HCl), and
      as such being absorbed in the body. In this manner, presumably all
      observed pharmacological effects of Barodon® are actually
      originated from the ortho-silicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Pure sodium metasilicate (Na2SiO3) also bears immunostimulatory
      effects and acts as a potent mitochondria activator [91]. Dietary
      silicon in the form of sodium metasilicate activates formation of
      ammonia by elevating mitochondrial oxygen utilisation as shown in
      a controlled animal experiment [91]. These findings further
      corroborate the hypothesis that sodium silicate might be
      responsible for immunostimulatory effects of Barodon®. Once again,
      the pharmacologically active species was ortho-silicic acid
      released upon the action of stomach hydrochlorid acid on sodium
      metasilicate.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Zeolites as a source of ortho-silicic acid</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Zeolites are a class of aluminosilicates of general formula
      (Mn+)x/n[(AlO2)x(SiO2)y·mH2O, wherein M represents a positively
      charged metal ion such as sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), magnesium
      (Mg2+), or calcium (Ca2+). Zeolites are crystalline
      aluminosilicates with open 3D framework structures built of SiO4
      and AlO4 tetrahedra linked to each other by sharing all the oxygen
      atoms to form regular intra-crystalline cavities and channels of
      molecular dimensions [92]. The positively charged metal ions (e.g.
      Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+) are positioned in these cavities of
      aluminosilicate skeleton which are termed as micro- (2–20 Å),
      meso- (20–50 Å), and macro-(50–100 Å) -pores. These ions are
      readily exchangeable in contact with aqueous solution of other
      positively charged ions (e.g. heavy metal ions like Hg2+). This
      structural characteristic of zeolites is the base of their ion
      (cation)-exchange property [93].<br>
      <br>
      At present, 191 unique zeolite frameworks have been identified
      [94], while over 40 naturally occurring zeolite frameworks have
      been described. Zeolites have been widely employed in chemical and
      food industries, agriculture, and environmental technologies as
      adsorbents, absorbents, adsorbent filter-aids, ion-exchangers,
      catalysts, active cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredients, soil
      improvers, etc. [95-103]. Besides, zeolites exhibit a number of
      interesting biological activities [5,104,105] (Figure
      ?(Figure4).4). For example, nontoxic natural zeolite
      clinoptilolite affects tumour cells proliferation in vitro and
      might act as an adjuvant in cancer therapy [105]. Katic et al.
      [106] confirmed that clinoptilolite influences cell viability,
      cell division, and cellular stress response that results in
      antiproliferative effect and apoptosis induction in vitro.
      Obtained results demonstrated that clinoptilolite biological
      effect on tumour cells growth inhibition might be a consequence of
      adsorptive and ion-exchange characteristics that cause adsorption
      of some serum components by clinoptilolite [106]. Similarly,
      clinoptilolite showed antiviral effects in vitro and a potential
      in antiviral therapy either for local skin application against
      herpesvirus infections or oral treatment of adenovirus or
      enterovirus infections [107]. The antiviral mechanism is probably
      non-specific and is based on adsorption of viral particles on
      external cavities at the clinoptilolite surface rather than a
      consequence of ion-exchange properties.<br>
      <br>
      Each zeolite particle acts like a large inorganic molecule and
      acts as a molecular sieve with a potential in molecular medicine
      in molecular medicine. Their pores are indeed, rather small (less
      than 2 nm to 50 nm) [108], and these structural similarities
      between the cages of zeolites and binding sites of enzymes
      resulted in development of zeolite structures that mimic enzyme
      functions [108], e.g. haemoglobin, cytochrome P450 or iron-sulphur
      proteins [109].<br>
      <br>
      Important data on biological zeolites fate (Figure ?(Figure5)5)
      and effects in vivo have been widely reported so far in the
      scientific literature. For example, it was shown that zeolites
      bear detoxifying and decontaminant properties when added to animal
      diets, reducing levels of heavy metals (e.g. lead, mercury, and
      cadmium) and various organic pollutants, i.e. radionuclides
      (Figure ?(Figure6)6) and antibiotics [108]. Furthermore, zeolites
      have been successfully utilized for haemodialysis, for cartridges
      in haemoperfusions, for wound healing, and surgical incisions
      [108]. For instance, QuikClot and Zeomic formulations are already
      being marketed for haemorrhage control [110] and dental treatment
      [5], respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Several toxicological studies proved that certain natural zeolite,
      e.g. clinoptiolite are non-toxic and completely safe for use in
      human and veterinary medicine [105]. In vitro and in vivo
      controlled animal studies have shown that clinoptilolite is an
      inert substance that may cause, in some instances, only moderate
      but not progressive fibrosis or mesothelioma [111]. This effect
      might be attributed to side-substances present in natural
      zeolites, e.g. silica or clay aluminosilicates [112]. It should be
      also stated that some zeolites might be extremely dangerous for
      human health and exert negative biological effects. For example,
      erionite, a fibrous type of natural zeolite, causes a high
      incidence of mesotheliomas and fibrosis in humans and experimental
      animals [113].<br>
      <br>
      Animal studies have also shown the possibility of zeolite A
      (sodium aluminosilicate) as a viable source of silicon [4,6,114].
      The latter is one of known zeolites that breaks down into
      bioavailable ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4) in the digestive system.
      This property arises from the structure of zeolite A which is
      characterized by the same number of aluminium and silicon atoms in
      zeolite A [115]. Zeolite A is hydrolysed at low pH (stomach
      hydrochloric acid) into ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4) and aluminium
      ions (Al3+). These are combined back to the amorphous
      aluminosilicate. Such process readily provides additional source
      of bioavailable silicon to the organism [114,116]. Indeed,
      randomized placebo-controlled studies on dogs [114] proved that
      silicon is absorbed upon oral administration of zeolite A.
      Comparable results have been obtained in a randomized
      placebo-controlled research on horses as well [6]. Addition of
      zeolite A to the diet of young racing quarter horses have resulted
      in decreased skeletal injury rates and better training performance
      [117]. However, increased bone formation was found in randomized
      controlled studies on broodmare horses [118], but not in yearling
      horses [119]. Food supplementation with zeolite A in calves showed
      no changes in bone architecture or mechanical properties [120].
      However, in a controlled study Turner et al. [120] showed
      increased aluminium content in the bone and cartilage of zeolite
      A-fed calves which is an important safety issue for the zeolite A
      therapeutic usage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In conclusion, we believe that ortho-silicic acid (H4SiO4) might
      be a prominent therapeutic agent in humans. Some potential
      therapeutic and biological effects on bone formation and bone
      density, Alzheimer disease, immunodeficiency, skin, hair, and
      nails condition, as well as on tumour growth, have already been
      documented and are critically discussed in the presented paper.
      Acid forms of ortho-silicic acid include:
      choline-chloride-stabilized ortho-silicic acid (ch-OSA) as a
      specific pharmaceutical formulation of H4SiO4, simple water
      soluble silicate salts such as sodium silicate (E550; Na2SiO3) or
      potassium silicate (E560; K2SiO3), and certain water-insoluble
      forms that, upon contact with stomach juice (HCl), release small,
      but biologically significant amounts of ortho-silicic acid. The
      latter involves: colloidal silicic acid (hydrated silica gel),
      amorphous silicon dioxide (E551), certain types of zeolites such
      as zeolite A (sodium aluminosilicate, E554; potassium
      aluminosilicate, E555; calcium aluminosilicate, E556), and the
      natural zeolite clinoptilolite. However, for some of the
      above-proposed therapeutic perspectives of both ortho-silicic acid
      and ortho-silicic acid -releasing derivatives, additional insights
      into biological mechanisms of action and larger studies on both
      animals and humans are required.<br>

      Silicon (Si) is important biogenic microelement which exhibits
      several roles in human and animal organism:<br>
      (i) helps resorption of calcium and takes part in its transport,
      stimulates osteoblasts; stimulates bone mineralization; in
      traumatic cases provides faster bone healing; prevents
      osteoporosis [E. M. Carlisle: A requirement for silicon for bone
      growth in culture, Fed. Proc. 37 (1978) 1123; E. M. Carlisle: A
      relation between silicon and calcium in bone formation, Fed. Proc.

      P. H. Thompson, J. J. Powell: Dietary silicon and bone health,
      Nutr. Bull. 30 (2005) 222];<br>
      (ii) takes part in structure of connective tissue and formation of
      functional tertiary structure of building proteins of soft organs
      like liver, lung, and brain; takes part in structure of arterial,
      vein, and capillary walls, increases elasticity and hardness of
      blood vessels, decreases their permeability [E. . Carlisle, D. L.

      461; E. M. Carlisle, C. Suchil: Silicon and ascorbate interaction
      in cartilage formation in culture, Fed. Proc. 42 (1983) 398];<br>
      (iii) acts as cross-linking agent for glucosaminoglycans and
      mucopolysaccharides in joints, ligaments and sinovial fluid [K.
      Schwartz: A bound form of silicon in glycosaminoglycans and
      polyuronides, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA 70 (1973) 1608; A. Lassus:

      lesions, arthropathy and onychopathy. A pilot study. J. Int. Med.

      Eisinger, P. Detolle: Silicium, tissu osseux et immunite, Revue du
      Rhumatisme 46 (1979) 483] ;<br>
      (v) exhibits antiinflammatory action at various inflammatory
      diseases like arthritis, osteoarthritis, skin disorders like
      psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, neurodermitis , skin
      irritations; hastes wound healing, soothes decubitus, etc. [A.

      treatment of psoriatic skin lesions, arthropathy and onychopathy.
      A pilot study. J. Int. Med. Res. 25 (1997) 206];<br>
      (vi) in oligomeric form, silicic acid decreases resorption of
      aluminum (Al&lt;3+&gt;) from gastrointestinal tract, thus beside
      antioxidative action, preventively acts on development of
      neurodegenerative diseases connected with prolonged exposure to
      aluminum, like Alzheimer disease [J. D. Birchall, J. S. Chappell:

      man and effects on aluminium excretion, J. Inorg. Biochem. 76

      (vii) stimulates biosynthesis of skin building proteins: collagen
      and elastin [C. D. Seaborn, F. H. Nielsen: Silicon deprivation
      decreases collagen formation in wounds and bone, and ornithine
      transaminase enzyme activity in liver, Biol. Trace Element Res. 89

      (viii) stimulates growth and improves strength and shine of hair
      and nails [A. Lassus: Colloidal silicic acid for oral and topical
      treatment of aged skin, fragile hair and brittle nails in females,
      J. Int. Med. Res. 21 (1993) 209]; and<br>
      (ix) antioxidative action; by this way preventively acts on
      development of atherosclerosis and other diseases caused by
      prolonged oxidative stress condition such as diabetes and diabetes
      complications [J. Loeper, J. Goy-Loeper, L. Rozensztajn, M.

      Bull. Acad. Natl. Med. 163 (1979) 530-534].<br>
      <br>
      At plants, silicon exhibits the following effects [H. A. Currie,
      C. C. Perry: Silica in Plants: Biological, Biochemical and
      Chemical Studies, Ann. Botany 100 (2007) 1383-1389]:<br>
      <br>
      (i) stimulates photosynthesis process and increases utility of
      nutrients what results in enhanced crop yields;<br>
      (ii) improves water management and thus enhances resistance to
      stress conditions like drought; and<br>
      (iii) enhances resistance to insect attacks and fungal diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Biologically available source of silicon is ortho-silicic acid
      (H4Si04) . It is known to those skilled in the art that silicic
      acid, in its monomeric form, ortho-silicic acid (H Si04) is not
      stable, but at higher concentrations undergoes polymerization
      yielding dimeric (H6Si207) , trimeric (H8Si3Oi0) , as well as
      linear unbranched oligomers (SI) which are all water soluble.
      Linear polymers of silicic acid (SI) undergo further
      polymerization giving tridimensional, branched polymers (S2) which
      are of very low water solubility and give opalescent gel. The
      process of polymerization proceeds further with generation of
      hydrated silicon dioxide (silica gel; Si02-xH20) . The course of
      polymerization of silicic acid is given in Scheme 1, at the end of
      the specification.<br>
      <br>
      Beside monomeric ortho-silicic acid (H Si04) , biologically
      available forms are also its lower oligomers that are soluble in
      water; they release starting H4Si0 by hydrolysis (oligomerization
      is reversible) . In other words, at certain concentrations, an
      equilibrium between monomeric ortho-silicic acid and its lower
      oligomers is established.<br>
      <br>
      Branched polymers of silicic acid are not biologically available
      [H. Yokoi, S. Enomoto: Effect of degree of polymerization of
      silicic acid on the gastrointestinal absorption of silicate in
      rats, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 27 (1979) 1733; K. Van Dyck, R. Van
      Cauwenbergh, H. Robberecht: Bioavailability of silicon from food
      and food supplements, Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 363 (1999) 541] .<br>
      <br>
      The use of natural, as low as possible refined food (e.g. whole
      grain cereals), usually provides sufficient intakes od silicon to
      organism. However, at the use of highly refined and unhealthy
      food, deficiency of silicon can take place. Such conditions, with
      eventual accompanied factors, often can cause development of
      diseases or disorders connected with silicon deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Because of this reason, development of stabilized form of ortho-
      silicic acid, wherein its polymerization is inhibited, and
      consequently increased its bioavailability, is of a great
      importance .<br>
      <br>
      Such products can be used as effective food supplements or
      therapeutic agents at such diseases or disorders. For the use in
      nutrition, medicine, and cosmetic, there are included only
      pharmacologically acceptable forms of silicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      In agriculture, therein also only non-toxic forms of silicic acid
      of high bioavailability can be employed.<br>
      <br>
      The most known product which is used as food supplement for
      silicon supplementation is "BioSil(R)" which is based on choline
      chloride (2)- stabilized ortho-silicic acid [S. R. Bronder, WO
      95/21124; V. Berghe, D. A. Richard, EP 1 371 289 Al (2002) ,
      BioPharma Sciences B. V. , Belgium] .<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, in patent literature there are disclosed other,
      mainly as auxiliary, stabilizers that inhibit polymerization of
      ortho- silicic acid such as: boric acid (H3B03) or sodium
      tetraborate natrijev tetraborat (Na2B407 . 10H2O) [L. J.
      Clapsdale, M. G. Syracuse: Nongelling aqueous silica sols
      stabilized with boron compounds, <b>US 2,630,410</b> (1953);
      Union Carbide Co.]; H3B03 in the presence of humectants like
      polyethylene glycol, urea, sorbitol; then polysorbates ; pectin;
      ethoxylated higher fatty acids; acetylated or
      hydroxypropyl-starch; starch phosphate; maltitol; vitamins [W. A.
      Kros, US Patent application 2006/0178268 Al]; amino acids proline,
      serine, lysine, arginine, glycine or their mixtures; polypeptides
      or protein hydrolyzates [V. Berghe, D. A. Richard, WO 2004/016551
      Al , BioPharma Sciences B.V.) ; <br>

      assimilable orthosilicic acid, which is under solid form, stable
      and concentrated, and a process for preparation of said complex,
      US Patent 6,335,457 Bl (2002) Exsymol S.A.M., onako] ; and calcium
      chloride (CaCl3) in combination with choline chloride or betaine
      [V. Berghe, D. A. Richard, WO 2003/077657 Al, Bio Pharma Sciences
      B.V.] .<br>
      <br>
      Partially polymerized forms of silicic acid (of nano-sized
      particles) were stabilized with strong inorganic acids in the
      presence of methyl sulfonilmethane (CH3S02CH3) or
      dimethylsulfoxide (CH3SOCH3) and humectants like 1 , 2-propylene
      glycol or polyethyene glycol 400 (PEG-400) [I. Suvee, G. Tourgis:
      Hydronium stabilized and dissoluble silicic acid nanoparticles :
      Preparation, stabilization and use, WO 2009/127256 Al (2008)].<br>
      <br>
      Somewhat similar products are based on silicic acid stabilized by
      alkali hydroxides [J. M. Rule: Process of making stable silica
      sols and resulting composition, US Patent 2,577,485 (1951) E.I.
      DuPont de Nemours Co.] or as basic complexes with amino acid
      arginine in the presence of inositol [M. F. McCarty, J. Zielinski:
      Arginine silicate complex and use thereof, US Patent 5,707,970
      (1998); V. Juturu, J. R. Komorowski: Arginine silicate inositol
      complex and use thereof, WO2004/017913 A2 (2002) and US Patent
      7,576,132 B2 (2005)] . However, in these cases, silicic acid is
      present in anionic form (as silicate; Si (OH) 30&lt;"&gt; or
      Si03&lt;2"&gt;) .<br>
      <br>
      Beside choline chloride-stabilized ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) ,
      on the market there can be find various food supplements
      containing silicon in the forms of amorphous or colloidal silicon
      dioxide (Si02) - The latter is also called "silicic acid", despite
      the fact that it is actually an anhydride of silicic acid. Such
      products are characterized by very low bioavailability [R.
      Jugdaohsingh : Silicon and bone health, J. Nutr. Health Aging 11
      (2007) 99] .<br>
      <br>
      Alternative and slightly more effective (bioavailable) sources of
      silicic acid are various plant drugs like extracts of horsetail
      (Equisetum arvense) , nettle {Urtica dioica) , and some other
      plants. However, it is known that portion of soluble (and thus
      bioavailable) silicic acid from these healing plants usualy does
      not exceed 10% w/w. All other silicic acid is insoluble and thus
      not biologically available [D. Kustrak: Pharmacognosy and
      phytopharmacy , (in Croatian) Golden marketing-Tehnicka knjiga,
      Zagreb, Croatia (2005) ] .<br>
      <br>
      In agriculture, the products based on silicon are used for
      increasing of resistance to stress (at drought and hail) and
      fungal diseases. Widely known products contain extract of
      horsetail (Equisetum arvense) or milled quartz sand (silicon
      dioxide; SiCb) in organic, and solution of potassium silicate (30%
      w/w K2Si03) in conventional agriculture (most often in wine
      growing: e.g. "Sil- Matrix&lt;R&gt;") . Such products are usually
      employed by foliar application.<br>
      <br>
      The technical problem of effective stabilization of ortho-silicic
      acid (H4Si04) :<br>
      <br>
      (i) at low pH value (stabilization of solution from the present
      invention) ; as well as<br>
      (ii) at physiological conditions (close to pH= 7; where the rate
      of its polymerization is drastically reduced, and consequently
      increases its bioavailability) ; is solved on a new and effective
      manner as will be demonstrated in detailed description of the
      invention.<br>

      </b><br>
      The present invention involves improved formulation of stabilized
      solution of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) which is used in
      nutrition, medicine, cosmetic, veterinary, or agriculture as
      effective source of highly bioavailable silicon (Si) .<br>
      <br>
      The solution is consisting of the following ingredients:<br>
      <br>
      (i) ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04), from 0.01-8% w/w;<br>
      (ii) carnitine salt (1) of pharmaceutically acceptable acids,<br>
      X= CI, H2P04, HSO", N03, CH3SO3, C6H5S03, 1 , 4 -CH3C5H4S03 from
      7-40% w/w;<br>
      (iii) pharmaceutically acceptable acid, from 0.05-4 molar
      equivalents to H4Si04;<br>
      (iv) auxiliary stabilizer of H4Si04, selected from the group
      comprising: glycerol, 1 , 2-propylene glycol, d-panthenol,
      glucosamine, or their mixtures, from 10-50% w/w; and<br>
      (v) diluent, selected from the group consisting of purified water,
      ethanol or their mixtures, in amounts of up to 100% w/w of overall
      formulation.<br>
      <br>
      Since enantiomeric form of carnitine does not have any impact on
      stabilization of H4Si0 , herein mentioned salts can be derivatives
      of racemic DL-carnitine or enantiomerically pure L- or
      D-carnitine.<br>
      Carnitine salt is selected from the group consisting of: carnitine
      hydrochloride (la; X= CI), carnitine dihydrogenphosphate (lb; X=
      H2P0 ), carnitine hydrogensulfate (lc; X= HS0 ) , carnitine
      nitrate (Id; X= N03) , carnitine methanesul fonate (le; X= CH3S03)
      , carnitine benzenesul fonate (If; X= C6H5S03) , carnitine
      p-toluenesulfonate (lg; X= 1 , 4-C6H4S03) , or mixtures of these
      substances.<br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable acid which is used in the solution
      from the present invention is selected from the same group, where
      the advantage is given to phosphoric acid (H3P04) , because it was
      found that H3PO4 additionally stabilizes ortho-silicic acid
      (H4Si04), presumably by inhibition of its polymerization (see
      Table 1) .<br>
      <br>
      Glucosamine as auxiliary stabilizer is used either in the form of
      free base, or corresponding salt of pharmaceutically acceptable
      acid such as sulphuric (H2S04) , phosphoric (H3P04) , hydrochloric
      (HC1) , or other above-mentioned acid. Unexpectedly, it was found
      that carnitine salts like carnitine hydrochloride (la) ,
      effectively act as stabilizers of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si0 ) at
      low pH values (acidic medium) .<br>
      <br>
      In this manner, solutions of ortho-silicic acid of concentration
      of 2-4% w/w, prepared by hydrochloric acid (HC1 ) -catalysed
      hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate [TEOS; Si(OC2H5)4], are
      stable at room temperature (20-25 [deg.]C) for 2-3 months. During
      storage, slow polymerization occurs (as given in Scheme 1) with
      formation of opalescent gel.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, carnitine hydrochloride (la) in concentration from 7-
      40% w/w does act as stabilizer of ortho-silicic acid (H4S04) due
      to the fact that solutions of analogous concentrations do not
      undergo gelling, e.g. polymerization, even after 2 years storage
      at room temperature .<br>
      <br>
      Mechanism of stabilizing action of carnitine salts such as
      hydrochloride la on H4Si04 in acidic medium is presumably
      analogous to the same action of choline chloride, which is known
      stabilizer from the literature; this effect obviously includes the
      impact of "deep eutectic liquid" property of these compounds when
      they are in mixture with suitable hydrogen bond donors like
      glycerol [S. R. Bronder, US Patent 5,922,360 (1999)] .<br>
      <br>
      In the prior art there are described deep eutectic mixtures and
      their use as solvents or as reaction mediums [A. P. Abbott, D.
      Boothby, G. Capper, D. L. Davies, R. K. Rasheed: Deep Eutectic
      Solvents Formed between Choline Chloride and Carboxylic acids:
      Versatile Alternatives to Ionic Liquids, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 126
      (2004) 9142-9147; M. Figueiredo, C. Gomes, R. Costa, A. Martins,
      C. M. Pereira, F. Silva: Differential capacity of deep eutectic
      solvent based on choline chloride and glycerol on solid
      electrodes, Electrochim. Acta 54 (2009) 2630-2634] .<br>
      <br>
      However, choline chloride (2) destabilizes ortho-silicic acid
      (H4Si04) at pH conditions that are close to physiological (around
      7) . Moreover, choline chloride in these conditions does catalyze
      polymerization of H Si0 (see Table 1), what actually decreasing
      its bioavailability .<br>
      <br>
      Completely unexpectable , it was found that carnitine
      hydrochloride (la) , in contrast to choline chloride (2) , under
      physiological conditions close to pH= 7, does not destabilize
      ortho-silicic acid significantly, and thus represents an important
      improved version:<br>
      <br>
      (i) of "deep eutectic liquid" which does stabilize H4Si04 in
      acidic pH medium of the solution from the present invention; as
      well as<br>
      (ii) in the same time does not influence negatively (does not
      destabilize) the stability of H Si0 under physiological conditions
      (pH values around 7), and in this manner does not decrease its
      bioavailability .<br>
      The effect was found and studied on a model solution of DL- (+-) -
      carnitine hydrochloride (la) and ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) ,
      prepared by hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate [TEOS;
      Si(OC2H5)4] in the presence of phosphoric acid (H3P0 ) . The
      hydrolysis reaction of TEOS with formation of the complex of
      H4Si04 and la in molar ratio of 1:1, compound 3a, is given in
      Scheme 2, end of specification.<br>
      For the purpose of study of the effect of DL- (+-) -carnitine
      hydrochloride on stabilization of H4Si04, as controls, the
      following samples are prepared:<br>
      (i) a standard solution of H4Si0 of concentration of 1% w/w Si;
      and<br>
      (ii) a solution of analogous complex of H4Si04 with choline
      chloride (2) with the same molar ratio (1:1) . The study of
      stabilizing effect was carried out under conditions that are known
      to lead fast polymerization of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) , and
      these are at pH values close to neutral. At such conditions, pH=
      6-7, relatively fast polymerization of H4Si04 takes place, with
      formation of its poylmers in the form of opalescent gel. In more
      concentrated systems, this change, from the phase of solution
      (which is, at the begining, clear and then opalescent) to the
      phase of (opalescent) gel is relatively fast, so it can be
      employed for analytical purpose for determination of gelling
      (polymerization) rate of H4Si04.<br>
      <br>
      Test solutions are prepared by mixing equal volume of solution of
      complex 3a (or complex of choline chloride or standard solution of
      pure H4Si04 of the same concentration) and 1.32M phosphate buffer
      of pH= 7. For these test solutions it was determined the time
      required for change from the moment of mixing (clear solution) to
      the formation of opalescent gel. This time was termed as gelling
      (or polymerization) time (tG) . Longer gelling time (tG) means
      slower polymerization what suggests to more stable complex.<br>

      Results are given in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      a Test solution was prepared by mixing 2 mL of sample solution and
      2 mL of 1.32 M phosphate buffer of pH= 7. Final pH value of all
      test solutions after mixing of corresponding sample solution with
      the buffer was 6.5.<br>

      phosphate buffer (clear solution) until the formation of

      . Shows stabilizing or destabilizing effect on ortho-silicic acid,
      and its polymerization (gelling) .<br>
      d The standard was prepared by addition of TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12 g;
      0.0054 mol) to a solution of 85% phosphoric acid (0.2 mL; 0.34 g;
      0.289 g H3P04; 0.0029 mol; 0.55 mol. equiv.) in distilled water
      (10.00 g) followed by stirring at room temperature for 3 h, with
      subsequent dilution with distilled water up to the total weight of
      15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si] .<br>
      e Sample solutions were prepared by addition of 0.0054 mol of
      choline chloride (2; 0.75 g) , or DL- (+-) -carnitine
      hydrochloride (la; 1.06 g) , and then TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12 g; 0.0054
      mol) to a solution of 85% phosphoric acid (0.2 mL; 0.34 g; 0.289 g
      H3P04; 0.0029 mol; 0.55 mol. equiv.) in distilled water (10.00 g)
      . Reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 3 h, and
      then diluted with distilled water to overall weight of 15.00 g
      [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si] .<br>
      <br>
      From thus obtained results it is clear that choline chloride (2)
      drastically destabilizes ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) at pH values
      close to physiological (pH= 6.5), because the gelling time was
      approx. 5.5 times shorter than in the case of the standard
      (Experiment 2 versus Experiment 1) . This suggests approx. 5.5
      times faster polymerization affected by choline chloride; it not
      only destabilizes H Si04, but moreover does act as catalyst of its
      polymeri zation . Choline chloride can be obviously considered as
      "stabilizer" of silicic acid in a formulation with very low pH,
      lower than pH= 3, in technological sense (as excipient) , helping
      stabilization of final product based on H4Si0 , to ensure
      prolonged shelf life.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, DL- (+-) -carnitine hydrokloride (la) does not
      influence significantly on rate of polymerization of ortho-silicic
      acid (H4S1O4) , where observed gelling time was only 3% shorter
      than for the standard (Experiment 3 against Experiment 1), what
      can be considered as acceptable difference within the limits of
      experimental error which are normally for this method up to
      approx. 5% .<br>
      <br>
      In continuation of the study, it was found that not all strong
      mineral acids influence in the same manner to the stability of
      ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) . Despite that in initial experiments,
      hydrochloric acid (HC1) was employed as classical agent for
      acidification and regulation of pH in pharmaceutical products,
      phosphoric acid (H3P04) appeared to exhibit significant additional
      stabilization effect against polymerization of H4Si04 (Table 2) .<br>
      <br>
      Table 2. Study of influence of pharmaceutically acceptable acids
      on stability of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) at pH= 6.5.&lt;a&gt;<br>
      &lt;a&gt; Test solution was prepared by mixing 2 mL of sample
      solution and 2 mL of 1M phosphate buffer of pH= 8.5; pH values of
      test solutions after mixing of the sample solutions and buffer
      were the same (pH- 6.5) .<br>
      <br>
      The time from the moment of mixing of the test solution with
      phosphate buffer (clear solution) until the formation of
      opalescent gel, expressed in minutes. &lt;c&gt; "Relative
      stability" expressed as numerical parameter, coefficient which
      describes stability of ortho-silicic acid in the given sample in
      comparison with the standard (solution of H4Si04) . Shows
      stabilizing or destabilizing effect on ortho-silicic acid, and its
      polymerization (gelling) .<br>
      <br>
      d These solutions were prepared by addition of TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12
      g; 0.0054 mol) to a solution of 85% phosphoric acid (0.2 mL; 0.34
      g; 0.289 g H3P04; 0.0029 mol; 0.55 mol. equiv.) or 37%
      hydrochloric acid (0.25 mL; 0.30 g; 0.11 g HC1; 0.003 mol; 0.55
      mol. equiv.) in distilled water (10.00 g) at room temperature
      during 3 h, with subsequent dilution with distilled water up to
      total weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si] .<br>
      <br>
      From thus obtained results it was concluded that phosphoric acid
      (H3PO4) in the same concentration provides approx. 40% longer
      gelling time, this means slower polymerization than analogous
      solution where hydrochloric acid (HC1) was employed.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, effect of humectants, which were described in the
      literature like 1 , 2-propylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, and
      polyethylene glycol (PEG) -400, and also substances which have not
      been described (as stabilizers) : d-panthenol (4) and glucosamine
      (5) , on stability of ortho-silicic acid (H Si04) in the presence
      of DL- (+-) -carnitine hydrochloride.<br>
      <br>
      The study was conducted in analogous manner with the use of 1
      phosphate buffer of pH= 8.5. Results are presented in Table 3.<br>

      hydrochloride . &lt;a&gt;<br>
      <br>
      &lt;a&gt; Composition of the sample solutions (% w/w) : 3.5%
      H4Si04 (1% of Si), 7% carnitine hydrochloride (1 mol . equiv. /
      H4Si04), 6.6% ethanol, 20% auxiliary stabilizer, 1.9% H3P04 (0.55
      mol. equiv. / H4Si04) , and up to 100% distilled water.<br>
      Test solution was prepared by mixing 2 mL of sample solution with
      2 mL of 1M phosphate buffer of pH= 8.5; pH values of all test
      solutions after mixing a corresponding sample solution and buffer
      were the same (6.5) .<br>
      b Time from the moment of mixing of sample solution with the
      phosphate buffer (clear solution) until the formation of
      opalescent gel, expressed in minutes.<br>
      c "Relative stability" expressed as numerical parameter,
      coefficient which describes stability of ortho-silicic acid in the
      given sample in comparison with the standard (solution of H4Si04)
      . Shows stabilizing or destabilizing effect on ortho-silicic acid,
      and its polymerization (gelling) .<br>
      d Instead auxiliary stabilizer, in this sample solution was added
      20% w/w more distilled water.<br>
      e Since pH value is in acidic region, as source of glucosamine was
      employed glucosamine sulfate.<br>
      <br>
      The results showed that the claim "humectants (as such) do
      additionally stabilize ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) because of
      retaining water (hygroscopic) action, and thus inhibit its
      polymerization (gelling) [W. A. Kros : Aqueous solution of non-
      colloidal silicic and boric acid, US Patent Appl . 2006/0178268
      Al]" is not valid.<br>
      <br>
      It was observed that polyethylene glycol (PEG-400) does
      destabilize H4Si04, where observed gelling time was more than 30%
      shorter than that for the standard (Table 3; Experiment 5 /
      Experiment 1) .<br>
      Sorbitol does not exhibit any significant influence on stability
      of H4S1O4 in the presence of carnitine hydrochloride; gelling time
      (tG) was the same as for the standard (Table 3; Experiment 4 /
      Experiment 1) .<br>
      <br>
      At other auxiliary stabilizers activity increases in the following
      order (see Table 3) :<br>
      (i) glycerol (+14%; Experiment 2 / Experiment 1) ;<br>
      (ii) glucosamine (+36%; Experiment 6 / Experiment 1);<br>
      (iii) d-panthenol (+57%; Experiment 7 / Experiment 1) ;<br>
      (iv) 1 , 2-propylene glycol (+71%; Experiment 3 / Experiment 1) .<br>
      <br>
      Finally, it appeared that the combination of:<br>
      (i) DL- (+-) -carnitine hydrochloride (la) ;<br>
      (ii) pharmaceutically acceptable acid, among them phosphoric acid
      (H3PO4) is preferred; and<br>
      (iii) auxiliary stabilizer: glycerol, glucosamine, d-panthenol,
      and 1 , 2-propylene glycol;<br>
      <br>
      does stabilize ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) , both at low pH values
      (acidic range) of the solution from the present invention, as well
      as in physiological conditions (pH around 7), in unexpected
      manner.<br>
      <br>
      Study of effect of whole formulation of the present invention
      [combination of (i)-(iii)] was performed on analogous manner, by
      determination of gelling (polymerization) time with the use of 1M
      phosphate buffer of pH= 8.5. As the control probe, the solution
      from the prior art based on mixture of choline chloride and
      glycerol was studied, however, with the same concentration of
      silicon, in order to provide comparable results. Results are given
      in Table 4.<br>

      &lt;a&gt; The test solutions were prepared by mixing 2 mL of each
      of sample solution with 2 mL of 1M phosphate buffer pH= 8.5; pH
      values of all test solutions were corrected to pH= 6.5 by addition
      of small amounts of anhydrous sodium carbonate.<br>

      coefficient which describes stability of ortho-silicic acid in the
      given sample in comparison with the standard (solution of H4Si0 )
      . It shows stabilizing or destabilizing effect on ortho-silicic
      acid, and its polymerization (gelling) . &lt;d&gt; The solution of
      analogous composition like the product "BioSil&lt;R&gt;" was
      prepared by addition of TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12 g; 0.0054 mol) to a
      solution of 85% phosphoric acid (0.2 mL; 0.34 g; 0.289 g H3P04;
      0.0029 mol; 0.55 mol. equiv.) and choline chloride (7.05 g; 47%
      w/w) in a mixture of distilled water (3.00 g) and glycerol (2.85
      g; 19% w/w) with stirring at room temperature for 3 h, with
      subsequent dilution with distilled water (0.64 g) up to the total
      weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si].<br>
      e The solutions were prepared by addition of TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12 g;

      0.289 g H3P04; 0.0029 mol; 0.55 mol. equiv.) and DL- (+-)
      -carnitine hydrochloride (3.75 g; 25% w/w) in a mixture of
      distilled water (6.00 g) and auxiliary stabilizer (3.00 g; 20%
      w/w) followed by stirring at room temperature for 3 h, and
      subsequently diluted with distilled water (0.79 g) up to the total
      weight of 15.00 g [sadrzi 150 mg (1% w/w) Si] .<br>
      <br>
      From thus obtained results, it is clear to those skilled in the
      art that the solution from the present invention exhibits
      drastically enhanced effects of stabilization of ortho-silicic
      acid (H4Si04) at physiological pH values. Observed gelling
      (polymerization) times of H4Si04 were 20-70x longer than the same
      value for analogous solution from the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      The best version of the solution from the present invention is
      based on the combination of carnitine salt (like carnitine
      hydrochloride), 1 , 2-propylene glycol and phosphoric acid (Table
      4, Experiment 5) . Analogous solution with glycerol and
      d-panthenol showed somewhat weaker stabilizing effect. The version
      of the formulation with glucosamine (as sulfate) showed the
      weakest effect, but even this was 20x stronger than is the case at
      the solution based on choline chloride from the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, it was found that the kind of carnitine salt, which is
      used in the formulation from the present invention, does not have
      significant effect. The study of the kind of anion of carnitine
      salt on stability of H4Si0 was carried out analoguously, by
      determination of gelling (polymerization) time with the use of 1M
      phosphate buffer of pH= 8.5. Result are given in Table 5.<br>

      (0.5 mol. equiv. / H4Si04); 6.6% ethanol, up to 100% distilled
      water.<br>
      <br>
      Test solutions were prepared by mixing 2 mL of each of sample
      solution with 2 mL of 1 phosphate buffer pH= 8.5; pH values of all
      test solutions after mixing of each of the sample solutions and
      the phosphate buffer were the same, pH= 6.5.<br>
      b The time from the moment of mixing of a given sample solution
      with the phosphate buffer (clear solution) until the formation of
      opalescent gel, expressed in minutes.<br>
      <br>
      From thus obtained results it is clear that the kind of anion from
      carnitine salt has some effect on stability of H4Si04, however,
      none of them did not exhibit significant negative (destabilizing)
      effect. The best effect showed carnitine dihydrogenphosphate , or
      alternatively, the combination of equimolar quantities of
      carnitine base and phosphoric acid (Table 5; Experiment 2) .<br>
      <br>
      In the case where the work with large amounts of acids wants to be
      avoided, for industrial purpose, the most convenient version is
      the use of carnitine hydrochloride (commercially available) and
      phosphoric acid (Table 5; Experiment 4) .<br>
      <br>
      Explanation of stabilizing effect of the formulation from the
      present invention on ortho-silicic acid (H4SiQ4) . Unexpected
      effect of the formulation from the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      A key unexpected effect of carnitine salt on stability of ortho-
      silicic acid is obviously based on possibility of forming
      relatively stable complexes like compound 3a (Scheme 2) .<br>
      <br>
      In the patent application WO 95/21124, which discloses stabilized
      solution of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) based on choline chloride
      (2) as stabilizer in strongly acidic medium, there are mentioned
      quaternary ammonium salts (where belongs choline chloride itself)
      as stabilizers of H4Si04. The person skilled in the art can
      consider carnitine salts from the present invention also as
      "quaternary ammonium salts" that are mentioned "generically" in
      the prior art, indeed .<br>
      <br>
      However, until the studies described in the present invention, the
      person skilled in the art could not know that stabilizing effect
      of carnitine salts (like carnitine hydrochloride) would be
      substantially different than at choline chloride as sole really
      disclosed stabilizer of H4Si04 from the category of "quaternary
      ammonium salts".<br>
      <br>
      Precisely, in the present invention it has been disclosed that
      choline chloride obviously does stabilize H4Si04 in acidic
      solution as is in the formulation of the solutions from the prior
      art (e.g. at product "BioSil&lt;R&gt;") , however, choline
      chloride at physiological pH values not only destabilizes, but
      moreover catalyzes its polymerization. In this manner, it
      decreases its bioavailability, because, bioavailability of
      polymeric silicic acids are drastically lower. This was confirmed
      in independent study published in the literature, where, for
      corresponding product based on choline chloride
      ("BioSil&lt;R&gt;") determined bioavailability was at a level of
      30% [R. Jugdaohsingh : Silicon and bone health, J. Nutr. Health
      Aging 11 (2007) 99-110] .<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, carnitine salts, like DL- (+-) -carnitine
      hydrochloride, not only act as stabilizers of ortho-silicic
      (H4Si04) in acidic pH medium of the formulation from the present
      invention, but they do not cause its destabilization at
      physiological conditions. In contrast to choline chloride,
      carnitine salts do not catalyze polymerization of H4Si0 under
      physiological conditions, and subsequently, cannot exhibit
      negatively on (decreasing) of its bioavailability .<br>
      <br>
      The reason of this presumably lies behind the fact that both
      choline chloride from the prior art and carnitine salts from the
      present invention, as well as many other quaternary ammonium salts
      are able to stabilize H4Si04 in acidic medium by the way of
      solvation mechanism as "deep eutectic liquids" in combinations
      with hydrogen- bond donors (e.g. polyols like glycerol) . However,
      this effect is lost at physiological conditions wherein pH is
      close to 7. In these conditions differences in the structure of
      quaternary ammonium salts become important, and where not all of
      them can be considered as the same .<br>
      <br>
      Presumably the key factor of stabilization / destabilization of
      ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) is ability or disability to form
      stable complex with the given molecule. Whereas choline chloride
      can act as bidentate ligand for H4Si04, carnitine salts act as
      tetradentate ligands. Because of this, carnitine hydrochloride
      (la) forms far more stable complex 3a than choline chloride (2)
      which gives the corresponding complex with less hydrogen bonds.
      Also, in the case of the use of carnitine salts with acids which
      can additionally stabilize H4Si04, as in the case of phosphoric
      acid (complex 3b), stability is additionally increased (compare
      results from Table 5; Experiment 2/Experiment 1) (Scheme 3, end of
      specification) .<br>
      <br>
      In this case, less stable complex (e.g. with choline chloride)
      means higher equilibrium concentration of free H Si04 (because the
      formation of the complex is a reversible process), and
      consequently its faster polymerization. Unwanted polymerization
      causes shift of the equilibrium of formation of the complex into
      the left (to the degradation direction) .<br>
      <br>
      In short, less stable complex finally results in faster
      polymerization process, what directly leads to decreased
      bioavailability of silicon (Si) at in vivo conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, despite the fact that in the prior art the use of
      strong pharmaceutically acceptable mineral acids in the
      formulations of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) is known, among them,
      there is "generically" mentioned also phosphoric acid (H3P0 ) [I.
      Suvee, G. Tourgis: Hydronium stabilized and dissoluble silicic
      acid nanoparticles : Preparation, stabilization and use, WO
      2009/127256 Al (2008); W. A. Kros, US Patent 2006/0178268 Al],
      there is no a single and clear evidence or study of kind of acid
      on stability of H4Si04.<br>
      <br>
      In the present application, clear additional stabilizing effect of
      phosphoric acid on stability of H4Si04 in solution, is clearly
      demonstrated .<br>
      Finally, in development of the solution from the present
      invention, significant synergistic effect of the formulation of:<br>
      (i) carnitine salts;<br>
      (ii) pharmaceutically acceptabe acid, expecially phosphoric acid;
      and (iii) auxiliary stabilizers, glycerol, glucosamine,
      d-panthenol, and 1 , 2-propylene glycol; on stability of H4Si04
      under physiological conditions (pH values closed to 7) has been
      clearly shown, what is the key prerequisite for high level of
      bioavailability under in vivo conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Preparation of the solution from the present invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The solution from the present invention is prepared by addition of
      precursor of silicic acid ( PSA) of tetraethyl orthosilicate
      [TEOS; Si(OC2H5) ] in previously prepared solution of carnitine
      salt like DL- (+-) -carnitine hydrochloride ( la ) ,
      pharmaceutically acceptable acid, and auxiliary stabilizer of
      H4Si04 according to the invention with vigorous stirring at
      temperatures between -10 [deg.]C to +40 [deg.]C, preferably at +15
      [deg.]C to +30 [deg.]C (room temperature conditions) during 1-24
      h.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, as PSA the followings can be employed:<br>
      (i) sodium or potassium silicate (common composition xM2OySi02; M=
      Na, K, x:y= 1:1 to 1:3.5); or<br>
      (ii) silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) .<br>
      <br>
      However, the use of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) provides
      advantage, since it is neither toxic nor corrosive like SiCl4.
      Moreover, commercially available products are of very high purity
      because TEOS is readily purified by distillation. This provides
      very pure final product with the content of unwanted heavy metals
      (Pb, Cd, Hg, As) far under limits usual for pharmaceutical
      products and food supplements.<br>
      In contrast, purification of sodium or potassium silicate from
      heavy metals is difficult and commercial products are not of so
      high level of chemical purity.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the use of silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4), as
      pharmaceutically acceptable acid is usually employed hydrochloric
      acid (HC1) released during its hydrolysis (4 mol of HC1 per single
      mol of SiCl4) . <br>
      Excess of HC1 is neutralized by addition of corresponding amounts
      of pharmaceutically acceptable base such as sodium or potassium
      hydroxide (NaOH, KOH) , calcium or magnesium hydroxide or
      carbonate [Ca(OH)2, Mg(OH)2, CaC03, MgC03] , etc. In this case,
      corresponding salts of used bases are generated, e.g. NaCl, KC1,
      CaCl2, MgCl2. These salts do not alter stability of ortho- silicic
      acid in the solution from the present invention; these are leaved
      in the final product or, if precipitate, removed by filtration .<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the use of sodium or potassium silicate and silicon
      tetrachloride (SiCl4) , the reaction is strongly exothermic, and
      intensive cooling of the reaction mixture is necessary. At the use
      of tetraethyl orthosilicate, the reaction is only slightly
      exothermic, temperature raises for only a few [deg.]C, and the
      reaction can be conducted with only a mild external cooling,
      without special difficulties .<br>
      In the cases of the use of SiCl4 or sodium/potassium silicate, the
      reaction is complete almost instantly, whilst hydrolysis of
      tetraethyl orthosilicate is far more slower; it tooks from 1.5-2 h
      at room temperature.<br>
      In any case, generated ortho-silicic acid in status nascendi forms
      complex with carnitine (e.g. carnitine hydrochloride) .<br>
      <br>
      As side-products, in reactions with sodium or potassium silicate,
      equivalent amounts of sodium or potassium salt of pharmaceutically
      acceptable acid is generated; these are eventually removed by
      filtration after completion of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of the use of tetraethyl orthosilicate, four molar
      equivalents of ethanol (C2H5OH) is formed. Since ethanol is
      completely non-toxic in this concentration, the latter is not
      subjected to removing, but leaved in the final product as diluent.
      It is known to those skilled in the art that ethanol is usual and
      widely employed pharmaceutical excipient - diluent.<br>
      Hydrolysis of tetraethyl orthosilicate can be carried out in the
      presence of pharmaceutically acceptable acid in purified water
      (only) , whereas all other ingredients (carnitine salt, auxiliary
      stabilizer) can be added afterwards.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the solution from the present invention can be
      prepared by the same manners, with the use of free carnitine
      ("carnitine base" or its zwitter-ionic form), however, then
      pharmaceutically acceptable acid (e.g. H3P04) is used in excess of
      one molar equivalent; this is because one equivalent is spent on
      neutralization of carnitine base.<br>
      <br>
      At the end, the product is subjected to dilution with water up to
      declared concentration of silicon (Si), filtration, and packaging
      into plastic bottles.<br>
      <br>
      The course of reaction is given in Scheme 2.<br>
      <br>
      The use of the solution from the present invention<br>
      <br>
      The use of the solution from the present invention provides all
      known positive therapeutic effects of silicic acid on human,
      animal, or plant organism which are known to a person skilled in
      the art.<br>
      <br>
      The solution from the present invention is employed as food
      supplement or as therapeutic agent for humans and animals, and for
      plant nutrition.<br>
      <br>
      Before the application, the solution is diluted with water to a
      concentration suitable for application:<br>
      <br>
      (i) at humans in doses from 5-15 mg of silicon (Si);<br>
      (ii) in animals in doses from 5-50 mg; and (iii) at plants, by
      foliar application in concentrations from 0.005- 0.01% w/w of
      silicon (Si), in amounts from 10-30 g per hectare (ha) .<br>
      At humans and animals, the solution is used in all medicinal,
      cosmetic, and veterinary indications wherein it is known that
      silicon (Si) acts positively:<br>
      (i) helps in resorption of calcium; takes part in its transport,
      stimulates osteoblasts, stimulates bone mineralization, hastes
      bone fracture healing; in prevention of osteoporosis;<br>
      (ii) takes part in structure of arterial, vein, and capillary
      walls, increases their elasticity and hardness of blood vessels,
      decreases their permeability; also takes part in structure of
      connective tissue and formation of functional tertiary structure
      of building proteins of soft organs like liver, lung, and brain;<br>
      (iii) stimulates immune system; thus increases natural ability of
      organism to fight against microorganisms at infective diseases,
      and in all other disorders and diseases which develop in
      conditions of weak immune system, e.g. allergies;<br>
      (iv) antiinflammatory effect; the therapy of various acute and
      chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g. positively acts at various
      skin diseases such as psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis,
      neurodermitis , eczema, skin irritations, burns, wound healing,
      soothes decubitus, then at dandruff, and other skin diseases and
      disorders; helps also in other inflammatory diseases like
      rheumatoid arthritis;<br>
      (v) acts as cross-linking agent for glucosaminoglycans and
      mucopolysaccharides and thus helps in function of joints,
      ligaments and formation of sinovial fluid;<br>
      (vi) inhibits resorption of aluminum (Al&lt;3+&gt;) from
      gastrointestinal tract, and beside antioxidative action,
      preventively acts on development of neurodegenerative diseases
      such as Alzheimer or Parkinson diseases;<br>
      (vii) stimulates biosynthesis of skin building proteins: collagen
      and elastin; in treatment of wrinkles and prevention of its
      formation; thus helps in slowing-down of skin ageing; (viii)
      stimulates growth of hair and nails; strengthes hair and nails,
      hair becomes even shinier; and<br>
      (ix) acts as antioxidant; prevents development of atherosclerosis
      and other diseases which are caused by prolonged exposure to
      oxidative stress like diabetes and diabetes complications.<br>
      <br>
      It is known to those skilled in the art that analogous biological
      effect silicon exhibits also in animals, and therefore the
      formulation from the present invention is also used in veterinary
      in all mentioned indications.<br>
      In plants, silicon nutrition provides:<br>
      (i) increased crop yields (due to stimulated photosynthesis caused
      by better utility of nutrients added by common fertilization) ;<br>
      (ii) resistance to stress conditions (e.g. during drought or after
      hail) ; and<br>
      (iii) resistance to insects attacks and fungal diseases.<br>
      <br>
      In agriculture, the present solution is diluted with water to the
      final concentration of 0.005-0.1% and used by foliar application
      by all common spraying equipments. Lower concentrations
      (0.005-0.05% of Si) are used preventively for stimulation of
      growth and against development of fungal diseases (e.g. at grape),
      whilst higher concentrations (0.05-0.1% of Si) are employed in
      stressful conditions at drought or after hail. Dosing rates are
      between 10-100 g of silicon per hectare (ha), or 1-10 L of the
      formulation from the present invention in concentration of 1% w/w
      of Si to the sprayer with 200-400 L of water, applied on area of 1
      ha.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the solution from the present invention can be used as
      raw material (intermediate) for production of other pharmaceutical
      products, cosmetics, food supplements, veterinary, and
      agrochemical products with content of highly bioavailable silicon
      (Si) . Examples<br>

      Silicon (Si) is important biogenic microelement which exhibits
      several important roles in human and animal organism:<br>
      (i) helps resorption of calcium and takes part in its metabolism;
      stimulates osteoblasts; stimulates bone mineralization; in
      traumatic cases, influences faster bone healing; helps in
      prevention of osteoporosis [E. M. Carlisle: A requirement for

      (ii) takes part in the structure of connective tissue and

      structure of arterial, vein, and capillary walls, increases

      <br>
      At plants, silicon shows the following effects [H. A. Currie, C.
      C. Perry: Silica in Plants: Biological, Biochemical and Chemical
      Studies, Ann. Botany 100 (2007) 1383-1389] :<br>
      (i) stimulates photosynthesis process and enhances utility of
      nutrients, what results in increased crop yields;<br>
      (ii) improves water management, thus increases resistance to
      stress events like drought; and<br>
      (iii) enhances resistance to attacks of insects and fungal
      diseases.<br>
      <br>
      Biologically available form of silicon is ortho-silicic acid (H
      Si04) . However, in literature, there is described that too large
      doses of silicic acid can cause damages of liver and kidney which
      is the most important organ for excretion of silicon [J. W.
      Dobbie, M. J. Smith: Silicate nephrotoxicity in the experimental
      animal: the missing factor in analgesic nephropathy, Scotish Med.
      J. 27 (1982) 10] .<br>
      <br>
      A person skilled in the art knows that silicic acid in its
      monomeric form, ortho-form (H4Si04) , is not stable and at higher
      concentration, but undergoes polymerization with formation of
      dimer (H6Si207) , trimer (H8Si3O10) , and linear chain oligomers
      (SI) which are still water soluble. Linear chain polymers of
      silicic acid (SI) undergo further polymerization yielding
      tridimensional, branched polymers (S2) which are not of
      significant water solubility but form opalescent gel. The
      polymerization process proceeds further with formation of
      hydratized silicon dioxide (silica gel; Si02'xH20) . The course of
      polymerization of silicic acid is given in Scheme 1 (at the end of
      the specification) . Beside monomeric ortho-silicic acid (HSi04) ,
      biologically available forms are also its lower oligomers soluble
      in water, due to partial hydrolysis that release starting HSi0
      (oligomerization is reversible) . In other words, under certain
      conditions of concentration, the equilibrium between ortho-silicic
      acid and its lower oligomers is established.<br>
      Branched polymers of silicic acid are not biologically available
      [H. Yokoi, S. Enomoto: Effect of degree of polymerization of
      silicic acid on the gastrointestinal absorption of silicate in
      rats, Chem. Pharm. Bull. 27 (1979) 1733; K. Van Dyck, R. Van
      Cauwenbergh, H. Robberecht: Bioavailability of silicon from food
      and food supplements, Fresenius J. Anal. Chem. 363 (1999) 541].<br>
      <br>
      By using natural, as less as possible refined food (e.g. whole
      grain cereals), usual intakes of silicon in organism are
      sufficient. However, at use of highly refined and unhealthy food,
      silicon deficiencies occur quite often. Such conditions, with
      eventual other factors, often can cause development of diseases or
      disorders where silicon plays important role.<br>
      <br>
      Because of this reason, it is of a great importance development of
      stabilized form of silicic acid where its polymerization is
      inhibited and, in this way, lost its bioavailability. Such
      products can be used as effective food supplements or therapeutic
      agents at diseases and disorders caused by silicon deficiency.<br>
      <br>
      For application in pharmacy, cosmetics, and veterinary, only
      pharmaceutically acceptable forms of silicic acid can be employed.
      For use in agriculture, also, only non-toxic forms of silicic acid
      of high bioavailability can be applied.<br>
      <br>
      The most known product used as food supplement for silicon
      supplementation is "BioSil&lt;R&gt;", based on choline
      chloride-stabilized ortho-silicic acid [S. R. Bronder, U.S.
      5,922,360 (1999); V. Berghe, D. A. Richard, E.P. 1 371 289 Al
      (2002), the holder is BioPharma Sciences B.V., Belgium] .<br>
      <br>
      Except choline chloride, in the patent literature there are
      mentioned also other stabilizers that prevent (inhibit)
      polymerization of ortho-silicic acid such as humectants like
      polyethylene glycol, polysorbates, plant gums, substituted
      cellulose, 1 , 2-propylene glycol, pectin, ethoxylated derivatives
      of higher fatty acids, acetylated or hydroxypropyl-derivatized
      starch, starch phosphate, urea, sorbitol, maltitol, vitamins [W.
      A. Kros, U.S. 2006/0178268 Al] , as well as proline, serine,
      lysine, arginine, glycine, their mixtures, polypeptides or protein
      hydrolyzates [V. Berghe, D. A. Richard, WO 2004/016551 Al (Bio
      Pharma Sciences B.V.) ] .<br>
      <br>
      Beside choline chloride-stabilized silicic acid, on the market
      exist various food supplements which contain silicon in the forms
      of amorphous or colloidal silicon dioxide (Si02) . However, such
      products are characterized by very low bioavailability [R.
      Jugdaohsingh : Silicon and bone health, J. Nutr. Health Aging 11
      (2007) 99] .<br>
      <br>
      Somewhat effective (bioavailable) sources of silicic acid are also
      various plant drugs like extracts of horsetail (Equisetum arvense)
      , nettle (Urtica dioica) , and some other plants. However, it is
      known that portions of soluble (and thus bioavailable) silicic
      acid from these healing plants usually do not exceed 1/10 of total
      amounts. All remained silicic acid is not soluble and, as such,
      not bioavailable [D. Kustrak: Pharmacognosy and phytopharmacy (in
      Croatian) Golden marketing-Tehnicka knjiga, Zagreb, Croatia
      (2005)].<br>
      <br>
      In agriculture, silicon based products are used for only a few
      years. They are used for increasing resistance of plants to stress
      (at drought or hail) and against fungal diseases. It seems that
      they also pasively protect from insect attacks by forming thin
      hard barrier of silicon dioxide on the plant leaves. The most
      known product are those based on horsetail {Equisetum arvense)
      extract or finelly milled quartz sand (silicon dioxide; Si02) in
      organic, and solution of potassium silicate (30% K2Si03) in
      conventional agriculture (mainly at grape; e.g. "Sil-Matrix" ) .
      These products are usually applied by foliar spraying.<br>
      Salicylic acid (1) is a well known pharmaceutically active
      substance which, as such, or in forms of its derivatives (e.g.
      salicylamide, acetylsalicylic acid) , is widely used as
      antiinflammatoric, analgesic, and antipyretic for decades. At
      topical application in higher concentrations (&gt;5%) acts as
      keratolytic (removes dead top skin layers) what is used both in
      medicine and cosmetic (peeling) . In lower concentrations (1-2%),
      it acts as keratoplastic . Beside this, exhibits topical
      microbiocidal action.<br>
      <br>
      Technical problem of production of improved product with effects
      of bioavailable silicon based on effective stabilization of ortho-
      silicic acid (H Si0 ) is solved by the present invention on a new
      [with salicylic acid (1) ] and significantly better way, as will
      be demonstrated in detailed description of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed description of the invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention represents improved pharmaceutical,
      cosmetic, veterinary or agrochemical composition which is
      effective source of highly bioavailable silicon.<br>
      <br>
      The formulation is consisting of:<br>
      (i) ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04), from 0.01-8% w/w;<br>
      (ii) salicylic acid (1) ,<br>
      <br>
      from 1-2 molar equivalents to H Si04; (iii) pharmaceutically
      acceptable acid, from 0.1-4 molar equivalents to H Si04; or
      pharmaceutically acceptable base, in amounts of 2 molar
      equivalents to salicylic acid (1) ; and<br>
      (iv) diluent, selected from the group consisting of: purified
      water, 1 , 2-propylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, or their
      mixtures, in amounts of up to 100% w/w of the formulation.<br>
      In the present formulation the following pharmaceutically
      acceptable acids can be used: hydrochloric (HC1) , sulfuric
      (H2S04) , nitric (HN03) , phosphoric (H3P04) , methanesulfonic
      (CH3SO3H) , benzenesulfonic (C6H5S03H) , salicylic ( 1 , 2-C6H4
      (OH) COOH) or sulfosalicylic [C6H3(3- COOH) (4-OH)S03H] acid,
      mixtures of these acids, or other acids which are not of
      significant toxicity for human, animal, or plant organism.<br>
      <br>
      The use of salicylic acid as pharmaceutically acceptable acid
      represents the special case of the present invention, because then
      it is in the same time:<br>
      (i) a stabilizer of ortho-silicic acid at pH values closed to
      neutral (and physiological) ;<br>
      (ii) agent for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of precursor or silicic
      acid ( PSA) ; and<br>
      (iii) pH-regulating agent of the present formulation.<br>
      <br>
      Pharmaceutically acceptable base is selected from the group
      comprising sodium hydroxide (NaOH) , potassium hydroxide (KOH) ,
      ammonium hydroxide (NH OH) , tetramethylammonium hydroxide
      [N(CH3)4OH], tetraethylammonium hydroxide [N (C2H5) 4OH] ,
      mixtures of these bases, or other bases characterized by:<br>
      (i) negliable toxicity to human, animal or plant organism; and<br>
      (ii) which do not precipitate insoluble silicates in aqueous
      medium.<br>
      <br>
      Completely unexpectable, it was found that salicylic acid (1) acts
      as effective stabilizer of ortho-silicic acid (H Si0 ) at pH
      values closed to neutral. In this manner, it inhibits its
      polymerization into biologically unavailable polymers of silicic
      acid. Consequently increases its bioavailability after oral
      administration of the formulation from the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The effect was found and studied on a model complex 2, disodium
      salicylate-HSi0 , prepared from sodium silicate (Na2Si03) and
      salicylic acid at molar ratio of 1:1. Chemically pure sodium
      silicate was prepared by base-catalyzed hydrolysis of tetraethyl
      orthosilicate [TEOS; Si(OC2H5)4] with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) .
      Hydrolysis reaction and formation of the complex 2 with salicylic
      acid is given in Scheme 2 (at the end of the specification) .<br>
      <br>
      Since pH values of solutions of complexes like compound 2 are in
      basic region, and are between 10-13, these are termed as "basic
      complexes of salicylic and ortho-silicic acid".<br>
      <br>
      The study of stabilizing effect of salicylic acid was carried out
      in conditions that are known to result in fast polymerization of
      ortho- silicic acid (H4Si0 ) , and these are at pH values close to
      neutral. At these conditions, pH= 6-7, relatively fast
      polymerization of HSi0 takes place with formation of its polymers
      what is accompanied with generation of opalescent gel. In more
      concentrated systems, the change from the phase of solution (which
      is, at the begining, clear and afterwards opalescent) to the
      moment of formation of (opalescent) gel is relatively fast, and
      can be used in analytical purpose for determination of gelling
      (polymerization) rate (time) of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) .<br>
      <br>
      The test solution was prepared by mixing equal volumes of the
      solution of compound 2 (sample solution) and 1.5M phosphate buffer
      pH= 4.5. The time required for conversion of thus prepared clear
      test solution until the formation of opalescent gel was
      determined. This time was called gelling or polymerization time
      (tG) . Longer gelling (tG) time means slower polymerization, this
      suggests on more stable complex. Beside the complex 2 from the
      present invention, as control probes, by the same manner the
      followings are studied:<br>
      (i) sodium silicate solution (Na2Si03) as standard;<br>
      (ii) solution of complex with choline chloride [ (CH3) 3N&lt;+&gt;
      (CH2CH2OH) CI&lt;"&gt; ] ; and<br>
      (iii) solution of complex with L-serine (HOOCCH (NH2) CH2OH) ;<br>
      which are described in the prior art as HSi04 stabilizers [S. R.
      Bronder: Stabilized orthosilicic acid comprising preparation and
      biological preparation, W095/21124 (1994)]. Results are given in

      <br>
      In all test solutions as diluent was employed distilled water,
      except otherwise noted. All solutions of complexes contained 6.5
      w/w of ethanol which was generated as side-product of hydrolysis
      of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) . Stability tests were carried
      out by mixing 2 mL of each of sample solution or standard with 2
      mL of 1.5M phosphate buffer of pH= 4.5; pH values of all solutions
      after mixing with the buffer were the same (pH= 6.5) .<br>

      "Relative stability" is expressed as numerical parameter,
      coefficient, which describes stability of ortho-silicic acid in
      the given sample in comparison with the standard [pure solution of
      sodium silicate (Na2Si03) ] . It shows stabilizing or
      destabilizing effect on ortho-silicic acid, in other words on its
      polymerization (gelling) .<br>
      <br>
      This was prepared by addition of TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12 g; 0.0054 mol)
      to a solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH; 0.44 g; 0.011 mol; 2.05
      equiv.) in distilled water (6.00 g) with stirring during 6 h, and
      subsequent dilution with distilled water (7.44 g) up to the total
      weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si].<br>
      <br>
      Samples are prepared by addition of 0.0054 mol of choline chloride
      (0.75 g) or L-serine (0.57 g) in hydrolyzed solution of sodium
      silicate (6.00 g distilled water + 0.44 g NaOH + 1.2 mL TEOS),
      with subsequent dilution with distilled water up to the total
      weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si].<br>
      <br>
      The solution of the complex was prepared by addition of salicylic
      acid (0.75 g; 0.0054 mol) in previously prepared solution of
      sodium silicate (6.00 g distilled water + 0.44 g NaOH + 1.2 mL
      TEOS), with subsequent dilution with distilled water up to the
      total weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si].<br>
      <br>
      Solutions are prepared by mixing previously prepared solution of
      sodium silicate (6.00 g distilled water + 0.44 g NaOH + 1.2 mL
      TEOS) and 2.25 g (15% w/w) or 6.00 g (40% w/w) of 1 , 2-propylene
      glycol with subsequent dilution with distilled water, up to the
      total weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si]. The
      solution of the complex was prepared by addition of salicylic acid
      (0.75 g; 0.0054 mol) to previously prepared solution of sodium
      silicate (6.00 g distilled water + 0.44 g NaOH + 1.2 mL TEOS) .
      Reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature during 1 h. Then,
      1, 2-propilene glycol (2.25 g; 15% w/w) was added, and
      subsequently diluted with distilled water, up to the total weight
      of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si] .<br>
      <br>
      Solutions like those of the complex 2 are clear and colourless
      solutions, stable to the occurence of gelling at room temperature
      (17-25 [deg.]C) , and at temperatures &lt;30 [deg.]C, during
      minimally 2 years.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the formulation from the present invention can be
      prepared as complex with ortho-silicic acid (HSi04) with salicylic
      acid salts (like disodium salicylate) in molar ratio of 1:2.<br>
      <br>
      Beside basic complexes like compound 2, the formulation from the
      present invention can be prepared as stabilized solution of ortho-
      silicic acid (H4Si04) also in acidic medium, by the influence of
      one or more above-mentioned pharmaceutically acceptable acid
      (0.1-4 molar equivalents) in the presence of 1-2 molar equivalents
      of salicylic acid, calculated to H4Si0 .<br>
      <br>
      Complex of salicylic acid and ortho-silicic acid, compound 3, was
      prepared in situ, by phosphoric acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of
      tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) in the presence of salicylic acid.
      The reaction is given in Scheme 3 (at the end of the
      specification) .<br>
      <br>
      Since pH values of solutions of the complexes like compound 3 are
      in acidic region, between 1-2.5, these are called "acidic
      complexes of salicylic and ortho-silicic acid".<br>

      silicic acid (H4Si04) was performed with 1.32M phosphate buffer of
      pH= 7. As the control, complexes with choline chloride and
      L-serine, described in the prior art as stabilizers of H Si0 ,
      were used. Results are given in Table 2.<br>

      Stabilizing effect of salicylic acid (1) on polymerization of
      ortho- silicic acid (H4Si04) at pH= 6.5.<br>
      <br>
      &lt;a&gt; In all test solutions, as diluent was used distilled
      water, except otherwise noted. All solutions contained 6.5% w/w of
      ethanol which was formed as side-product during hydrolysis of
      tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) . Stability tests were performed
      by mixing 2 mL of each of sample solution with 2 mL of 1.32M
      phosphate buffer of pH= 7.0; pH values of all test solutions after
      mixing with buffer were the same (6.5) . &lt;b&gt; The time from
      the moment of mixing the given sample solution and phosphate
      buffer (clear solution) until the formation of opalescent gel,
      expressed in minutes [min] .<br>
      c "Relative stability" is expressed as numerical parameter,
      coefficient, which describes stability of ortho-silicic acid in
      the given sample in comparison with the standard [pure solution of
      silicic acid (HSi04) ] . It shows stabilizing or destabilizing
      effect on ortho-silicic acid, in other words on its polymerization
      (gelling) .<br>
      d This was prepared by addition of TEOS (1.2 mL; 1.12 g; 0.0054
      mol) to a solution of 85% phosphoric acid (0.2 mL; 0.34 g; 0.289 g
      H3P04; 0.00295 mol; 0.55 mol. equiv.) in distilled water (13.54 g)
      with stirring for 6 h [total wight 15.00 g; contains 150 mg (1%
      w/w) of Si] .<br>
      e Samples are prepared by addition of 0.0054 mol of choline
      chloride (0.75 g) or L-serine (0.57 g) to a solution of
      ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04; 10.00 g destilirana voda + 1.2 mL TEOS
      + 0.2 mL 85% H3P04; 3 h-stirring / room temperature) with
      subsequent dilution with distilled water, up to the total weight
      of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si] .<br>
      f Samples are prepared by addition of salicylic acid (0.75 g;
      0.0054 mol) to a solution of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS; 1.2
      mL; 1.12 g; 0.0054 mol) in 1 , 2-propylene glycol (10.00 g) .
      Distilled water (0.4 mL; 0.022 mol; 4.1 mol. equiv.) was added to
      the reaction mixture, and stirred at room temperature during 5 h.
      Then, 1,2- propylene glycol was added to the solution up to the
      total weight of 15.00 g [contains 150 mg (1% w/w) of Si].<br>
      <br>
      To the solution from the Experiment 5, also 85% phosphoric acid
      (0.2 mL) was added.<br>
      <br>
      From thus obtained results, it was concluded that choline
      chloride, which is in the literature described as "stabilizer" of
      ortho- silicic acid, actually acts as catalyst of its
      polymerization under physiological conditions where pH value is
      close to 7. Solutions which contained choline chloride showed
      5-10x faster polymerization process accompanied with formation of
      silica gel in comparison to the solution of the standard
      (Experiments 2; Table 1 and 2) . Choline chloride can be obviously
      considered as "stabilizer" of silicic acid in a formulation with
      very low pH, lower than pH= 3, due to its property of "deep
      eutectic liquid" in mixture with polyols like glycerol. In fact,
      it is "stabilizer" in technological sense (as excipient) which
      helps stabilization of final product, solution of H Si0 ,
      providing long term shelf life of the product.<br>
      However, in contrast to this, under physiological conditions, at
      pH values close to 7, it destabilizes ortho-silicic acid
      catalyzing its polymerization, and thus decreases their
      bioavailability. This finding is in accordance with literature
      data wherein it was described that bioavailability of choline
      chloride-stabilized ortho- silicic acid at oral administration is
      &lt;50% [R. Jugdaohsingh : Silicon and bone health, J. Nutr.
      Health Aging 11 (2007) 99] .<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, amino acid serine, which is also described in the
      literature as stabilizer of ortho-silicic acid, does exhibit
      slight stabilizing effect, indeed. However, this effect is almost
      negliable because observed increase of gelling time was only 8-10%
      prolonged against that for the standard (Experiments 3; Tables 2
      and 3) .<br>
      <br>
      In contrast, salicylic acid (1) exhibits significant effect of
      stabilization of ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) where observed
      polymerization time was 2.2x longer (Experiments 4; Tables 2 and
      3), what suggest on high stability of the complex H4Si04-salicylic
      acid (compound 3) .<br>
      <br>
      It was found that application of 1 , 2-propylene glycol as
      humectant which acts as auxiliary stabilizer, in accordance to the
      literature statements, does increase polymerization time of H
      Si04, indeed, for approx. 30% (Experiments 5 and 6; Table 1) .
      Determination of optimal weight percentage of 1 , 2-propylene
      glycol, where concentrations of 15% w/w (Experiment 5) and 40% w/w
      (Experiment 6) were studied, showed that the use of higher
      concentration fail to result in further positive effect on
      stability of H4Si04. In conclusion, optimal concentration of 1 ,
      2-propylene glycol in the formulation was 15% w/w.<br>
      In continuation of the research, it was found a synergistic effect
      of 1 , 2-propylene glycol (in optimal concentration of 15% w/w) on
      the basic stabilizing effect of salicylic acid.<br>
      <br>
      The formulation of the present invention based on combination of
      salicylic acid (1 mol . equiv. to H4Si04) and 15% w/w of 1 ,
      2-propylene glycol showed . lx longer polymerization time than at
      the standard<br>
      (Experiment 7; Table 1) . This result represents increase of
      almost 100% from the result obtained with the use of salicylic
      acid<br>
      <br>
      (Experiment 4; Table 1) as sole stabilizer. These results clearly
      suggest to those skilled in the art an unexpected additional
      synergistic effect on stabilization of ortho-silicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      By the use of a version of the formulation from the present
      invention with 1 , 2-propylene glycol as sole diluent, this
      additional synergistic effect onto basic stabilizing effect of
      salicylic acid is lost. In this manner, in Experiments 4 and 5
      (Table2), obtained gelling times are 2-2.2x longer than at
      standard, what is also a very good result, but in the same range
      as with salicylic acid only (Experiment 4; Table 1) .<br>
      <br>
      However, such versions of the formulation of the present invention
      exhibit adequate stability in real time at acidic acomplexes of
      salicylic and ortho-silicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      Except 1, 2-propylene glycol, as humectant can be also used
      glycerol. Additionally, as alternative diluent, beside purified
      water, can be employed ethanol, or mixtures of these substances.<br>
      <br>
      Solutions of the complex like compound 3 are also clear,
      colourless and relatively viscous solutions, stable to occurrence
      of gelling at room temperature (17-25 [deg.]C) , and at
      temperatures &lt;30 [deg.]C, during minimally 2 years. Explanation
      of inhibition effect of salicylic acid on polymerization of
      ortho-silicic acid (HSiQ )<br>
      <br>
      From obtained results, it can be concluded that salicylic acid
      acts stabilizing to ortho-silicic acid presumably due to formation
      of relatively stable complexes with it.<br>
      <br>
      In the basic medium, as is the case with the complex 2 (Scheme 2)
      , in solution are present 2 molar equivalents of strong base (e.g.
      NaOH) which reacts with salicylic acid yielding its disodium salt,
      disodium salicylate [ 1 , 2-C6H4 (ONa) COONa] . Acidity of
      ortho-silicic acid [pKa (H4Si04) = 2,2.10&lt;"10&gt;] is similar
      to that of hydroxyl group of simple phenol [pKa (C6H5OH) =
      1,3.10&lt;~10&gt;]. However, due to electron- attracting
      properties of carboxylic group in the ortho-position, acidity of
      phenolic group of salicylic acid is higher than that of ordinary
      phenol or ortho-silicic acid (H4Si04) . Because of this, the
      compound 2 is not correct to name silicate, but it can be rather
      considered as the complex of disodium salicylate and ortho-silicic
      acid (H4Si04) .<br>
      <br>
      Since in the solution of complex 2 in (predominantly) aqueous
      medium, due to hydrolysis, is present also significant
      concentration of hydroxide anions (OH&lt;"&gt;) , what is the
      reason of why the solution is basic, subsequently, certain amounts
      of ortho-silicic acid is present in the form of ortho-silicate
      anion Si(OH)30&lt;"&gt;, indeed.<br>
      <br>
      However, this fact does not have any negative consequences in
      final use of the formulation from the present invention, because,
      upon dilution with water at oral administration, it provides
      ortho- silicic acid exclusively in its monomeric form. This
      ensures maximal level of bioavailability, what is not the case at
      choline chloride- stabilized HSi0 where some significant amounts
      of the same is already polymerized, and thus corresponding product
      is of lowered bioavailability . In acidic medium salicylic acid
      also forms complex with ortho- silicic acid, like complex 3
      (Scheme 3) . Completely the same (analogous) complex is generated
      by addition of basic complex like compound 2 into acidic or
      neutral (physiological) medium. From this follows complete analogy
      between the complex 2 and complex 3 because :<br>
      <br>
      (i) compound 2 in physiological conditions gives the complex 3
      (Scheme 4, at the end of specification) ;<br>
      (ii) whilst the compound 3 exists both in more acidic medium as
      well as under physiological conditions (at pH values closed to 7)
      .<br>
      <br>
      Finally, stablizing effect of salicylic acid is obviously
      consequence of its structure, where two functional groups are
      present, carboxylic (as bidentate ligand) and phenolic hydroxyl
      group (as monodentate ligand) . Due to their neighbouring, ortho-
      position, salicylic acid acts as very effective tridentate ligand
      for ortho-silicic acid (HSi04) . Stability of such complex is
      significant, what is visible from drastically increased
      polymerization (gelling) time at pH= 6.5. This actually means that
      the stability constant of the complex 3 is very high; this result
      in very low equilibrium concentration of free H4Si0 in the
      solution of the complex, what consequently leads to drastically
      slower polymerization process (high values of tG) .<br>
      <br>
      Additional synergistic effect of 1 , 2-propylene glycol ( PG) on
      the basic stabilizing effect of salicylic acid is presumably
      consequence of additional formation of hydrogen bonds between
      molecules of PG and the complex 3 . It can be shown by calculation
      that (roughly) estimated optimal amounts of 1 , 2-propylene glycol
      of 15% w/w in the formulation corresponds to the value of approx.
      5.5 molar equivalents of PG to H4Si04. Probably, minimal molar
      excess of 4 equivalents of PG to H4Si04 does act positively in a
      synergistic manner, due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between
      molecules of PG and the complex 3 . Use of the formulation from
      the present invention<br>
      <br>
      Application of the formulation of the present invention provides
      all known positive therapeutic effects of silicic acid on human,
      animal or plant organism, which are known to those skilled in the
      art.<br>
      At humans and animals, the present formulation is used in the
      following medicinal, cosmetic, and veterinary indications:<br>
      <br>
      (i) helps in resorption of calcium; takes part in its transport,
      stimulates osteoblasts, stimulates bone mineralization,
      accelerates wound healing; in prevention of osteoporosis;<br>
      (ii) takes part in structure of arterial, vein, and capillary
      walls, increases elasticity and hardness of blood vessels,
      decreases its permeability; also takes part in structure of
      connective tissue and formation of functional tertiary structure
      of building proteins of soft organs like liver, lung, and brain;<br>
      (iii) stimulates immune system; thus increases natural ability of
      organism to fight against microorganisms at infective diseases,
      and at all diseases and disorders which develop upon weak immune
      system like various allergic diseases;<br>
      (iv) antiinflammatory effect of silicon and silicic acid; therapy
      of various acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, e.g.
      positively acts at various inflammations of locomotive system such
      as muscle inflammations, rheumatoid arthritis, etc; skin diseases
      like psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, neurodermitis, eczema, skin
      irritations, burns, wound healing, at dandruff, and at other skin
      disorders and diseases; also positively acts at other inflammatory
      diseases;<br>
      (v) acts as cross-linking agent for glucosaminoglycans and
      mucopolysaccharides, and thus helps function of joints, ligaments,
      and production of synovial fluid; (vi) inhibits resorption of
      aluminum (Al&lt;3+&gt;) from gastrointestinal tract, thus
      preventively acts on development of neurodegenerative diseases
      like Alzheimer or Parkinson diseases ;<br>
      (vii) stimulates biosynthesis of skin building proteins: collagen
      and elastin; in treatment of wrinkles and prevention of their
      development; thus helps in slowing-down skin ageing;<br>
      (viii) stimulates growth of hair and nails; for strengthening of
      hair and nails; also hair becomes shinier.<br>
      Due to the presence of salicylic acid which, beside
      antiinflammatory action, exhibits also analgesic and antipyretic
      effects, the formulation from the present invention is used as
      adjuvant in treatment of pain and decreasing of increased body
      temperature. This is expecially recommended at indications where
      basic patological condition is consequence of silicon deficiency.<br>
      As example, herein is given the treatment of strong pain at bone
      fractures, joints and/or ligaments. The silicon therapy in these
      cases is essential for fast mineralization process and healing,
      and in the same time can provide (due to the content of salicylic
      acid) :<br>
      (i) soothing of inflammation process; and<br>
      (ii) calming pain; which are formed due to given traumatological
      changes .<br>
      At topical application (e.g. in cosmetics), the formulation of the
      present invention, due to the content of salicylic acid, shows:<br>
      (i) keratoplastic effect, at concentrations of salicylic acid
      &lt;2% w/w;<br>
      (ii) keratolytic (peeling) effect, at concentrations of salicylic
      acid &gt;5% w/w in the final formulation; and<br>
      (iii) microbiocidal effect. The latter effects of salicylic acid
      are excellently supplemented with basic actions of silicon, where
      effects of refreshing of the skin are achieved through combination
      of wrinkle reducing (biosynthesis of collagen and elastin) ,
      keratolytic/keratoplastic, and microbiocidal effects.<br>
      Moreover, due to microbiocidal effect of salicylic acid and
      fungistatic action of ortho-silicic acid, the formulation from the
      present invention at topical application provides positive effects
      in conditions like:<br>
      (i) acne;<br>
      (ii) problematic skin;<br>
      (iii) seborrheic dermatitis; and<br>
      (iv) dandruff.<br>
      It is known to those skilled in the art that analogous biological
      effects of silicon (in the form of HSi0) exhibits also at animals,
      in this manner, the formulation of the present invention is
      applied in veterinary in all mentioned indications.<br>
      At plants, the formulation of the present invention provides:<br>
      (i) increased crop yields (due to stimulation of photosynthesis
      through better utility of nutrients which are added by common
      fertilization; silicon effects) ;<br>
      (ii) resistance to stressful events (e.g. during drought or after
      hail; silicon effects) ; and<br>
      (iii) resistance to fungal diseases (effects of silicon and
      salicylic acid) .<br>
      The formulation of the present invention intended for medicinal,
      cosmetic, veterinary, and agrochemical applications is in the
      dosing form of solution (concentrate) . Before use, the solution
      is diluted with water and administered orally in a dosage which
      corresponds to the following daily intakes of silicon (Si) :<br>
      (i) 5-25 mg of Si at humans; and (ii) 5-250 mg of Si at animals;
      5-50 mg at small animals like cats or dogs, 50-250 mg at large
      ones like horses and cows.<br>
      In agriculture, the present formulation is also diluted with water
      up to the final concentration od silicon from 0.005-0.1% w/w, and
      applied by foliar application by using all common spraying
      equipments .<br>
      Lower concentrations (0.005-0.05% w/w of Si) are used
      preventatively for stimulation of growth and against occurrence of
      fungal diseases (e.g. at grape), whilst higher concentrations
      (0.05-0.1% w/w of Si) are applied in urgent conditions of drought
      or after hail. Dosage rates are from 10-100 g of silicon per
      hectare (ha) or 1-10 L of the present formulation in concentration
      of 1% w/w of Si per single tank of 200-400 L of water, applied to
      the area of 1 ha.<br>
      Finally, the formulation of the present invention can be used as
      starting material (intermediate) for production of other
      pharmaceutical products, cosmetics, then veterinary or
      agrochemical products with content of silicon (Si) of high
      bioavailability.<br>
      For instance, the version of the formulation from the present
      invention of the composition:<br>
      - 3.8% w/w HSi04 [corresponds to 1% w/w of Si]<br>
      - 5% w/w salicylic acid;<br>
      - 6.5% w/w ethanol;<br>
      - ad 100% w/w 1, 2-propylene glycol; in the form of colourless
      viscous solution, serves as suitable concentrate (intermediate)
      for production of various oral and topical final dosage forms for
      human or veterinary use, such as: oral solution, oral suspension,
      shampoo, lotion, cosmetic mask, cream, ointment, gel, therapeutic
      patch for human use; or concentrate for solution intended for use
      in agriculture. Preparation of the formulation from the present
      invention<br>
      Basic complexes of ortho-silicic (H4Si04) and salicylic acid are
      prepared by hydrolysis of precursor of silicic acid ( PSA)
      tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) :<br>
      (i) in the presence of 2 molar equivalents of pharmaceutically
      acceptable base in a diluent, with subsequent addition of
      salicylic acid; or alternatively,<br>
      (ii) in previously prepared solution of salt of salicylic acid
      with pharmaceutically acceptable base in a diluent.<br>
      Alternatively, the following PSA can be used:<br>
      (i) sodium or potassium silicate (common composition xM2OySi02; M=
      Na,K, x:y= 1:1 do 1:3,5); or<br>
      (ii) silicon tetrachloride (SiCl4) .<br>
      The use of sodium (Na2Si03) or potassium silicate (K2Si03) as PSA
      represents a special case of performance of the present invention,
      because these are in the same time:<br>
      (i) pharmaceutically acceptable bases, as sources of sodium (NaOH)
      or potassium (KOH) hydroxide; and<br>
      (ii) sources of silicic acid ( PSA) .<br>
      In these cases, no additional pharmaceutically acceptable base is
      used, since equimolar amounts of these silicates and salicylic
      acid do directly give salicylate salts like disodium or
      dipotassium salicylates which, in the same time act as:<br>
      (i) basic agent for hydrolysis of TEOS; and as<br>
      (ii) ligand for complexation of in status nascendi formed H4Si04.<br>
      In the case of the use of SiCl4 as PSA in this synthesis, 6 molar
      equivalents of pharmaceutically acceptable base (e.g. NaOH) is
      employed, because, 4 equivalents is spent on neutralization of
      hydrochloric acid (HC1) generated during hydrolysis of SiCl4,
      whilst 2 remained equivalents serve for neutralization reaction of
      salicylic acid yielding salicylate salt (e.g. disodium salicylate)
      which forms the complex with liberated H4Si04 (complex 2;
      analogously to Scheme 2) .<br>
      Acidic complexes of salicylic and ortho-silicic acid, such as
      compound 3 , are prepared by addition of 0.1-4 molar equivalents
      of pharmaceutically acceptable acid into previously prepared
      solution of precursor of silicic acid ( PSA) and salicylic acid in
      the diluent .<br>
      In the preparation of the formulation of the present invention, no
      matter of the kind of either basic or acidic complex of ortho-
      silicic and salicylic acid, the following molar ratios of
      salicylic acid and precursor of silicic acid ( PSA; expressed
      through the molar portion of silicon in the PSA) is used:
      salicylic acid : Si = 1:1 to 2:1<br>
      As the diluent or solvent 1 , 2-propylene glycol, purified water,
      glycerol, ethanol, or mixtures of these substances can be
      employed.<br>
      Reactions are conducted by vigorous stirring at temperatures from
      - 10 [deg.]C to +40 [deg.]C, preferably from +15 [deg.]C to +30
      [deg.]C (conditions of room temperature) during 0,5-6 h.<br>
      In the case of the use of sodium or potassium silicate or silicon
      tetrachloride (SiCl ) reaction is very exothermic. At the use of
      tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) , the reaction is only mildly
      exothermic, however, with mild cooling; the reaction is conducted
      without special difficulties.<br>
      In the case of the use of SiCl4 or sodium/potassium silicate, the
      reaction is almost instantly finished, whereas the hydrolysis
      reaction of TEOS tooks 1.5-2 h at room temperature.<br>
      The use of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) is preferred because it
      is neither toxic nor corrosive like SiCl4, and available
      commercial products are of very high purity due to the fact that
      TEOS is readily purified by distillation. In this manner, final
      product of very high purity with the content of unwanted heavy
      metals (Pb, Cd, Hg, As) far under common limits for pharmaceutical
      products and food supplements can be produced. In contrast, sodium
      or potassium silicate are difficult to purify from heavy metals,
      so, commercial products are not of so high level of chemical
      purity.<br>
      In every case, ortho-silicic acid (HSi0 ) , in status nascendi
      generated in the reaction, forms the complex with:<br>
      (i) salicylate salt (in basic medium; example is the complex 2,
      Scheme 2); or with<br>
      (ii) salicylic acid (in acidic medium; example is the complex 3,
      Scheme 3) .<br>
      In all cases, the formulation of the present invention is clear,
      colourless, more or less viscous solution.<br>
      As side-products in reactions of sodium or potassium silicate,
      equivalent amounts of sodium or potassium salts of
      pharmaceutically acceptable base are formes, which, after
      completion of the reaction can be eventually removed by
      filtration. For instance, at the use of sodium silicate and
      hydrochloric acid (HC1) , the side-product is sodium chloride
      (NaCl) which is not soluble in 1 , 2-propylene glycol, and after
      synthesis is removed by filtration.<br>
      In the case of the use of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) , four
      molar equivalents of ethanol (C2H5OH) are generated. Since ethanol
      in this concentration is completely harmless and does not
      influence negatively on the stability of the present solution, it
      is not removed but kept in the final product as auxiliary solvent
      or diluent. It is known to those skilled in the art of
      pharmaceuticaly technology that ethanol is widely used as
      pharmaceuticaly excipient, diluent. Alternatively, ethanol can be
      removed from the final solution of the present invention by
      evaporation under high vacuum at temperatures &lt;40 [deg.]C,
      without negative effect upon its stability. Finally, the reaction
      product, the solution, is only diluted with water or 1 ,
      2-propylene glycol up to the nominal concentration of silicon
      (Si), filtered, and paked into plastic bottles.<br>
      The course of the reaction is given in Schemes 2 and 3.<br>

      The invention relates to a method for preparing ortho silicic
      acid, to the ortho silicic acid obtainable by this method and to

      animal feed, food or food supplement, and of pharmaceutical or

      [0001] The present invention relates to a method for preparing
      ortho silicic acid, to the ortho silicic acid obtainable by this
      method and to its use as a silicone preparation in the production
      of animal feed, food, food or feed supplement, and for the
      production of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic preparation.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon (Si) has been recognized as an essential trace element for
      diatoms, Si accumulating plants and higher animals. The best
      documented function of silicon in vertebrates is its regulatory
      action in bone calcification and its chemical association with
      several constituents of the extracellular matrix in connective
      tissues (Carlisle E. (1989), Silicon, in : Handbook of
      Nutritionally Essential Mineral Elements, ed. B.L. O'Dell and R.A.
      Sunde, Marcel Dekker Inc., New York, pp. 603-618). This matrix
      consists primarily of fibrous proteins such as collagen, embedded
      in a hydrated polysaccharide gel. Silicon being bound to
      components of this matrix is regarded to be important for the
      structural integrity, the development and the regulatory functions
      of connective tissue. Gastro-intestinal absorption of Si is only
      possible after hydrolysis of dietary Si-compounds into ortho
      silicic acid. The solubility of silicon compounds in the diet is
      low and consequently these compounds have a limited
      bioavailability. Organic compounds comprising Si-C bounds are not
      found in biological systems and several classes of synthetized
      products were found to have an unacceptable high toxicity. The
      natural soluble silicon compound, ortho silicic acid also called
      monomeric silicic acid is present both in fresh and sea water but
      only at very low concentrations (&lt;1 mmol l&lt;-1&gt; [Sullivan
      C. (1986) Silicification by diatoms, in : Silicon Biochemistry,
      CIBA Foundation Symposium 121, John Wiley and Sons, New York, pp.
      24-39].) Higher concentrations in aqueous media initiates a
      polymerization reaction of into non-bioavailable colloids and
      ultimately gels. A method for the preparation of a stabilized
      formulation of ortho silicic acid is disclosed US 5,922,360.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention has for its object to provide a
      method for preparing ortho silicic acid starting from relatively
      inexpensive and market available starting materials while
      polymerisation of formed ortho silicic acid is substantially
      avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] This is obtained with the method according to the invention
      for preparing ortho silicic acid wherein an acid hydrolysable
      silicon compound is hydrolysed in an acid solution in the presence
      of a solvent agent under the formation of ortho silicic acid, such
      as a acid aqueous solution. Due to the use of an acid solution and
      to the presence of a solvent agent the afore mentioned
      polymerisation reaction is substantially suppressed and the ortho
      silicic acid formed is sufficiently stabilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The starting material, which is an acid hydrolizable
      silicon compound, may be selected from a silicate, such as a
      monomeric silicate such as silicon halogenide, methyl ortho
      silicate, sodium or magnesium orthosilicates, or from hydrated
      silicate such as crystalline sodium silicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] According to another embodiment the acid hydrolizable
      silicon compound has the general formula<br>
      EMI3.1<br>
      wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from H,
      C1-C12 alkyl, C1-C12 alkoxy which are optionally substituted by an
      hydroxyl group, under the proviso that R1, R2, R3 and R4 are not
      simultaneously H. Preferably, R1, R2, R3 and R4 are selected from
      H, C1-C4 alkyl, C1-C4 alkoxy optionally substituted by an
      hydroxylgroup. It is noted that R1, R2, R3 and R4 are preferably
      selected such that the compound split off from the hydrolisable
      silicon compound is removable using traditional techniques such as
      evaporation and distillation, and most preferably is non-toxic
      (LD50 orally in rat higher than 1g/kg bodyweight). The most
      preferred silicon compound is tetra-ethoxy-silanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Other preferred examples for R are C2H5, CH3CO, HCO, C3H7,
      C4H9 and CH3CH(OH)CHCO. The solution may comprise 1-80%,
      preferably 10-70%, more preferably 40-60% solvent agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The solvent agent used in the acid solution for stabilizing
      the formed ortho silicic acid may be selected from the group
      comprising glycol, glycerol, (poly)alkylene glycol, DMSO and
      polysorbate 80. The (poly) alkylene glycol may be polypropylene
      glycol or polyethylene glycol. The alkylene glycol may be ethylene
      glycol or propylene glycol. A common set of properties for all
      solvent agents are a high solubility in water (more than 30%), a
      boiling point higher than 130 DEG C, a liquid state between -10
      DEG C and 40 DEG C and a stability at an acid pH of generally 0-4.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The formed ortho silicic acid stabilized by the solvent
      agent, may be stabilized further by contacting the ortho silicic
      acid with a particulate carrier.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Surprisingly, it is experienced that this particulate
      carrier adsorbed ortho silicic acid has a bioavailability which is
      comparable or even improved over the stabilized formulation, as
      disclosed in US 5,922,360. The bioavailability is a critical issue
      since it was recently shown in comparative human supplementation
      studies that solid silicon supplements such as colloidal silica
      and phytolytic silicates are not bioavailable whereas a solution
      of stabilized ORTHO SILICIC ACID in a HCl-choline matrix has a
      high bioavailability [Calomme M., Cos P., Vingerhoets R., Van
      Hoorebeke C., Vanden Berghe D. (1998) Comparative bioavailability
      study of silicon supplements in healthy subjects, Journal of
      Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition, 22, S12, (abstract #47) .Van
      Dyck K., Van Cauwenbergh R., Robberecht H., Deelstra H. (1999),
      Bioavailability of silicon from food and food supplements,
      Fresenius Journal of Analytical Chemistry, 363, 541-544.]<br>
      Accordingly, the present invention also provides a silicon
      preparation, comprising ortho silicic acid adsorbed on a
      particulate carrier, obtainable by the process comprising the
      steps of:<br>
      <br>
      i) providing a solution, comprising ortho silicic acid stabilized
      with said acid solvent agent; and<br>
      ii) contacting the ortho silicic acid comprising solution with the
      particulate carrier.<br>
      In order to avoid to an additional extent the polymerization of
      ortho silicic acid, it is preferred that the ortho silicic acid is
      formed in situ. The handling and the formation of dosing forms of
      the silicon preparation are further improved when the carrier,
      after contact with ortho silicic acid, is extruded.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The skilled person will appreciate that the silicon
      preparation according to the invention may contain ortho silicic
      acid over a broad silicon content range depending on the
      contemplated use of the silicon preparation. Generally, the
      silicon content of the silicon preparation is within the range of
      0.01-50 wt.%, preferably within the range of 0.01-10 wt.%, more
      preferably within the range of 0.1-10 wt.%, and most preferably
      within the range of 0.1-5 wt.%. Accordingly, the silicon
      preparation may be used in a dosing regime which is suitable for
      most contemplated food, feed, pharmaceutical and cosmetic
      utilities. In this respect it is noted that the pharmaceutical and
      cosmetic preparation will have a positive effect on nails, hair,
      skin, teeth, collagen, connetive tissue, bones, encourages cell
      generation, stimulates the immune system against infections and
      toxins and inhibits degenerative (ageing)-process.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Experimental use of silicon preparations according to the
      invention have shown, that the silicon preparation has a desired
      high bioavailability expressed as the total silicon absorption by
      an organism such as a human being. Over a period of 0-8 hours the
      relative bioavailability was much improved over the afore
      mentioned colloidal and phytolytic silica preparations. In other
      words the total silicon absorption over 8 hours is more than 250
      mu g Si.h/l, preferably more than 500 mu g Si.h/l, more preferably
      more than 600 mu g Si.h/l, such as 250-700 mu g Si.h/l, preferably
      300-700 mu g Si.h/l.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The silicon preparation according to the invention adsorbed
      on a carrier may be used as such or in combination with any
      acceptable carrier material, excipient or diluent.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The silicon preparation according to the invention may be
      administared orally or in any other suitable fashion. Oral
      administration is preferred and the silicon preparation may have
      the form of a tablet, aqueous dispersion, dispersable powder or
      granule, emulsion, hard or soft capsule, syrup, elixir or gel. The
      dosing forms may be prepared using any method known in the art for
      manufacturing these pharmaceutical or cosmetic compositions and
      may comprise as additives sweeteners, flavoring agents, coloring
      agents, preservatives and the like. Carrier materials and
      excipients may include calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate,
      lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and
      disintegrating agents, binding agents and the like. The silicon
      preparation may be included in a gelatin capsule mixed with any
      inert solid diluent or carrier material, or has the form of a soft
      gelatin capsule, in which the ingredient is mixed with a water or
      oil medium. Aqueous dispersions may comprise the silicon
      preparation in combination with a suspending agent, dispersing
      agent or wetting agent. Oil dispersions may comprise suspending
      agents such as a vegetable oil. A gel formulation may be prepared
      following the teaching given in US 5,922,360.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] It is now possible to make dry mixtures of carrier-bound
      ortho silicic acid with other components such as trace elements,
      vitamins, amino acids, sugars, plant extracts, and other
      ingredients used in the manufacturing of food and food
      supplements. As an explanation it is considered that the ortho
      silicic acid remains in its monomeric form in carrier-bound ortho
      silicic acid and is therefore different from non-bioavailable
      polymerized forms of ortho silicic acid such as in colloidal or
      solid silicic acid and silicates.<br>
      <br>
      Ortho silicic acid is for instance prepared in the presence of the
      acid solvent agent and in situ by (a) hydrolysis of monomeric
      silicon compounds such as silicon halogenide or methyl
      orthosilicate [Iler R. (1979) Monosilicic acid, in : The Chemistry
      of Silica, John Wiley and Sons, New York, pp. 178-180.], (b) by
      reacting monomeric silicates such as sodium or magnesium
      orthosilicates or hydrated crystalline sodium silicate with dilute
      acid (Iler 1979), (c) by hydolyzing organic alkylsilanol
      compounds. It is noted that next to the formed ortho silicic acid
      the other hydrolization reaction compounds should be non-toxic and
      if desired should be removed from the reaction mixture.
      Preferably, the alkylsilanol compound is an ethoxysilanol compound
      and the formed ethanol may be separated without difficulty. The
      freshly prepared ortho silicic acid is bound to the carrier or a
      combination of carriers. A second method is to bind first a
      organic silicon compound on a carrier and thereafter hydrolyzing
      the organic silicon compound into ortho silicic acid for instance
      at a pH of lower than 4, such as 0.2-2.5, more preferably 0.8-1.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The solid carrier or combination of solid carriers may be
      selected from the group comprising:<br>
      <br>
      i) natural and semi-synthetic fibers,<br>
      ii) plant metabolites such as polyfenols, lignans, flavonoid,<br>
      iii) fatty acids and esters thereof such as stearates, palmitates,
      linoleates, oleates, adipates, caprylates, caprates, cocoates,<br>
      iv) phosholipids and derivates thereof,<br>
      v) polyalcohols such as inositol, trehalose,<br>
      vi) hydrogenated and sulfated compounds,<br>
      vii) salts such as chlorides, sulfates, nitrates, etc.,<br>
      viii) pectines and alginates,<br>
      ix) sugars or sugar alcohols and derivatives thereof such as
      lactose, sucrose, mannitol, sorbitol, sorbitolesters,<br>
      x) poly- and oligosaccharides silicic acharides and derivatives
      thereof such as dextran, fructans, inulin, oligofructose,<br>
      xi) gelatine or derivatives thereof such as gelatine hydrolysate<br>
      xii) cellulose er derivatives thereof such as microcrystalline
      cellulose,hydroxypropylcellulose, hydroxypropyl
      methylcellulose,carboxymethylcellulose, cellulose gum<br>
      xiii) peptides and polypeptides such as collagen, soy proteins,
      mays protein and derivates thereof<br>
      xiv) glucans and derivatives thereof such as proteoglycans,
      glycosaminoglycans, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate, heparin,
      heparan sulfate, keratan sulfate, dermatan sulfate,<br>
      xv) starch and derivatives thereof,<br>
      xvi) lecithin and derivatives thereof, and<br>
      xvii) byproducts of foodproduction, such as fermented byproducts
      from cheese, beer and mays, and cheese whey as an example<br>
      xviii) foodproducts such as dried animal food, substrates for
      plants such as natural peat for plant production, dried plant
      extracts are dried plant homogenates and cosmetic powders such as
      talc.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example A</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0016] Ortho silicic acid is prepared as followed. Two liters of a
      fresh solution of cold sodiumsilicate (27 % SiO2 in 14 % NaOH) is
      mixed with 2 - 4 liters of glycerol (pro analyse, 100 %) until a
      homogeneous solution is obtained. To decrease the pH, one liter of
      cold, concentrated hydrochloric acid is added and the mixture is
      stirred strongly at a temperature between 0 - 10 DEG C. During
      continuous mixing, solid or a suspension of calcium carbonate is
      added until a pH of 1-3 is obtained. During mixing CO2 gas will be
      formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Half a liter of freshly prepared combination of
      concentrated ortho silicic acid is mixed with 0.5 kg of gelatine,
      or 0.5 kg of cheese whey, or 200 g of cellulose, or 1 kg of
      galactose, or 1 kg of saccharose. The resulting paste is mixed
      until a homogeneous paste is obtained. The paste is dried in
      vacuo. The final product contains minimum 0.1 % elemental silicon
      and preferably between 1 - 5 % elemental silicon.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A daily intake of 0.5 g during 2 months resulted in
      improved nail and hair quality in four different persons. This
      improvement was equivalent as observed using the formulations
      mentioned in US 5,922,360.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example B</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0019] The carrier (65 %) microcrystalline cellulose is mixed with
      35 % of a combination of concentrated ortho silicic acid with
      glycerol (see example A). Demineralized water is added during
      continuous mixing to obtain an appropiate quality of the
      granulated material. The plastic mass is extruded with a basket
      extruder (Caleva Model 10, Sturminster Newton, Great Britain) at
      750 rpm. The extruded strands are spheronized (Caleva Model 120
      spheronizer). The resulting pellets are dried to a final water
      content of lower than 5 %. Typical pellet size is between 800 and
      1200 mu m. The pellets are encapsulated in hard gelatine capsules
      size OO. Each capsule contains 0.54 g pellets equal to 5 mg
      elemental silicon in the form of carrier-bound ortho silicic acid.
      The loading capacity of the microcrystalline cellulose can be
      increased to 45 % ortho silicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example C</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0020] The carrier, a mixture (1:1) of soy proteins and mays
      proteins (70 %) are mixed with 30 % of a combination of ortho
      silicic acid with glycerol (see example A). Demineralized water is
      added during continuous mixing to obtain an homogenous plastic
      mass. The mixture is dried by lyophilization. Following
      granulation the protein-bound ortho silicic acid is directly
      encapsulated or used as a raw material in the manufacturing of
      animal feed, food, food supplements, cosmetics or pharmaceutical
      preparations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example D</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] The carrier (65 %) a mixture (3:1) of microcrystalline
      cellulose and fructans is mixed with 35 % of a combination of
      concentrated ortho silicic acid with glycerol (see example A).
      Demineralized water is added during continuous mixing to obtain an
      appropiate quality of the granulated material. The plastic mass is
      extruded with a basket extruder (Caleva Model 10, Sturminster
      Newton, Great Britain) at 750 rpm. The extruded strands are
      spheronized (Caleva Model 120 spheronizer). The resulting pellets
      are dried to a final water content of lower than 5 %. Typical
      pellet size is between 800 and 1400 mu m. The pellets are pressed
      to tablets or used as a raw material in the manufacturing of
      animal feed, food, food supplements, cosmetics or pharmaceutical
      preparations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example E</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] 100 ml icecold tetra-ethoxy-silanol is dropped slowly in 1
      liter of 50% solution icecold glycerol in water pH 1,0. After 8 h
      at 0 DEG C the silanol compound is completely hydrolysed. Ethanol
      is removed by quick evaporation under vacuum.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining OSA solution is mixed with 2 - 3 kg lactose as a
      paste and further dried under vacuum. The final product contains
      minimum 0.1 % Si and preferably between 0.3 abd 2% Si.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Dissolution assays of the preparations of Examples A-E
      prove that ortho silicic acid is released within 30 minutes into
      the dissolution medium. This is demonstrated by measuring the
      silicon content of the dissolution medium at fixed time-points
      with Zeeman corrected Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectometry
      (Perkin Elmer). The fact that ortho silicic acid is released
      during dissolution demonstrates clearly that binding of ortho
      silicic acid to the carrier will not result in polymerization of
      ortho silicic acid but remains in a dissociatable form.
      Dissolution assays were repeated at 3, 6 and 12 months after the
      production date without difference in results demonstrating that
      carrier-bound ortho silicic acid is chemically stable over a long
      period of time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example F</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0024] Three healthy subjects (2 females, 1 male, aged 22-34 y)
      were included after informed, written consent. None had taken Si
      supplements within 3 months before the start of the study. Each
      fasting subject received in a cross-over protocol Si p.o. as
      follows:10 mg of Si in the form of stabilized ortho silicic acid
      (ortho silicic acid, 0.5 ml of BioSil containing 20 g Si/l, as in
      US 5, 922,360), 10 mg of Si in the form of carrier-bound ortho
      silicic acid (capsules of the preparation of Example D), 20 mg of
      Si in the form of colloidal silica (polymerized ortho silicic
      acid) 20 mg of Si in the form of phytolytic silica (a standarized
      dry extract of the Si-accumulating plant Equisetum arvense) or a
      placebo (10 ml mineral water) within 1 week washout period between
      each supplement or the placebo. Blood samples were collected in Si
      free polypropylene tubes prior to supplementation and after 1, 2,
      4, 6 and 8 hours post partem. Identical meals were consumed during
      the experiment after 2 and 6 hours supplementation. The Si
      concentration in serum and urine was determined for each subject
      in one batch with AAS. A Zeeman/3030 Atomic Absorption
      Spectrometer equipped with a HGA-600 graphite furnace was used in
      combination with an AS-60 autosampler (Perkin-Elmer Corp. Norwalk
      CT). The area under the time concentration curve (A.U.C.) was
      calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule as an objective
      parameter of the total Si absorption. The serum silicon
      concentration increases significantly from the baseline value
      after supplementation of both liquid ortho silicic acid and
      carrier-bound ortho silicic acid (fig. 1 ortho silic acid = OSA)
      but not after supplementation of polymerized ortho silicic acid
      forms such as colloidal silica or phytolytic silica. The kinetic
      absorption profile for carrier-bound ortho silicic acid indicates

      total bioavailability is similar for carrier-bound ortho silicic
      acid and liquid ortho silicic acid whereas the polymerized forms
      of ortho silicic acid are not bioavailable since no significant
      difference is seen for these products compared to the placebo
      (fig. 2 ortho silicic acid = OSA). Bioavailability experiments
      were repeated one year after the production date of the

        <b>Stabilized orthosilicic acid </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Preparation comprising ortho silicic acid which is stabilized with
      a stabilizing agent and is substantially free of organic silicon
      compounds, preferably a nitrogen-containing stabilizing agent such
      as choline, to a method for preparing such a preparation,
      comprising: i) providing a solution containing a stabilizing
      agent; ii) dissolving an inorganic silicon compound in the
      solution containing the stabilizing agent; and iii) hydrolyzing
      the silicon compound to ortho silicic acid, and to the obtained
      biological preparation.<br>
      <br>
      Silicon is an essential trace element for plants, animals and
      humans. In a watery environment silicon is initially present as
      ortho silicic acid which is quickly converted by polycondensation
      to polysilicic acid, which transposes into a colloidal solution
      and gels. Ultimately, insoluble silicates are formed.<br>
      <br>
      In the same way as carbonic acid for compounds comprising carbon,
      ortho silicic acid is the most important metabolite for organic
      silicon compounds. Water glass (sodium ortho silicate) is the
      usual source of ortho silicic acid, which however hydrolyses after
      oral administration to mammals and forms insoluble and
      non-absorbable gels through polycondensation.<br>
      <br>
      Organic silicon compounds such as alcohol esters, such as ethyl
      ortho silicate and glycol ortho silicate, cannot be used in
      biological systems because of the poor solubility and the low
      resistance to hydrolysis, but above all because of the
      unacceptable toxicity.<br>
      <br>
      There therefore exists a need for a silicon-comprising preparation
      not possessing the above stated drawbacks, because silicon has a
      positive biological effect on nails, hair, skin, teeth, collagen,
      connective tissue, bones, encourages cell generation, stimulates
      the immune system against infections and toxins and inhibits
      degenerative (ageing)-processes.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is based on the insight that if ortho
      silicic acid is formed in the presence of a stabilizing agent,
      polycondensation is inhibited and even avoided and, furthermore
      organic silicon compounds substantially do not occur.<br>
      <br>
      A first aspect of the present invention therefore relates to a
      preparation comprising ortho silicic acid which is stabilized with
      a stabilizing agent and is substantially free of organic silicon
      compounds.<br>
      <br>
      A second aspect of the present invention relates to a method for
      preparing a preparation as according to claims 1-7, which
      comprises of:<br>
      i) providing a solution containing a stabilizing agent;<br>
      ii) dissolving an inorganic silicon compound in the solution
      containing the stabilizing agent; and<br>
      iii) hydrolyzing the silicon compound to ortho silicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      A third aspect of the present invention relates to a biological
      preparation containing a preparation according to claims 1-7,
      and/or a preparation prepared according to claims 8-13, and a
      pharmacologically acceptable diluent.<br>
      <br>
      The biological preparation according to the invention is can be
      used for:<br>
      chronic infections with destruction of the mucous membranes: forms
      of sinusitis and ulcers.<br>
      problems with connective tissues, arteriosclerosis, bone and
      tendon problems, gynaecology (fibroids, polycystic adenopathy);
      and<br>
      the growth of children: children with recurrent infections with
      overload of the lymphatic system.<br>
      <br>
      The stabilization using a stabilizing agent preferably takes place
      with stabilizing agents containing a nitrogen atom with a free
      electron pair which forms a complex with the silanol groups of the
      ortho silicic acid. Quaternary ammonium compounds are preferably
      used, for instance tetra-alkyl compounds, wherein each alkyl group
      contains for instance 1-5 carbon atoms, in particular methyl and
      ethyl groups. Very highly recommended are trialkylhydroxyalkyl
      compounds, wherein the hydroxy group is preferably methanol or
      ethanol. Choline has been found very suitable, which is further
      recommended in that it provides the option of the stabilizing
      agent also forming the solution for the ortho silicic acid, and an
      inert solvent can therefore be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      Another or additional type of stabilizing agent is an amino acid,
      such as proline and serine. Serine enhances uptake in the stomach
      and gives additional stability.<br>
      <br>
      Starting point for the preparation of the ortho silicic
      acid-comprising preparation is a solution containing the
      stabilizing agent, wherein an inert solvent can be used.
      Incorporated in -This solution is an inorganic silicon compound
      which hydrolysis under the influence of water to ortho silicic
      acid, which is immediately stabilized by the stabilizing agent
      that is present. The solution containing the stabilizing agent can
      initiate the hydrolysis immediately after addition of the
      inorganic silicon compound. Usually recommended is a solution
      containing a stabilizing agent in which no hydrolysis can take
      place until after the addition of a hydrolyzing agent, such as
      water.<br>
      <br>
      If choline is used as stabilizing agent it can be converted to
      choline hydrochloride using dry hydrochloric acid. In this liquid
      stabilizing agent can be incorporated the inorganic silicon
      compound, such as a silicon halogenide, particularly silicon
      tetrachloride.<br>
      <br>
      Simultaneously with the addition of the inorganic silicon
      compound, or following the addition of the hydrolyzing agent, the
      hydrolysis of the inorganic silicon compound to ortho silicic acid
      takes place. The silicic acid formed in situ is subsequently
      stabilized by forming a complex with the stabilizing agent. It is
      of great importance herein that the stabilizing agent only forms a
      complex and does not enter into a reaction, particularly an
      esterifying reaction, with the ortho silicic acid. Then achieved
      is that no organic silicon compounds are created which have an
      inherent toxicity, are absorbed in the stomach and enter the blood
      circulation.<br>
      <br>
      After forming a complex the ortho silicic acid-comprising solution
      can if desired be partially neutralized by adding a base, such as
      a lye, particularly sodium hydroxide. Neutralization can take
      place to a pH smaller than 4, in particular smaller than 3, in
      general to a pH lying in the range of 1-3, whereby any
      polycondensation of ortho silicic acid is substantially avoided.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, a further purification of the preparation can take
      place, for instance through absorption of contaminants on active
      carbon, optionally followed by filtration.<br>
      <br>
      If desired, the content of hydrolyzing agent, particularly water,
      can be reduced by removing the hydrolyzing agent, for instance
      through distillation, whereby a constant viscosity is achieved if
      use is made of choline as the stabilizer.<br>
      <br>
      Preparations then result with a silicon content generally of 1% by
      weight, preferably of about 4% by weight, such as 8% by weight. A
      very acceptable preparation contains 3-5% by weight of silicon,
      70s by weight of choline hydrochloride and the rest water. The pH
      of this preparation lies within the range 1-3.<br>
      <br>
      Biological preparations can be-manufactured from this prepared
      preparation for the purpose of administering ortho silicic acid to
      plants, animals and humans, whereby the bio-availability of
      silicon is greatly improved. The above prepared solution can be
      administered as biological preparation as such, for instance as
      nail tincture. A usage of 0.5 ml of a 2% Si-solution per day for
      three weeks caused a fungal infection to disappear (3 patients),
      where treatment with ketonazols did not render any improvement. If
      for instance an edible acid, such as malic acid, is added a
      preparation results which is very suitable for administering to
      horses.<br>
      <br>
      If a solid carrier is added, for instance cattle feed, cattle feed
      pellets can be pressed therefrom which contain ortho silicic acid
      in stabilized form for administering silicon to cattle. If
      sugar/maltose is used as solid carrier, tablets and gels can be
      formed therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      Through use of a glucuronic acid buffer a preparation on a cream
      basis can be formed wherein the pH is less than 4, which creams
      are suitable for local cutaneous application.<br>
      <br>
      It will be apparent that all kinds of diluents can be used in
      order to obtain a preparation for biological application. Such
      diluents contain lower alkanols, such as ethanol, dichloromethane,
      ethyl acetate, glycerine and polyalcohols.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PREPARATION EXAMPLE</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Choline hydrochloride (UCB) is dried under vacuum (100 DEG C./6
      hours). The choline hydrochloride is treated with dry hydrochloric
      acid. Silicon hydrochloride (1 mol per mol) is added to the formed
      choline solution at a temperature which is kept below 40 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      For hydrolysis, water (ice/ice water) is added to the solution
      while cooling, wherein the temperature is held within the range of
      -20 DEG C. to -30 DEG C.<br>
      <br>
      The solution containing the ortho silicic acid is subsequently
      neutralized by adding sodium hydroxide wherein cooling takes place
      to a temperature below 0 DEG C. The pH neutralization amounts to
      about 1.3.<br>
      <br>
      A purification over active carbon is then performed, followed by
      filtering off the formed precipitate and the active carbon.<br>
      <br>
      After distillation under vacuum a preparation is obtained which
      contains 3% by weight of silicon, 70% by weight choline
      hydrochloride and the rest water.<br>
      <br>
      FAB/MS with glycerol as liquid matrix provides a spectrum with a
      molecular cation at M/Z 104 (C@+) and an MC@+ adduction at
      M/Z243/245, typical for chloride isotropy. This spectrum is the
      same as the spectrum for choline.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NMR-SPECTRUM OF THE PREPARATION SHOWING CHOLINE/ALCOHOL GROUPS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Element analysis produces 24.+-.2% by weight chlorine and 9.+-.1%
      by weight N. This points to a ratio of chloride to nitrogen of
      1:1.<br>
      <br>
      Neutralization is subsequently carried out to a pH of 2.7-3.0.<br>
      <br>
      The preparation is stable for more than two years when stored at
      room temperature.<br>

      Composition comprises silicon and chondroitin, which are present
      in a form that is soluble in water, the chondroitin has a
      molecular weight of = 25000 g/mole and the silicon is present in a
      complexed form, e.g. with sugar, or in a form of silicic acid or
      ortho-silicic acid. - ACTIVITY : Antiarthritic; Osteopathic.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a composition combining silicon
      and chondroitin, particularly advantageous in the prevention and /
      or treatment of osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      Osteoarthritis, or arthropathic chronic degenerative cartilage
      degeneration is a c.0 joints which leads to its dest_: uction more
      or less rapid.<br>
      <br>
      The cartilage surface cracking, crumbling and eventually
      disappear.<br>
      <br>
      Then, bone growths in form of the joint and hinder movement.<br>
      <br>
      Symptoms include joint pain and difficulty performing 11
      movements.<br>
      <br>
      This is the most common joint disease.<br>
      <br>
      The first symptoms usually appear from 40 to 50 years, but the
      disease often begins much earlier in life.<br>
      <br>
      The most commonly used in the treatment of osteoarthritis
      treatments are simple analgesics (paracetamol), nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin, diclofenac), anti-inflammatory
      drugs (corticosteroids).<br>
      A number of molecules are proposed as chondroprotective
      (protective cartilage) also called antiarthrosiques (glucosamine,
      chondroitin).<br>
      <br>
      They have not shown that they were "pushing" destroys cartilage,
      but they slow down the evolution of malad = e.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, the "sodium chondroitin" for example is a molecule used in
      the long term (6 month treatment renewable), which inhibits
      elastase (an enzyme involved in the degradation of cartilage).<br>
      <br>
      The clinical effects are possible after pl-zsieurs weeks of
      treatment, but they are inconsistent.<br>
      <br>
      In the prior art, the chondroitin has also been proposed in
      combination with silicon to form silica, for the treatment of
      osteoarthritis (US2007122473), or with compositions comprising
      chondroitin and plant extracts, for relieve the pain of
      osteoarthritis US6579543).<br>
      <br>
      These compounds have the drawback of being difficult to solubilize
      and be of very low bioavailability.<br>
      <br>
      This implies the use of high doses of these compounds to observe
      an effect on osteoarthritis, this effect is associated with side
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      The side effects seen with the compositions of the prior art
      include skin reactions (erythema, urticaria, eczema,
      maculopopuleuse rash with or without pruritus and / or edema) and
      gastrointestinal effects (Nausea, vomiting) (Vidal 2008 Page 406
      ISBN 978-2-85091-156-9).<br>
      <br>
      Thus, treatment of osteoarthritis of the known prior art are not
      satisfactory enough.<br>
      <br>
      They have a limited and inconsistent efficacy.<br>
      <br>
      They act primarily on the symptoms, pain, but do not allow
      cartilage repair.<br>
      <br>
      They require long-term treatment.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, they have no preventive action.<br>
      <br>
      Given the above, a technical problem to be resolved is one
      invention to provide an improved method for the treatment and. /
      Or prevention of osteoarthritis, which does not present the
      aforementioned drawbacks composition.<br>
      <br>
      The solution proposed by the inventon to this problem for a first
      object compound: itiDn combining silicon and chondroitin,
      chondroitin and silicon being present in soluble form in water,
      characterized in that the chondroitin has a lower or equal to 25
      000 g / mol molecular weight and the silicon is present in a form
      complexed, for example sugars, or in a form of silicic or
      orthosilicic acid.<br>
      <br>
      The invention secondly relates to a composition combining silicon
      and chondroitin, wherein the silicon and chondroitin are present
      in soluble form in water, has a chondroitin is less than or equal
      to 25 000 g / mol molecular weight and the silicon is present in a
      form complexed, for its application as a medicament in the
      treatment and / or prevention of osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, the Applicant has found, surprisingly, that the
      combination of silicon and chondroitin, chondroitin and the
      silicon being present in soluble form in water, chondroitin having
      a molecular weight below or equal to 25 000 g / mol, permits
      treatment and more efficient and faster osteoarthritis without the
      drawbacks observed in one prior art prevention.<br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, in the framework of the present invention, has a
      chondroitin or less molecular weight 0000 g / mol, preferably less
      than or equal to 16 000 g / mol; - The silicon is present at a
      concentration between 0.0001 and 5% by weight, based on the total
      weight of the composition; - Chondroitin is present at a
      concentration between 0.5% and 6C by weight relative to the total
      weight of the composition; - The silicon is derived from the
      envelope of cereals, rice, or plants such as nettle; - The
      composition is applied as a drug to stimulate the production and
      repair of cartilage in] e = reatment and / or prevention of
      osteoarthritis..<br>
      <br>
      The invention will be better understood on reading the following
      non-limiting description.<br>
      <br>
      The composition according to the invention. Ion present improved
      preventive action against osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      It combines silicon and chondroitin which are present in a soluble
      form in water and which act synergistically against
      osteoarthritis.<br>
      <br>
      The compositions of the invention can improve the solubility and
      bioavailability of silicon and chondroitin.<br>
      <br>
      The dDses necessary to observe an effect are thus reduced, which
      improves the risk / benefit ratio.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the compositions of the invention are more effective and
      have fewer side effects than those of the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      The silicon is preferably in a form complexed, for example with
      sacred, that is to say, with one or more carbohydrates, or the
      silicon is present as silicic acid raw orthosilicic acid.<br>

      Chondroitin has a lower or equal to 25 000 g / mol molecular
      weight Éftre more soluble in water.<br>
      <br>
      A less than or equal to 20 000 g / mol molecular weight is
      preferred, and in particular less than or equal to 1700 molecular
      weight, 16000, 15000, 10000, 5000 or 3000 g / mol are.
      particularly preferred.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred range of molecular weight is between 15000 and 16000 g
      / mol, a value of t e molecular weight is preferably 15 900 g /
      mol.<br>
      <br>
      For this, the chondroitin is preferably hydrolyzed.<br>
      <br>
      Chondroitin comes from various known sources, such as cartilage,
      bone or cornea, fish, marine mammals, birds, ducks, swine, sheep,
      cattle or goats.<br>
      <br>
      Chondroitin according to the invention can be obtained by
      application of known extraction methods, such as those described
      in Technical Bulletin Biocatalysts n [deg.] 106 p 1-4.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the method described in this document comprises the
      steps of: - the cartilage is used intact or cut into pieces; - It
      is hydrolyzed enzymatically, preferably with proteases, for 16 to
      24 hours, at a pH between 5 and 7 and a temperature between 55 and
      70 [deg.<br>
      <br>
      ] C, stirring, for example in 7-10 mL of medium Promod648L
      (marketed by B_ocatalysts [deg.]) Per kg of cartilage.<br>
      <br>
      In most cases, this results in a complete solubilization of the
      cartilage; - The mixture is cooled to 40 [deg.] C and gra3 and
      solid wastes are separated; - Soluble peptides and proteins are
      removed from the aqueous solution; and - chondroitin sulphate is
      precipitated in the aqueous solution, then dried and reduced to
      powder.<br>
      <br>
      Chondroitin thus obtained comprises a mixture of molecules of
      chondroitin moléculaLres whose weight can be between 620 000 g /
      mol and 25 000 g / mol.<br>
      <br>
      The classic has a chondroitin: 7oids molecular average of about
      100,000 to 3_0000 g / mol.<br>
      <br>
      Chondroitin is then hydrolyzed, preferably enzymatically.<br>
      <br>
      Proced {s of enzymatic hydrolysis used to obtain chondroitin
      according to the invention are described in "Extraction and
      purification of chondroitin sulfate from cartilage stripe by
      enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrafiltration" (Lignot B., et al; Sow
      Congress French Process Engineering, L9 :7-October 2001, Nancy,
      France).<br>
      <br>
      In another example of the prior art, an extraction process
      chondreït = not from cartilage, such as sharks, little ':
      Understanding the steps of: -. Cartilace the previously cleared of
      muscle tissue residual and frozen at - 20 [deg.] C, is supplied
      and maintained throughout his treatment at a temperature near or
      below 4 [deg.] C; - The minced cartilage in pure water (amount
      equivalent weight / volume); - Chopped mixture was homogenized in
      a blender hung twenty minutes.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting mixture Contains particles whose size is less than
      500 mm; - The mixture is centrifuged at 13600 g for 15 minutes and
      then the supernatant was filtered on Whatman 24 filter, or the
      mixture is centrifuged at 3000-4000 g in a CEPA centrifuge
      equipped with a nylon bag that porosity of 1 m , which allows to
      obtain 30 L of supernatant of starting / water mixture cartilage
      25 kg/25 L; then - the recovered solution undergoes
      ultrafiltration tangential flow columns known whose porosity is
      chcis_.e depending on the molecular weight of chondroitin sought.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid extract may be used as such or after concentration, for
      example by na: iofiltration which favors the maintenance of
      biological activity.<br>
      <br>
      However, this method presents a method to lower extraction
      efficiency of any chondroitin followed by enzymatic hydrolysis.<br>
      <br>
      In the compositions according .. to the invention, the chondroitin
      is present at a concentration: 0.01 ration and 90% by weight. the
      total weight of the composition, preferably between 0.1 and 85%,
      more preferably between 0.5% and 80% wt%, and particularly 80%,

      Preferably, the concentration of a composition in choridrDïtine
      liquid cotprise is between 0.5 and 1% by weight of the total
      weight of the composition, while it is preferably of the order of
      50% in a composition in solid as a capsule.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, the total weight of composition per day is conventionally
      absorbed substantially infér_eur with a solid composition (in the
      order of 500mg/jour) relative to a liquid composition (in the
      order of 30g/jour).<br>
      <br>
