          to turn salt water into drinkable fresh water</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Kaitlyn Bolduc</b><br>

      <br>
      A Portland teen is turning heads across the country all because of
      a science experiment that began in his high school classroom.
      Companies like Intel and universities like MIT are now invested in
      his findings.<br>
      <br>
      With certainty you'll want to remember his name.<br>
      <br>
      "My name is Chaitanya Karamchedu, but you can call me Chai," said
      the Jesuit High School Senior.<br>
      <br>
      Karamchedu has big plans of changing the world.<br>
      <br>
      "1 in 8 people do not have access to clean water, it's a crying
      issue that needs to be addressed," said Karamchedu.<br>
      <br>
      He made up his mind to address the matter himself.<br>
      <br>
      "The best access for water is the sea, so 70 percent of the planet
      is covered in water and almost all of that is the ocean, but the
      problem is that's salt water," said Karamchedu.<br>
      <br>
      Isolating drinkable water from the ocean in a cost effective way
      is a problem that's stumped scientists for years.<br>
      <br>
      "Scientists looked at desalination, but it's all still
      inaccessible to places and it would cost too much to implement on
      a large scale," Karamchedu added.<br>
      <br>
      Karamchedu figured it out, on his own, in a high school lab.<br>
      <br>
      "The real genesis of the idea was realizing that sea water is not
      fully saturated with salt," Karamchedu said.<br>
      <br>
      By experimenting with a highly absorbent polymer, the teen
      discovered a cost effective way to remove salt from ocean water
      and turn it into fresh water.<br>
      <br>
      "It's not bonding with water molecules, it's bonding to the salt,"
      said Karamchedu.<br>
      <br>
      It's his creativity that makes this a big deal.<br>
      <br>
      "People have been looking at the problem from one view point, how
      do we break those bonds between salt and the water? Chai came in
      and thought about it from a completely different angle," said
      Jesuit High School Biology Teacher Dr. Lara Shamieh.<br>
      <br>
      "People were concentrated on that 10 percent of water that's
      bonded to the salt in the sea and no one looked at the 90 percent
      that was free. Chai just looked at it and said if 10 percent is
      bonded and 90 percent is free, then why are we so focused on this
      10 percent, let's ignore it and focus on the 90."<br>
      <br>
      It's a breakthrough that's estimated to impact millions of lives
      if ever implemented on a mass scale.<br>
      <br>
      "What this is compared to current techniques, is that it's cheap
      and accessible to everyone, everyone can use it," said Shamieh.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists across the country are taking note. He won a $10,000
      award from the US Agency for International Global Development at
      Intel's International Science Fair and second place at MIT's
      TechCon Conference where he won more money to continue his
      research.<br>
      <br>
      "They were very encouraging, they could see things into it that I
      couldn't, because they've been working their whole lives on this,"
      said Karamchedu.<br>
      <br>
      A contribution to science that's sure to make a difference. Though
      he's not done yet.<br>
      <br>
      "Now, he's working on at least mentally thinking about the idea of
      killing cancer cells from the inside out. I keep telling him to
      remember his high school biology teacher when he wins the Nobel
      prize," said Shamieh.<br>
      <br>
      "Some problems seem like impossible problems, but to call them
      impossible problems is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you
      think about it as impossible, the more impossible it becomes
      sometimes," said Karamchedu.<br>
      <br>
      A line of thinking, by one gifted teen, that just might cure
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      "I can really see beauty in things that aren't immediately
      applicable, and at the same time I want to do something to make a
      difference that's not completely in the abstract. It's important
      what you do has an impact on people," Karamchedu added.<br>
      <br>
      Back in January, Karamchedu was also named one of 300 Regeneron
      Science Talent Search Semifinalists. The STS is thought to be one
      of the most prestigious competitions in nation for high school
      seniors.<br>

          starch grafted polyacrylamide's hydrophilic properties to
          harvest fresh water with a low energy and chemical footprint</b><br>

      Chaitanya Karamchedu, Student Member, IEEE<br>
      Jesuit High School/Portland State University<br>

      <br>
      WATER scarcity is a global crisis affecting over a billion people;
      it creates environmental and social stress. Desalination is a
      promising approach to address this crisis. With approximately 97%
      of the water on Earth represented by oceans, the prospect of
      extracting arable or potable water from seawater has the potential
      to impact millions of lives, particularly along the world’s
      coasts. Current approaches are still expensive, both in monetary
      and energy terms; and remain out of reach for many countries. They
      rely on thermal, membrane, or hybrid approaches to desalinate
      water and impose high energy and environmental costs. Yet,
      seawater is on average only 3% - 4% by weight salt and other
      dissolved solids, while the maximum solubility of salt in water is
      approximately 30%.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, nearly 90% of seawater is water that is not bonded
      with salt and potentially available for harvesting. The primary
      question that motivates this investigation is - whether it is
      possible to harvest this remaining 90% of seawater using
      superabsorbent hydrophilic polymers, with no external energy,
      under room temperature and pressure and produce drinkable water
      within WHO’s guidance for safe drinking water. This study
      harvested fresh water from seawater using saponified
      starch-grafted-polyacrylamide’s hydrophilic properties. This
      required a) the creation of a hydrogel to separate freshwater from
      seawater, b) the separation of the hydrogel from the brine, c) the
      dewatering of the gel resulting in aqueous sulfuric acid and d)
      the recovery of fresh water from the aqueous solution. The results
      of the investigation were promising. The study demonstrated that:<br>
      <br>
      1. It is possible to use such hydrophilic polymers to desalinate
      water without thermal or electrical energy. Water that was not
      bonded with salt, bonded with the starch grafted polyacrylamide to
      form a hydrogel, effectively isolating it from the salt water.<br>
      <br>
      2. The extracted water’s conductivity was comparable to fresh
      water indicating that the salts have been separated. The average
      conductivity of the resulting water was 306.32 µS/cm, comparable
      to the conductivity of 200 µS/cm for the reference distilled water
      used.<br>
      <br>
      3. That this approach has promise in mitigating desalination
      pre-treatment and post-treatment problems. Mass and conductivity
      analysis confirmed that the extracted water had a total dissolved
      solids concentration of 513 mg/L, (WHO guidance is &lt;600 mg/L)
      compared to 35,000 mg/L for seawater. The concentration of sodium
      in the extracted water was 25.8 mg/L (compared to 10,500 mg/L for
      seawater) and that of chloride was 36 mg/L (compared to 19,000
      mg/L for seawater). The corresponding EPA secondary concentration
      levels (aesthetic standards) for sodium is 20 mg/L and for
      chloride is 250 mg/L.<br>
      <br>
      The process required no external energy – a significant
      improvement over current energy dependent techniques; fresh
      drinkable water yield was over 70% and produced a commercially
      useful fertilizer, CaSO 4 , as a byproduct. Another significant
      promise of this approach is that it appears amenable to small
      scale use. Sustainable and accessible means for desalination have
      potential to improve millions of lives; the implementation of the
      proposed hydrogel based desalination technique may be able to
      address this need with very low infrastructure investments and a
      high yield.<br>

          COPOLYMERS BY REACTIVE EXTRUSION)</b><br>

      <b>Interpretive Summary:</b> Starch, a renewable resource derived
      from corn and other grains, often requires chemical modification
      to provide specific properties desired for end-use applications.
      These processes often use large quantities of water and generate
      significant amounts of by-products. New processes for modifying
      starch which use less water and reduce environmental impact are
      desirable. One promising method, known as reactive extrusion, is a
      continuous process using equipment similar to that used for
      production of puffed food products. We have demonstrated that
      reactive extrusion can be used to modify starch and other natural
      materials in a rapid and continuous manner. This process can be
      used to prepare modified starches with a wide range of properties,
      while decreasing water use by half or more. Application of this
      technology may reduce the cost of producing modified starches and
      lead to new materials based on starch, in addition to reducing the
      environmental impact of starch processing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical Abstract</b>: Graft copolymers of starch and
      polyacrylamide (PAAm) were prepared by reactive extrusion using a
      co-rotating twin screw extruder and ammonium persulfate initiator.
      Feed rates were 109 g/min to 325 g/min (all components) at a
      moisture content of 50%, with screw speeds in the range 100 rpm to
      300 rpm. Starch/acrylamide weight ratios ranged from 5:1 to 1.3:1.
      Conversions of acrylamide to PAAm were generally 80% or greater
      with residence times of 400 seconds or less. Conversion was
      independent of residence time, and increased with feed rate,
      suggesting that reaction efficiency was proportional to the degree
      of fill in the extruder. Grafting efficiencies were in the range
      of 50% to 80%. Grafting efficiencies were lower for waxy maize
      starch than for normal corn starch. Extractable fractions in 30/70
      ethanol-water solvent were approximately 10% to 15%, of which 25%
      to 70% was polyacrylamide. Soluble PAAm increased with decreasing
      starch/acrylamide ratio. PAAm molecular weight increased with
      increasing acrylamide content, consistent with free radical
      polymerization kinetics. Extrusion temperature had no significant
      impact on acrylamide conversion, while PAAm molecular weights did
      not show the expected decrease with increasing temperature. Graft
      frequency, as measured by the number of anhydroglucose units per
      graft, were essentially constant over the starch:acrylamide ratio
      and temperature range studied. At a starch:acrylamide ratio of
      5:1, graft frequency decreased with increasing screw speed, giving
      materials with fewer grafts of lower molecular weight. These
      results show that reactive extrusion offers the potential for
      rapid production of starch graft copolymers with unsaturated
      monomers. <br>

      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention, there is provided a high
      molecular weight graft copolymer containing starch as the backbone
      and polyacrylamide or poly(acrylamide-acrylic acid) as grafted
      side chains. Starch is derived from such crops as corn, wheat,
      yams, or potatoes. It is a white, tasteless, odorless, granular
      solid and is classed chemically as a complex carbohydrate. Certain
      natural starches and certain fractions of starch are soluble in
      water. It is this class of materials, those capable of forming
      aqueous solutions, that are employed in this invention. The
      macromolecule of the water soluble starch is composed of glucose
      units joined .alpha.-1,4'. The repeating unit of the chemical
      formula of water soluble starch is: ##STR1## To this starch
      macromolecule is grafted repeating units of acrylamide ##STR2##
      alone or in combination with repeating units of acrylic acid
      ##STR3##<br>
      <br>
      The preparation of this copolymer is accomplished in general under
      oxygen-free conditions by adding acrylamide to an aqueous starch
      solution followed by the addition of a polymerization initiator
      and allowing time for graft polymerization to occur. When acrylic
      acid units are desired a previously prepared graft copolymer of
      starch-acrylamide is subjected to hydrolysis conditions capable of
      converting some of the amide units to carboxylic acid units.<br>
      <br>
      To a container of appropriate size containing a mechanical stirrer
      and inert gas inlet is added between 2 and 75 parts by weight of
      starch per 1000 parts distilled or deionized water. The mixture is
      heated to 85 DEG-95 DEG C. with stirring, to dissolve the starch.
      Certain fractions or types of starch require heating to
      temperatures as high as 150 DEG C. under pressures as high as 15
      psig to dissolve the starch in water. If such a starch is used,
      these temperature and pressure conditions should be applied for at
      least 30 minutes. After dissolution, the mixture is allowed to
      cool to 25 DEG C. while being stirred and bubbled with an inert
      gas such as nitrogen, helium, neon, argon, krypton, or xenon.
      Between 5 and 400 parts, preferably between 70 and 225 parts, by
      weight of acrylamide are added to the reaction mixture per 1000
      parts water. The system is then deoxygenated for about 30 minutes
      by bubbling with an inert gas. Certain impurities present in
      commerically-available acrylamide may inhibit or prevent the
      copolymerization, and it is therefore preferred that acrylamide be
      used that has been freshly recrystallized from trichloromethane
      and vacuum dried.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred polymerization initiator is ceric ion (Ce@+4). Other
      initiators that may be used include vanadium (V@+5) or manganese
      ions (Mn@+3, Mn@+4, Mn@+7). It is preferred that the physical form
      of the initiator be an acidic aqueous solution. Preferably the
      initiator is a 0.001 to 0.1 molar aqueous solution of ceric
      ammonium nitrate, Ce(NH4)2 (NO3)6, in 0.001 to 1.0 molar nitric
      acid. Other acid soluble cerium salts, however, can be used.
      Between 0.01 and 7 parts of this ceric ion initiator solution is
      added to the above reaction mixture and the mixture is stirred for
      1 minute.<br>
      <br>
      The graft copolymerization reaction can be conducted with or
      without stirring once the initiator has been dispersed in the
      reaction mixture. The reaction is allowed to proceed for 1 to 200
      hours, with 48 hours being a typical reaction time. It is
      preferred to terminate the copolymerization by addition of a free
      radical scavenger such as hydroquinone.<br>
      <br>
      If it is preferred to form poly(acrylamide-acrylic acid)-starch
      graft copolymer by replacing a fraction of the acrylamide in the
      above procedure with acrylic acid, it is best accomplished by
      hydrolyzing some of the amide groups of the polyacrylamide-starch
      graft copolymer, preferably with a base, such a sodium hydroxide
      or with acid, such as nitrous acid.<br>
      <br>
      The graft copolymer is easily recovered from a liquid reaction
      mixture. If the reaction mixture is a gel it can be made pourable
      by mixing with 5 to 8 times its volume of distilled or deionized
      water under low shear conditions until a homogeneous, pourable
      system is formed. The reaction mixture is added to 2-50,
      preferably 5-30, times its volume of a nonsolvent for the
      copolymer, such as acetone. Preferably the nonsolvent is stirred
      vigorously so as to form a vortex and the copolymer solution is
      slowly drained directly into the center of this vortex. The
      precipitated graft copolymer is then removed from the nonsolvent
      solution by filtration, washed with nonsolvent, filtered, and
      vacuum-dried to a constant weight.<br>
      <br>
      The amount of all save one of the components of the reaction
      mixture can be varied within reasonable limits of those given in
      this description. The acrylamide concentration of the reaction
      mixture should remain between 5 parts and 400 parts, preferably 70
      to 225 parts per 1000 parts by weight of reaction medium.
      Copolymers having the high molecular weight needed for efficient
      water viscosification in oil recovery may not be formed in
      reaction mixtures with acrylamide concentrations beyond these
      limits.<br>
      <br>
      The following examples illustrate certain embodiments of this
      invention wherein parts and percentages are by weight and
      temperatures are in centigrade unless otherwise indicated. Pfaltz
      and Bauer starch, catalog number SO8583, and Eastman reagent-grade
      acrylamide were used in these syntheses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><br>
      <br>
      A 50 ml. Erlenmeyer flask containing 25 ml. of deionized,
      distilled water and 0.336 g of starch was heated to 95 DEG C. and
      stirred for 30 minutes. The flask was allowed to cool to 25 DEG C.
      and 2.91 g of recrystallized and vacuum dried acrylamide and 15
      ml. of deionized, distilled water were added. The system was
      sparged with argon for 30 minutes and capped with a serum cap. The
      initiator solution was made by dissolving 1.3703 g of ceric
      ammonium nitrate in 20 ml of 1 molar nitric acid contained in a 25
      ml volumetric flask. The flask was then filled to its volume mark
      with 1 molar nitric acid to form a 0.0999 molar solution of ceric
      ion, Ce@+4, in 1 molar nitric acid. Using a syringe, 0.041 ml of
      the initiator solution was injected into the reaction mixture and
      the mixture was stirred for 1 minute. The flask was placed in a
      constant temperature bath held at 30 DEG C. and allowed to react
      for 48 hours. The reaction mixture was stirred for one minute
      every one-half hour until the mixture became too viscous to stir.
      The addition of 0.5 ml of deionized water saturated with
      hydroquinone terminated the reaction. The reaction mixture was
      mixed with 250 ml of deionized water until the system was
      homogeneous.<br>
      <br>
      Dropwise addition of 250 ml. of acetone to the dilute, viscous
      solution of copolymer caused the solution to become cloudy and
      nonviscous. The mixture was then slowly poured into 2.5 liters of
      acetone to precipitate the copolymer. The white, fibrous copolymer
      was removed from the acetone by filtration, washed with 200 ml. of
      acetone, and placed in a high speed, Waring laboratory blender
      with 300 ml. of acetone. The mixture was beaten for 3 seconds to
      pulverize the copolymer and the resulting slurry was filtered. The
      copolymer was dried under vacuum at room temperature. The product
      was 3.02 g of a copolymer of acrylamide grafted to starch and
      having an intrinsic viscosity of 10.6 dl/g.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask was added 25 ml of distilled,
      deionized water and 1.00028 g of starch. The flask and contents
      were heated to 80 DEG C. and stirred for 30 minutes. When the
      flask and contents had cooled to 25 DEG C., 4.27 g of acrylamide
      and 15 ml of distilled, deionized water were added. Argon was
      bubbled through the solution for 30 minutes before the flask was
      capped and 0.051 ml of the ceric ammonium nitrate solution,
      prepared as in Example 1, was added. The solution was stirred for
      one minute, and placed in a controlled temperature bath at 30 DEG
      C. The sample was removed from the bath every 15 minutes and the
      reaction mixture stirred for one minute. After 45 minutes, the
      mixture was too viscous to stir and the sample was left
      undisturbed for another 71.25 hours. The reaction was terminated
      by the addition of 0.5 ml of water saturated with hydroquinone and
      the reaction mixture was placed in 300 ml of deionized water and
      stirred slowly for 3 days. A total of 230 ml of acetone was added
      dropwise to form a cloudy, nonviscous dispersion of copolymer in
      acetone and water. The dispersion was slowly added to 1.5 liters
      of vigorously stirred acetone. The precipitated copolymer was
      revovered from the acetone by filtration, placed in a covered
      beaker, and dried to constant weight under vacuum at 25 DEG C. The
      product was 5.3 g of a copolymer of acrylamide grafted to starch
      and having an intrinsic viscosity of 12.4 dl/g. <br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) were prepared from cassava starch
      by graft copolymerization of acrylamide on to starch using ceric
      ammonium nitrate (CAN) as free radical initiator, followed by
      alkali saponification. The reaction parameters such as
      concentration of acrylamide, concentration of CAN, temperature,
      and duration of polymerization reaction were optimized for maximum
      water absorbency using a 4-factor 3-level Box-Behnken design. The
      highest values of percentage grafting and absorbency obtained were
      174.8% and 425.2 g/g, respectively. The polymers were
      characterized by determination of grafting efficiency, N-content,
      acrylamide content, FTIR analysis, SEM and XRD analyses.
      Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) showed that the SAP has higher
      thermal stability. The rate of water absorbency and the swelling
      behaviour of the SAP under different conditions of pH, and
      different salts were determined. The de-swelling pattern of the
      hydrogels over different time durations was also determined.<br>

          Permanganate/Sulfuric Acid Initiation System</b><br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Graft copolymerization of 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate onto
      potato starch was carried out in an aqueous medium using a
      potassium permanganate/sulfuric acid initiation system. The
      grafting percentage and grafting efficiency were determined as
      functions of the concentrations of potassium permanganate,
      sulfuric acid and the monomer, and also polymerization temperature
      and time. The IR spectrum of the graft copolymer showed the peaks
      characteristic of the grafted chains. The grafting percentage and
      grafting efficiency increased and then decreased with increasing
      the concentrations of potassium permanganate, sulfuric acid, and
      the monomer, as well as polymerization temperature. The grafting
      reaction was characterized by an initial fast rate followed a
      lower rate which leveled off after a certain time. The overall
      activation energy for the grafting was estimated to be 66.9
      kJ/mol.<br>
