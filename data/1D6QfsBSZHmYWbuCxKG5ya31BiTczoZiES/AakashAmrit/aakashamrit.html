          It is refreshing to know some companies are still ethical .
          Unlike the false hope and promises QEG made in Morocco to the
          impoverished&nbsp; people a company in India is donating 100
          water vapor condensing machines to a drought stricken area in
          India :<br>

          AURANGABAD: It is not the magician at work nor is it a
          miracle. Experts are using innovative technology to tap the
          vapour content in the air to meet the drinking water needs
          without touching the existing sources of water.<br>
          <br>
          A private firm has developed a machine that condenses the
          water vapour in the air into clean drinking water. The firm
          recently donated the machines to the state government, which
          is planning to use them in the scarcity-hit areas.<br>
          <br>
          The scarcity-hit Jalna district received three such machines,
          which were installed at the civil hospital, Zilla Parishad and
          collector's office on Saturday. Each machine has the capacity
          to generate around 500 litres of water a day.<br>
          <br>
          State water supply and sanitation minister Babanrao Lonikar
          inaugurated the air water harvester (Akash Amrit) on Saturday.
          The company has donated 100 such machines to the state
          government to tackle water scarcity in the state.<br>
          <br>
          Lonikar said the private company has designed the device that
          offers a green and clean drinking water solution. "The machine
          harvests clean drinking water from air. The private company
          has donated 100 such machines to the state government and
          around 10 machines will be installed in the drought-hit Jalna
          district," he said.<br>
          <br>
          An expert from the company said the technology uses
          proprietary knowledge of superior condensation engineering
          techniques to convert atmospheric water vapour into the
          cleanest form of drinking water. "Unlike water filtration
          technologies like reverse osmosis, which require a water
          source, our technology does not require one," the expert said.
          <br>
          <br>
          The device costs around Rs 8 lakh and can function in full
          capacity when the maximum temperature is between 20 and 45
          degrees celsius. The humidity levels in the atmosphere have to
          be 30%, the expert said.<br>
          <br>
          "The technology also offers the advantage of an instantaneous
          solution for drinking water as it starts producing water
          within minutes of installation. Depending on the prevailing
          humidity and temperature conditions, the system is capable of
          making 500 to over 1,000 litres of clean drinking water per
          day," the expert said.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, this system does not require any additional
          infrastructure or skilled personnel to operate or maintain it.
          It is not just innovative technology but also cost effective,
          said the expert.<br>

          Drinking water quality directly affects millions of lives
          along with the economics of the world at large. Water-based
          and water-related vector diseases are responsible for
          increased mortality &amp; morbidity rate in many regions
          across our planet. In addition, contaminants in water like
          fluoride, arsenic and iron play havoc in many areas across
          India.<br>
          <br>
          This problem has been on a constant rise with hygienic water
          sources getting increasingly scarce. The fact is that in many
          parts of India, clean water is either hard to come by or has
          become a commodity that requires laborious work or significant
          currency to obtain.<br>
          <br>

          <b>INNOVATION TO SAVE THE PLANET, NOW!</b><br>
          <br>
          Water, a natural resource, is depleting fast, and time is
          running out. Inventive Green is involved with creating
          solutions to sustain and protect the environment starting with
          water, one of the basic resources to sustain life on the
          planet, our home.<br>
          <br>
          THE TOTAL VOLUME OF WATER ON EARTH IS ABOUT 1.4 BILLION KM3.<br>
          <br>
          THE VOLUME OF FRESHWATER RESOURCES IS ABOUT 2.5% OF THE TOTAL
          VOLUME. OF THESE FRESHWATER RESOURCES, 70% IS IN THE FORM OF
          ICE AND PERMANENT SNOW COVER.<br>
          <br>
          <b>FACTS ON THE TOTAL WATER RESERVES</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The total volume of water on Earth is about 1.4 billion km3.
          The volume of freshwater resources is around 35 million km3,
          or about 2.5 percent of the total volume.<br>
          <br>
          Of these freshwater resources, about 24 million km3 or 70
          percent is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in
          mountainous regions, the Antarctic and Arctic regions.<br>
          <br>
          Around 30 percent of the world's freshwater is stored
          underground in the form of groundwater (shallow and deep
          groundwater basins up to 2000 metres, soil moisture, swamp
          water and permafrost). This constitutes about 97 percent of
          all the freshwater that is potentially available for human
          use.<br>
          <br>
          Freshwater lakes and rivers contain an estimated 105 000 km3
          or around 0.3 percent of the world's freshwater.<br>
          <br>
          The total usable freshwater supply for ecosystems and humans
          is about 200 000 km3 . The Earth's atmosphere contains
          approximately 13,000 km3 of water<br>
          <br>
          <b>OUR OUTLOOK</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          We at Inventive Green continuously challenge ourselves to
          think forward to bring technologies of future to present, in
          order to ensure a better and brighter future.<br>
          <br>
          Rapid depleting natural resources, alarming increase in global
          pollution and population, necessitates innovative thinking and
          we at Inventive Green endeavour to explore, innovate and
          introduce new technologies that build BRIDGES to connect the
          present to the future.<br>
          <br>
          BRIDGES that are radical and creative in nature and yet use
          the simple natural processes in nurturing a sustainable
          future.<br>
          <br>
          BRIDGES that currently are focussed on pure drinking water and
          clean sustainable energy to guarantee a bright and better
          future for all.<br>
          <br>
          In the first phase of its operations Inventive Green is
          investing in providing clean water, one of the Earth’s most
          precious resources, the lack of which has and is the cause of
          major health-hazards and fatalities, far more than epidemics
          and wars.<br>

          than 40 percent of the people on our planet. By 2025, 1.8
          billion people will be living in countries or regions with
          absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world’s
          population could be living under water stressed conditions.<br>
          <br>
          Humans are over-consuming natural resources at an
          unsustainable rate. Around 3.5 planets Earth would be needed
          to sustain a global population achieving the current lifestyle
          of the average European or North American<br>
          <br>
          Inventive green has created a solution towards major
          applications of water, which can help society surmount the
          challenges posed by drinking water scarcity.<br>
          <br>
          <b>WATER ANYTIME</b><br>
          <b> </b>&nbsp;<br>
          Water scarcity is a concept, abstract to many and a stark
          reality for others.<br>
          <br>
          While the amount of freshwater on the planet has remained
          fairly constant since the beginning of time - continually
          recycled through the atmosphere and back into our cups - the
          need of water for drinking, cooking, bathing, agriculture,
          industry, waste disposal and "sustaining life" has amplified.<br>
          <br>
          Our atmosphere holds more than 13 Quadrillion litres of the
          freshest water in the form of water vapour. Nature's
          hydrologic cycle replenishes the water vapour every day
          thereby providing a sustainable source of clean water. Our
          engineered solution uses natural principles of condensation to
          convert the atmospheric water vapour into clean drinking
          water.<br>
          <br>
          We call our plug and play Air Water Harvester: AAKASH AMRIT
          (India)&nbsp; and&nbsp; NECTAIR (Internationally)<br>
          <br>
          NECTAIR is an innovative and green technology that provides an
          indispensable and instantaneous drinking water solution
          specifically in areas where drinking water is difficult or
          impossible to obtain.<br>
          <br>
          These units are engineered to maximize water vapour extraction
          on a specially designed condensing surface. Using natural
          process of 'condensation', our proprietary device harvests the
          atmospheric water vapour and converts into clean drinking
          water. The water yield is dependent upon the existing ambient
          conditions of temperature and relative humidity.<br>
          <br>
          Ease of use and maintenance, free of dependence on existing
          water resources and quick production of water makes the
          technology efficacious in addressing the clean drinking water
          needs in many areas across the globe.<br>

          <b>HARVESTING DRINKING WATER FROM THE AIR IS AN IDEAL SOLUTION
            FOR YOU IF...</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          You care about the quality of water consumed by your
          customers, fellow workers and you<br>
          <br>
          You recognize that that unhealthy water can cause serious
          ailments, loss of man hours, escalation of healthcare expenses
          and reputation damage<br>
          <br>
          You are tired of the unreliability of timelines and dependency
          on your current source of drinking water (the municipality,
          tanker water, bottled water service provider)<br>
          <br>
          You think bottled water is the only solution to ensure water
          quality and reliability but know that it is getting far too
          expensive to be a long term solution<br>
          <br>
          You realize that over 90% of the costs associated to bottled
          water is towards packaging, retailing, marketing, bottling and
          factors beyond the actual cost of water<br>
          <br>
          You acknowledge that water is getting scarce with every
          passing day and the huge impact on the environment based from
          your current sources of drinking water:<br>
          <br>
          Bore wells - Rapid depletion of the ground water reserves<br>
          Bottled Water - Environmental impact of plastic bottles<br>
          Tanker Water - Burning of Fossil Fuels<br>
