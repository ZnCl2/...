    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      <b>Troy Hurtubise</b> has done the seemingly impossible with his
      newest invention and defied all known rules of physics, he says.
      Hurtubise claims the concept came to him in a recurring dream. The
      Angel Light can reportedly see through walls, as if there was no
      barrier at all.
      <p>That's not all, though. Hurtubise, 41, said the device detects
        stealth technology. And he's done the tests to prove it, with
        the covert help of scientists at the famed Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology, Hurtubise said. If that's not enough,
        Hurtubise also said the French government sent representatives
        to North Bay to witness a demonstration of the Angel Light.
        Hurtubise said the reps were so impressed with the eight-foot
        long device they paid him $40,000 in cash to put the finishing
        touches on it. </p>
      <p><b>New Universe</b> </p>
      <p>The French, Hurtubise adds, have also agreed to pay him a
        substantial amount of money for the technology if it passes
        rigorous tests in France. </p>
      <p>They couldn't believe what they saw", Hurtubise told
        BayToday.ca. "One of them told me it was as if I'd discovered a
        new universe". </p>
      <p>Gary Dryfoos, a consultant and former long-time instructor at
        MIT, said "there's a Nobel Prize" for Hurtubise if the Angel
        Light really performs as described. </p>
      <p>"There are laws of physics waiting to be written for what he's
        talking about," Dryfoos said. </p>
      <p>The French aren't the only ones interested in Hurtubise's
        innovations. </p>
      <p>BayToday.ca has obtained documentation confirming that the
        former head of Saudi counter-intelligence, who asked that his
        name not be used, has been in regular contact with Hurtubise
        regarding the Angel Light, fire paste, and the Light Infantry
        Military Blast Cushions (LIMBC). </p>
      <p><b>Ultra-Wideband Technology</b> </p>
      <p>While Hurtubise's claims appear, on the surface, to strain
        credulity, he has now placed himself miles ahead in the quest by
        high-tech companies to invent something that will do the same
        thing. <br>
        Motorola Inc. for example, has set its sights on emerging
        technology that could allow first responders and Special Forces
        to see through building walls, the Washington Technology Web
        site reports. </p>
      <p>Camero Inc., an Israeli firm founded by technology and
        intelligence veterans, received $5 million from Motorola and
        other investors to develop portable imaging radar that uses
        ultra-wideband technology to create a 3-D picture of objects
        that are concealed by walls or other barriers. </p>
      <p><b>Plasma Light</b> </p>
      <p>Three units make up the Angel Light. The main unit, which
        Hurtubise calls the centrifuge, contains the Angel Light's
        brains and includes black, white, red and fluorescent light
        sources, as well as seven industrial lasers. The second unit, or
        the deflector grid, contains a large circle of optical glass, a
        microwave unit and plasma intermixed with carbon dioxide. The
        third unit contains eight plasma light rods, CO2 charges,
        industrial magnets, 108 mirrors, eight ionization cells,
        industrial lights, and other components Hurtubise chooses to
        remain tight-lipped about. </p>
      <p><b>Just A Dream</b> </p>
      <p>Hurtubise said the Angel Light has cost $30,000 to build he
        sold percentages of his other innovations to finance it as well
        as 800 to 900 hours of his time. </p>
      <p>He credits his subconscious with the idea. </p>
      <p>"I had a dream about a year and a half ago as I do for most of
        my innovations, just a dream, and I saw it, saw the whole casing
        and everything, and I saw what it could do", Hurtubise said. "I
        had the same dream about that three times and by the third time
        I had it in my head and I started to build it". </p>
      <p><b>Through The Wall</b> </p>
      <p>Troy dreamed the Angel Light would be able to see through walls
        with window-like efficiency, and then built it with no
        blueprints, drawings or schematics. </p>
      <p>"I turned it on --- that was well over a year --- and it worked
        and it was really awesome". </p>
      <p>Hurtubise said he could see into the garage behind his lab
        wall, and read the licence plate on his wife's car and even see
        the salt on it. </p>
      <p>"I almost broke my knuckles three or four times, because it was
        almost like you could step through the wall," Hurtubise said.
        "You could be fooled into believing that you could actually walk
        through the wall and go touch the car." </p>
      <p><b>Across The Border</b> </p>
      <p>Hurtubise called his MIT contacts with news of what he'd done.
      </p>
      <p>"They told me that I was playing with electromagnetism",
        Hurtubise said. </p>
      <p>The conversation ultimately led to the discovery of the Angel
        Light's other startling properties. </p>
      <p>Hurtubise said "somebody from MIT" shipped him an eight-inch by
        eight-inch piece of panelling from the latest Comanche
        helicopter, which was built using radar-resistant stealth
        technology. </p>
      <p>"It's amazing what you can get across the border on a Greyhound
        bus", Hurtubise said. </p>
      <p><b>Pick it up</b> </p>
      <p>Hurtubise was instructed to set up an outdoor track, which he
        did on First Nations land. He attached the panel piece to a
        remote control car that went down the track. Hurtubise then
        aimed the Angel Light at the panel and turned on a radar gun. </p>
      <p>"I was able to pick it up the panel on the radar gun", he said.
      </p>
      <p><b>Stopped working</b> </p>
      <p>But a strange thing happened to the car, once it was hit by the
        Angel Light beam: it stopped working. </p>
      <p>Hurtubise returned to his lab and began testing the Angel Light
        on other electronic items including portable radios, TVs and a
        microwave over. </p>
      <p>"They all stopped working", Hurtubise said. </p>
      <p>He duly reported this to his MIT contacts. </p>
      <p>"They said 'Troy, this is unbelievable.'" </p>
      <p><b>To the Ground</b> </p>
      <p>Hurtubise purchase a remote-control plane for $1,800 and took
        it and the Angel Light to a flying field on the way to Powassan.
        He directed the Angel Light beam toward the sky and started the
        plane flying. </p>
      <p>"On the first loop it came around, passed through the beam of
        light and fell right to the ground", Hurtubise said. </p>
      <p><b>Peeled It Back</b> </p>
      <p>Hurtubise continued testing the light on other materials and
        discovered it could also see through other metals including
        steel, tin, titanium and, unlike Superman, lead. As well the
        beam also penetrated ceramic and wood. Then Hurtubise put his
        hand in the light beam. </p>
      <p>"I could see my blood vessels, muscles, everything, like I'd
        taken an Exacto knife, cut into my skin and peeled it
        back",Hurtubise said. </p>
      <p><b>Bad Stuff</b> </p>
      <p>Soon after, Hurtubise discovered the Angel Light had devilish
        side-effects. He lost feeling in the finger of the exposed hand
        and began suffering an overall malaise. </p>
      <p>"MIT told me every time I turned it on there must have
        splash-back hitting me", Hurtubise said. </p>
      <p>A test on a tank of goldfish was even more disturbing. </p>
      <p>"I turned the beam on it and within minutes all the goldfish
        died", Hurtubise said. "That's when I realized there was a Hyde
        effect, as in Jekyll and Hyde, and I dismantled the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p><b>Walked On Water</b> </p>
      <p>He didn't reassemble it until the French called him after
        seeing a Discovery Channel program about the LIMBC. Hurtubise
        believes the Hyde effect can be taken out, but by others who
        have far more expertise than him. In the meantime Hurtubise
        believes that after 17 years inventing, his ship may finally
        have come in with France. </p>
      <p>"My brother told me the only way I'd be able to sell any of my
        innovations is by walking on water," Hurtubise said. "Well, I
        think I've just walked on water." </p>
