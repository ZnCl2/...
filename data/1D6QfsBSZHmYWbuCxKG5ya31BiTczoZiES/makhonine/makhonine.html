        Montpellier : "The Mystery Makhonine"</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention of Ivan Makhonine who made use of it as a business
      Makhonine, was the subject of numerous articles and reviews in
      national and international press, as well as in political circles,
      the army, and business world.<br>
      <br>
      As always, there were those who understood that this invention
      could make France free from oil speculation, major groups that
      govern the planet. But it was not counting on their power and
      their Lies which unfortunately diverted policy makers from this
      fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Our site aims to make known to all inventions which concern mainly
      energy and pollution problems.<br>
      <br>
      We always try as much as possible to give you the maximum
      information about these inventions and their inventors.<br>
      <br>
      In many cases we do not have conclusive evidence that these
      inventions provide the results described by their inventors and we
      often stay on our hunger, but there are some whose results are
      indisputable because they have been thoroughly checked, recorded
      officially, and have resulted in successful applications. Despite
      this interest, they fell or were pushed into oblivion for reasons
      wholly beyond their technical or utilities.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it is impossible to ignore one of those inventions made at
      the beginning of the century by Mr Ivan Makhonine, Russian
      engineer.<br>
      <br>
      In 1981 we became aware of the issue... and today, 20 years later,
      and more than 80 years after the time when Makhonine lived, we
      think it useful to publish the most of our documents for
      reflection of our readers.<br>
      <br>
      So much time, energy and lives ruined by the chosen orientation
      for supplying fuel to the transport means for all these years, and
      all that to come to requisition (almost) today good agricultural
      land that could produce anything other than fuel. History repeats
      itself, the choice is unfortunately also biased as it was time
      Makhonine. We see every day what to means of production such
      choices steer humanity...<br>

      Mr. Makhonine had simply found a way to make an ideal fuel ranging
      from gasoline and diesel, with the advantages of each without its
      flaws.<br>
      <br>
      Born in Russia in 1895, Yvan Makhonine, finds himself in the war
      of 14/18 in a state research center to invent weapons and
      ammunition of all kinds, which brings him fortune.<br>
      <br>
      Around 1917, he invented a way to produce synthetic fuel, able to
      run without noticeable changes, all types of combustion engines
      typically powered by gasoline or other fuels.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike gasoline, his fuel can not be ignited in the cold, but only
      when hot as fuel. But though it can only be ignited&nbsp; with
      difficulty by auto ignition, unlike gasoline, it can help to
      significantly increase the efficiency of combustion engines by
      simply raising their compression rate.<br>
      <br>
      This fuel, a little fatter than gasoline, with the appearance of
      diesel, is easily sprayable by carburetor engines, provided you
      bring the electric air preheating systems to facilitate cold
      starts and to increase the efficiency of the usual means of
      heating the body of the carburettor.<br>
      <br>
      Some adjusting the weight floats and sizes of the nozzles are to
      be made because of the density of the product, markedly higher
      than gasoline, and close to 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      Around 1918, Mr. Makhonine built an electric-powered locomotive
      with motors driving the wheel axles are powered by a power
      generator itself driven by an internal combustion engine with a
      high compression ratio. The cars of this train were also equipped
      with electric motors.<br>
      <br>
      According to witnesses, it leaves a vapor with the appearance of a
      thick smoke, which feeds directly into the combustion engine
      electric generator.<br>
      <br>
      If this "smoke" is sent to a conventional distillation apparatus,
      it condenses as fuel that can be stored for later use.<br>
      <br>
      This electric powered locomotive, ultra modern for its time
      compared to intensive steam engines, was used in Russian cars
      until 1920 or 1921.<br>
      <br>
      Beginning 1922, Mr. Makhonine with his wife (the singer Nathalie
      Ermolenko) and fortune, arrived in France, and decided to sell his
      invention to the French State.<br>
      <br>
      For many years the fuel was used successfully in all vehicles
      equipped with an internal combustion engine, automobiles, trucks,
      boats, planes etc.<br>
      <br>
      One could write books about what happened during these years,
      finally everything stopped around 1927, when he found himself
      almost ruined after suffering the fate of many inventors.<br>
      <br>
      After the 39/40 war, with energy problems and addictiveness, he
      found hope to interest French politicians and other
      decision-makers and power brokers again to his invention. This
      would have resulted in&nbsp; incalculable positive economic
      consequences for our country.<br>
      <br>
      We actually noticed a few bursts of interest over the years for
      its fuel, years in which he sought to develop one or two other
      inventions, including his invention of an airplane with variable
      geometry. The invention on which he obstinately persisted at his
      own expense would eventually ruin him completely.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Ivan Makhonine, engineer, Russian inventor, died in France in
      1973 in a retirement home for needy Russian emigrants, without
      disclosing the precise secret of his invention, i.e., the exact
      technology that transformed the machine hydrocarbon vapors and
      other carbon products in a "smoke" condensable giving this famous
      fuel and this with tremendous efficiency, which we are unable to
      achieve with our current science.<br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, Mr. Makhonine knew just make an ideal fuel that was
      neither petrol nor diesel, but an intermediate product.<br>
      <br>
      He could manufacture this fuel from raw materials most unfit for
      this, i.e., coal tars, the worst coal, crude oil, vegetable oils
      and all hydrocarbon or carbonaceous waste.<br>
      <br>
      What we know is that it was preparing the base product with means
      that differed product (see French Patent No. 622036 below), so as
      to extract a steam that was posing in a kind large insulated tube
      externally - not described in the patent system - whose other end
      is connected directly to an engine, or a conventional distillation
      apparatus where the fuel comes out.<br>
      <br>
      These are obviously the details of this device, absent from the
      patent, which are unknown to us.<br>
      <br>
      We know that production of this exceptional fuel yields were
      approximately 95% crude oils and coal tars. These results are not
      comparable with that obtained in quantity and quality by
      conventional methods which are known to us.<br>
      <br>
      We also know that the engines burning the fuel, in addition to
      their exceptional performance, did not pollute, produced no smoke
      or the usual unpleasant smell, but only a sort of hot gas with a
      slight pleasant odor.<br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A method of mechanical processing heavy liquid fuels, coal tars
      and in light liquid fuels, can be employed for feeding internal
      combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      DESCRIPTION<br>
      <br>
      The present invention and improvements and modifications to the
      process, feeding internal combustion engines, manufacturing and
      hydrogenation of fuel required for the operation of these motors
      and devices for the implementation of this method in internal
      combustion machinery.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the present invention is applicable to feeding
      internal combustion engines using solid fuels such as shale, coal,
      peat, lignite, etc., by their dissociation under high pressures
      and at elevated temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The separation of liquid or solid fuels will be carried out as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      The heavy liquid fuel, mixed with any gas, is introduced into a
      cylinder and compressed adiabatically until a certain pressure
      and, therefore, subject to corresponding temperature, then
      reformed in a refrigerant, products which have undergone this
      elevation of temperature and pressure (that is to say, the factors
      promoting their decomposition and their cleavage) will be
      condensed.<br>
      <br>
      We obtain for the oils from petrol and having undergone such an
      operation, a dissociation of their elements, that is to say that
      one will find in the resulting products, products heavier than
      before the operation and the slight species.<br>
      <br>
      There may also be introduced into the cylinder or cylinders (the
      compression operation can be performed in one or more stages) the
      liquid fuel mixed with hydrogen gas at a pressure and a
      temperature determined in advance; hydrocarbons poor in hydrogen,
      that is to say unsaturated, absorb, in addition to the hydrogen
      they already contain a determined amount of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      These hydrocarbons driven into a condenser and condensed, with or
      without pressure, in the presence or absence of a catalyst, will
      be&nbsp; hydrogenated and contain minor species in abundance.<br>
      <br>
      By performing the same operations on fat, one can break them down
      into small essences.<br>
      <br>
      Similar results will be obtained by separating the oils by the use
      of gas or air expelled at high pressures and corresponding
      temperatures across a certain mass of the selected fuel. The
      resulting products will be passed, if necessary in the presence of
      a catalyst, or a refrigerant or condensable gas, with or without
      pressure, are condensed with or without pressure; as products to
      condensable gases, such as coal gas or other, they will be
      recovered to be used for purposes other than those indicated by
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The Description which will follow, to the accompanying drawing,
      given by way of example, will explain how the invention will be
      realized.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1 and 2 are an elevation partially cut away and in plan, of
      an apparatus for the treatment of liquid fuels.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a sectional view of the apparatus for processing solid
      fuels.<br>
      <br>
      A compressor ( Fig. 1 and 2 ) sucks through an ordinary carburetor
      1 the mixtures of selected gas and heavy liquid fuels, the gas
      flowing through the pipe 3. This compressor will consist in
      principle of two cylinders 4 and 5 of the first compression stage,
      a cylinder 6 of the second compression stage and a cylinder 7,
      compression of the third stage; it is provided with suction valves
      8 and 9 and delivery valves 10 and 11, 12, and 13, separating them
      in the different phases of compression and conveniently disposed
      to assure the good functioning of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      On the body of these valves will set a piping for aspirating the
      mixture gas and liquid to be hydrogenated, the passing this
      mixture in the various compression chambers, and finally the
      compressor communicating with the condenser 14 to through the
      control valve 15.<br>
      <br>
      There exist in the path of this piping two similar cooling coils
      16 and 17, the coil 16 between the second and the third
      compression stages, and the other between the third 17 and the
      refrigerant compression; each of these coils will have a special
      installation to meet at each instant, with a pyrometer and through
      the inner tubes 18 and 19, the temperature of gases and vapors
      through these coils; these will be naturally cooled as required
      for the operation and the results to be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the compressor will have three manometers 20, 21, and
      22 as indicated; 20 is the pressure gauge in the first compression
      chamber, 21 in the second compression chamber, and 22 the gauge in
      the third compression chamber; in addition, three suction valves
      located one on each of the three compression stages.<br>
      <br>
      The number of compression stages is not essential and may even be
      one, resulting, of course, the forms of construction of
      compressors and other data as described above.<br>
      <br>
      A water manometer will be installed on the suction piping of gas,
      in order to measure every moment the pressure or vacuum in this
      part of the piping.<br>
      <br>
      This compressor can be controlled directly or indirectly by any
      force: steam, electricity, gasoline engine, transmission belt,
      etc. A refrigerant compressor may be mounted on the same base, or
      separately.<br>
      <br>
      The operation is as follows: The compressor suction (Fig 1 and 2)
      being felt in the carburetor 1 by the intermediary of aspiration
      valves 8 and 9, a depression is produced in the chamber of the
      carburetor; the liquid, acted upon by this relative vacuum, comes
      through the pipe 3, the nozzle will pass through the carburetor
      and by spraying, will mix into droplets of tenuous gas supplied
      through pipe 2.<br>
      <br>
      This liquid and gas mixture pass through the filling valves 8 and
      9 and répandra in the cylinders 4 and 5, where it will undergo a
      first compression and hence, a processing liquid particles in
      vapor, caused by the increase in temperature corresponding to this
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The gas mixture and the released vapors of the cylinders 4 and 5,
      after the first compression through the discharge valves 10 and 11
      of these cylinders will cover a first portion of pipes arranged
      for this purpose and on the route which is a manometer 20 of first
      compression chamber, then into the cylinder 6 through a pipe
      arranged thereto and undergo the second compression.<br>
      <br>
      The gas mixture and then vapor will penetrate into the cylinder 7
      to be compressed there a third time and undergo there, therefore,
      a further increase in pressure and cooling, then the output gas
      and vapors are highly compressed and heated to a high temperature,
      then cross the third and final part of the piping, also with a
      manometer in the third compression chamber and valve to the coil
      17 (or,if deemed necessary, a further reduction) and be finally
      collected by the light liquid outlet pipe of the coolant, which
      may moreover be provided with a flow valve.<br>
      <br>
      A similar operation is reserved for the treatment of solid fuels
      by the process of reducing them to a very fine powder.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, as regards the processing in subjecting these solid
      fuels, such as coal usually a means envisaged for the embodiment
      of the present invention will be excessively fine grinding and
      pulverizing of coal to be treated, mixing this with a heavy coal
      liquid fuel and the passage of this mixture sufficiently liquid,
      mixing with gas or air through a compressor of a type somewhat
      similar to that already described, and then condensation vapors
      and gases obtained in the compressor under high pressure and at
      corresponding temperatures, through a similar coolant to that used
      for the treatment of heavy liquid fuels described above.<br>
      <br>
      Condensable gases, such as coal gas, for example, from the
      dissociation of coal will be recovered to be used for purposes
      other than those specified by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of the solid fuel treatment embodiment is to
      carry out the separation of coal, by subjecting them to the action
      of gas or air expelled at high pressures and corresponding
      temperatures, using an apparatus Special arranged for this
      purpose.<br>
      <br>
      This device (Fig. 3) will consist of a fuel tank, cylindrical tube
      26, having on its perimeter tubing 27; on arrival of the gas or
      compressed air in this pipe, the valve 28 will be set to discharge
      the compressor.<br>
      <br>
      The upper part is closed by a hemispherical cover 29 carrying a
      manometer 30 and a safety valve 31; the lid on the reservoir body
      will be tightened using bolts 32, equipped with wing nuts.<br>
      <br>
      The lower part of the apparatus ends by a hemispherical bottom 33
      forming a pipe on the flange of which will bind a control valve 34
      which, via the pipe 35, allow access to the refrigerant vapor and
      gas products.<br>
      <br>
      At the bottom, the obstruction of the outlet pipe is avoided by
      adding a movable strainer 36 arranged for this purpose.<br>
      <br>
      As for the top, the bottom be fastened with bolts to eye 37,
      equipped with wing nuts.<br>
      <br>
      The vertical position of the fuel tank is not required; the latter
      may be more or less tilted and even be placed horizontally.<br>
      <br>
      One compressor may by an intermediary a delivery manifold, forcing
      simultaneously in several fuel tanks arranged on ad hoc sites, or
      vice versa, several compressors...<br>

      It is known that when the hydrocarbons are subjected to pressures
      and temperatures higher than those which correspond to their
      normal boiling, they undergo complex processes of transformation
      that is designated by the name of cracking or cracking and which
      consist in particular in the production of hydrocarbons having a
      lower boiling point than the hydrocarbons from which we started.<br>
      <br>
      It has already been proposed to subject the liquid fuels
      (especially heavy oils) vaporized in a heat treatment under a
      high&nbsp; pressure, prior to entering the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Now the Applicant has found that, to obtain a liquid fuel suitable
      for a particular motor, it is necessary to submit the liquid fuel,
      which is, more particularly, a heavy oil, after vaporization and
      before its introduction into the engine, the temperature and the
      maximum pressure to which it will be submitted in the engine
      during the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The treatment may be in a facility associated with the engine. The
      fuel is then introduced directly into the engine or in the vapor
      state or in a reliquefied state. According to a variant the fuel
      can be obtained separately to be used thereafter.<br>
      <br>
      The applicant has found that by adjusting the fuel processing to
      the type of engine used, we get various technical and economic
      benefits.<br>
      <br>
      If, for example, in an engine which operates with a high pressure
      and high temperature pressing, for example with a pressure of 8
      kg. per cm and a temperature of 350 [deg] C., use is made of a
      fuel that has been subjected to the vaporized state, at a pressure
      and a temperature significantly lower, for example at a pressure
      of 4 kg per cm and a temperature of 250 C., the product
      auto-ignites, therefore, is likely to autoxidation, and forms
      carbon deposits which rapidly contaminate the engine.<br>
      <br>
      If however a motor which operates with a low pressure and a low
      compression temperature, for example with a pressure of 4 kg. per
      cm and a temperature of 250 [deg] C. is provided a vaporized fuel
      that has been subjected to a pressure and at a significantly
      higher temperature, for example at a pressure of 8 kg. per cm and
      at a pressure of 350 [deg] C., the operation of the engine is
      perfect but during processing it eliminates some amount of the
      combustion products which would be effective, and therefore the
      fuel efficiency is considerably reduced.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus seen that the method according to the present invention
      provides a hydrocarbon fuel which gives the best results for the
      particular engine in which it is used.<br>
      <br>
      This fuel does not react with air and is no longer producing
      autoxidation phenomena during compression, which eliminates
      self-ignition; it causes no carbon deposit, nor the phenomena
      known as knocking.<br>
      <br>
      The method may be implemented in any suitable manner and using any
      suitable installation.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the oil may be subjected to the temperature and the
      pressure mentioned above in a suitable boiler and vapors can be
      either introduced directly into the engine where they are mixed
      with the combustion air, is conducted in a cooling apparatus, and
      the obtained liquid can be adjusted and if necessary, filtered.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the oil is sucked via a suitable
      carburetor, with a small amount of an inert gas or a hydrogen-rich
      gas in a cylinder, where it is subjected to the desired
      compression and temperature, with the temperature or not, totally
      or partially, due to compression.<br>
      <br>
      The vapors are then either supplied directly to the engine, where
      they mix with the combustion air, is fed to a cooling device, the
      liquid obtained being rectified, and cooled if necessary.<br>
      <br>
      The following figures are given for explanatory purposes regarding
      the pressure and the maximum temperature to be employed.<br>
      <br>
      Compression pressure. -- The moment or end of its admission, the
      gas occupies at atmospheric pressure po, volume aq + e, q being
      the volume of the cylinder, a the coefficient compression, and e
      the remaining volume when the piston is at its top dead center.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the compression volume is e and the pressure p.<br>
      <br>
      Following the laws of adiabatic compression we have:<br>

      This formula gives p1 in kg per cm^2.<br>
      <br>
      When the load factor is not known, it can take the value a = 0.88.<br>
      <br>
      The gases are heated in contact with the walls, especially at the
      end of the compression the compression heat increases and
      decreases n.<br>

      = 1.3 and n = 1.4, the coefficient 1.4 being closest to practical

      <p>Three hundred miles on a gallon of oil -- 10 times the mileage
        possible for the usual present-day motor! </p>
      <p>Such is the astounding record claimed for a crude-oil engine
        developed by Harry H. Elmer, of Syracuse NY for use in
        automobiles, airplanes, ships, and lighting systems. In
        experiments, the engine has generated sufficient power to run a
        battery of 18 incandescent lamps on 1-1/4 pints of oil, costing
        less than a cent. </p>
      <p>Because this mechanical marvel does not require a cooling
        system, government officials, it is reported, are studying the
        possibility of its use in dirigibles. </p>
      <p>Among more than 300 radically new features claims for the
        engine, the most important are these: </p>
      <p>It contains only 64 parts and has only three adjustments. </p>
      <p>It has no spark, carburetor, wiring, nor any sort of ignition.
      </p>
      <p>The cylinder has a bore of 3-3/4 inches and a 6-inch stroke,
        yet the engine, it is said, has developed 200% more power than
        internal combustion engines of the same size, and will pick up
        almost instantaneously from 100 to 2800 revolutions a minute. </p>
      <p><b>How the Motor Operates ~</b> </p>
      <p>The new engine is described as a 4-cycle motor, the cycles
        being suction, combustion, expansion, and exhaust. The crude oil
        is led through needle valves into mechanism, where it is
        compressed by the upward stroke of the piston. On compression
        the oil is "cracked" by chemical process and the expansion of
        gases takes place. As the piston is forced down, the exhaust
        port is opened, and the incoming charge forces out the expanded
        gases </p>
      <p>There is no combustion in the cylinder, though hydrocarbon gas,
        escaping the exhaust, explodes on uniting with atmosphere. </p>
      The engine has been operated with equal success on mineral,
      animal, and vegetable oils<b><br>

      <br>
      The present invention relates to improvements intended to permit
      feeding of heavy oils of internal combustion engines, particularly
      those operating according to a cycle Beau de Rochas.<br>
      <br>
      Until now, heavy oils were unusable in combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      Indeed, we sought the opportunity to bring these oils and their
      mixture with air at a temperature allowing their inflammation by
      ordinary candles in combustion engines, but the results have been
      very limited.<br>
      <br>
      The fuel truck is not suitable for modern engines which have a
      high compression, and one is led to prevent self-ignition, knocks
      and other drawbacks, decompressing the engine, which has the
      effect of reduce power and increase its consumption, which is a
      function of the volumetric compression.<br>
      <br>
      This is due to their molecular structure as heavy oils are
      difficult to use.<br>
      <br>
      According to the invention, the fuel is changed so that it no
      longer has the disadvantages indicated above.<br>
      <br>
      According to a feature of the invention, there is added to the
      heavy oil carburetor carburetor continuously debiting a special
      fuel, with heavy oil, is an anti-knock mixture inside the engine,
      without the mixture is performed before the introduction into the
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      According to another feature of the invention is modified and
      warmed fuel in admixture with air, so that they can be consumed in
      the most modern engines regardless of their compression.<br>
      <br>
      Supercharging, however, decreases the specific consumption and,
      given the lower price of heavy fuel, the user benefits from a
      considerable saving.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably is carried out as close as possible heating of the
      engine, that is to say between the carburettor and intake
      manifold.<br>
      <br>
      This preheating may be achieved by heat exchange with the exhaust
      gas by electrical means, or by an auxiliary combustion with a
      burner fed optionally by another fuel.<br>
      <br>
      By way of non-limiting example, there is shown schematically an
      embodiment of the invention in the single figure of the
      accompanying drawing.<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="fr1470414.jpg" height="574"

      <br>
      The apparatus of the invention comprises a small tube boiler A
      heated in any suitable manner and advantageously by the hot
      exhaust gas arriving at B and departing cooled in C. However, it
      could use any other heat source.<br>
      <br>
      Above this unit is attached H carburetor for the vaporization of
      heavy oil.<br>
      <br>
      Instead of a single carburetor, it may also be more than one each
      for the use of a different fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, on the same apparatus there is another carburetor M
      which supplies a special fuel facilitating, through its catalytic
      action, processing of heavy fuels, and thereby avoid knocking and
      auto-ignition.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, an ordinary carburetor, E, gasoline fueled can be used
      either for commissioning or for powering the motor in the case
      where it would not have heavy oil.<br>
      <br>
      Starting the engine and pre-heating of the device can be normally
      obtained by the fuel supply.<br>
      <br>
      However, if the lack of fuel, or if one is in an environment where
      gasoline is prohibited, preheating can be provided by an electric
      heater.<br>
      <br>
      It would then be linked to a thermostat coming into action
      whenever the temperature of the unit will be lowered as a result
      of prolonged idling or after an engine shutdown, if it can not
      serve as essence.<br>
      <br>
      To use any heavy oil, we can have another auxiliary electric
      heater with thermostat that will maintain the fuel to the desired
      density.<br>
      <br>
      As the calorific value is substantially proportional to the
      density, and the density proportional to the temperature, it is
      possible to ensure that the fuel of any kind, always at the same
      density, which will run the engine always in identical conditions.<b><br>
