      The Siberian Times disclosed recently how Russian scientists are
      making progress in the search for the elixir of youth by
      investigating a bacteria named Bacillus F which has remained alive
      in the permafrost for millions of years.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments are underway on mice and human blood cells but the man
      who made the 'sensational' discovery has now admitted he injected
      himself with the ancient bacteria found in the Sakha Republic, the
      largest region of Siberia. Anatoli Brouchkov, head of the
      Geocryology Department at Moscow State University, said he has
      become a guinea pig for the bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      'I started to work longer, I've never had a flu for the last two
      years,' he said. 'After successful experiments on mice and fruit
      flies, I thought it would be interesting to try the inactivated
      bacterial culture,' he told The Siberian Times<br>

      <br>
      'Besides, the permafrost is thawing, and I guess these bacteria
      get into the environment, into the water, so the local population,
      the Yakut people, in fact, for a long time are getting these cells
      with water, and even seem to live longer than some other nations.
      So there was no danger for me. '<br>
      <br>
      He stressed: 'It wasn't quite a scientific experiment, so I cannot
      professionally describe the effects. But it was quite clear for me
      that I did not catch flu for two years.&nbsp; Perhaps there were
      some side-effects, but there should be some special medical
      equipment to spot them. Of course, such experiments need to be
      conducted in clinic, with the special equipment and statistics.
      Then we could say clearly about all the effects.'<br>
      <br>
      In any case, it was too early to market the bacteria despite an
      undoubted demand for a potion offering eternal life. 'It still
      needs the experiments. We have to work out how this bacteria
      prevents ageing. I think <br>
      that is the way this science should develop. What is keeping that
      mechanism alive? And how can we use it for our own benefits?'<br>

      Living bacteria found in permafrost - '3.5 million years old' - is
      'scientific sensation' which allows 'mice grannies' to reproduce.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists have decoded the DNA of a bacteria found thriving in
      ancient permafrost, and are now seeking to understand the genes
      which provide its extraordinary longevity. <br>
      <br>
      Work is also underway to study a so far unexplained positive
      impact on living organisms, notably human blood cells, mice, fruit
      flies, and crops. Professor Sergey Petrov, chief researcher of
      Tyumen Scientific Centre, said: 'In all these experiments,
      Bacillus F stimulated the growth and also strengthened the immune
      system. The experiments on human erythrocytes and leucocytes were
      also very optimistic. '<br>
      <br>
      The bacteria were originally found on Mamontova Gora - Mammoth
      Mountain - in Siberia's Sakha Republic, also known as Yakutia, in
      2009 by Dr Anatoli Brouchkov, head of the Geocryology Department,
      Moscow State University.&nbsp; Similar bacteria were discovered by
      Siberian scientist Vladimir Repin in the brain of an extinct
      woolly mammoth preserved by permafrost.<br>
      <br>
      'We did a lot of experiments on mice and fruit flies and we saw
      the sustainable impact of our bacteria on their longevity and
      fertility,' said Dr Brouchkov. 'But we do not know yet exactly how
      it works. In fact, we do not know exactly how aspirin works, for
      example, but it does. The same is true here: we cannot understand
      the mechanism, but we see the impact.' <br>
      <br>
      Describing the discoveries as a 'scientific sensation' and an
      'elixir of life', Yakutsk epidemiologist Dr Viktor Chernyavsky
      said: 'The bacteria gives out biologically active substances
      throughout its life, which activates the immune status of
      experimental animals.' As a result, 'mice grannies not only began
      to dance, but also produced offspring'.<br>
      <br>
      If the same substance were to be given to people, it could cause a
      significant improvement in their health, leading to the discovery
      of an 'elixir of life', said Dr Chernyavsky.<br>
      <br>
      A number of claims are now being made for the potential of three
      different strains of bacteria found in the permafrost, among them
      the rejuvenating of the life of living beings. Another is the
      potential development of organisms capable of destroying petroleum
      molecules, turning them into water, with the potential one day to
      create a new system for cleaning up oil spills. A third strain of
      ancient bacteria is capable of eliminating cellulose molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Dr Brouchkov told The Siberian Times: 'We have completed the
      deciphering of Bacillus DNA and, more importantly, we have
      completely restored a sequence of genes in it. This work was
      ongoing for several years and it finished at the end of last year.
      Now we face&nbsp; the most complicated task - the attempts to find
      out which genes are providing the longevity of bacteria, and which
      proteins are protecting the DNA structure from damages. <br>
      <br>
      'We want to understand the mechanisms of the protection of genome,
      the functioning of the genes. The key question is what provides
      the vitality of this bacteria, but it is as complicated as which
      human genes are responsible for cancer and how to cure it. The
      scale and complicity of the question are nearly the same.' This
      involves technically difficult research, he said.<br>
      <br>
      He revealed that the bacteria has survived for millions of years
      deep in the Siberian ice. 'To state the exact age of bacteria, we
      need to date the permafrost rocks and this is not so easy,' he
      said. 'There are no exact methods to date the permafrost, but we
      have solid reason to believe that it is rather old. <br>
      <br>
      'Eastern Siberia is not a warm place even now and 3.5 million
      years ago it was also rather cold. It already had nearly the same
      temperature mode as it has now. That is we believe that this
      permafrost was formed 3.5 million years ago. And we believe that
      the bacteria could not penetrate to the oldest layer from the
      earlier ones through the permafrost. This bacteria was isolated
      from the outer world in ice, so we are quite sure that this
      bacteria was kept in the permafrost for such a long time. Yet we
      are still working to prove this.'<br>
      <br>
      Bacteria also preserved in other extreme conditions, he said.
      'Some of them were found in amber, some even in rock salt. More
      than this, in rock salt a bacteria aged half a billion years was
      found.'<br>
      <br>
      He claimed: 'I would say, there exist (in the world) immortal
      bacteria, immortal beings. They cannot die, to be more precise,
      they can protect themselves. Our cells are unable to protect
      themselves from damage. These bacteria cells are able to protect
      themselves. It would be great to find the mechanisms of protection
      from ageing, from damage and to use them to fight with our ageing.
      It's is the main riddle of mankind and I believe we must work to
      solve it. <br>
      <br>
      'Now we have a key, ancient bacteria, which scientists have found
      in an extreme and ancient environment.' He admitted that some
      people need convincing of the significance of the discoveries. 'Of
      course the discussions are ongoing. There are a lot of sceptics
      who do not believe that bacteria are really old. <br>
      <br>
      'But the main thing is: we finally saw the light at the end of a
      long and hopeless tunnel. It is a great deed. I would be happy if
      people are interested in our research. It is much better than to
      follow the dollar rate or price of oil. Our researches globally
      has just started. The first (scientific) articles appeared about
      ten years ago, so it is at the first stage of the research. <br>
      <br>
      'I believe that we all need to start studying these immortal
      beings, but at the moment not so many of us are doing this. We are
      arguing, discussing, instead of (doing sufficient) research. We
      need to use the fact that such bacteria were found in our
      permafrost. We have such opportunities for study. I believe that
      this bacteria could be very useful.'<br>

        seeds sprouted at a temperature 5C.' Pictures: SurgutInform TV</i><br>
      <br>
      One place where active research is underway is in Tymen, western
      Siberia, under Prof Petrov. 'We conduct various studies of the
      impact of the bacteria on the living organisms,' he said. 'We made
      experiments with copepods, mice, crops and human blood cells. In
      all these experiments Bacillus F stimulated the growth and also
      strengthened the immune system. The experiments on human
      erythrocytes and leucocytes were also very optimistic. <br>
      <br>
      'Now we are focused on experiments with the crops. The bacteria
      stimulates the growth of crops, increases productivity. This year
      we completed the laboratory studies and went to the field trials.
      We will look at the results. Before sowing seeds we put them into
      a solution containing a culture of the bacterium. We have
      harvested but the results are not completely processed yet.'&nbsp;
      The results of these trials will be announced later. <br>
      <br>
      'In the laboratory we got very good results. The bacteria not only
      stimulates growth, but increases frost resistance. The seeds
      sprouted at a temperature 5C. It is very important in our Siberian
      harsh conditions, when a sudden frost can come in May and even
      June.'<br>
      <br>
      He revealed: 'We can say that the bacteria enhances
      photosynthesis. It is also very important for our northern areas
      with short photo period. The plants have time to fully mature.<br>
      <br>
      'We conduct the biochemical research to understand the mechanism,
      how exactly this bacteria influences on the plants,&nbsp; which
      exact stages&nbsp; of the metabolism it affects. At the moment we
      cannot say for sure. That is, we see the effects, but cannot fully
      explain this yet. <br>
      <br>
      'At the moment the use of plant growth promoting bacteria is a
      very promising direction. It is clear that bacteria are much more
      effective than chemicals. Our Bacillus F has a great potential, as
      it managed to survive in permafrost. I believe its potential is
      much higher that other growth promoting bacteria. Besides it can
      help to withstand frost, which is so important for our conditions.<br>
      <br>
      'Now we have applied for a grant to conduct further research,
      especially on human blood cells, and we hope that we will get it,
      because the research is extremely promising.' <br>
      <br>
      Close to the site where the ancient bacteria was found lay the
      remains of woolly mammoths and rhinos. 'We found our bacteria in
      deeper, more ancient layers of permafrost, significantly lower
      that the layers where mammoths were found,' said Dr Brouchkov.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      At a time when the fundamental mechanisms of aging are still an
      issue of concern, the study of cells able to survive for thousands
      of years may be of interest to Gerontology. Evidence of the
      viability of microorganisms in frozen ground appeared in the
      nineteenth century. SS Abizov in 1979 found in the ice at the
      Antarctic station Vostok bacteria, fungi, diatoms and other
      microorganisms (Abizov SS, Bobin NE, Kudryashov BB, 1979.
      Microbiological studies glacier in Central Antarctica. Proceedings
      of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, Series Biology, 6, pp.
      828-836). Without denying the likelihood of microorganisms in the
      permafrost, we note that their growth is probably difficult. Even
      in vitro aging culture, as is known, stop growing. Crystallization
      of water and stopping External metabolism reduces the ability to
      grow. Therefore, we can assume that the bacteria in the permafrost
      are fossils relic organisms. Their age is confirmed by geological
      conditions of the location (Baranov Yu, Elijah IA, Nikitin VP,
      Pniewy GN, Fradkin AF, NY Shvareva Miocene Mammoth Mountain. Trudy
      GIN SB RAS USSR. Science. Moscow. 1976. 284 s), radiocarbon dating
      (Katayama T., Tanaka M., Moriizumi J., Nakamura T., Brouchkov A.,
      Douglas TA, Fukuda M., Tomita R, Asano K . Phylogenetic Analysis
      of Bacteria Preserved in a Permafrost Ice Wedge for 25,000 Years.
      Appl. Environ. Microbiol., Apr. 2007: 2360-2363), the study of the
      optical isomers of amino acids (Brinton KLF, Tsapin AI,
      Gilichinsky D., McDonald GD. Aspartic Acid Racemization and
      Age-Depth Relationships for Organic Carbon in Siberian Permafrost.

      as microbial habitat. In Viable Microorganisms in Permafrost.
      Russian Academy of Sciences: Pushchino, Russia; 21-26).<br>
      <br>
      The nature of long-term viability of microorganisms in ancient
      permafrost does not have a full explanation. Ability relic
      organisms remain viable for a long time suggests the existence of
      a mechanism that prevents the accumulation of damage. We consider
      it possible to use this mechanism to treat disease and prolong
      life in animals and humans.<br>

      <b>1. MATERIALS AND METHODS isolated microorganisms</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For microorganisms from permafrost samples were collected from
      natural outcrops. They are located on the left bank of the Aldan,
      325 kilometers upstream from its confluence with the Lena, at
      Mammoth Mountain. Samples were selected 0.9-1 m deep layer of
      seasonal thawing. Exposure of the river destroyed (more than a
      meter a year), so that the deposits from which samples were taken,
      were obviously in a state of permafrost. Thus there is an annual
      spring flushing collapses, preventing blockages and mixing breeds.
      The latter are fine-grained sands and siltstones; their age
      corresponds to the Middle Miocene (Baranov Yu, Elijah IA, Nikitin
      VP, Pniewy GN, Fradkin AF, NY Shvareva Miocene Mammoth Mountain.
      Trudy GIN SB RAS . Science. Moscow. 1976. 284 s). Cooling began
      here in the late Pliocene, about 3 - 3.5 million years ago.
      January temperature at that time was measured from -12 to -32 ° C,
      and in July of +12 to + 16 ° C. Deposits apparently not thawed
      Pleistocene of the cold climate Yakutia. Thus, the age of
      permafrost on Mammoth mountain can probably reach 3.5 million
      years. In addition, samples were taken from the wedges of ice ice
      complex in Yakutia and Alaska: Fox in the tunnel and in the gold
      mine near Fairbanks, and the walls of the underground Permafrost
      Institute. Melnikov in Yakutsk.<br>
      <br>
      <b>11. Sampling</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Samples were collected using sterilized with alcohol and burnt in
      the flame of metal tools (drills, forceps, scalpels). In order to
      conduct surface sterilized samples sample weighing about 50 g was
      placed in a beaker with 96% ethanol for one minute and then the
      flame at about 2 seconds, and finally in a sterile tube. Selected
      rocks stored at -5 ° C, which was close to the natural conditions.
      Transportation of samples was carried out in cold boxes with
      refrigerants in a frozen state.<br>
      <br>
      <b>12. Growth on artificial media</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Samples of various dilutions were added aseptically in petri
      dishes containing medium YPD, MRS and NA (see user manual Manual
      of environmental microbiology. 1997. Ed. Hurst CJ FSM Press.
      Washington DC. 894 p.). Samples were added in liquid meat peptone
      in anaerobic and aerobic conditions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>13. Preparation and Sequencing of DNA</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ribosomal DNA extracted microbial culture by using Fast DNA kit
      for soil (BIO 101 Inc., Vista, CA), where the method is based on
      the destruction of the cells with glass beads. Nucleic acids were
      precipitated from the solution using a solution consisting of 0.1
      parts of 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and 2.5 parts of ethanol,
      incubated on ice, and then centrifuged for 30 minutes at a speed
      of about 12,000. / Min. The precipitated nucleic acid is then
      dissolved in distilled water (free of RN-DN-az and AZ), and stored
      at -20 ° C. Fragments of 16S rRNA were amplified Poland pursued
      with bacterial primers (27F; 5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3 ', 1492R;<br>
      <br>
      5 '-TG ACTG ACTGAGG YTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3'). PCR was performed in a
      volume of 20-µ1 using GeneAmp PCR System 2700 (Applied Biosystems,
      Foster City, CA) as follows: 4 min at 94 ° C, followed by 30
      cycles of 1 min at 94 ° C, 1 min at 50 ° C, and 1.5 min at 72 ° C,
      then 7 min at 72 ° C. PCR amplicons were subjected to
      electrophoresis and purification using Wizard SV Gel and PCR
      Clean-Up System (Promega, Madison, USA). Purified amplicons were
      cloned using pCR2.1 vector, culture of E. coli, as well as TA
      cloning kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's
      recommendations. From the daily culture of plasmid DNA containing
      the 16S rDNA, obtained by Mini prep spin kit (Quiagen, Crawley,
      UK). Purified plasmid DNA was sequenced on ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic
      Analyzer using Big Dye Terminator cycle-sequencing kit (Applied
      Biosystems). Amplitsitsirovannye 27F-1492R products were sequenced
      in both directions with primers 27F, 357F (5'- CTACGGGAGGCAGCAG -3
      '), 520R (5'-ACCGCGGGGTGCTGGC- 3'), 920F (5 '- AAACTC
      AAAGGAATTGACGG-3'), 1080R ( 5'- CCCAACATCTCACGAC-3 ') and 1492R as
      described Mori et al. (1997). The length of the sequence was 1488
      bp. The resulting sequence was compared with others using BLAST
      (Altschul et al., 1997). The phylogenetic tree was constructed by
      the method of Saitou and Nei (1987), using the CLUSTAL W software
      package (Thompson et al., 1994). The nucleotide sequence of 16S
      rRNA has been deposited in the DDBJ / EMBL / GeneBank under the
      number AB 178889, identification number 20040510203204.24251.<br>

      <b>2. RESULTS OF ALLOCATION, studying the growth and
        identification of microorganisms</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In Miocene deposits frozen on Mammoth mountain it was found
      cultivated bacteria capable of aerobic and anaerobic growth in the
      medium YPD, MRS and NA; optimum growth temperature is set at + 37
      ° C. The microorganism is psychrotolerant since capable of
      metabolic activity at -5 ° C. Bacillus is a relatively large ((1-
      1.5) x (3-6) microns) wand, which is connected to the culture
      circuit, and is capable of forming spores circular shape. She

      <b>REALIZATION EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>3.1. Testing flies Drosophila melanogaster</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      For the experiment were selected Drosophila melanogaster
      individuals of the same age (1 day). They were placed in tubes
      containing culture medium (5-7 ml) in 5 pairs. The sample size for
      each variant was 100 flies. The selection of individuals for the
      experiment was carried out by esterification, the victims and
      survivors of flies counted every third day. The experiment was
      carried out overnight culture Bacillus sp. MZ grown on meat-broth.
      In test tube culture was added in the amount of 20 l. The
      experiment included a control variant in which the flies were kept
      on a medium supplemented with yeast; and experienced embodiment,
      when the first 5 days of flies were kept on a medium with the
      addition of yeast, then one day in an environment with bacillus
      (alternating entire observation period). To determine the
      fertility of selected Virginia flies the day of departure. Males
      and females were placed separately and held 5 days when they reach
      maximum fertility. Then the tubes were placed in pairs with
      removable lids. The bottom lids poured agar-agar with the addition
      of sugar confectionery. Accounting fertility conducted daily for 6
      days. We consider the number of eggs laid, and a day determined by
      the number undeveloped eggs.<br>
      <br>
      When adding nutrient medium to the surface 75 of the strain
      Bacillus sp. in saline solution (1 billion. cells / ml), there was
      a reduction of fertility in relation to control 5 times. The
      average fertility of the females was in control of 58,1 ± 8,61
      pcs., In a test version this value is 10,2 ± 3,44 units. When
      adding the bacterial culture after incubation flies for yeast,
      despite destruction of flies in the control experiment and after
      50 days, it was observed excess proportion surviving flies from 24
      to 42 th day of the experiment compared to the control (FIG. 1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>3.2.Testirovanie on laboratory mice</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Preparation of the bacterial culture test was conducted in a
      similar manner on fruit flies; used daily culture Bacillus sp.,
      but it was carried out before the introduction of freezing and
      thawing. Experiments were performed on CBA mice Fl / V1ask-6, an
      average of 15 animals in each group. In the first series of
      experiments investigated the effect of doses culture parameters of
      the immune system of young animals (aged 3-4 months). The two
      control groups of animals were used, one of which was intact,
      while the second group was treated with saline. Bacterial culture
      Bacillus sp. intraperitoneally administered to the animals once
      5000; 50000; 500,000; 5 000 000 and 50 million microbial bodies
      (bw) per animal. In a second series of experiments evaluated the
      effect of the bacterial culture on the physiological and
      behavioral responses of "older" mice (17 months), the culture was
      administered once intraperitoneally in the dose of 5000 bw The
      control group was represented by animals of the same age.
      Euthanasia of animals held by cervical dislocation. Evaluated
      according to standard procedures morphophysiological thymus and
      spleen activity on the index body (body weight ratio to body
      weight,%), nonspecific activity factors immunoresistance in the
      level of phagocytic (FI%) and metabolic (NBT-test,%) of splenic
      macrophage activity, cellular immunity DTH reaction in vivo, the
      activity of humoral immunity by the number of antibody-forming
      cells (AFC) in one million nucleated cells in the spleen, muscle
      strength test animals in cargo lifting, behavioral reactions in
      the test "Open Field" and lifespan.<br>
      <br>
      It was found that Bacillus sp. at a dose of 5000 microbial bodies
      increases the index of thymus and spleen. Culture bacilli in the
      low dose (5,000 MT) promote and, in moderate doses (500,000 and
      5,000,000 MT) - inhibit the phagocytic activity of splenic
      macrophages. Culture bacilli Bacillus sp. almost all doses
      increases the activity of the humoral immunity, and a dose of 5000
      bw increases the functional activity and cellular and humoral
      immunity.<br>
      <br>
      In this regard, for investigation on the influence of culture
      longevity dose was chosen in 5000 bw The minimum lifespan of mice
      in the control group was 589 days, and the maximum - 833 days. The
      minimum lifespan of mice from the experimental group was 836 days,
      and the maximum - 897 (FIG. 2). Body weight in the treated group
      was higher than in control animals after 2 months after
      administration of the culture. Muscle strength increased in the
      experimental animals (60%) relative to their peers in the control
      group. On increasing the ability of the animals to the orientation
      in space and research activity indicating more frequent visits to
      their domestic sectors open field, increasing the number of
      vertical posts and visiting mink. Apparently, the bacterial
      culture at parenteral administration stimulates the immune system
      and improves the emotional stability of laboratory animals.
      Increased life span of mice testifies to the possible presence in
      the culture of Bacillus sp. geroprotectors.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the strain was investigated as immunomodulators
      biocorrectors capable of launching an innate immune response in
      animal models. Activation of immunity was investigated in the
      experiments of metabolic change in macrophage activity, levels of
      interferon-gamma (IFN-?), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) and
      nonspecific cytotoxic effects of T-lymphocyte cells under the
      action of Bacillus sp., Introduced into mice C57B1 / 6 . It is
      found that intraperitoneal injection of the strain in the dose
      range 5 000 - 5 000 000 m. M. To animals leads to a dose-dependent
      activation of metabolism intraperitoneal macrophages, assessed by
      the level of reactive intermediates of aerobic metabolism (ROIs)
      by more than 2 times. A single intraperitoneal injection at a dose
      of 5000 MT lead to increased levels of IFN-? by 2.6 times, and
      also contribute to a significant reduction in TNF-a (FIG. 3). The
      cytotoxic effect of T-lymphocytes obtained from the spleen of
      animals after injection Bacillus sp., Was studied in vitro against
      mouse lymphosarcoma cells RLS. It is found that reliable
      activation of unspecific T lymphocyte clones occurs at a dose of 5
      OOO OOO bw, wherein the cytotoxic effect of T-cell lymphocytes
      against lymphosarcoma was 1.8 times higher than their action
      without activating the strain. Thus, increased metabolism of
      macrophages, increasing interferon-gamma, decreased tumor necrosis
      factor and activation of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes acts under the
      action of Bacillus sp. indicates activation of innate immunity in
      laboratory animals and pronounced immunomodulatory properties of
      the strain Bacillus sp. <br>
