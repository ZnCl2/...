      This invention converts inertial impulses into electric currents.
      Specifically, it converts impulses created by the impacts of
      high-energy particles from the Sun and other cosmic sources into
      the Earth's Magnetosphere and the varying D, E, F1 and F2 layers
      of its Ionosphere to controlled electric currents. This invention
      presents a new method of utilizing energy from the Sun and other
      sources of high energy articles as a virtually, inexhaustible,
      alternative-energy source for the world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0001] 1. Field of Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] This invention relates to the conversion of impact energies
      created by the collision of high-speed cosmic particles and
      electromagnetic radiations with "Earth's Outer Layers" to produce
      inertial waves in the dielectric Troposphere which are
      subsequently converted into electricity by this invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The term "Earth's Outer Layers" refers to: Earth's
      Magnetosphere, Van Allen Belts, Ionosphere, Mesosphere, and
      Stratosphere as illustrated in FIG. 2<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] One day while reading an old scientific magazine I saw a
      small article on the research of Dr. John Trump of MIT (the basis
      for an electrostatic generator patented later by <b>Onezime P.
        Breaux in U.S. Pat. No. 4,127,804</b>). The article talked about
      a series of experiments which Dr. Trump had performed with a
      2-plate, capacitor in a vacuum dielectric. Briefly, he discovered
      that by varying the distance between the two plates one could
      produce current flows in one direction or the other between either
      of the plates and ground.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The Solar Wind strikes "Earth's Outer Layers" constantly as
      do many other cosmic particles. At any given instant of time, the
      vector product of these impacts produces either a net pressure
      increase or decrease in the Troposphere. This creates random waves
      of pressure in the "Earth's Outer Layers" as one charged "plate"
      moves in relation to the oppositely-charged Earth's surface as the
      other "plate". This variation of pressure in the "Earth's Outer
      Layers" is equivalent to moving an outer "plate" back and forth
      toward the Troposphere and the Earth's surface as the inner
      "plate"-thus giving rise to variations in voltage on both
      "plates". In this case the Troposphere (see FIG. 2) acts as the
      dielectric medium instead of the vacuum in the Trump experiments.
      Furthermore, the Troposphere, itself, is also compressed and
      decompressed by these random waves of pressure on the "Earth's
      Outer Layers". Thus, I reasoned if one could create a charged
      envelope or field of sufficient voltage within the Troposphere,
      one could convert these random pressure waves in the dielectric
      Troposphere into current flow on the Earth's surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] As "Earth's Outer Layers" surround the planet, any impact
      waves propagate throughout all of them when they are present-even
      to the nighttime side of the planet. Thus, I also reasoned one
      could extract power from these impacts anywhere on Earth's surface
      or in its atmosphere whether it be day or night. The pressure
      waves on the dark side of Earth would be less energetic than those
      occurring on the daytime side because the nighttime layers of the
      Ionosphere are compressed so much that the D-Layer of the
      Ionosphere disappears at night and the F1 and F2-Layers of the
      Ionosphere combine into one F-Layer. I calculated the available
      energy from these impact waves would be significantly less by
      30-45% depending upon one's location on the night side of the
      planet in respect to the terminator.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Many years ago around 1900 Dr Nikola Tesla built and tested
      a device to extract energy from the Sun using an apparatus which
      forms part of my own invention (see <b>U.S. Pat. Nos. 685,957</b>
      and <b>685,958</b> dated 5 Nov. 1901).<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Subsequently, Dr. Thomas Henry Moray, another inventor and
      student of these Tesla patents made a device which apparently
      accessed the same source of energy but with a method different
      than my own. As Dr. Moray was never granted a patent for his
      device I cannot be certain that his work is considered prior art
      but I list it here as part of my due diligence. Apparently, he had
      trouble explaining the source of energy his device was converting
      to the patent reviewer and was, thus, not granted a patent for his
      impressive work. Dr. Moray's public disclosure of certain aspects
      of his invention are public knowledge through his published
      lectures and his book, "The Sea of Energy in Which the Earth
      Floats'-published in 1931.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Since the beginning of the 20th Century mankind has been
      looking for new sources of electric power to feed the
      ever-increasing energy demands of the human population. In the
      last half of the 19th Century coal, whale oil, human and animal
      labor, moving water, wind and wood were main sources of energy.
      However, in the first quarter of the 20th Century mankind began to
      use more electricity produced by hydroelectric generators and
      other generators producing electricity by combustion of fossil
      fuels. With increasing use of gasoline engines and the increasing
      use of electrical appliances the demand for electricity
      accelerated the addition of heat and greenhouse gases into the
      Earth's ecosystem.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In the last half of the 20th Century many forward-thinking
      individuals began looking for alternate energy sources to reduce
      the emissions of greenhouse gases. All of the alternate energy
      systems investigated and/or developed in the last 56 years have
      had significant drawbacks to their usage as the main energy supply
      for the needs of humanity.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Some of those alternate energy systems were nowhere near as
      efficient as the existing systems. Some of the alternate energy
      systems still introduced extra heat into the environment like the
      existing fossil fuel and nuclear energy systems. And, yet, others
      produced even more greenhouse gases than the existing energy
      systems. Some of the new systems used food resources to produce
      combustible fuels which, consequently, reduced the food resources
      of the planet. Among the leaders in the new energy sources was and
      is nuclear energy which produces extra heat, toxic wastes and
      materials which can be used in nuclear weapons. Hydroelectric
      energy sources do not add heat to the ecosystem but they are not
      an inexhaustible resource as they depend upon rainfall which is
      diminishing as global warming increases. Wind energy resources do
      not add heat to the ecosystem but they are not constant and
      require expensive conversion and storage equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The ideal energy source for mankind will not add heat to
      the planet's ecosystem, will not produce by-product green house
      gases; will not deplete our food and water resources; will not
      produce toxic wastes; however, it will be portable,
      self-replenishing and constantly available in real time anywhere
      on Earth and in useful quantities.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Our major source of natural energy on Earth is the Sun.
      Energy from the Sun enters the Earth's ecosphere by particle
      bombardment, radiated electromagnetic energy, gravitational
      variations and magnetic processes. Mankind has developed various
      methods of capturing energy from the Sun already. Silicon-based
      solar cells convert light in a narrow bandwidth into electron
      flows. These cells are-at most-only 50% efficient and only work
      when the Sun is shining on them and at an optimum angle. Wind
      turbines only work when there is wind to power them and are-for
      the most part-not portable. Devices to convert wave action in the
      oceans only work when there are waves created by the wind and
      tidal effects caused by gravitational variations; and they are not
      portable enough to be used in common transportation devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] I concluded if mankind could find an inexpensive method of
      obtaining electricity from the Sun in some form that worked both
      day and night and which was already flowing into the Earth's
      ecosystem, we might be able to develop a clean and
      self-replenishing energy source which would add no extra heat to
      our ecosystem, would not alter our planetary albedo and might well
      be made in a portable form.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0016] The Harmonic Energy Exchange Device (or "HEED") offers an
      interim solution to Earth's dwindling fossil fuel resources. It
      utilizes a previously untapped energy resource which exists
      throughout the known Universe. By the very nature of the
      invention, it only interrupts the flow of energy from the Sun and
      all the other cosmic sources of high-energy particles on their
      normal journey to the Earth by way of The Outer Layers.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The invention does not add energy to the normal
      thermodynamic equilibrium of the planet and its associated outer
      layers. The invention does not produce wastes-toxic or otherwise.
      It does not produce harmful gases; and in some embodiments it
      could even assist in the rebuilding of our thinning ozone shield.
      Use of this invention will eventually remove mankind's dependence
      on fossil fuels and create new occupations. It will be cheap
      enough that homeowners will be able to install their own HEED and
      sell back energy to the grid until such time as every home has
      their own HEED and civilization has completely weaned itself from
      the use of fossil fuels and nuclear energy in its current form.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE
        INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0021] Be it known that I, Harold Stanley Deyo, Jr, a citizen of
      both The United States of America and The Commonwealth of
      Australia, residing in the community of Pueblo West in Pueblo
      County, Colorado have invented an Harmonic Energy Exchange Device
      which converts dynamic pressures in the ambient media around Earth
      to controlled electric currents.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] This invention as represented in FIG. 1 is unique in that
      it is designed to extract electricity from random pressure waves
      propagated in the Troposphere 14 by impacts of the solar wind and
      other cosmic particles with the Earth's "The Outer Layers" 22 of
      FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In FIG. 1, the Troposphere 14 in its rest state is
      represented by the line of "+" marks 14. The convergent or
      compression state 12 of the random waves in the Troposphere 14 is
      represented by the lower line of dots while the divergent or
      decompression state 13 of the random waves in the Troposphere 14
      is represented by the upper line of dots. The preferred embodiment
      of my invention FIG. 1 is a method of coupling a parallel,
      resonant, electrical circuit to these random pressure waves to
      extract electricity from them.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As Dr John Trump's research and Onezime P. Breaux's U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,127,804 show, when one plate of a charged capacitor is
      moved closer to or farther from the other plate of that capacitor
      a voltage change appears on both plates of that capacitor.
      Furthermore, the electric field gradient between those plates
      changes as the plates are moved in this manner. Thus they have
      described a method of converting mechanical energy into electrical
      current by simply varying the plate spacing over time which can be
      expressed as ds/dt where "ds" is the change in spacing and "dt" is
      the change in time.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] As illustrated in FIG. 2, The Outer Layers can be viewed as
      one plate of a capacitor comprised of the Earth's surface itself
      as one plate 21 and Earth's outer layers as the other plate 22
      where the Earth's Troposphere 23 serves as the dielectric medium
      separating the two plates. There is a charge between these plates
      which varies extremely rapidly but not with a constant period. At
      any given instant, the vector product of all the impacts by the
      cosmic particles with The Outer Layers 22 will create a pressure
      wave in The Outer Layers 22 which will manifest in the Troposphere
      23. Whatever that vector product is, it will alter the field
      gradient in the dielectric Troposphere 23. That alteration will
      either increase or decrease the effective spacing between "plates"
      22 and 23.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In order to capture and convert the resulting voltage
      variations produced at or near the Earth's surface 21 of FIG. 2,
      this invention creates its own, localized stress field 3 of FIG. 1
      established in the Troposphere 23 of FIG. 2 with a charged,
      conductive surface 1 of FIG. 1 which is encased in high-voltage
      insulation 2 of FIG. 1 and extending into the Troposphere 23 of
      FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] In FIG. 1, a series of high-voltage, starting pulses is
      applied across points 4 and 6 on opposite sides of a capacitor 5
      to create the localized stress field 3. As these high-voltage
      starting pulses are applied, the parallel resonant circuit formed
      by inductor coil 7 and variable capacitor 11 both referenced to
      ground 8 is stimulated into resonance within the bandwidth
      determined by the values of these circuit components. Tuning of
      this circuit is effected through variable capacitor 11. The high
      voltage charge on conductive surface 1 of FIG. 1 is maintained by
      the parallel tuned circuit formed by inductor coil 7 and variable
      capacitor 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Then as the random, pressure waves propagate throughout the
      Troposphere 23 of FIG. 2, the localized stress field 3 of FIG. 1
      is oscillated by the compression wave front 12 and the
      decompression wave front 13-both of FIG. 1 which creates voltage
      changes on capacitor 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In FIG. 1, the resulting voltages changes on capacitor 5
      will add energy to the parallel resonant circuit formed by
      inductor coil 7 and variable capacitor 11 which acts as a tank
      circuit to store the energy which has been passed to it. As energy
      builds in the parallel circuit the voltage of the circuit rises
      until a spark discharge occurs across the gap 9 also referenced to
      ground 8. The current will only discharge in one direction as
      determined by diode 10. The circuit will work without diode 10 but
      a diode is used here as one method to keep from draining all the
      energy from the tank circuit when a discharge occurs.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] This resonant circuit can be tuned to various bandwidths to
      maximize the efficiency of the conversion process depending upon
      location of the device, time of day, temperature variations,
      relative humidity and other variables in the ambient Troposphere
      23 of FIG. 2 around the conductive surface 1 of FIG. 1. A
      resistive load to extract power from the resonant circuit can be
      used instead of the spark gap 9 of FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] This preferred embodiment uses a parallel, tuned circuit to
      access a wide range of frequencies usually to be found in the
      range of 4.5 to 7 MHz. This range encompasses the major,
      naturally-occurring, resonant frequencies found in the ionosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] A second embodiment of this invention as shown in FIG. 3
      replaces the parallel tuned circuit formed by inductor coil 7 and
      variable capacitor 11 in FIG. 1 placed in parallel to each other
      and referenced to ground 8 in FIG. 1. This second embodiment forms
      a series tuned circuit formed by inductor coil 7 and variable
      capacitor 11 in FIG. 3 placed in series to each other and
      referenced to ground 8 of FIG. 3. It differs from the preferred
      embodiment only in the placement of variable capacitor 11 of FIG.
      3 so that it is in series with coil 7 of FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] This embodiment limits the frequency range and, hence, the
      energy the system will store when compared to the preferred
      embodiment. It produces higher voltages across the spark gap 9 of
      FIG. 3 than those produced in the preferred embodiment across the
      spark gap 9 of FIG. 1.<br>

      Two inversely ganged variable capacitors having a common movable
      element varying the capacities such that when one capacitor is at
      maximum capacitance, the other is at minimum capacitance, have,
      after initially charging, a substantially constant contained or
      trapped charge distributed between the two capacitors. As the
      capacities of the capacitors are varied, a potential difference is
      developed between the fixed plate of one capacitor and the fixed
      plate of the other. When these two potential points are connected
      to a load, charge is transferred from one capacitor to the other
      as a current flow through the load. The total charge is not
      diminished, the energy supplied the load being the energy expanded
      on moving the movable charged plates. As the movable plates are
      moved in a cyclic manner an alternating current is provided to the
      load.<br>

      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The field of the invention is in electrostatic machines.<br>
      <br>
      Electrostatic machines have been well known for many years. The
      Toepler-Holtz and the Wimshurst machines were early electrostatic
      generators. Now their usage is mainly for demonstrations in the
      Physics Laboratory. The only remaining electrostatic machine to
      remain in extensive usage is the Van de Graaff type electrostatic
      generator. It is presently used to generate extremely high voltage
      potentials for atomic research. Substantially all of the prior art
      devices are direct current type machines.<br>

        <b>Apparatus for the Utilization of Radiant Energy</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Nikola Tesla</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;It is well known that certain radiations such as those of
      ultra-violet light, cathodic, Roentgen rays, or the like possess
      the property of charging and discharging conductors of
      electricity, the discharge being particularly noticeable when the
      conductor upon which the rays impinge is negatively electrified.
      These radiations are generally considered to be ether vibrations
      of extremely small wave lengths, and in explanation of the
      phenomena noted it has been assumed by some authorities that they
      ionize or render conducting the atmosphere through which they are
      propagated. My own experiments and observations, however, lead me
      to conclusions more in accord with the theory heretofore advanced
      by me that sources of such radiant energy throw off with great
      velocity minute particles of matter which are strongly
      electrified, and therefore capable of charging an electrical
      conductor, even if not so, may at any rate discharge an
      electrified conductor either by carrying off bodily its charge or
      otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      My present application is based upon a discovery which I have made
      that when rays or radiations of the above kind are permitted to
      fall upon an insulated conducting-body connected to one of the
      terminals of a condenser while the other terminal of the same is
      made by independent means to receive or to carry away electricity
      a current flows into the condenser so long as the insulated body
      is exposed to the rays, and under the conditions
      hereinafter-specified an indefinite accumulation of electrical
      energy in the condenser takes place. This energy after a suitable
      time interval, during which the rays are allowed to act, may
      manifest itself in a powerful discharge, which maybe utilized for
      the operation or control of mechanical or electrical devices or
      rendered useful in many other ways.<br>
      <br>
      In applying my discovery I provide a condenser, preferably of
      considerable electrostatic capacity, and connect one of its
      terminals to an insulated metal plate or other conducting-body
      exposed to the rays or streams of radiant matter.<br>
      <br>
      It is very important, particularly in view of the fact that
      electrical energy is generally supplied at a very slow rate to the
      condenser, to construct the same I use, by preference, the best
      quality of mica as dielectric, taking every possible precaution in
      insulating the armatures, so that the instrument may withstand
      great electrical pressures without leaking and may leave no
      perceptible electrification when discharging instantaneously. In
      practice I have found that the best results are obtained with
      condensers treated in the manner described in a patent granted to
      me February 23,1897, No. 577,671. Obviously the above precautions
      should be the more rigorously observed the slower the rate of
      charging and the smaller the time interval during which the energy
      is allowed to accumulate in the condenser. The insulated plate or
      conducting-body should present as large a surface as practicable
      to the rays or streams of matter, having ascertained that the
      amount of energy conveyed to it per unit of time is under
      otherwise identical conditions proportionate to the area exposed,
      or nearly so. Furthermore, the surface should be clean and
      preferably highly polished or amalgamated. The second terminal or
      armature of the condenser may be connected to one of the poles to
      any conducting body or object whatever of such properties or so
      conditioned that by its means electricity of the required sign
      will be supplied to the terminal. A simple way of of a battery or
      other source of electricity generally convey a positive charge to
      the first condenser-terminal, which is connected to the plate or
      conductor above mentioned, I usually connect the second terminal
      of the condenser to the ground, this being the most convenient Way
      of obtaining negative electricity, dispensing with the necessity
      of providing an artificial source. In order to utilize for any
      useful purpose the energy accumulated in the condenser, I
      furthermore connect to the terminals of the same circuit including
      an instrument or apparatus which it is desired to operate and
      another instrument or device for alternately closing and opening
      the circuit. This latter may be any form of circuit-controller,
      with fixed or movable parts or electrodes, which may be actuated
      either by the stored energy or by independent means,<br>
      <br>
      My discovery will be more fully understood from the following
      description and annexed drawings, to which reference is now made,
      and in which Figure 1 is a diagram showing the general arrangement
      of apparatus as usually employed. Fig. 2 is a similar diagram
      illustrating more in detail typical forms of the devices or
      elements used in practice, and Figs. 3 and are diagrammatical
      representations of modified arrangements suitable for special
      purposes.<br>

      <br>
      As illustrative of the manner in which the several parts or
      elements of the apparatus in one of its simplest forms are to be
      arranged and connected for useful operation, reference is made to
      Fig. 1, in which 0 is the condenser, P the insulated plate or
      conducting-body which is exposed to the rays, and P another plate
      or conductor which is grounded, all being joined in series, as
      shown. The terminals T of the condenser are also connected to a
      circuit which includes a device R to be operated and a
      circuit-controlling device d of the character above referred to.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus being arranged as shown, it will be found that when
      the radiations of the sun or of any other source capable of
      producing the effects before described fall upon the plate P an
      accumulation of electrical energy in the condenser C will result.
      This phenomenon, I believe, is best explained as follows: The sun,
      as well as other sources of radiant energy, throws off minute
      particles of matter positively electrified,which,impinging upon
      the plate P, communicate continuously an electrical charge to the
      same. The opposite terminal of the condenser being connected to
      the ground, which may be considered as a vast reservoir of
      negative electricity, a feeble current flows continuously into the
      condenser, and inasmuch as these supposed particles are of an
      inconceivably small radius or curvature, and consequently charged
      to a relatively very high potential, this charging of the
      condenser may continue, as I have actually observed, almost
      indefinitely, even to the point of rupturing the dielectric. If
      the device be of such character that it will operate to close the
      circuit in which it is included when the potential in the
      condenser has reached a certain magnitude, the accumulated charge
      will pass through the circuit, which also includes the receiver R,
      and operate the latter.<br>
      <br>
      In illustration of a particular form of apparatus which may be
      used in carrying out my discovery I now refer to Fig. 2. In this
      figure, which in the general arrangement of the elements is
      identical to Fig. 1, the device at is shown as composed of two
      very thin conducting-plates 2ft, placed in close proximity and
      very mobile, either by reason of extreme flexibility or owing to
      the character of their support. To improve their action,they
      should be inclosed in a receptacle, from which the air may be
      exhausted. The plates 25 are connected in series with a working
      circuit, including a suitable receiver, which in this case is
      shown as consisting of an electromagnet M, a movable armature a, a
      retractile spring, and a ratchet-wheel 10, provided with a
      spring-pawl 1 which is pivoted to armature a, as illustrated. When
      the radiations of the sun or other radiant source fall upon plate
      P, a current flows into the condenser, as above explained, until
      the potential therein rises sufficiently to attract and bring into
      contact the two plates 25 t, and thereby close the circuit
      connected to the two condenser-terminals. This permits a fiow of
      current which energizes the magnet M, causing it to draw down the
      armature a and impart a partial rotation to the ratchet-Wheel to.
      As the current ceases the armature is retracted by the spring,
      without, however, moving the wheel. With the stoppage of the
      current the plates t t cease to be attracted and separate, thus
      restoring the circuit to its original condition.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 shows a modified form of apparatus used in connection with
      an artificial source of radiant energy, which in this instance may
      be an arc emitting copiously ultra-violet rays. A suitable
      reflector may be provided for concentrating and directing the
      radiations. A magnet and circuit-controller d are arranged as in
      the previous figures; but in the present case the former instead
      of performing itself the whole work only serves the purpose of
      alternately opening and closing a local circuit, containing a
      source of current B and a receiving or translating device D. The
      controller, if desired, may consist of two fixed electrodes
      separated by a minute air gap or weak dielectric film, which
      breaks down more or less suddenly when a definite difference of
      potential is reached at the terminals of the condenser and returns
      to its original state upon the passage of the discharge.<br>
      <br>
      Still another modification is shown in Fig. 4, in which the source
      S of radiant energy is a special form of Roentgen tube, having but
      one terminal 70, generally of aluminium, in the form of half a
      sphere,with a plain polished surface on the front side, from which
      the streams are thrown off. It may be excited by attaching it to
      one of the terminals of any generator of sufficiently high
      electromotive force; but whatever apparatus be used it is
      important that the tube be exhausted to a high degree, as
      otherwise it might prove entirely ineffective. The working or
      discharge circuit connected to the terminals T T of the condenser
      includes in this case the primary 19 of a transformer and a
      circuit controller comprising a fixed terminal or brush t and a
      movable terminal 25 in the shape of a wheel, with conducting and
      insulating segments, which may be rotated at an arbitrary speed by
      any suitable means. In inductive relation to the primary wire or
      coil 19 is a secondary s, usually of a much greater number of
      turns, to the ends of which is connected a receiver R. The
      terminals of the condenser being connected, as indicated, one to
      an insulated plate P and the other to a grounded plate P, when the
      tube S is excited rays or streams of matter are emitted from the
      same, which convey a positive charge to the plate P and
      condenser-terminal T, while terminal T is continuously receiving
      negative electricity from the plate P. This, as before explained,
      results in an accumulation of electrical energy in the condenser,
      which goes on as long as the circuit including the cult is closed
      owing to the rotation of the terminal t, the stored energy is
      discharged through the primary 19, this giving rise in the energy,
      comprising in combination, a condenser, secondaries to induced
      currents, which oper ate the receiver R.<br>
      <br>
      It is clear from what has been stated above that if the terminal T
      is connected to a plate supplying positive instead of negative
      electricity the rays should convey negative electricity to plate
      P. The source S maybe any form of Roentgen or Lenard tube; but it
      is theory of action that in order to be very effective the
      electrical impulses exciting it should be wholly or at least
      preponderately of one sign. If ordinary symmetrical alternating
      currents are employed, provision should be made for allowing the
      rays to fall upon the plate P only during those periods when they
      are productive of the desired result. Evidently if the radiations
      of the source be stopped or intercepted or their intensity varied
      in any manner,as by periodically interrupting or rhythmically
      varying the current exciting the source, there will be
      corresponding changes in the action upon the receiver R, and thus
      signals may be transmitted and will respond to or be set in
      operation when a predetermined amount of energy is stored in the
      condenser may be used in lieu of the device specifically described
      with reference to Fig. 2<br>

      or object whatever of such properties or so conditioned that by
      its means electricity of the required sign will be supplied to the
      terminal. A simple way of supplying positive or negative
      electricity toy the terminal is to connect the same either to an
      insulated conductor, supported at some height in the atmosphere,
      or to a grounded conductor, the former, as is well known,
      furnishing positive and the latter negative electricity. As the
      rays or supposed streams of matter generally convey a positive
      charge to the first condenser-terminal,which is connected to the

      terminal of the condenser to the ground, this being the most
      convenient Way of obtaining negative electricity, dispensing with

      The rays or radiations which are to be utilized for the operation

      from a natural source, as the sun, or may be artificially produced
      by such means, for example, as an arc-lamp, a Roentgen tube, and

      of the devices or elements as arranged and connected in applying
      the method for the operation of a mechanical contrivance or
      instrument solely by the energy stored; and Fig. 2 is a
      diagrammatical representation of a modified arrangement suitable
      for special purposes, with a circuit-controller actuated by

      <br>
      Referring to Fig. l, O is the condenser, P the insulated plate or
      conducting body, which is exposed to the rays, and P another plate
      or conductor, all being joined in series,as shown. The terminals T
      T of the condenser are also connected to a circuit including a
      receiver R, which is to be operated, and a circuit-controlling
      device which in this case is composed of two very thin conducting
      plates t t', placed in close proximity and very mobile, either by
      reason of extreme flexibility or owing to the charater of their
      support. To improve their action, they should be inclosed in a
      receptacle from which the air may be exhausted. The receiver R is
      shown as consisting of an electromagnet M, a movable armature a, a
      retractile spring b, and a ratchet-wheel w, provided with a
      spring-pawl r, which is pivoted to armature a, as illustrated. The
      apparatus being arranged as shown, it will be found that when the
      radiations of the sun or of any other source capable of producing
      the effects before described fall upon the plate P an accumulation
      of electrical energy in the condenser C will result. <br>
      <br>
      This phenomenon, I believe, is best explained as follows: The sun
      as well as other sources of radiant energy throw off minute
      particles of matter positively electrified, which, impinging upon
      the plate P, communicate an electrical charge to the same. The
      opposite terminal of the condenser being connected to the ground,
      which may be considered as a vast reservoir of negative
      electricity, a feeble current flows continuously into the
      condenser, and inasmuch as these supposed particles are of an
      inconceivably small radius or curvature, and consequently charged
      to a relatively very high potential, this charging of the
      condenser may continue, as I have found in practice, almost
      indefinitely, even to the point of rupturing the dielectric.
      Obviously whatever circuit controller be employed it should
      operate to close the circuit in which it is included. Thus in Fig.
      when the electrical pressure at the terminals T T' rises to a
      certain predetermined value the plates t t', attracting each
      other, close the circuit connected to the terminals. This permits
      a flow of current which energizes the magnet M, causing it to draw
      down the armature a and impart a partial rotation to the
      ratchet-wheel w. As the current ceases the armature is-retracted
      by the spring b without, however, moving the wheel w. With the
      stoppage of the current the condenser has reached the desired
      magnification the plates t t" cease to be attracted and separate,
      thus restoring the circuit to its original condition.<br>
      <br>
      Many useful applications of this method of utilizing the
      radiations emanating from the sun or other source and many ways of
      carrying out the same will at once suggest themselves from the
      above description. By way of illustration a modified arrangement
      is shown in Fig. 2, in which the source S of radiant energy is a
      special form of Roentgen tube devised by me having but one
      terminal k, generally of aluminium, in the form of half a sphere
      with a plain polished surface on the front side, from which the
      streams are thrown. It may be excited by attaching it to one of
      the terminals of any generator of sufficiently high electromotive
      force; but whatever apparatus be used it is important that the
      tube be exhausted to a high degree, as otherwise it might prove
      entirely ineffective. The working or discharge circuit connected
      to the terminals T T of the condenser includes in this case the
      primary p of a transformer and a circuit-controller comprising a
      fixed terminal or brush t and a movable terminal t' in the shape
      of a wheel with conducting and insulating segments which may be
      rotated at an arbitrary speed by any suitable means. In inductive
      relation to the primary wire or coil p is a secondary s, usually
      of a much greater number of turns, to the ends of which is
      connected a receiver R. The terminals of the condenser being
      connected as indicated, one to an insulated plate P and the other
      to a grounded plate P', when the tube S is excited rays or streams
      of matter are emitted from the same, which convey a positive
      charge to the plate P and condenser terminal T, while terminal T'
      is continuously receiving negative electricity from the plate P'.
      This, as before explained, results in an accumulation of
      electrical energy in the condenser, which goes on as long as the
      circuit including the primary p is interrupted. Whenever the
      circuit is closed, owing to the rotation of the terminal t', the
      stored energy is discharged through the primary p, this giving
      rise in the secondary s to induced currents which operate the
      receiver R. It is clear from what has been stated above that if
      the terminal T is connected to a plate supplying positive instead
      of negative electricity the rays should convey negative
      electricity to plate P. The source S may be any form of Roentgen
      or Lenard tube; but it is obvious from the theory of action that
      in order to be very effective the electrical impulses exciting it
      should be wholly or at least preponderatingly of one sign. If
      ordinary symmetrical alternating currents are employed, provision
      should be made for allowing the rays to fall upon the plate P-
      only during those periods when they are productive of the desired
      result. Evidently if the radiations of the source be stopped or
      intercepted or their intensity varied in any manner, as by
      periodically interrupting or rhythmically varying the current
      exciting the source, there will be corresponding changes in the
      action upon the receiver R, and thus signals may be transmitted
      and many other useful effects produced. Furthermore,it will be
      understood that any form of circuit-closer which will respond to
      or be set in operation when a predetermined amount of energy is
      stored in the condenser may be used in lieu of the device
      specifically described with reference to Fig. l, and also that the
      special details of construction and arrangement of the several
      parts of the apparatus maybe very greatly varied without departure
      from the invention. <br>

      My test results for 2 months on the basic concept. Special thanks
      to all those who pushed forward towards harnessing natural
      (radiant) energy. YouTube squashed my first release of this video
      after getting almost 6k views, a bunch of likes and comments after
      only 5 days... guess YouTube doesn't like anyone posting stuff
      about this lost patent... <br>
