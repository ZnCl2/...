      For soon 20 years when electroculture is extended from the
      laboratory to enter the practice, the results obtained each year
      since this epoch, have shown the triumphal running of this large
      progress.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the apparatus represented here is a larger power of
      collecting of the electromagnetic forces of the nature, so that
      used with the fertilization of the ground, the results obtained in
      electroculture are further increased.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the invention was given as
      example in the annexed drawings which show: . 1, a view in end of
      the apparatus South side; . 2, a view in elevation; . 3, a plan
      view.<br>
      <br>
      In these figures the same letters of references indicate the same
      portions always. The apparatus is consisted a cast iron A part, in
      the shape of elongated, supporting magnet on its walls a certain
      number of fins C. It is finished Sud side in the shape of tip B,
      this to facilitate the collecting of the terrestrial magnetism
      moving the South one with the North one always. The fins come from
      cast iron with the body of the apparatus. At the base of the
      apparatus, between the 2 poles of part A in form of magnet, pass a
      metal ranging D, maintained at an equal distance from the 2 poles
      of the magnet, by an insulating part E, held by small bars I
      coming of cast iron with the body of the apparatus. - This metal
      ranging follows the apparatus in all its length and is bent; to
      pass in an opening G, spared in the flange of the apparatus where
      it is bolted.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the apparatus is the following one: The apparatus
      is hidden in the earth with one depth such as it cannot be reached
      more by the passage of the ploughing implements. It is rigorously
      directed magnetic SudNord, the tip B with South, in order to
      collect the magnetic currents which move the South one to the
      North one. As soon covered with earth, the negative electricity
      whose sphere is loaded precipitates on the apparatus. The fins C
      are used then as antennas to attract the electricity of the earth
      to mass A and as the experiment showed that the larger the contact
      of the apparatus with the earth was, larger was its capacity of
      collecting, the fins are thus surfaces intended to increase the
      contact of the apparatus with the earth.<br>
      <br>
      They play also another role. When a soft iron bar is placed in the
      direction of the needle of the compass, it is as soon traversed by
      a current. All the fins being on the apparatus are thus traversed
      by this current which comes to already join the body of the loaded
      apparatus of the negative electricity of the ground. Mass A thus
      becomes a formidable loaded magnet of negative electricity of the
      earth. When the apparatus is in place, the two poles into low, one
      of the fins is placed on the top of the apparatus aiming at the
      vertical currents of the atmosphere which are attracted by
      induction with the formed mass by the apparatus. The purpose of
      the fins which are in the East and the West of the apparatus are
      collecting of the earth currents. So that the circuit is not
      closed between the 2 poles of the apparatus, a metal ranging D,
      pass between these 2 poles, maintained by an insulating part E,
      collects of it the energy and brings it to the head of the
      apparatus Nord side, where it taken and is bolted in an opening G,
      in such way that all the negative of earth and positive energy of
      the atmosphere, being able to be collected by the apparatus,
      arrives at the end of the stem D from where it escapes from the
      apparatus by a driver H which will distribute it in the cultivated
      basement.<br>
      The forms, dimensions and materials employed for the construction
      of the apparatus susdécrit, can vary without changing into
      anything the object of the invention.<br>

      After exposed electricity of the nature, and especially since the
      biologists showed us that the ground was something of living, of
      many seekers thought of increasing the microbial life of the
      ground, while attracting, on the part where one wished to increase
      the vegetation, the electricity of the nature, source of life of
      all that lives on the earth, knowing that where the electricity
      would be attracted and concentrated, there would be more life,
      consequently an increase of the vegetation and also an increase of
      the biological qualities of this vegetation.<br>
      <br>
      To arrive at this purpose. one built amount of slight apparatuses
      which had, to collect the electricity, to be placed on a mast
      raised with a certain height above the ground. But the presence of
      these masts in the cultivated earths, obstructed the ploughings
      considerably; in the pastures, they were inverted by cattle; and
      near the dwellings they harmed aesthetic of the properties.
      Moreover, the apparatuses raised in space, while bringing to the
      ground a large static quantity of electricity, increased it is
      true in considerable proportions the quality of the products and
      also the amount of the crops, but daN, S certain cases, for
      example for cereals the static electricity increasing the
      development of vegetal especially, it arrived that those, because
      of their size were subjects with pours.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention, concerning an apparatus
      entirely subterranean, is curing especially this disadvantage by
      removing the expensive and disgracieux masts initially, and into
      decreasing the collecting of the static electricity of the air, to
      take a larger amount of the currents of the earth concurrent to
      the increase of the crops in amount and quality, but not in the
      gigantic face; consequently removing by there the causes of pours.
      In a word, the purpose of the apparatus is increasing the crops as
      well in amount as in quality, but by a method which approaches
      more the nature, that when one will only seek the electricity with
      a certain height above the ground.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the invention was
      represented, as example, in the annexed drawings which show: . 1,
      a view in elevation of the apparatus; . 2, a view out of
      longitudinal cut; . 3, a plan view; . 4, a view out of cut
      following X there; . 5, a plan view of the apparatus in function
      under the earth with its wire distributors network.<br>
      <br>
      In these figures the same letters of references indicate the same
      portions always.<br>
      <br>
      The body of the apparatus is formed by a mass of magnetic metal A
      in the iron shape with U, finished with dimensions south by a tip
      B intended for the magnetic collecting of the currents moving
      south-north. The shape out of U is intended to reinforce these
      currents crossing the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      In order to collect the earth currents moving in general East-West
      and sometimes west-east, a magnetic metal plate C supporting on
      each side of the frayed teeth, is attached on the top of the
      apparatus, such way that all the currents of the earth attracted
      with the apparatus by its mass, will be easily collected by the
      teeth of this plate. The plate is also finished, south side, by a
      very frayed tail intended to increase the capacity of collecting
      of apparatus of the currents moving south-north magnetic.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus door on the top a series of frayed tips D attached
      in the mass, intended to collect by induction through the layer of
      earth which covers them, a small amount of positive electricity of
      the atmosphere.<br>
      North side, the apparatus ends in a way of nose E supporting a
      small opening intended to receive a bolt F to fix at the apparatus
      the wire network distributors G of the electrical forces
      collected.<br>
      <br>
      In order to give a perfect contact between conducting wire forming
      the network, a double small part H in magnetic metal is clamped
      highly, using a bolt, one against the other, imprisoning the end
      of wire in a suitable groove.<br>
      <br>
      The wire constituting the subterranean network being placed as
      well as the apparatus, in the direction of the needle of the
      compass, are traversed by the terrestrial magnetism, under the
      terms of the quite known phenomenon, that if one place a bar of
      soft iron in the direction of the needle of the compass, this bar
      is immediately traversed by the magnetic current moving
      south-north and àcquiert immediately two poles.<br>
      This network thus made up would be already capable to retain with
      the passage a large amount of the negative earth currents moving
      East-West and sometimes ouestest, very favourable with the
      vegetation, but as it will receive the small amount of positive
      electricity collected by induction by the apparatus and thrust in
      the network by the terrestrial magnetism, the positive electricity
      which will be thus distributed in the network will attract there
      more and will retain there a large part of the earth currents;
      what will have as consequence that the earth part where this
      network will function, will have accumulated the arable layer on a
      formed magnetic field by the negative electricity of the ground
      and the positive electricity of the atmosphere, there by the
      apparatus and the network.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, in the vegetal ones which will be on this terrane and
      which is used already usually as drivers between the positive
      electricity of the atmosphere and that negative of the earth, to
      and from of these two electricities will be increased in
      considerable proportions and vitality will be increased in the
      proportions where this exchange of the two electricities already
      making will be increased live all that lives on the earth. In a
      word, the subterranean apparatus and its network, support and
      increase the play of the electrical forces of the nature chairing
      already the life of vegetal not subjected to the action of the
      apparatuses.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as the electricity of the nature is the source of life
      of all that lives on the earth; the concentration of the natural
      electricity in the cultivated basement will develop to with it the
      microbial life absolutely necessary with the life of vegetal and
      their good health.<br>
      <br>
      The forms, dimensions, details and materials employed for the
      construction of the apparatus know-described, can vary without
      changing into anything the object of the invention.<br>

      The present invention has as an object an apparatus intended to
      protect the young plants against the slugs and snails which devour
      them. Moreover, this apparatus forming frame, makes it possible if
      it is wished, to sow earth seeds full and to obtain a larger speed
      of germination than in the ordinary frames and to avoid being
      obliged to replant the plant which, thus, shoot where it raised.
      This apparatus allows moreover a faster growth of the plant.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the invention was
      represented as example in the annexed drawings which show: . 1 a
      view out of cut of following apparatus AB. . a plan view of the
      apparatus. In these figures the same letters of references
      indicate the same portions always.<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus is composed of a small circular reservoir C
      intended to receive water, with an hole at the center D reserved
      for the site of the plant, either that it there or transplanted
      into outgoing of the frame, or that one sows called seed there to
      give this plant. In this last case the seeds are put in the earth
      at the center of the opening D which is covered by a small tile
      with glass pane E the purpose of which is forming frame and to
      accelerate the germination of seeds and the growth of the young
      plant. When the plant arrives at the tile of glass pane, this one
      is removed and of water is put continuously in the throat of the
      reservoir C which will be sufficiently large so that slugs or
      snails cannot pass to reach the plant and often to devour it like
      that product by wet times.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover as the apparatus is in magnetic metal and than it rests
      on the earth, it takes care rapidly of negative electricity of the
      earth, at the same time as it attracts with him the
      electromagnetic waves and other positive currents of the
      atmosphere. The plant is surrounded at its base of a formed
      magnetic field by the currents which circulate in the metal
      forming the basin which surrounds it and active its power of
      vegetation, its richness in nutrient qualities and also its
      maturity.<br>
      <br>
      It is clearly understood that forms, dimensions, details, and
      materials employed for the construction of the apparatus, can vary
      without changing the object of the invention.<br>

      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is a considerable improvement
      in the current design and the construction industry of the shoe.<br>
      <br>
      Since a large number of years, many scientists, belonging a little
      in all the countries of-world, showed that the man and the plant
      were subjected to the same laws of the nature, that one and the
      other had requirement to develop in a normal way, to be in contact
      with the forces of the nature and especially with the earth.<br>
      <br>
      The plant living out of pot and apartment, insulated of the earth,
      needs to develop in an addition of food to cure the deprivation of
      the telluric electricity and of that the flowing ambient air
      through its branches when it is in full earth.<br>
      <br>
      It is the same for the human beings, of the men deprived of
      garments and going naked feet, setting on the earth, constantly in
      contact with the forces of the nature, develop normally and
      acquire a large force with an insignificant food; whereas the
      people covering garments and locking up their feet in shoes which
      isolate them from the ground, need, to maintain their vitality, of
      a food much more abundant and much richer to compensate for the
      forces of the nature from which they are insulated by their
      garments and especially by their shoes. As the potted plant they
      are private telluric electricity, of that of the ambient air,
      which cannot circulate through their body.<br>
      <br>
      To prevent that the shoe in which the foot is locked up, isolates
      the human body from the earth, it is necessary to make cross the
      shoe by one or more small metal ranging, good conducting of the
      electricity, resting of an end on the earth and other end in
      contact with the foot locked up in the shoe.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of. the invention is given
      here, as example only, in the annexed drawing which watch: . 1, a
      view out of cut of a bead of shoe provided with one with these
      stems; . 2, a plan view of this bead.<br>
      <br>
      A bead of shoe A is crossed in all its height by a metallic screw
      B with wide head of resting foot on this screw will be put by it
      in contact with the earth, thus allowing the passage, the exchange
      and the combination, through the human body, of the telluric and
      atmospheric electricities. ! It residue of course that the number
      of these stems; is not limited, that they can be placed at one,
      unspecified place of the sour chaus- which enables them to touch
      of an end to the earth and other end the foot, and that the forms,
      dimensions, details and metals employed, can vary without changing
      the object of the invention.<br>

      Until present, to increase the growth rate of the plants and their
      maturity, one covered them with a bell out of glass or a glazed
      frame, having for purpose letting penetrate in the Inner one of
      the bell or the frame, the light and the rays of the sun, and, by
      withdrawing them from the abrupt variations of the outer
      temperature, preserve around them the atmosphere of determined
      heat by the radiation of the earth under the green surfaces neck,
      and the rays of the sun passing through the glass and heating the
      ambient air under the bells or frame.<br>
      <br>
      It is obvious that the culture of the plants under glass can
      increase the growth rate and the maturity, for the explained
      reasons higher, but with the detriment of the quality of the
      vegetal products, because these principles are in obvious
      contradiction with the laws of the nature. All the vegetal ones
      whatever they are, have sheets eL branches, all provided of
      serrations around the sheets, or small barbs, which are as many
      small sensors intended to receive on these antennas of which A
      provided nature, the forces of electrical origin to the latent
      state in the atmosphere. Gold the plants cultivated under glass,
      are completely insulated these various electrical forces to which
      from the laws of the nature quote are called to ask life, like-all
      what lives on the earth, thus that show it multiple small the year
      tend natural they are provided. In locking up the plants under
      bells or frames glass panes, these plants are, by the glass,
      insulated of the electrical forces of the nature, it who night
      enormously with the speed rise nelle of the sap in the vegetal
      ones and with their richness in nutrient qualities.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is bringing inside the bells,
      frame and mssme greenhouses, electricity of the ambient air and it
      my terrestrial gnetism.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the invention was
      represented, as exeraple, in the annexed drawings which show:<br>
      <br>
      1, a view out of cut of the apparatus has, a view one crosses of a
      simplified apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus is composed of a bell in pierced glass A of two
      holes B to his part known prioress, intend to let pass two wire
      metallic of different nature, for example an iron wire galvanized
      D and a copper C wire.<br>
      <br>
      The iron wire galvanized D is, bent with its upper part, in such
      way that it pre a tip feels towards the south one, in order to
      collect the terrestrial magnetism moving the south one with the
      north one. The copper C wire is finished in tip and is directed
      towards the sky, in order to collect by this tip, the static
      electricity of the ambient air.<br>
      <br>
      These two wire are had together with a certain distance of their
      upper end, by some towers of rolling up and a spot weld F, cross
      the bell by the holes B, and come to be inserted in the earth E
      under the bell, each one has an opposite base; the iron wire
      galvanized D at the south base of the bell, the copper G wire at
      the magnetic north base.<br>
      <br>
      As these wire are different metals, depressed in the earth they
      form a stack whose circuit is closed by the moisture of the earth,
      and as the two pals are depressed in the earth at the Intérieure
      base of the bell, one with south, 1 ' other with north, the
      circuit closing themselves by the moisture of the earth, bathes
      its ellluves constantly the roots of the called plants G has to
      grow at the center of the bell. To the product of this small
      formed stack by the two different metals, still comes to join the
      terrestrial magnetism collected by the tensioned tip D towards the
      south one, the static electricity of the ambient air collected by
      the tip eflilée of the copper C fìl tensioned towards the sky.<br>
      <br>
      Gold it is shown today that the élec- static tricity of the
      atmosphere gives to the plants a faster growth, a végé- more
      abundant tation, and the terrestrial magnetism brings an addition
      of richness to them which appears by an increase of the frue- -
      tification and an increase out of alcohol and sugar and other
      nutrient qualities revealed each time one makes the analysis of
      it.<br>
      <br>
      One can to still bring under the bell the electrical forces of the
      atmosphere, to be useful itself of only one wire H finished by two
      branches; one I turned towards the south one to collect the
      terrestrial magnetism, and the other J towards the sky to collect
      the static electricity of the ambient air, and enfoneant other end
      in the earth E under the bell, fiv. 9.<br>
      <br>

      glass, or transparent material being able tre bushing by the
      lutnière or the rays of the sun, such as frame, greenhouses, etc<br>

      SUMMARY.<br>
      <br>
      The possibility bring to the plants pushing under bells or frame,
      electrical forces of the atmosphere of which they are insulated by
      the glass or another transparent material of which one is used for
      oneself usually to cover them,<br>
      <br>
      Maybe by employing two formed stems of two different metals, one
      finished in tip directed towards the sky to collect the static
      électri- quoted of the ambient air, the other finished in
      tensioned tip towards the south one to collect the terrestrial
      magnetism moving the south one with the north one. These two stems
      joined together then together close to their upper end, cross the
      bell by two spared holes to this etfet and. are depressed in the
      earth under the bell, in such way that the circuit is closed by
      the earth and forms stack, and that the roots of the plants are
      taken in this circuit;<br>
      <br>
      Or by means of a metal ranging supporting two branches, one
      directed towards the sky, different I' towards the south one, and
      crossing the glazed surface, bells, frame, greenhouses, etc to be
      inserted then in the earth and to bring to the plants the
      electrical forces of the atmo- sphere of which they are insulated
      by the glass or another transparent material of which one
      himself-is useful usually to cover them.<br>

      Since a large number of years the phy- sicians of all the
      countries recognized that it was enough to place a soft iron bank
      in the direction of the needle of the compass, so that immediately
      this bar is bushing by the magnetic currents moving the south one
      with the north one always. II has be also proven by scientists
      belonging with all country of world, that Félectricité natural,
      not only played a considerable role in the vegetation, but still
      that this élee- tricity has the latent state in the atmosphere,
      and especially the terrestrial magnetism, were the source of life
      of all that saw on the earth, that it is for the plants, the human
      ones or the animals. It is absolutely die shown today, in a
      precise way, that a magnetic field created by a series of soft
      iron bars placed in the direction of the needle of the compass,
      put around any tre living, increases its vitality in considerable
      proportions.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is thus showing the
      application of this principle with the pondoirs and incubators.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the inven- tion was
      represented as example in the annexed drawings which show:<br>
      <br>
      Fig.i, one. view out of cut of an incubator;<br>
      <br>
      . 2, a view in elevation of the closed incubator;<br>
      <br>
      . 3, a view in elevation of the open incubator.<br>
      <br>
      The incubator is composed of a bolte A, provided on all its inner
      surface, of small soft iron bars B. In this boot are put eggs A to
      brood, and when the chicken or any other poultry, is coated on its
      eggs, one flap the cover C which is him also provided with small
      soft iron bars B, so that the chicken is entirely surrounded by
      soft iron bars, of which one their ends, finished in tip, is
      turned side of the south one, and the other on the side of north
      magnetic. Being given the orientation of the bars with which is
      provided the box to brood on all its inner surface, the chicken
      which broods thus finds entirely surrounded by these bars which,
      because of their orientation create around it a magnetic field
      which wraps it entirely, read a vitality gives which enables him
      to achieve until the end and almost without tiredness its task.
      The eggs which are also bathed by this magnetic field, make it
      possible future chicks to acquire Mrs. before their rise, a
      vitality much larger than that which they can obtain in any case
      where the chickens brood in an unspecified nest.<br>
      <br>
      The cover C east constitutes by a series of soft iron bars B go up
      on a frame. While the chicken broods and especially pendent the
      night, the cover C is undercrust on box A, and the movable wall D
      is raised, so that the boot is quite closed (. 2), so that the
      destructive rats and other animals cannot go to importune chicken,
      and same with the requirement destroying the eggs which it broods.<br>
      <br>
      When the chicken owes tre released pendent the day so that it can
      leave for Ali menter, the cover C is raised and the lowered wall D
      (. 3). It is of Mrs. when the small chicks are hatched. The wall D
      is lowered so that they can leave limps and to walk. The chicken
      and the chicks having returned again, the wall D is closed again,
      as well as the cover C.<br>
      <br>
      The explanation above watch the utility of this box for the
      incubators, but being given the advantages which one has has to
      make live the animals in the middle of a magnetic field, a series
      of boots A can tre placed the ones beside the others, and by
      removing the cover C, they will constitute a series of pondoirs of
      which the number is limited only by the requirements of the hen
      house.<br>
      <br>
      These principles can tre appli- also qués with the artificial
      incubators.<br>
      <br>
      The forms, dimensions, details and materials employed for the
      construction of the apparatus susdécrit, can vary without changing
      into anything the object of the invention.<br>

      Since exposed electricity of the nature, the man ingénié himself
      to domesticate it with his profit. The experiments made by the
      scientists of all the countries of the world showed, as the years
      were passed, that this invisible force whose they could measure
      the effectiveness, was the source of life of all that lives on the
      earth. Also many were the tests of collecting of this fluid
      mysterious to increase it around the living organisms, in order to
      increase their vitality by it, with variable successes according
      to the scientific value of the used apparatuses. The purpose of
      the present invention is to join together in the same apparatus a
      thermoelectric stack, using for its operation the changes of
      temperature, and a sensor amplifier of the electromagnetic forces
      of the nature in order to increase the vitality of any living
      organism which one can place at the center of the apparatus.<br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the invention was given as
      example in the annexed drawings which show.<br>
      <br>
      . I, a general view of this apparatus. . 2, a view of the
      apparatus in the shape of nonclosed, ready circle to receive at
      the center, the living organisms which one wishes to increase
      vitality.<br>
      <br>
      In these figures the same letters of references indicate the same
      portions always.<br>
      <br>
      This apparatus is composed of a tube A, formed by a steel wire
      rolled up in spiral.<br>
      <br>
      Inside the formed tube by these turns, is past a copper B wire,
      insulated over all its length, only stripped with the two ends in
      order to be in contact with each of the two ends of steel tube A
      where it is attached, thus forming a closed circuit. In this steel
      tube A is also locked up a wire of soft iron C, also insulated
      over all its length, except at the two ends.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the apparatus is the following one:<br>
      <br>
      The electricity of the atmosphere is attracted by the whole of the
      apparatus which forms magnetic mass and its power is increased by
      its passage in the steel A wire rolled up in spiral, which becomes
      for this cause a sensor and an amplifier of the electromagnetic
      forces, atmospheric electricity.<br>
      <br>
      As it spiral in steel A wire is connected at the two ends with the
      copper B fil', thus forming a closed circuit composed of two
      different metals, each time for an unspecified cause a change of
      temperature reaches the apparatus, this closed circuit, heated
      unequally, will become a small thermoelectric stack; In addition,
      the passage of these different electricity in the turns of the
      steel wire, magnetizes it and its two ends being very brought
      closer to the two ends of the soft iron wire C being inside the
      apparatus, it forms by induction a second closed circuit traversed
      constantly by the electromagnetic forces of the atmosphere. The
      apparatus being flexible, if one forms of it a nonclosed circle
      around the body of a man or an animal, the heat of this living
      organism makes increase the temperature in the apparatus. But as
      the nature of the metals forming this circuit is of different
      composition, the temperature increases more quickly in one of the
      metals than in the other and the apparatus becomes a
      thermoelectric stack. If this circle surrounds the foot of a shaft
      or a plant in full air, this stack will function each time the
      temperature of the ambient air changes. The apparatus is thus a
      double power source being able to be used to increase the vitality
      of the living organisms that one place in his magnetic field. One
      of these forces formed by the collecting of the waves
      electromagnetic and amplified by their passage through the turns
      of the apparatus, the other produced by the acting change of
      temperature on a formed closed circuit by two metals of different
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      The forms, dimensions, details and metals employed in the
      composition of the apparatus, can vary without changing into
      anything the object of the invention.<br>

      Since long years of many scientists noticed the role .bienfaisant
      of the electricity of the nature on the life of the plants and
      same on all as there is the living one on the earth.<br>
      <br>
      The workings .de these many scientists, studied, condensed,
      bringing .des irrefutable proofs of the increase of the life
      everywhere where the electricity of the nature was increased, have
      given rise with electroculture, i.e. with the culture of the
      plants by means of the natural electricity collected by
      apparatuses special and drained in the .cultivé basement where one
      wants to obtain an addition of vegetation.<br>
      <br>
      There is today in all the countries of the making world of the
      experimenters, of improved results according to the quality of the
      apparatuses of which they make use for collecting of the natural
      electricity and its mode of distribution in the cultivated
      basement.<br>
      <br>
      But whatever the mode of collecting that the experimenters employ,
      it is a point on which they all arrive at the same purpose, i.e.
      if a living organism is placed in a magnetic field created by the
      single electrical forces of the nature, collected, drained,
      increased on the point where one wants to increase the life, the
      life increases on this point in the same proportions where the
      natural quantity of electricity there was amplified.<br>
      <br>
      All these workings which last since exposed electricity and which
      had thousands of experimenters, at the head of which the largest
      names of science are placed, show by the results obtained on all
      the living organisms, that the electricity of the nature is the
      source .de life of all that lives on the earth.<br>
      <br>
      The human ones are thus also tributary of these forces. But as
      they cannot remain day and night outside in contact with the
      electromagnetic forces of the nature and than they are private
      partly when they are locked up in their residence, one can cure
      this disadvantage by bringing an addition of natural electricity
      in their dwelling.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the present invention is thus:<br>
      <br>
      a pickup apparatus of the natural electricity and the diffusing
      one in the human dwelling.<br>
      <br>
      The shape of execution of the object of the invention was
      represented as example in the annexed drawings which show: . <br>

      <br>
      In these figures the same letters of references indicate the same
      ones by ties always.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus is composed of a metallic circle nonclosed A,
      magnetized by means of the negative electricity of the earth. On
      this circle a reflector B is attached, with the bottom of which a
      light hearth 0 is laid out. The whole is attached using bolts or
      of rivets D, on a tray E, pierced, of an opening F, allowing in
      the light of being spread in the part. This tray E is maintained
      upright by a foot G. The operation of the apparatus is the
      following one: metallic circle A being as a preliminary loaded of
      negative electricity of the earth, constantly attracts with him a
      larger positive quantity of electricity of the atmosphere. The
      space contained in the inner one of the circle thus becomes a
      magnetic field created by the natural electricity which the light
      rays must cross before being spread outside the apparatus. These
      light rays while crossing the magnetic field take care themselves
      of natural electricity which they transfer onto all. the space
      reached by their radiation. As the electricity of the nature is
