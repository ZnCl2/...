      <br>
      After four years of incredulity and not-so-gentle mocking, Bo
      Thide of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics and a team in
      Italy have finally proven that it’s possible to simultaneously
      transmit multiple radio channels over exactly the same wireless
      frequency. In theory, according to Thide, we could potentially
      transmit an “infinite number” of TV, radio, WiFi, and cellular
      channels at the same time over the same frequency, blasting apart
      our highly congested wireless spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      Thide’s approach is rather simple. Basically, electromagnetic
      waves can have both spin angular and orbital angular momentum
      (OAM). If you picture the Earth-Sun system, spin momentum is the
      Earth rotating on its axis (producing the day-night cycle), and
      orbital momentum is the Earth rotating around the sun (producing
      the seasons). In standard wireless communications — radio, TV,
      WiFi — we only modulate the spin angular momentum of waves. For
      years, Thide had theorized that orbital angular momentum could
      also be added to wireless signals, effectively creating a spiral
      signal that looks like fusilli pasta; or, in the words of Thide, a
      “radio vortex.”<br>
      <br>
      Now, in an experiment in Venice, Thide and his Italian colleagues
      have transmitted two signals at the same time, on the same
      frequency, over a distance of 442 meters (1450ft). Pictured on the
      right is the antenna that the team used. No, your eyes don’t
      deceive you: To create these radio vortices, all you have to do is
      make a cut in a standard parabolic reflector and twist it
      slightly. If you imagine a corkscrew of radio signals being
      continuously transmitted from the outside edge of the antenna,
      that’s effectively what’s occurring. On the receiving end, there
      are two “normal” TV antennae (Yagi-Uda) set apart by the same
      angle as the break in the transmitter. These antennae “decode” the
      vortex, and voila: Two radio signals transmitted over the same
      frequency.<br>
      <br>
      It is hard to put into words just how significant Thide’s
      discovery could be. If the vortex preserves other aspects of
      wireless communications, such as multiplexing, then in the short
      term we could be looking at a wireless spectrum that can carry 10
      or 20 times as much data. In the long term, as our understanding
      of orbital angular momentum grows, our wireless spectrum could
      effectively be infinite. To be honest, this is such a huge twist
      for wireless communications that the full repercussions are not
      yet known.<br>
      <br>
      With radio and TV, and now cellular networks, wireless spectrum is
      one of humanity’s most valued resources. It is because airwaves
      are so clogged that companies like Verizon or Vodafone pay
      billions of dollars for just a few megahertz. If Thide’s discovery
      pans out, not only would wireless spectrum lose most of its value,
      but the trouble and strife surrounding LightSquared, international
      roaming, LTE rollout, white space wireless, and digital TV simply
      cease to be.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have shown experimentally, in a real-world setting, that it is
      possible to use two beams of incoherent radio waves, transmitted
      on the same frequency but encoded in two different orbital angular
      momentum states, to simultaneously transmit two independent radio
      channels. This novel radio technique allows the implementation of,
      in principle, an infinite number of channels in a given, fixed
      bandwidth, even without using polarization, multiport or dense
      coding techniques. This paves the way for innovative techniques in
      radio science and entirely new paradigms in radio communication
      protocols that might offer a solution to the problem of radio-band
      congestion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      The first radio signal transmitted and received by Guglielmo
      Marconi on 8 December 1895 started the wireless communication
      revolution [1]. Now information is mostly exchanged through
      wireless channels and the rapid increase of the use of mobile
      devices has led to congestion in the available radio bands even
      after the application of dense coding and channel sharing
      techniques [2]. Therefore, it is important to try to develop new
      methods that make it possible to utilize the electromagnetic (EM)
      spectrum better.<br>
      <br>
      One way is to exploit fundamental physical properties of the EM
      field that hitherto have not been utilized in radio
      communications. To this end, we recall that the EM field can carry
      both energy and momentum. Whereas the Poynting vector S and the
      concomitant linear momentum (rational units) are associated with
      force action and therefore with translational dynamics, the
      angular momentum is a conserved physical observable (constant of
      motion) that is associated with torque action and thus with
      rotational dynamics [3]. In a beam geometry as used in radio
      communications, the total angular momentum can be conveniently
      expressed as the sum of two components: J = S + L. The component S
      represents the spin angular momentum (SAM), related to the
      polarization of the individual EM waves of the beam and thus with
      photon helicity. The component L represents the lesser-known
      orbital angular momentum (OAM) associated with the helicoidal
      phase profile of the EM beam in the direction orthogonal to the
      propagation axis. In a quantum picture L can be described as a
      superposition of discrete photon quantum eigenstates, each with a
      well-defined OAM value lhbar,l = 0,±1,±2,... [4–7]. Hence, not
      only in mechanics but also in electromagnetism, OAM is a
      fundamental physical quantity that spans an infinite state space
      [8]. It offers, in addition to the conventional translational
      linear momentum and polarization (SAM) rotational degrees of
      freedom, which spans only a two-dimensional (2D) state space,
      additional rotational degrees of freedom that are distinctly
      different from SAM. Without increasing the frequency bandwidth,
      the OAM states can be used as a new, very large set of
      communication channels that are mutually orthogonal to each other
      in the OAM state space.<br>
      <br>
      Here we report the results of real-world, outdoor radio
      experiments in the 2.4 GHz WiFi band that demonstrate the
      feasibility of increasing the wireless information transfer
      capacity over large distances by exploiting the OAM states [8] of
      EM waves. Our findings extend previous indoor laboratory test
      experiments in which the transmission of optical OAM states of
      coherent laser [9] and radio [10] beams was demonstrated. The
      results reported here show that OAM and vorticity are preserved
      throughout the long-distance propagation over long distances and
      can indeed be utilized in radio communication.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike already existing radio communication protocols that use the
      spatial phase distribution generated by a set of antennae to
      artificially increase the transmission bandwidth, the immediate
      advantage provided by a protocol based on the physical OAM states
      as independent communication channels is that of using the
      peculiar spatial phase distribution of each of these states as a
      reference pattern to generate, modulate and detect them in a
      better way.<br>
      <br>
      OAM has found practical applications in many other fields such as
      radar [11], nanotechnology [12], quantum experiments [13] and also
      astronomy and space sciences [14–18], improving the resolving
      power of diffraction-limited optical instruments [19] and
      facilitating the detection of extrasolar planets [20] and Kerr
      black holes [21].<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Transmitting with radio vortices</b><br>
      <br>
      To date, there has been no report on the transmission of twisted
      radio beams in a real-world experiment. The results from our
      outdoor radio vorticity experiments demonstrate that when using a
      given radio frequency bandwidth around a fixed carrier frequency,
      the inherent orthogonality (in a Hilbert sense) of the denumerably
      infinite OAM state space can ideally provide, without increasing
      the frequency bandwidth, an arbitrarily large set of independent
      OAM transmission channels, each characterized only by its peculiar
      topological property. This new technique can be described as
      topological diversity.<br>
      <br>
      In our radio vorticity communication experiments, we generated and
      detected two orthogonal OAM channels within a given fixed
      frequency band: one untwisted with OAM l = 0 and the other with an
      l = 1 OAM twist. Two identical WiFi FM transmitters, each with an
      output power of 2 W and driven by a signal generator, were tuned
      to the carrier frequency of 2.414 GHz to feed two antennae. In an
      FM transmission the amplitude and intensity of the EM wave remain
      constant in time; only the carrier frequency is modulated. The
      signal-to-noise ratio of the WiFi modules was 38 dB for the video
      channel and 45 dB for the audio band. The receiver sensitivity was
      -90 dBm, i.e. 10-9mW. The transmitted signal bandwidths of both
      signals were 15 or 27 MHz, like those used in video signals.<br>
      <br>
      The l = 0 source was radiated with linear polarization by a
      commercial 16.5 dBi gain Yagi–Uda antenna [22]. To generate the l
      = 1 vortex beam, we mechanically modified a 26 dBi commercial
      off-axis parabolic antenna, with diameter D = 80 cm, to attain an
      off-axis spiral parabolic-shaped phase mask reflector. The
      expected beam waist, given by the diffraction limit of the
      antenna, is dphiv = 1.22?/D ˜ 10.9°, where ? is the radio
      wavelength. The half-power beam width (HPBW), i.e. the angular
      separation between the points on the antenna radiation pattern at
      which the power or, equivalently, the linear momentum, drops to
      half its maximum value is ? = k?/D = 8.75°. The characteristic
      parameter of the antenna, k, is a factor that depends on the shape
      of the reflector and the method of illumination. This l = 1 beam
      was also linearly polarized. Additional technical details of the
      experiment can be found in the appendix...<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Radio transmission with orbital angular momentum</b><br>
      <br>
      The purpose of the second stage of the experiment was to transmit,
      using the same set of antennae, on the same frequency of 2.414
      GHz, and within a fixed given bandwidth, two mutually orthogonal
      OAM modes at a distance of 442 m (3536?) from the phase-detecting
      interferometer. After having verified that the phase properties of
      the twisted beam were preserved, by analysing the beam shape with
      an intensity/spectrum analyser, we transmitted the two OAM modes
      from the lighthouse of San Giorgio Island in the direction of the
      balcony of Palazzo Ducale in Venice (Italy), where they were
      received. The HPBW diameter of the parabolic antenna at that
      distance was 67 m. During the experiment, we measured a maximum
      signal power Pmax = 30.7 dBm, with a background noise of -87 dBm
      generated by external radio sources. The noise background that we
      characterized with the help of a digital spectrum analyser was
      dominantly caused by external sources (see table A.4 in the
      appendix).<br>
      <br>
      At the phase singularity point we expected the intensity to drop
      almost to zero, as found in experiments at optical frequencies.
      The narrow zone where the central singularity was located, defined
      by a 10 dB (i.e. tenfold) drop in the mean field intensity, had a
      diameter of about 2?. This small region was contained inside a
      wider zone with a diameter of ~190 cm (~15?) where a 3–5 dB drop
      in the mean field intensity was observed. Outside this region, at
      distances larger than 2 m (~16?) from the singularity, the field
      intensity was found to be more stable and flatter. The measured
      signal intensity was only 3 dB lower than expected from a
      non-helicoidal parabolic antenna with the same diameter and focal
      length.<br>
      <br>
      Due to propagation effects, the signal intensity near the
      singularity, where the electric field tends to zero, exhibited a
      more uniform and flatter intensity profile than expected from a
      coherent beam with a Laguerre–Gaussian profile. The phase
      distribution of the entire antenna lobe was preserved. This
      actually resembles the behaviour of incoherent beams carrying OAM.
      Such beams preserve the phase profile but the region of the lobe
      in which the singularity is located appears much more filled by
      the signal because of the large width of the transmission band
      and, in our case, probably also because of the shape of the
      transmitting antenna. The only insignificant variable interference
      effects noted during the experiments were due to reflections of
      the beam from the water surface of the lagoon that varied with the
      tidal height of the sea.<br>
      <br>
      By using an interferometric phase discrimination method we were
      able to separate the two OAM modes by identifying their 'phase
      fingerprints' [10, 11, 21, 23, 24]. The receiving station
      consisted of a commercial off the shelf (COTS)
      frequency-modulation (FM) radio module receiver fed by two
      identical 16.5 dBi Yagi–Uda antennae (hereafter called antenna A
      and antenna B) connected together with 180°-phase-shifted cables
      through a beam adder module, in order to obtain a phase-difference
      interferometer. We decided to use such directive antennae to
      spatially reduce any possible background interference due to the
      presence of other WiFi sources. The antenna parameters are given
      in the appendix. Antenna A was mounted on a mechanical translator
      oriented towards the direction of the transmitting station to
      select one of the two channels by exploiting the spatial phase
      front properties of different OAM states present in the two beams,
      whereas antenna B could be moved mechanically in the orthogonal
      horizontal direction only.<br>
      <br>
      The interferometer measured the phase difference between the two
      antennae, A and B, and therefore characterized the spatial phase
      properties of the beams that are the fingerprints of the vorticity
      OAM states of the field. To discriminate between the two different
      spatial modes of the EM field, we aligned antenna A, antenna B and
      the field singularity along a line parallel to the horizon, and
      the singularity was positioned in the middle of the segment
      delimited by antennae A and B (see the scheme in the appendix,
      figure A.6). If the setup were perfectly aligned, the twisted EM
      wave with l = 1 would have produced an exact 180° azimuthal phase
      difference between the two antennae, subsequently compensated for
      by the cable electric delay, thus producing an intensity maximum.
      The untwisted beam, with 0° azimuthal phase difference, would have
      produced an intensity minimum for the same settings.<br>
      <br>
      EM waves with wavelength ?, propagating along the two paths from
      the source to the two receiving antennae A and B, acquired a total
      phase difference phgr that depends on the angle ? between the
      incident plane wavefront and the interferometer baseline, the
      relative azimuthal term between the two receiving antennae phgrl
      due to the beam vorticity (phgrl = 0 when l = 0 and phgrl = p when
      l = 1) and a generic additional spatial/temporal phase term phgr0
      introduced by the experimental setup (e.g. cable delay, imperfect
      parallelism of the receiving antennae, etc). This total phase
      difference can be approximated by *** where d is the separation of
      the two antennae. The signal was collected equally by antennae A
      and B in phase and the signal of antenna A arrived at the signal
      adder 180° out of phase with respect to that of antenna B because
      of the electric ?/2 cable delay, resulting in a difference signal
      configuration, |A - B|, such that<br>
      <br>
      where V 0 is the voltage measured at the antenna cable end
      (receiver input). The bearing to the transmitter is, in the ideal
      case, determined by a minimum or total absence of signal. A
      maximum is obtained when phgr = (k + 1)p and k is an integer.<br>
      <br>
      By adding a phase delay to the signal from antenna A, one can
      change the pointing direction of the antenna system in such a way
      that the segment A - B, delimited by the two antennae, would
      effectively rotate rigidly around the field singularity in the
      direction orthogonal to the propagation of the EM signal, with the
      result of moving the position of the null interference fringes and
      compensating for the presence of additional phases and the
      inclination of the interferometric base with respect to the
      direction of the source. Alternatively, a similar compensation is
      obtained by moving antenna A along the direction of the source by
      a quantity ?x = ?n/2p. Consequently, the phase difference between
      the two paths can be written as ***.<br>
      <br>
      The parameter n can be adjusted to improve the tuning of the
      receiving system and read a signal minimum in the exact direction
      to the transmitting antenna. Here, n is negative when antenna A is
      moved towards the source.<br>
      <br>
      If the beam carries OAM, the phase distribution of the wavefront
      arriving at antennae A and B will exhibit a characteristic
      topological signature. In the simplest case, when the centre of
      the vortex coincides with the centre of the interferometer, the
      two antennae will experience a phase gap due to the OAM of the EM
      wave phgrl = lp and a maximum of the signal is obtained when the
      phase factor is ***<br>
      where is the set of all integer numbers. When l = 1, a maximum for
      the vortex is achieved when n = 0 and k = 0. Because of
      destructive interference the l = 0 signal intensity will at the
      same time experience a minimum. On the other hand, a maximum for
      the l = 0 mode will be obtained when n = -?/2, corresponding to a
      minimum for the vortex. Following these considerations, we aligned
      the interferometer so as to have the field singularity at the
      midpoint of the line joining the two receiving antennae (i.e. the
      interferometer baseline) and obtained a phase gap phgrl = p
      between the two antennae expected during the reception of the l =
      1 vortex. To better optimize the interference fringe structure we
      oriented the baseline by an inclination ? ~ 10° with respect to
      the balcony in order to be orthogonal to the incoming beam. During
      the experiment, the main practical difficulty was that of
      positioning the singularity at the midpoint between the two
      Yagi–Uda antennae: this problem was solved with the find-and-track
      direction method, also known as the 'fox-hunting' method [25],
      commonly used to locate a radio transmitter with high precision.<br>
      <br>
      In order to have a simple, straightforward and practical method to
      discriminate between the two orthogonal OAM channels, transmitted
      on the same carrier frequency, we frequency modulated them with
      constant-level audio signals at different modulation frequencies
      (400 and 1000 Hz for the untwisted and twisted waves,
      respectively) by injecting a -5 dBm monophonic audio signal into
      the video band of each transmitter. The thus-modulated radio
      signals were received by the two Yagi–Uda antennae, summed by a 3
      dB power splitter/combiner (Mini-Circuits ZX10-2-42 +) and then
      demodulated in the FM receiver into monophonic audio signals that
      were subsequently digitally sampled, recorded and analysed in real
      time with 32-bit resolution. Each dataset so produced was
      22?870?008 bytes long.<br>
      <br>
      The total signal loss measured in the receiving line of the
      interferometer was 6 dB. In order to reduce the power of the
      signal we inserted a calibrated 10 dB attenuator into the
      receiving line, so that the audio digitizer connected to the
      receiver output would not saturate due to overvoltage. In a
      conventional single-antenna receiver setup that detects linear
      momentum only, the two radio signals were audible simultaneously.
      By mechanically moving the antenna A with respect to B to select
      one of the two orthogonal OAM beams, one signal was alternately
      suppressed with respect to the other due to the different spatial
      phase signature of the two OAM states. We adjusted the baseline in
      order to optimize the discrimination of the two different OAM
      channels by moving antenna A.<br>
      <br>
      Since an FM transmission has the property of generating a constant
      amplitude output, we adjusted the output of the two transmitters
      to measure the same receiver output voltage, 1 volt in continuous
      current (VCC) for each channel. In this way, we were able to
      characterize the transition between equal-intensity twisted and
      untwisted channels. Figure 2 shows the maximum positive voltage of
      the signal measured at the output of the antenna receiver and
      amplifier. The untwisted beam (line marked 'o') showed destructive
      interference in the interval 8.5–9.4 cm (approximately 0.7?–0.8?)
      from the initial antenna position. In the corresponding audio
      track, the carrier disappears and the 400 Hz tone is suddenly
      replaced by white noise, which appears louder due to the automatic
      gain control (AGC) of the receiver. This is a clear indication of
      destructive interference. Similar behaviour was observed in two
      other smaller regions and is possibly due to the effects of the
      secondary Yagi lobes that were not considered in our
      autocorrelation analysis. The twisted beam (red continuous line),
      on the other hand, presented a richer forest of alternating maxima
      and minima; only near the initial position of the antenna (0.4–1.6
      cm) was a wide region of total destructive interference observed.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2. Diagram of the monophonic audio recordings of the
      twisted/untwisted beams. The output of the two transmitters was
      adjusted to ensure the same maximum input voltage of 2 V when both
      channels were present, and 1 VCC max for each individual channel.
      The first minimum is found at about 1 cm of antenna shift for the
      l = 1 mode (continuous line). Here the l = 0 channel (marked with
      the symbol 'o') has a maximum and the associated audio tone is
      clearly audible. The same was found for the l = 0 mode around the
      9 cm antenna position. The inner boundaries of the two minima
      regions are separated in distance by half the radio wavelength.
      Between these positions there was a forest of minima of the l = 1
      mode, a phenomenon due to the sampling of the field from a
      finite-sized antenna. Beyond the minimum located at 9 cm, two
      additional alternating signal minima due to the cross-talk of the
      two Yagi–Uda antennae were found.... <br>
      <br>
      An audio recording, split into three MP3 files of the tuning
      between the two OAM channels, is provided as additional material,
      available at stacks.iop.org/NJP/14/033001/mmedia. The first audio
      file (movie 1) is the recording of the spatial tuning of the
      channel without OAM only. One can hear the main tone at 400 Hz and
      then strong white noise at the position where antenna A, moving in
      the direction of the source with respect to antenna B, reaches the
      point where the signal is cancelled by the interferometer. The
      second file (movie 2) shows that the twisted beam has a much
      richer spatial structure than that of the untwisted beam. Finally,
      the third file (movie 3) is the recording of the vortex tuning
      between the two different OAM states transmitted simultaneously on
      the same frequency and used in the data analysis reported in
      figures 2–4.<br>
      <br>
      Already with this setup, one can obtain four physically distinct
      channels on the same frequency by additionally introducing the use
      of polarization (SAM), which is independent of OAM. A further
      five-fold multiplicative factor from implementing multiplexing
      would yield a total of 20 channels on the same frequency. The
      utilization of multiport techniques (e.g. MIMO) could increase the
      capacity further.<br>
      <br>
      <b>5. Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      Our experimental findings that EM OAM can be used for increasing
      radio transmission capacity without increasing bandwidth is likely
      to open up new perspectives on wireless communications and
      radio-based science. History tells us that Marconi invented the
      wireless telegraph and from that the communication world spread
      its branches in all directions [1]. All current radio
      communication services are based on various forms of phase,
      frequency and/or amplitude modulation of the EM radiation in the
      form of EM linear momentum (i.e. integrated Poynting vector or
      energy flux). In order that many different broadcasting stations
      are able to transmit simultaneously without overlapping their
      radio signals, Marconi suggested that the total available spectrum
      of radio frequencies be divided into many non-overlapping
      frequency subbands [23]. Now, the wide use of wireless
      communication has unavoidably led to the saturation of all
      available frequency bands, even after the adoption of artificial
      techniques that increase band capacity. We have experimentally
      shown that by using helicoidal parabolic antennae, the use of OAM
      states might dramatically increase the capacity of any frequency
      band, allowing the use of dense coding techniques in each of these
      new vortex radio channels. This might represent a concrete
      proposal for a possible solution to the band saturation problem.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, our experimental findings demonstrate that the spatial
      phase signature was preserved even in the far-field region and for
      incoherent non-monochromatic wave beams. These results open up new
      perspectives not only for wireless communication but also for
      physics and astronomy, including the possible detection of Kerr
      black holes in the test general relativity [21].<br>

      </b><b>STATE OF THE ART</b><br>
      <br>
      As is well known, if common techniques of channel multiplexing are
      not considered, TV and radio broadcasting is limited by the fact
      that only two independent signals, one for each polarization state
      of the EM field, can be transmitted for each carrier frequency.<br>
      <br>
      With current technology and international standards, the available
      frequencies for the transmission of radio signals, each identified
      by their carrier frequency and bandwidth, are confined to a
      relatively narrow spectrum, which accordingly limits the number of
      signals that can be transmitted independently within a given
      geographical region.<br>
      <br>
      Telecommunication methods and systems that exploit a further
      characteristic quantity of the EM waves, the orbital angular
      momentum, for increasing the capacity of transmitting information,
      have been recently proposed.<br>
      <br>
      The orbital angular momentum (OAM) is a fundamental physical
      property of the EM field. The simplest example of an EM field in a
      pure OAM eigenstate, independent of frequency, is a paraxial beam
      of light propagating in vacuum along a z axis. In this case, the
      complex amplitude of the EM field, measured in the plane
      orthogonal to z, Uf &lt;G&gt;p, can be described, in terms of a
      Laguerre-Gaussian mode in a cylindrical reference frame r,-&amp;,
      z , by:<br>
      <br>
      ***<br>
      <br>
      where i describes the number of twists of the helical wavefront
      (OAM mode, topological charge), p the number of radial nodes of
      the mode, w the beam waist, L&lt;e&gt; (x) is an associated
      Laguerre polynomial.<br>
      More in general, the amplitude of a field carrying OAM state can
      be described in an apparatus of spherical coordinates as the
      factorization of two parts: the first, Ae(r,-&amp;,q&gt;) ,
      depends on the spatial coordinates and the OAM mode while the
      second, exp(-/ ) , gives the phase dependence, according to the
      following relation:<br>
      Uf-&lt;G&gt; {r, ,&lt;? ) = Af {r, ,&lt;? )exp{- m) A
      superimposition of different OAM states can generate non-integer
      OAM states, i.e. a beam endowed with a phase dependence
      exp(z&lt;'&gt;ccd) corresponding to a non-integer OAM value . A
      non-integer OAM state can be represented as a series
      superimposition of integer OAM modes, according to the following
      relation:<br>
      expO'ccfl ) = &lt;[pound][chi]&gt; (
      &lt;[pi][alpha]&gt;)&lt;8[iota][eta]&gt;(&lt;[pi][alpha]&gt;) y
      expQ&lt;'&gt; ft)<br>
      [pi] f ^[infinity] - [pound]<br>
      <br>
      An EM wave is therefore characterised by a set of OAM modes, which
      are naturally quantized and can ideally be infinite.<br>
      <br>
      OAM eigenstates, each identified by a unique integer, are
      quantised by nature and can therefore be superimposed into various
      bit patterns that can be resolved at the receiving end. Each OAM
      mode may be tagged with an integer number (known as "quantum
      number") I that identifies the corresponding state of vorticity of
      the propagating EM wave. The quantum number I of an OAM mode may
      be positive or negative depending on the vorticity type
      (left-handed or right-handed) with respect to the propagation
      direction of the EM wave.<br>
      <br>
      OAM modes are independent of the polarization state of the EM
      field, i.e. they may exist for any type of polarization of the EM
      wave.<br>
      A beam of EM waves on a given carrier frequency can be encoded
      with an OAM spectrum in term of pure, integer OAM eigenstates.<br>
      <br>
      OAM eigenmodes with different quantum numbers are orthogonal in a
      Hilbert sense and therefore correspond to mutually and
      reciprocally independent quantum states for the radio beam. For
      this reason, the different OAM eigenmodes in a radio beam that
      carries OAM of any kind, do not interact during the propagation of
      the radio beam in a homogeneous unbounded medium, in particular in
      free space.<br>
      <br>
      The exploiting of OAM modes for wireless communication offers a
      number of relevant advantages, since several orthogonal and
      independent communication channels become available for any given
      carrier frequency.<br>
      In a propagating EM wave having a given carrier frequency, the
      phase of OAM modes having a state of vorticity I&lt;&gt; 0 is not
      constant along a plane but it has a well-defined spatial periodic
      structure, which may be properly exploited for the transmission of
      information.<br>
      <br>
      The idea of exploiting the superimposition of OAM modes for
      performing a multi-modal transmission of information is already
      used in optics, mostly in the visible region.<br>
      <br>
      However, this concept of physics is basically valid for any
      wavelength, since Maxwell's equations are linearly scalable in
      wavelength. Telecommunication apparatuses exploiting OAM modes are
      at present very crude and apparently addressed towards only a
      point-to-point transmission/reception of EM waves that is mainly
      designed for optical applications. Apparently, the extension of
      the proposed solution to radio telecommunication is inherently not
      suitable for radio signal broadcasting.<br>
      <br>
      At present no radio telecommunication systems exploiting OAM modes
      are commercially available.<br>
      <br>
      However some papers have envisaged to use antennas having a
      particular kind of geometry shape for OAM transmission and
      reception. Radiation lobes of the transmitting antennas, which are
      designed for point-to-point transmission/reception, may be
      directed only towards predefined directions, basically towards a
      single receiving antenna and are not suitable for broadcasting.
      Also the receiving antennas are designed for preferable direction
      reception. Further, such telecommunication systems are apparently
      difficult and expensive to realize at industrial level, at radio
      frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, they do not allow properly identifying/ recognizing the
      transmitted/received OAM states...<br>
