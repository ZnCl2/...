      DNA holds the genetic code for all sorts of biological molecules
      and traits. But University of Illinois researchers have found that
      DNA's code can similarly shape metallic structures.<br>
      <br>
      The team found that DNA segments can direct the shape of gold
      nanoparticles -- tiny gold crystals that have many applications in
      medicine, electronics and catalysis. Led by Yi Lu, the Schenck
      Professor of Chemistry at the U. of I., the team published its
      surprising findings in the journal Angewandte Chemie.<br>
      <br>
      "DNA-encoded nanoparticle synthesis can provide us a facile but
      novel way to produce nanoparticles with predictable shape and
      properties," Lu said. "Such a discovery has potential impacts in
      bio-nanotechnology and applications in our everyday lives such as
      catalysis, sensing, imaging and medicine."<br>
      <br>
      Gold nanoparticles have wide applications in both biology and
      materials science thanks to their unique physicochemical
      properties. Properties of a gold nanoparticle are largely
      determined by its shape and size, so it is critical to be able to
      tailor the properties of a nanoparticle for a specific
      application.<br>
      <br>
      "We wondered whether different combinations of DNA sequences could
      constitute 'genetic codes' to direct the nanomaterial synthesis in
      a way similar to their direction of protein synthesis," said
      Zidong Wang, a recent graduate of Lu's group and the first author
      of the paper.<br>
      <br>
      Gold nanoparticles are made by sewing tiny gold seeds in a
      solution of gold salt. Particles grow as gold in the salt solution
      deposits onto the seeds. Lu's group incubated the gold seeds with
      short segments of DNA before adding the salt solution, causing the
      particles to grow into various shapes determined by the genetic
      code of the DNA.<br>
      <br>
      The DNA alphabet comprises four letters: A, T, G and C. The term
      genetic code refers to the sequence of these letters, called
      bases. The four bases and their combinations can bind differently
      with facets of gold nanoseeds and direct the nanoseeds' growth
      pathways, resulting in different shapes.<br>
      <br>
      In their experiments, the researchers found that strands of
      repeating A's produced rough, round gold particles; T's, stars;
      C's, round, flat discs; G's, hexagons. Then the group tested DNA
      strands that were a combination of two bases, for example, 10 T's
      and 20 A's. They found that many of the bases compete with each
      other resulting in intermediate shapes, although A dominates over
      T.<br>
      <br>
      Next, the researchers plan to investigate exactly how DNA codes
      direct nanoparticle growth. They also plan to apply their method
      to synthesize other types of nanomaterials with novel
      applications.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD</span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Embodiments of a method for using nucleic acid molecules to
      control the growth and shape of nanoparticles are disclosed, as
      well nanoparticles and methods of using such nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Metal nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties
      leading to potential applications in selective catalysis,
      sensitive sensing, enhanced imaging, and medical
      treatment.&lt;1-9, 53, 54 &gt;The properties of a metal
      nanoparticle typically are affected by its size, shape, and
      crystal structure, and therefore it is possible to tune the
      properties of the particle by controlling its growth process.
      Molecular capping agents such as organic surfactants and polymers
      have been used to direct nanocrystal growth in a face-selective
      fashion to produce shape-controlled nanoparticle synthesis.&lt;8,9
      &gt;Despite tremendous progress made, the mechanism of the shape
      control is not well understood, in part due to the difficulty in
      defining structures and conformations of these surfactants and
      polymers in solution and in systematic variation of functional
      groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] DNA is a biopolymer with more defined structure and
      conformation in solution and unique programmable nature to tune
      its functional properties.&lt;10-13 &gt;Because of these
      advantages, DNA has been used as a template to position
      nanoparticles through DNA metallization,&lt;14,15 &gt;or
      nanoparticle attachment,&lt;16-21 &gt;or to control the sizes
      and/or the photo-luminescent properties of quantum dots.&lt;22-28
      &gt;However, in contrast to proteins or peptides,&lt;29-32 &gt;DNA
      has been much less explored to control the shape or morphology of
      metal nanoparticles, and, therefore the promise of this field
      remains to be fully realized. Such an investigation may result in
      new nanoparticles with new shapes and offer deeper insights into
      mechanisms of shape control.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br>
      <br>
      [0006] Embodiments of a method to use DNA and/or RNA for
      modulating the shape and thus the optical properties of
      nanoparticles are disclosed. Systematic variations of the nucleic
      acid sequences offer mechanistic insights into the morphology
      control. Nucleic acid molecules in such nanoparticles maintain
      their bioactivity, allowing programmable assembly of new
      nanostructures. In addition, the cell uptake ability and light
      scattering property of the flower-shaped nanoparticles are also
      demonstrated. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid-mediated
      nanoparticle synthesis method is applied to synthesize
      non-spherical gold nanoparticles with new shapes by using other
      nanoseeds such as nanoprisms or nanorods.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Embodiments of a method for controlling the shape of a
      nanoparticle using nucleic acid (DNA and/or RNA) oligomers are
      disclosed. In some embodiments, the method includes providing a
      metal nanoseed, adsorbing a plurality of nucleic acid oligomers to
      the metal nanoseed, wherein each nucleic acid oligomer has a
      nucleic acid sequence, and depositing metal onto the metal
      nanoseed to produce a shaped nanoparticle, wherein the shaped
      nanoparticle has a shape determined at least in part by the
      nucleic acid sequence of the oligomer. In some embodiments,
      inorganic nanoseeds such as silica or metal oxide nanoseeds are
      used. Following adsorption of the nucleic acid oligomers to the
      inorganic nanoseed, additional inorganic material is deposited
      onto the nanoseed to produce a shaped nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In some embodiments, the metal nanoseed is gold. In certain
      embodiments, the metal nanoseed is coated with citrate before
      adsorbing the oligomer. In some embodiments, the metal nanoseed is
      a nanosphere, a nanorod, or a nanoprism. In particular

      is poly A, poly C, poly G, poly U, or a sequence with mixed
      nucleotides of A, C, G, and/or U. In some embodiments, the
      oligomer is an aptamer. In certain embodiments, the oligomer has
      at least 5 nucleotides, such as at least 10, at least 50, or at
      least 100 nucleotides, such as 5 to 100 nucleotides. In certain
      embodiments, the oligomer is labeled with a detectable label. In
      some embodiments, a plurality of oligomers is adsorbed to the
      metal nanoseed. In particular embodiments, the sequence of each of
      the plurality of oligomers is the same.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In some embodiments, the metal nanoseed is a gold
      nanosphere, a plurality of DNA oligomers is adsorbed to the gold
      nanosphere, wherein each of the plurality of DNA oligomers has a
      DNA sequence consisting of poly A, poly C, or a mixture of A and
      C, and depositing gold onto the gold nanosphere produces a
      nanoflower. In other embodiments, each of the plurality of DNA
      oligomers has a DNA sequence consisting of poly T, and depositing
      gold onto the gold nanosphere produces a spherical nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In some embodiments, the metal nanoseed is a gold
      nanoprism, a plurality of DNA oligomers are adsorbed to the gold
      nanoprism, wherein each of the plurality of DNA oligomers has a
      DNA sequence consisting of poly T or a mixture of T in majority
      and C in minority, and depositing gold onto the gold nanoprism
      produces a six-angled nanostar. In some embodiments, each of the
      plurality of DNA oligomers has a DNA sequence consisting of poly
      G, or a mixture of G in majority and T in minority, and depositing
      gold onto the gold nanoprism produces a nanostar with multiple
      tips. In other embodiments, each of the plurality of DNA oligomers
      has a DNA sequence consisting of poly A, poly C, or a mixture of A
      and C, and depositing gold onto the gold nanoprism produces a
      nanoplate.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Also disclosed are embodiments of shaped nanoparticles
      including a metal nanoparticle and a plurality of oligomers
      extending from the metal nanoparticle, wherein at a least a
      portion of each of the plurality of oligomers is embedded within
      the metal nanoparticle. In some embodiments, the oligomers are at
      least 5 nucleotides, such as at least 10, at least 50, or at least
      100 nucleotides, such as 5 to 100 nucleotides in length. In
      particular embodiments, the metal nanoparticle is gold.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In some embodiments, the metal nanoparticle is gold, the
      oligomers are DNA oligomers that are at least 5 nucleotides, such
      as at least 10, at least 50, or at least 100 nucleotides, such as
      5 to 100 nucleotides in length, each of the DNA oligomers has a
      DNA sequence consisting of poly A, poly C, or a mixture of A and
      C, and the shaped nanoparticle is a nanoflower or a nanoplate. In
      other embodiments, each of the DNA oligomers has a DNA sequence
      consisting of poly T, poly G or a mixture of T and G, and the
      shaped nanoparticle is a nanosphere or a nanostar.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In some embodiments, the oligomers are RNA oligomers that
      are at least 5 nucleotides, such as at least 10, at least 50, or
      at least 100 nucleotides, such as 5 to 100 nucleotides in length,
      and each of the RNA oligomers has an RNA sequence consisting of
      poly A, poly C, poly G, poly U, or a mixture of A, C, G, and/or U.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Embodiments of methods of using the shaped nanoparticles
      also are disclosed. In some embodiments, the shaped nanoparticle
      is delivered to a target cell by contacting the shaped
      nanoparticle with a target cell under conditions that allow the
      shaped nanoparticle to enter or bind to the cell. In certain
      embodiments, the shaped nanoparticle is conjugated to an antibody
      specific for a protein on the surface of the target cell, thereby
      delivering the shaped nanoparticle to the target cell. In
      particular embodiments, the shaped nanoparticle comprises
      oligomers including an aptamer sequence extending from the shaped
      nanoparticle, wherein the aptamer sequence is capable of binding
      to the target cell (e.g., to a protein on the surface of the
      target cell), thereby delivering the shaped nanoparticle to the
      target cell. In certain embodiments, the target cell is in a
      subject, and contacting comprises administering the shaped
      nanoparticle to the subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Embodiments of methods of using the shaped nanoparticles
      also are disclosed. In some embodiments, the shaped nanoparticle
      is delivered to a target cell by contacting the shaped
      nanoparticle with a target cell under conditions that allow the
      shaped nanoparticle to bind to and/or enter the cell, wherein the
      shaped nanoparticle comprises DNA or RNA aptamers specific for the
      target cell, thereby delivering the shaped nanoparticle to a
      target cell. In certain embodiments, the target cell is in a
      subject, and contacting comprises administering the shaped
      nanoparticle to the subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In some embodiments, the shaped nanoparticle is imaged
      after delivery to the target cell. In other embodiments, after the
      shaped nanoparticle is delivered to the target cell in the
      subject, near-infrared radiation is administered to the subject,
      wherein the shaped nanoparticle absorbs at least a portion of the
      near-infrared radiation, thereby producing a temperature increase
      within the shaped nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In some embodiments, a drug is delivered within a cell by
      contacting an embodiment of a shaped nanoparticle with the cell,
      wherein the shaped nanoparticle comprises a drug molecule
      conjugated to the shaped nanoparticle to produce a drug-shaped
      nanoparticle conjugate, and wherein the drug-shaped nanoparticle
      conjugate is contacted with the cell under conditions sufficient
      to allow the cell to bind to and/or internalize the drug-shaped
      nanoparticle conjugate. In certain embodiments, the cell is in a
      subject, and contacting comprises administering a therapeutic
      amount of the drug-shaped nanoparticle to the subject.<br>

      <br>
      [0056] Embodiments of a method for using nucleic acids to control
      nanoparticle shape are disclosed. The nucleic acids may be DNA or
      RNA. Single strand DNA (ssDNA) has been found to adsorb on
      citrate-coated gold nanospheres (AuNSs) in a sequence-dependent
      manner.&lt;33 &gt;Deoxynucleosides dA, dC, dG have shown much
      higher binding affinity to gold surfaces than deoxynucleoside
      dT.&lt;34 &gt;To investigate the effect of different DNA sequences
      on nanoparticle morphology during crystal growth, various DNA
      oligomers were bound to gold nanoseeds, additional metal was
      deposited onto the DNA-nanoseed constructs, and the resulting
      nanoparticle morphology was determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Nanoparticles made by some embodiments of the disclosed
      method can be taken up by cells. Because metallic nanoparticles
      can be visualized by, e.g., darkfield microscopy, such
      nanoparticles may be useful for intracellular imaging.
      Additionally, nanoparticles that can be taken up by cells may be
      useful carriers for delivering drugs, contrast agents, genes, and
      other molecules into cells.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">I. TERMS AND ABBREVIATIONS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0058] The following explanations of terms and abbreviations are
      provided to better describe the present disclosure and to guide
      those of ordinary skill in the art in the practice of the present
      disclosure. As used herein, "comprising" means "including" and the
      singular forms "a" or "an" or "the" include plural references
      unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. The term "or"
      refers to a single element of stated alternative elements or a
      combination of two or more elements, unless the context clearly
      indicates otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Unless explained otherwise, all technical and scientific
      terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to
      one of ordinary skill in the art to which this disclosure belongs.
      Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
      described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the
      present disclosure, suitable methods and materials are described
      below. The materials, methods, and examples are illustrative only
      and not intended to be limiting. Other features of the disclosure
      are apparent from the following detailed description and the
      claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing
      quantities of components, molecular weights, percentages,
      temperatures, times, and so forth, as used in the specification or
      claims are to be understood as being modified by the term
      "about."Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated, implicitly or
      explicitly, the numerical parameters set forth are approximations
      that may depend on the desired properties sought and/or limits of
      detection under standard test conditions/methods. When directly
      and explicitly distinguishing embodiments from discussed prior
      art, the embodiment numbers are not approximates unless the word
      "about" is recited.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Definitions of common terms in chemistry may be found in
      Richard J. Lewis, Sr. (ed.), Hawley's Condensed Chemical
      Dictionary, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1997 (ISBN
      0-471-29205-2). All references herein are incorporated by
      reference. In order to facilitate review of the various
      embodiments of the disclosure, the following explanations of
      specific terms are provided:<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Administration: To provide or give a subject an agent, such
      as a nanoparticle preparation described herein, by any effective
      route. Exemplary routes of administration include, but are not
      limited to, topical, injection (such as subcutaneous,
      intramuscular, intradermal, intraperitoneal, intratumoral, and
      intravenous), oral, sublingual, rectal, transdermal, intranasal,
      vaginal and inhalation routes.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Adsorption: The physical adherence or bonding of ions and
      molecules onto the surface of another molecule or substrate. An
      ion or molecule that adsorbs is referred to as an adsorbate.
      Adsorption can be characterized as chemisorption or physisorption,
      depending on the character and strength of the bond between the
      adsorbate and the substrate surface. Chemisorption is
      characterized by a strong interaction between an adsorbate and a
      substrate, e.g., formation of covalent and/or ionic bonds.
      Physisorption is characterized by weaker bonding between an
      adsorbate and a substrate. The weaker bond typically results from
      van der Waals forces, i.e., an induced dipole moment between the
      adsorbate and the substrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Antibody: A polypeptide ligand comprising at least a light
      chain or heavy chain immunoglobulin variable region which
      specifically recognizes and binds an epitope of an antigen, such
      as a tumor-specific protein. Antibodies are composed of a heavy
      and a light chain, each of which has a variable region, termed the
      variable heavy (VH) region and the variable light (VL) region.
      Together, the VH region and the VL region are responsible for
      binding the antigen recognized by the antibody.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Antibodies include intact immunoglobulins and the variants
      and portions of antibodies well known in the art, such as Fab
      fragments, Fab' fragments, F(ab)'2 fragments, single chain Fv
      proteins ("scFv"), and disulfide stabilized Fv proteins ("dsFv").
      A scFv protein is a fusion protein in which a light chain variable
      region of an immunoglobulin and a heavy chain variable region of
      an immunoglobulin are bound by a linker, while in dsFvs, the
      chains have been mutated to introduce a disulfide bond to
      stabilize the association of the chains. The term also includes
      genetically engineered forms such as chimeric antibodies (for
      example, humanized murine antibodies), heteroconjugate antibodies
      (such as, bispecific antibodies). See also, Pierce Catalog and
      Handbook, 1994-1995 (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, Ill.); Kuby,

      [0066] Typically, a naturally occurring immunoglobulin has heavy
      (H) chains and light (L) chains interconnected by disulfide bonds.
      There are two types of light chain, lambda ([lambda]) and kappa
      (k). There are five main heavy chain classes (or isotypes) which
      determine the functional activity of an antibody molecule: IgM,
      IgD, IgG, IgA and IgE.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Each heavy and light chain contains a constant region and a
      variable region, (the regions are also known as "domains"). In
      combination, the heavy and the light chain variable regions
      specifically bind the antigen. Light and heavy chain variable
      regions contain a "framework" region interrupted by three
      hypervariable regions, also called "complementarity-determining
      regions" or "CDRs." The extent of the framework region and CDRs
      have been defined (see, Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of
      Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Health and Human
      Services, 1991, which is hereby incorporated by reference). The
      Kabat database is now maintained online. The sequences of the
      framework regions of different light or heavy chains are
      relatively conserved within a species, such as humans. The
      framework region of an antibody, that is the combined framework
      regions of the constituent light and heavy chains, serves to
      position and align the CDRs in three-dimensional space. The CDRs
      are primarily responsible for binding to an epitope of an antigen.
      The CDRs of each chain are typically referred to as CDR1, CDR2,
      and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and
      are also typically identified by the chain in which the particular
      CDR is located.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] References to "VH" or "VH" refer to the variable region of
      an immunoglobulin heavy chain, including that of an Fv, scFv, dsFv
      or Fab. References to "VL" or "VL" refer to the variable region of
      an immunoglobulin light chain, including that of an Fv, scFv, dsFv
      or Fab.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] A "monoclonal antibody" is an antibody produced by a single
      clone of B lymphocytes or by a cell into which the light and heavy
      chain genes of a single antibody have been transfected. Monoclonal
      antibodies are produced by methods known to those of skill in the
      art, for instance by making hybrid antibody-forming cells from a
      fusion of myeloma cells with immune spleen cells. Monoclonal
      antibodies include humanized monoclonal antibodies.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Aptamer: An oligonucleic acid that binds to a specific
      target. Nucleic acid aptamers are capable of binding to various
      molecular targets such as small molecules, proteins, nucleic
      acids, or cells. DNA or RNA aptamers recognize target effector
      molecules with high affinity and specificity (Ellington and
      Szostak, Nature 346(6287):818-822, 1990; Tuerk and Gold, Science,
      249:505-510, 1990). Aptamers have several unique properties.
      First, aptamers for a given target can be obtained by routine
      experimentation. For instance, in vitro selection methods can be
      used (called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential
      enrichment (SELEX)) to obtain aptamers for a wide range of target
      effector molecules with exceptionally high affinity, having
      dissociation constants in the picomolar range (Brody and Gold,
      Reviews in Molecular Biotechnology, 74(1)5-13, 2000, Jayasena,
      Clinical Chemistry, 45(9):1628-1650, 1999, Wilson and Szostak,
      Ann. Rev. Biochem., 68:611-647, 1999, Ellington et al., Nature
      1990, 346, 818-822; Tuerk and Gold Science 1990, 249, 505-510; Liu
      et al., Chem. Rev. 2009, 109, 1948-1998; Shamah et al., Acc. Chem.
      Res. 2008, 41, 130-138; Famulok, et al., Chem. Rev. 2007, 107,
      3715-3743; Manimala et al., Recent Dev. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004,
      1, 207-231; Famulok et al., Acc. Chem. Res. 2000, 33, 591-599;
      Hesselberth, et al., Rev. Mol. Biotech. 2000, 74, 15-25; Morris et
      al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998, 95, 2902-2907). Second,
      aptamers are easier to obtain and less expensive to produce than
      antibodies, because aptamers can be generated in vitro in short
      time periods (for example, within days) and at economical cost.
      Third, aptamers display remarkable structural durability and can
      be denatured and renatured many times without losing their ability
      to recognize their targets. The mononucleotides of an aptamer may
      adopt a particular conformation upon binding to its target.
      Aptamers that are specific to a wide range of targets from small
      organic molecules such as adenosine, to proteins such as thrombin,
      and even viruses and cells, have been identified (Chou et al.,
      Trends in Biochem Sci. 2005, 30(5), 231-234; Liu et al., Chem.
      Rev. 2009, 109, 1948-1998; Lee et al., Nucleic Acids Res. 2004,
      32, D95-D100; Navani and Li, Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006, 10,
      272-281; Song et al., TrAC, Trends Anal. Chem. 2008, 27, 108-117;
      Tombelli et al., Bioelectrochemistry, 2005, 67(2), 135-141). In
      one example the aptamer is specific for HIV (such as HIV-tat).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Contacting: Placement in direct physical association,
      including both a solid and liquid form. Contacting can occur in
      vitro, for example, with isolated cells, such as tumor cells, or
      in vivo by administering to a subject (such as a subject with a
      tumor). Thus, the nanoparticles disclosed herein can be contacted
      with cells in vivo or in vitro, under conditions that permit the
      nanoparticle to be endocytosed into the cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] DNA melting temperature: The temperature at which a DNA
      double helix dissociates into single strands, specifically the
      temperature at which 50% of the DNA, or oligonucleotide, is in the
      form of a double helix and 50% has dissociated into single
      strands. The most reliable and accurate determination of melting
      temperature is determined empirically. Methods for determining the
      melting temperature of DNA are known to those with ordinary skill
      in the art of DNA characterization. For single-stranded oligomers,
      a complementary oligonucleotide is hybridized to the oligomer, and
      the melting temperature of the double-stranded complex is
      determined.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Nanoflower (NF): A nanoparticle with a morphology in
      microscopic view that resembles a flower.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Nanoparticle (NP): A nanoscale particle with a size that is
      measured in nanometers, for example, a particle that has at least
      one dimension of less than about 100 nm. Nanoparticles may have
      different shapes, e.g., nanofibers, nanoflowers, nanohorns,
      nano-onions, nanopeanuts, nanoplates, nanoprisms, nanorods,
      nanoropes, nanospheres, nanostars, nanotubes, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Nanoplate: A nanoparticle with a morphology in microscopic
      view that resembles a substantially flat plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Nanoseed (NS): A small nanoparticle used as a starting
      material for larger nanoparticle synthesis. For example, gold ions
      may be reduced and deposited onto gold nanoseeds to produce larger
      gold nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Nanostar: A nanoparticle with a morphology in microscopic
      view that resembles a star.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Near-infrared (NIR): The infrared spectrum is typically
      divided into three sections, with near-infrared including the
      shortest wavelengths. Although the region is not rigidly defined,
      NIR typically encompasses light with wavelengths ranging from
      700-2000 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] An oligomer is a general term for a polymeric molecule
      consisting of relatively few monomers, e.g., 5-100 monomers. In
      one example, the monomers are nucleotides.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Pharmaceutically acceptable vehicles: The pharmaceutically
      acceptable carriers (vehicles) useful in this disclosure are
      conventional. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, by E. W.
      Martin, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 19th Edition (1995),
      describes compositions and formulations suitable for
      pharmaceutical delivery of the nanoparticles disclosed herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In general, the nature of the carrier will depend on the
      particular mode of administration being employed. For instance,
      parenteral formulations usually comprise injectable fluids that
      include pharmaceutically and physiologically acceptable fluids
      such as water, physiological saline, balanced salt solutions,
      aqueous dextrose, glycerol or the like as a vehicle. For solid
      compositions (for example, powder, pill, tablet, or capsule
      forms), conventional non-toxic solid carriers can include, for
      example, pharmaceutical grades of mannitol, lactose, starch, or
      magnesium stearate. In addition to biologically-neutral carriers,
      pharmaceutical compositions to be administered can contain minor
      amounts of non-toxic auxiliary substances, such as wetting or
      emulsifying agents, preservatives, and pH buffering agents and the
      like, for example sodium acetate or sorbitan monolaurate.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] A polymer is a molecule of repeating structural units
      (e.g., monomers) formed via a chemical reaction, e.g.,
      polymerization.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] "Specifically binds" refers to the ability of a molecule to
      bind with specificity to a particular target. For example,
      "specifically binds" refers to the ability of an individual
      aptamer to specifically bind to a molecular target such as a small
      molecule, a protein, a particular nucleic acid sequence, or a
      particular cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] "Specifically binds" also refers to the ability of
      individual antibodies to specifically immunoreact with an antigen,
      such as a tumor-specific antigen, relative to binding to unrelated
      proteins, such as non-tumor proteins, for example [beta]-actin.
      For example, a HER2-specific binding agent binds substantially
      only the HER-2 protein in vitro or in vivo. As used herein, the
      term "tumor-specific binding agent" includes tumor-specific
      antibodies and other agents that bind substantially only to a
      tumor-specific protein in that preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The binding is a non-random binding reaction between an
      antibody molecule and an antigenic determinant of the T cell
      surface molecule. The desired binding specificity is typically
      determined from the reference point of the ability of the antibody
      to differentially bind the T cell surface molecule and an
      unrelated antigen, and therefore distinguish between two different
      antigens, particularly where the two antigens have unique
      epitopes. An antibody that specifically binds to a particular
      epitope is referred to as a "specific antibody".<br>
      <br>
      [0086] In some examples, an antibody (such as an antibody
      conjugated to a nanoparticle of the present disclosure)
      specifically binds to a target (such as a cell surface protein)
      with a binding constant that is at least 10&lt;3 &gt;M&lt;-1
      &gt;greater, 10&lt;4&gt;M&lt;-1 &gt;greater or 10&lt;5 &gt;M&lt;-1
      &gt;greater than a binding constant for other molecules in a
      sample or subject. In some examples, an antibody (e.g., monoclonal
      antibody) or fragments thereof, has an equilibrium constant (Kd)
      of 1 nM or less. For example, an antibody binds to a target, such
      as tumor-specific protein with a binding affinity of at least
      about 0.1*10&lt;-8 &gt;M, at least about 0.3*10&lt;-8 &gt;M, at
      least about 0.5*10&lt;-8 &gt;M, at least about 0.75*10&lt;-8
      &gt;M, at least about 1.0*10&lt;-8 &gt;M, at least about
      1.3*10&lt;-8 &gt;M at least about 1.5*10&lt;-8&gt;M, or at least
      about 2.0*10&lt;-8 &gt;M. Kd values can, for example, be
      determined by competitive ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay) or using a surface-plasmon resonance device such as the
      Biacore T100, which is available from Biacore, Inc., Piscataway,
      N.J.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Subject or patient: A term that includes human and
      non-human mammals. In one example, the subject is a human or
      veterinary subject, such as a mouse.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Therapeutically effective amount: An amount of a
      composition that alone, or together with an additional therapeutic
      agent(s) (such as a chemotherapeutic agent) sufficient to achieve
      a desired effect in a subject, or in a cell, being treated with
      the agent. The effective amount of the agent (such as the
      nanoparticles disclosed herein) can be dependent on several
      factors, including, but not limited to the subject or cells being
      treated, the particular therapeutic agent, and the manner of
      administration of the therapeutic composition. In one example, a
      therapeutically effective amount or concentration is one that is
      sufficient to prevent advancement, delay progression, or to cause
      regression of a disease, or which is capable of reducing symptoms
      caused by the disease, such as cancer. In one example, a
      therapeutically effective amount or concentration is one that is
      sufficient to increase the survival time of a patient with a
      tumor.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In one example, a desired response is to reduce or inhibit
      one or more symptoms associated with cancer. The one or more
      symptoms do not have to be completely eliminated for the
      composition to be effective. For example, administration of a
      composition containing a nanoparticle disclosed herein, which in
      some examples is followed by photothermal therapy can decrease the
      size of a tumor (such as the volume or weight of a tumor, or
      metastasis of a tumor) by a desired amount, for example by at
      least 20%, at least 50%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%,
      at least 98%, or even at least 100%, as compared to the tumor size
      in the absence of the nanoparticle. In one particular example, a
      desired response is to kill a population of cells by a desired
      amount, for example by killing at least 20%, at least 50%, at
      least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%, at least 90%, at least 95%,
      at least 98%, or even at least 100% of the cells, as compared to
      the cell killing in the absence of the nanoparticle. In one
      particular example, a desired response is to increase the survival
      time of a patient with a tumor (or who has had a tumor recently
      removed) by a desired amount, for example increase survival by at
      least 20%, at least 50%, at least 60%, at least 70%, at least 80%,
      at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 98%, or even at least 100%,
      as compared to the survival time in the absence of the
      nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The effective amount of the disclosed nanoparticles that is
      administered to a human or veterinary subject will vary
      significantly depending upon a number of factors associated with
      that subject, for example the overall health of the subject. An
      effective amount of an agent can be determined by varying the
      dosage of the product and measuring the resulting therapeutic
      response, such as the regression of a tumor. Effective amounts
      also can be determined through various in vitro, in vivo or in
      situ immunoassays. The disclosed agents can be administered in a
      single dose, or in several doses, as needed to obtain the desired
      response. However, the effective amount of the disclosed
      nanoparticles can be dependent on the source applied, the subject
      being treated, the severity and type of the condition being
      treated, and the manner of administration. In certain examples, a
      therapeutically effective dose of the disclosed nanoparticles is
      at least 20 mg per kg body weight, at least 200 mg per kg, at
      least 2,000 mg per kg, or at least 20 g per kg, for example when
      administered intravenously (iv).<br>
      <br>
      [0091] In particular examples, a therapeutically effective dose of
      an antibody conjugated to a nanoparticle of the present disclosure
      is at least 0.5 milligram per 60 kilogram (mg/kg), at least 5
      mg/60 kg, at least 10 mg/60 kg, at least 20 mg/60 kg, at least 30
      mg/60 kg, at least 50 mg/60 kg, for example 0.5 to 50 mg/60 kg,
      such as a dose of 1 mg/60 kg, 2 mg/60 kg, 5 mg/60 kg, 20 mg/60 kg,
      or 50 mg/60 kg, for example when administered iv. However, one
      skilled in the art will recognize that higher or lower dosages
      also could be used, for example depending on the particular
      nanoparticle. In particular examples, such daily dosages are
      administered in one or more divided doses (such as 2, 3, or 4
      doses) or in a single formulation. The disclosed nanoparticle can
      be administered alone, in the presence of a pharmaceutically
      acceptable carrier, in the presence of other therapeutic agents
      (such as other anti-neoplastic agents).<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Treating: A term when used to refer to the treatment of a
      cell or tissue with a therapeutic agent, includes contacting or
      incubating an agent (such as a nanoparticle disclosed herein) with
      the cell or tissue. A treated cell is a cell that has been
      contacted with a desired composition in an amount and under
      conditions sufficient for the desired response. In one example, a
      treated cell is a cell that has been exposed to a nanoparticle
      under conditions sufficient for the nanoparticle to enter the
      cell, which is in some examples followed by phototherapy, until
      sufficient cell killing is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Tumor, neoplasia, malignancy or cancer: A neoplasm is an
      abnormal growth of tissue or cells which results from excessive
      cell division. Neoplastic growth can produce a tumor. The amount
      of a tumor in an individual is the "tumor burden" which can be
      measured as the number, volume, or weight of the tumor. A tumor
      that does not metastasize is referred to as "benign." A tumor that
      invades the surrounding tissue and/or can metastasize is referred
      to as "malignant." A "non-cancerous tissue" is a tissue from the
      same organ wherein the malignant neoplasm formed, but does not
      have the characteristic pathology of the neoplasm. Generally,
      noncancerous tissue appears histologically normal. A "normal
      tissue" is tissue from an organ, wherein the organ is not affected
      by cancer or another disease or disorder of that organ. A
      "cancer-free" subject has not been diagnosed with a cancer of that
      organ and does not have detectable cancer.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Exemplary tumors, such as cancers, that can be treated with
      the claimed nanoparticles include solid tumors, such as breast
      carcinomas (e.g. lobular and duct carcinomas), sarcomas,
      carcinomas of the lung (e.g., non-small cell carcinoma, large cell
      carcinoma, squamous carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma), mesothelioma
      of the lung, colorectal adenocarcinoma, stomach carcinoma,
      prostatic adenocarcinoma, ovarian carcinoma (such as serous
      cystadenocarcinoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma), ovarian germ
      cell tumors, testicular carcinomas and germ cell tumors,
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, biliary adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular
      carcinoma, bladder carcinoma (including, for instance,
      transitional cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and squamous
      carcinoma), renal cell adenocarcinoma, endometrial carcinomas
      (including, e.g., adenocarcinomas and mixed Mullerian tumors
      (carcinosarcomas)), carcinomas of the endocervix, ectocervix, and
      vagina (such as adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma of each of
      same), tumors of the skin (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma, basal
      cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, skin appendage tumors, Kaposi
      sarcoma, cutaneous lymphoma, skin adnexal tumors and various types
      of sarcomas and Merkel cell carcinoma), esophageal carcinoma,
      carcinomas of the nasopharynx and oropharynx (including squamous
      carcinoma and adenocarcinomas of same), salivary gland carcinomas,
      brain and central nervous system tumors (including, for example,
      tumors of glial, neuronal, and meningeal origin), tumors of
      peripheral nerve, soft tissue sarcomas and sarcomas of bone and
      cartilage, and lymphatic tumors (including B-cell and T-cell
      malignant lymphoma). In one example, the tumor is an
      adenocarcinoma.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] The disclosed nanoparticles can also be used to treat
      liquid tumors, such as a lymphatic, white blood cell, or other
      type of leukemia.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] Under conditions sufficient for: A phrase that is used to
      describe any environment that permits the desired activity. In one
      example, "under conditions sufficient for" includes administering
      a nanoparticle to a subject sufficient to allow the nanoparticle
      to enter the cell. In particular examples, the desired activity is
      killing the cells into which the nanoparticles entered, for
      example following phototherapy of the cells. In another example,
      "under conditions sufficient for" includes contacting DNA
      oligomers with a nanoseed sufficient to allow the oligomers to
      bind to the nanoseed, to form a nanoparticle of the desired shape.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">II. NANOPARTICLE PREPARATION AND
        NUCLEIC ACID-MEDIATED SHAPE CONTROL</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0097] The disclosure provides nanoparticles having attached
      thereto nucleic acid oligomers, wherein the DNA or RNA oligomer
      can be used to control the shape of the nanoparticle. Also
      provided are methods of making such shaped nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] In some embodiments, nanospheres (NSs) are used as
      nanoseeds, or starting materials, for nanoparticle growth. In
      other embodiments, the nanoseeds are nanoprisms, or nanorods. A
      person of ordinary skill in the art of nanoparticle technology
      will understand that nanoseeds of any shape may be used; however,
      the final nanoparticle's morphology may depend at least in part
      upon the shape of the nanoseed. Nanoseeds may comprise any
      material to which nucleic acid oligomers can be attached. If the
      nanoparticles will be administered to living subjects, it is
      advantageous to use nanoseeds that do not have significant
      cellular toxicity. In particular embodiments, gold nanoparticles
      are produced from gold nanoseeds. Gold has very low cellular
      toxicity, making gold nanoparticles (NPs) advantageous for
      applications in living subjects. Other suitable materials include
      other metals, such as silver and platinum, as well as inorganic
      compounds (e.g., silica, metal oxide).<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Typically, the nanoseeds have a largest dimension, or
      diameter, between 1 nm to 1000 nm, such as from 1 nm to 25 nm, 1
      nm to 50 nm, 1 nm to 100 nm, 1 nm to 250 nm, 1 nm to 500 nm, 5 nm
      to 20 nm, 5 nm to 50 nm, 5 nm to 100 nm, 5 nm to 150 nm, 10 nm to
      50 nm, 10 nm to 100 nm, 10 nm to 500 nm, 10 nm to 1000 nm. In some
      embodiments, AuNSs with a diameter of 5-20 nm were used.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] In some embodiments, nucleic acid oligomers comprising a
      single type of nucleotide are used (e.g., poly A). In other
      embodiments, the oligomers may include more than one type of
      nucleotide (such as an oligomer containing a mixture of A and C).
      Oligomers containing five or more nucleotides are suitable for use
      in the disclosed embodiments. Oligomers with fewer than 5
      nucleotides are too short to significantly influence the
      nanoparticle morphology. The oligomers disclosed herein can be at
      least 5 nucleotides in length, such as at least 10, at least 20,
      at least 30, or at least 60 nucleotides in length, such as 5 to
      100 nucleotides in length, 5 to 60 nucleotides, or 10 to 30
      nucleotides in length. In some embodiments, all of the oligomers
      bound to the NS have the same sequence and the same length. In
      other embodiments, oligomers of differing sequences and/or
      differing lengths may be used. In a working embodiment, 30-mer
      DNAs consisting of either poly A, poly C, or poly T (designated as
      A30, C30, and T30, respectively) were bound to AuNSs.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In some embodiments, the oligomers may be modified or
      labeled with a detectable label. Suitable detectable labels may
      include, but are not limited to, fluorophores (e.g., fluorescein
      dyes, Alexa Fluor(R) dyes, etc.), radioisotopes, biotin,
      photo-sensitive linkers, and chemical functional groups (e.g.,
      alkynyl, azide, carboxyl, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      [0102] In some embodiments, gold nanoseeds are coated with citrate
      during nanoseed synthesis. Oligomers adsorb to the citrate-coated
      AuNS surface via physisorption.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] After nucleic acid (NA) oligomers are adhered to the NS
      surface, additional material is deposited onto the nucleic
      acid-nanoseed (NA-NS) construct to produce nanoparticle growth. In
      some embodiments, the nanoseed is gold, and nanoparticle growth is
      achieved through gold ion reduction and deposition onto the
      NA-functionalized AuNS surface. In working embodiments, hydrogen
      tetrachloroaurate(III) (HAuCl4) was used as the gold ion source.
      However, other soluble gold salts also may be used. Hydroxylamine
      (NH2OH) is a suitable reducing agent for reducing HAuCl4 catalyzed
      by the gold surface.&lt;35 &gt;Other reducing agents also may be
      used, e.g., ascorbic acid, amines (poly(allylamine)
      hydrochloride&lt;51&gt;, sodium diphenylamine
      sulfonate&lt;52&gt;).<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Nanoparticle size is controlled by varying the size of the
      nanoseed and/or varying the growth conditions. In some
      embodiments, a set of growth conditions is selected to minimize
      the amount of gold deposited onto the nanoseed. For example, the
      amount of HAuCl4 can be limited and controlled to precisely
      control the size of the resulting nanoparticle. In certain
      embodiments, the nanoparticle has a largest dimension, or diameter
      of 5-1,000 nm, such as 10-500 nm, 10-250 nm, or 20-200 nm.
      Typically, particles with a largest dimension between 20 nm and
      200 nm are suitable for in vivo applications. Nanoparticle size is
      a result-effective variable that may influence uptake activity for
      nanoparticles having a particular shape, surface
      functionalization, and/or environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] The oligomer sequence affects the morphology of the
      nanoparticle. In a working embodiment, gold nanoparticles were
      synthesized in the presence of A30, C30, or T30 oligomers. DNA
      oligomers were adsorbed onto small gold nanospheres. Gold ions in
      solution subsequently were reduced and deposited onto the
      DNA-nanosphere constructs to cause nanoparticle growth. Using
      transmission electron microscopy to determine the nanoparticles'
      morphology, the inventors unexpectedly discovered that the
      nanoparticles synthesized in the presence of A30 and C30 were
      flower shaped (FIGS. 2a-2b), while nanoparticles synthesized in
      the presence of T30 were spherical (FIG. 2c). Nanoparticles
      synthesized in the absence of DNA also were spherical (FIG. 2d),
      as were nanoparticles synthesized in the presence of a 10-mer of
      poly G (FIG. 3). Thus, it is apparent that the nucleic acid
      sequence mediated the nanoparticle growth and controlled the
      resulting shape of the nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The length and number of oligomers adsorbed to the nanoseed
      also significantly affect the nanoparticle shape. As previously
      discussed, shorter oligomers (e.g., those with fewer than 5
      nucleotides) have a lesser influence on the nanoparticle shape.
      Furthermore, the number of oligomers adsorbed to the nanoseed
      significantly affects the nanoparticle morphology. As shown in
      FIGS. 7a-f, shape control becomes increasingly evident as the
      number of oligomers increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] Thiol chemistry can be used to conjugate DNA and RNA to
      gold surfaces. However, when thiolated (i.e., thiol-modified) DNA
      is adsorbed onto gold nanospheres, all of the thiolated DNA can be
      displaced by mercaptoethanol. In contrast, embodiments of AuNFs
      produced with unmodified poly A oligonucleotides by the methods
      disclosed herein are resistant to mercaptoethanol displacement,
      and incubation with mercaptoethanol overnight displaces less than
      one-third of the DNA strands. Thus, some embodiments of the
      disclosed in situ synthesis and controlled reduction methods
      advantageously can be used to prepare stable DNA-functionalized
      gold surfaces with unmodified DNA. Certain embodiments of gold
      nanoflowers produced by the disclosed methods are very stable in
      aqueous solution, even in the presence of 0.3 M salt,
      demonstrating that unmodified DNA oligomers can be attached to the
      nanoparticles during their synthesis, and act as stabilizing
      ligands.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Considering the remarkably high binding affinity of DNA to
      the AuNFs (higher than thiol-gold binding), it was hypothesized
      that the DNA in situ attached to AuNFs during reduction could be
      partially buried in the AuNFs. As additional gold is deposited
      onto the DNA-functionalized nanoseed, a portion of the DNA strand
      becomes buried in the deposited gold, thereby firmly attaching the
      DNA oligomer to the nanoparticle during nanoparticle growth.
      Because the melting point of a DNA oligonucleotide bound to a
      complementary oligonucleotide increases with the length of the
      oligonucleotide, an attached DNA oligonucleotide may have a lower
      melting point than that of a free oligonucleotide if a portion of
      the attached oligonucleotide is buried within the gold
      nanoparticle. In some embodiments, the attached oligonucleotides
      have a melting point that is at least 10% or at least 20% (such as
      10-20%) lower than that of the corresponding free
      oligonucleotides, substantiating the hypothesis that a portion of
      the DNA strand is embedded within the gold nanoparticle during
      nanoparticle growth. In certain embodiments, it is preferable to
      control nanoparticle size by varying the nanoseed size rather than
      by varying the thickness of the deposited gold. Varying the
      nanoseed size while minimizing the thickness of the deposited gold
      allows minimal "trapping" of the DNA sequence by the growing gold
      layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] To produce flower-shaped gold nanoparticles, the DNA
      oligomer has at least 5 nucleotides. DNA oligomers with fewer
      nucleotides are not long enough to significantly influence the
      nanoparticle morphology. As discussed above, DNA oligomers
      comprising poly A and poly C produced flower-shaped nanoparticles,
      while DNA oligomers comprising poly T and poly G produced
      spherical nanoparticles. It was observed that poly G oligomers
      longer than 10 nucleotides had secondary structure due to internal
      folding, thereby forming a compact structure that is hydrophobic,
      and making poly G more difficult to use for nanoparticle
      synthesis. In an oligomer containing a mixture of nucleotides, as
      the percentage of A and C increases (such as a DNA oligomer
      containing at least 75% A and C nucleotides, at least 80%, at
      least 90%, or at least 95% A and C nucleotides, the flower
      morphology becomes more pronounced. However, if a large majority
      (e.g., at least 90%, at least 95%, at least 97% or at least 98%)
      of the nucleotides of the DNA oligomer are T, the nanoparticle
      will be spherical.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] In some embodiments, it is beneficial to maximize the
      flower-like morphology of the nanoflower while minimizing the
      thickness of the deposited gold. Nanoflower growth can be
      monitored by the nanoparticle's UV absorbance. Gold spherical
      nanoparticles exhibit specific UV absorbance in the 500-600 nm
      range, and the absorption at this wavelength is a good indicator
      of the size and the polydispersity of the nanoparticles. As
      spherical nanoseeds grow into nanoflowers, the absorption peak
      will blue shift (increase in wavelength) and the absorbance at the
      original wavelength will decrease. By monitoring the subsequent
      shifted peak that corresponds to the formation of the nanoflower
      structure as well as the original peak of the nanosphere, it is
      possible to assign a quality factor to track the growth of
      nanoflowers that is expressed as:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Quality factor=Abs&lt;Nanoflower&gt;/Abs&lt;Nanosphere&gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0000] The optimum gold concentration that maximizes nanoflower
      morphology with minimum gold growth can be determined by plotting
      this quality factor vs. the amount of gold salt added.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The sequence of the nucleic acid also mediates growth and
      morphology of nanoparticles synthesized from non-spherical seeds.
      In a working embodiment, when gold nanoprisms were functionalized
      with A30 or C30 DNA oligomers and additional gold was deposited,
      flat nanoplates were formed (FIGS. 20a, 20c). Thus, DNA oligomers
      of poly A or poly C, or a mixture of A and C (such as a DNA
      oligomer of at least 75% A and C), can be attached to gold
      nanoprisms to make flat nanoplates. In contrast, gold nanoprisms
      functionalized with T30 or G10 DNA oligomers formed multi-pointed
      nanostars (FIG. 20b, 20d). Thus, DNA oligomers of poly T or poly
      G, or a mixture of T and G (such as a DNA oligomer of at least 75%
      T and G), can be attached to gold nanoprisms to make multi-pointed
      nanostars. In another working embodiment, gold nanorods
      functionalized with A30 DNA oligomers produced bone-shaped, or
      dumbbell-shaped, nanoparticles (FIG. 21b), whereas nanorods
      functionalized with T30 oligomers produced nanoparticles
      resembling peanuts (FIG. 21c). Thus, DNA oligomers of poly A, or a
      mixture of A with other nucleotides (such as a DNA oligomer of at
      least 75% A), can be attached to gold nanorods to make
      dumbbell-shaped, nanoparticles, while DNA oligomers of poly T, or
      a mixture of T with other nucleotides (such as a DNA oligomer of
      at least 75% T), can be attached to gold nanorods to make
      nanoparticles resembling peanuts.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In certain embodiments, a nucleic acid sequence is selected
      based at least in part on its ability to bind to a target, e.g., a
      target protein. In such embodiments, it is desirable to control
      nanoflower size by selecting an appropriately sized nanoseed and
      then depositing a thin layer of gold so that only a minimal
      portion of the oligomer is buried in the deposited gold. For
      example, aptamer AS1411 (SEQ ID NO: 2) recognizes and binds to
      nucleolin, a eurkaryotic nucleolar phosphoprotein involved in the
      synthesis and maturation of ribosomes. In order to facilitate
      binding to its target, the entire AS1411 sequence preferably is
      fully exposed. Thus, in some embodiments, the nanoseed is
      functionalized with a plurality of oligomers comprising the
      aptamer plus an additional "tail" of nucleotides, e.g., a poly C
      tail, such that a portion of the tail is embedded in the deposited
      metal while the aptamer sequence remains fully exposed. Based on
      this teaching, one can select an appropriate aptamer based on the
      target, and incorporate the selected aptamer into the disclosed
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] In some examples, the disclosed nanoparticles further
      include other molecules. In one example, the disclosed
      nanoparticles further include antibodies or fragments thereof that
      can be used to target a nanoparticle to a target cell. In one
      example, the antibody is specific for a cell surface receptor,
      such as a receptor on a cancer cell. Such nanoparticles can be
      used for example to image or treat (e.g., kill) the cancer cell.
      In another example, the disclosed nanoparticles further include a
      therapeutic molecule that can be used to treat a target cell. For
      example, the therapeutic molecule can be a drug that is used to
      treat a disease, such as a chemotherapeutic agent (e.g.,
      cisplatin, doxorubicin, fluorouracil). In another example, the
      therapeutic molecule is a nucleic acid molecule used for gene
      therapy.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] Chemotherapeutic agents are known in the art (see for
      example, Slapak and Kufe, Principles of Cancer Therapy, Chapter 86
      in Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 14th edition; Perry
      et al., Chemotherapy, Ch. 17 in Abeloff, Clinical Oncology 2nd
      ed., 2000 Churchill Livingstone, Inc; Baltzer and Berkery. (eds):

      Cancer Chemotherapy Handbook, 4th ed. St. Louis, Mosby-Year Book,
      1993). Exemplary chemotherapeutic agents that can be conjugated to
      a nanoparticle provided herein include but are not limited to,
      carboplatin, cisplatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, doxorubicin,
      epirubicin, topotecan, irinotecan, gemcitabine, iazofurine,
      gemcitabine, etoposide, vinorelbine, tamoxifen, valspodar,
      cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil, mitoxantrone and
      vinorelbine.<br>

      <br>
      [0115] Bio-functionalization of nanomaterials can provide the
      nanomaterials with target recognition ability, and can enable
      their controlled assembly.&lt;41 &gt;This functionalization step
      typically involves chemical modifications of the nanoparticles or
      the biomolecules to allow conjugation. For example, some
      embodiments of the disclosed shaped nanoparticles (e.g.,
      nanoflowers, nanoplates, nanospheres, and/or nanostars), are
      capable of binding to and/or entering a target cell. In one
      embodiment, a nucleic-acid functionalized nanoparticle comprises
      an aptamer capable of binding to an antigen of interest. In
      another embodiment, a molecule of interest (e.g., an antibody,
      antibody fragment, peptide, protein, or drug molecule) is
      conjugated to a nucleic acid-functionalized nanoparticle. The
      molecule of interest may be conjugated to the nucleic acid
      oligomer extending from the nanoparticle, or the molecule of
      interest may be conjugated directly to the nanoparticle surface.
      Certain embodiments of the disclosed shaped nanoparticles are
      capable of forming larger nano-assemblies comprising a plurality
      of shaped nanoparticles. Additionally, some embodiments of the
      disclosed shaped nanoparticles have unique optical and/or
      electrical properties that may provide utility for imaging and/or
      biosensing applications, e.g., surface-enhanced Raman
      spectroscopy-based biosensing.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Nanoflowers have several advantages over nanospheres. For
      example, nanoflowers have a much higher surface area than
      nanospheres of a similar size. Therefore, more biomolecules or
      drug can be loaded on each nanoflower. In addition, the tips of
      the nanoscale protrusions and the nanocavities on the surface of
      gold nanoflowers have strong localized near-field enhancement
      effects, and they give a much stronger Raman signal enhancement
      effect than the gold nanospheres. Furthermore, preliminary studies
      indicate that AuNFs are more easily taken up and internalized by
      cells via endocytosis than non-functionalized gold nanospheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In some embodiments, nanoflowers also have different
      optical properties than nanospheres. For example, AuNFs have a
      peak absorbance at longer wavelengths (e.g., 600-630 nm) than gold
      nanospheres (unfunctionalized or functionalized with T30), which
      have a maximum absorbance at 520-530 nm (FIG. 1a). The absorbance
      shift allows visualization of AuNFs with near-infrared radiation,
      and also may make AuNFs suitable candidates for photothermal
      therapies since near-IR absorption increases the temperature of
      the AuNFs.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] Nucleic acid-functionalized nanoflowers may be used as
      imaging agents and nano-carriers in a cellular environment. For
      example, some embodiments of DNA-functionalized AuNFs can be taken
      up by cells. Without being bound by any particular theory, it is
      believed that this cellular uptake ability might be due to high
      DNA loading on the AuNF surface and/or the morphology of the AuNF.
      Intracellular AuNFs scatter light and can be visualized using
      dark-field microscopy. The cellular uptake ability and light
      scattering property make the AuNFs promising nano-carriers for
      drug or gene delivery and promising contrast agents for
      intracellular imaging.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] In certain embodiments, a nucleic-acid functionalized
      nanoflower comprises an aptamer capable of binding to an antigen
      of interest. DNA aptamers have been shown to be a useful targeting
      ligand for many biologically and medically relevant targets, and
      have shown potential for in vivo targeting applications.&lt;57,58
      &gt;Thus, an aptamer-functionalized nanoflower can be used to
      deliver the nanoflower to a desired target (such as a particular
      cell type). In one embodiment, a gold nanoflower comprises an
      AS1411 aptamer, which binds specifically to nucleolin, a protein
      that is over expressed ~20-fold on the surface of certain cancer
      cells and is an exemplary binding target for human breast cancer
      cells, e.g., MCF-7.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Molecules of interest (e.g., antibodies, peptides,
      proteins, drug molecules) may be attached to nucleic
      acid-functionalized gold nanoflowers by conventional coupling
      techniques. For example, molecules of interest can be attached to
      DNA-functionalized gold nanoflowers by conventional gold or DNA
      coupling techniques. In some embodiments, the nucleic acid
      oligomers may be chemically modified to facilitate
      functionalization with, e.g., antibodies, peptides, proteins,
      and/or drug molecules. In other embodiments, the molecules of
      interest may be attached directly to the nanoflower surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] Nanoflower-antibody conjugates may be used to deliver NFs
      to desired targets. For example, an antibody that recognizes a
      particular target antigen on a cell surface may be conjugated to
      the NF. Alternatively, the NF may be conjugated to an antibody
      that recognizes, e.g., mouse monoclonal antibodies. In such an
      embodiment, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for a target
      antigen may be administered to a subject where it binds to the
      target antigen, followed by administration of the anti-mouse
      antibody-NF conjugate.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] In one embodiment, an antibody-NF conjugate may be used for
      imaging target cells. For example, antibodies to an antigen found
      on the surface of cancer cells may be conjugated to NFs. The
      antibody-NFs may be administered to a subject, with the antibody
      then recognizing and binding to the cancer cell antigens. The
      cancer cells may be imaged by any suitable method, such as CT or
      x-ray imaging.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] In one embodiment, an antibody-NF conjugate may be used in
      photothermal and/or radiotherapy, e.g., for treatment of cancer.
      Photothermal therapy is a technique that converts electromagnetic
      radiation (usually in the form of infrared) into thermal energy as
      a therapeutic technique for medical conditions, such as cancer.
      Gold and silver nanoparticles have emerged as powerful platforms
      for in vitro and in vivo biomedical applications, due to their
      high stability, low toxicity, and ability to be taken up by
      cells.&lt;59 &gt;As the dimensions decrease in metals, the
      properties of the surface become dominant and give nanoparticles
      new properties. As the dimensions decrease in metals, the
      properties of the surface become dominant and give nanoparticles
      new properties. In noble metals, the coherent collective
      oscillation of electrons in the conduction band induces large
      surface electric fields which greatly enhance the radiative
      properties of gold and silver nanoparticles when they interact
      with resonant electromagnetic radiation. This makes the absorption
      cross section of these nanoparticles orders of magnitude stronger
      than that of the most strongly absorbing molecules and the light
      scattering cross section orders of magnitude more intense than
      that of organic dyes. It was realized that this intense absorption
      provided a path to efficiently convert IR light to an intense
      local heating around the nanoparticle.&lt;60 &gt;Photothermal
      therapy places these metal nanoparticles only in and around
      diseased and/or cancerous cells to create localized heating that
      would selectively kill the targeted cells without damaging the
      surrounding area.&lt;61 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0124] In order to be considered applicable for in vivo
      applications, nanoparticles should absorb EM radiation most
      efficiently from 700 nm to 900 nm, also known as the near IR
      window where skin, tissues, and hemoglobin have minimum absorption
      and scattering, allowing the radiation to penetrate deep into the
      tissue. The efficiency with which a nanoparticle can convert near
      IR radiation to thermal energy is partly determined by electric
      fields that arise from the oscillations of surface electrons.
      Sharp, pointed features, such as the morphological features of
      nanoflowers, behave as focusing points for such oscillations and
      can dramatically increase the radiative properties at these
      locations.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Gold nanoflowers have been shown to absorb energy in the
      near-infrared region. Absorption of NIR energy will increase the
      temperature of the AuNF. Thus, an antibody-AuNF conjugate bound to
      a cancer cell may be irradiated with NIR radiation, thereby
      heating the AuNF and destroying the cancer cell. Alternatively,
      the AuNFs may be used to increase the dose of x-ray radiation
      received by the cancer cells relative to the dose received by
      normal tissue. The absorption characteristics of AuNFs may allow
      effective treatment (e.g., cancer cell destruction) with less
      radiation than conventional gold nanospheres.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] In other embodiments, nanoflowers may be used to deliver
      molecules of interest to a cell. For example, a drug molecule may
      be conjugated to the NF surface or to the nucleic oligomers
      protruding from the NF surface. Because cells can take up
      DNA-functionalized AuNFs (see Example 6), the AuNF may be used to
      deliver a drug molecule to the cell interior. Alternatively,
      coupling a drug molecule to an NF-antibody conjugate may be used
      to deliver the drug to the immediate environment, or vicinity, of
      a targeted cell. Thus, an anti-cancer drug, for example, could be
      delivered specifically to a tumor site rather than disseminated
      throughout the body. Such methods can be used in combination with
      other therapies, such as other anti-neoplastic therapies, such as
      radiation therapy, chemotherapy immunosuppressants (such as
      Rituximab, steroids), and cytokines (such as GM-CSF).<br>

      [0127] Nanoparticles prepared by embodiments of the disclosed
      method also can be used to make nano-assemblies. Nucleic
      acid-directed nano-assemblies may be used for biosensing and
      nanoscale photonic device applications. A nanoflower
      functionalized with oligomers of a given sequence can be prepared.
      The oligomers can act as ligands to bind and attach additional
      nanoparticles to which complementary oligomers are attached. For
      example, nanoparticles functionalized with poly T oligomers can
      bind to a gold nanoflower functionalized with poly A oligomers via
      the interaction between the poly A and poly T oligomers. (See,
      e.g., FIG. 14a.) However, if the added nanoparticles include
      non-complementary oligomers, then little or no binding occurs. For
      example, nanoparticles with bound poly A oligomers will not bind
      to a poly A-nanoflower. Thus, formation of the nano-assemblies is
      sequence specific. Additionally, the number of oligomers on the
      "central" nanoparticle, or nanoflower, determines in part how many
      "peripheral" nanoparticles including complementary oligomers can
      be attached to form the nano-assembly. As the number of oligomers
      on the central nanoparticle increases, so does the number of
      peripheral nanoparticles that can assemble onto it. One of
      ordinary skill in the art will understand that the number of
      nanoparticles in the nano-assembly also depends at least in part
      upon space constraints and the relative sizes of the
      nanoparticles. A larger central nanoparticle can accommodate more
      peripheral nanoparticles than a smaller central nanoparticle.
      Similarly, using smaller peripheral nanoparticles allows more
      nanoparticles to assemble onto the central nanoparticle.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] These flower-like nanoparticles may also have promising
      applications in SERS (Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy) based
      biosensing. Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique that detects
      and identifies molecules based on their vibrational energy levels
      and corresponding Raman fingerprints. However, Raman scattering
      from the molecules themselves without enhancement is very weak.
      Colloidal Au nanospheres have been used to increase the scattering
      efficiencies of Raman-active molecules by as much as
      10&lt;14&gt;-10&lt;15&gt;-fold.&lt;44 &gt;Compared to these AuNSs
      with smooth surfaces, AuNFs may be a better candidate for
      fabricating SERS-active tags for a number of reasons: (i) the tips
      of the nanoscale bumps and the nanocavities on the AuNF surface
      have strong localized near-field enhancement effects&lt;45,46&gt;;
      (ii) AuNFs have a larger total surface area due to the roughness
      of the AuNF surface; and/or (iii) the surface plasmon resonance
      peaks of the AuNFs (e.g., 630 nm for AuNFs) are nearer to the
      excitation wavelength, which provides stronger enhancement
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Nanoparticles with different shapes have different
      physiochemical properties. Thus, new nanoparticle shapes such as
      nanoplates, nanostars, etc., have unique optical and/or electrical
      properties that are significantly different from nanospheres or
      nanoflowers. These new nanoparticles may have an improved
      performance in SERS sensing, and imaging and drug delivery in
      comparison with nanospheres. Furthermore, these nanoparticles with
      different light scattering properties may also be used
      collectively for multiplex sensing or imaging by encoding each
      target with a different type of nanomaterial. For example, a
      nanoplate may be functionalized (e.g., with an antibody or an
      oligonucleotide probe) to couple to one target, while a nanostar
      may be functionalized to couple to a different target.<br>

      [0131] Shapes and sizes of gold nanoparticles as well as the
      nano-assemblies were analyzed using a JEOL 2010LaB6 transmission
      electron microscope (TEM) operated at 200 kV. Samples were
      prepared by putting a drop of a nanoparticle solution onto a
      carbon-coated copper TEM grid (Ted pella).<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Absorbance of the nanoparticle solutions was characterized

      [0133] Darkfield light-scattering images were acquired using a

      Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were imaged with a Plan-Neofluar
      10* objective (NA=0.3). Prior to acquisition, the digital camera
      was white-balanced using Zeiss Axiovision software so that colors
      observed in the digital images represented the true color of the

      [0135] The concentration of purified 20-nm citrate-coated gold
      nanospheres (AuNSs) was calculated based on the Beer-Lambert law
      (extinction coefficient of 20-nm AuNS at 520 nm is 9.406*10&lt;8
      &gt;M&lt;-1 &gt;cm&lt;-1&gt;) and then adjusted to 0.5 nM and
      resuspended in pure water. A 300 [mu]L aliquot of 0.5 nM 20-nm
      AuNS solution was first incubated with 1 [mu]M of DNA (poly A30,
      poly C30 or poly T30) for 15 min to let DNA adsorb onto the AuNS
      surface. This step was followed by addition of 15 [mu]L of 400 mM
      NH2OH (adjusted to pH 5 with NaOH) to produce a final
      concentration of 20 mM NH2OH. Three types of 30-mer DNAs
      consisting of poly A, poly C, or poly T (designated as A30, C30,
      and T30, respectively) were used. After vortexing, 2.1 [mu]L 1%
      (wt/wt) HAuCl4 was introduced to AuNS mixture solution (final
      concentration of HAuCl4 was 167 [mu]M), and the mixture was
      rigorously vortexed to facilitate the reduction. A color change
      was observed in seconds. The mixture solution was constantly
      vortexed for another 15 min until the reaction was complete. Based
      on the DNA sequences used and their shape, the synthesized gold
      nanoparticles were called AuNF_A30, AuNF_C30 or AuNS_T30
      respectively. Surprisingly, nanoparticle solutions synthesized in
      the presence of A30 or C30 were blue colored, while the
      nanoparticle solution synthesized with T30 was red colored (FIG.
      1b). The resultant solutions were stable for days without showing
      any nanoparticle aggregation or color change.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] To determine the morphology of the nanoparticles prepared
      with different DNA sequences, transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM) was employed to investigate each of the resulted
      nanoparticle solutions. Surprisingly, those particles synthesized
      with A30 or C30 were flower shaped (designated as AuNF_A30 and
      AuNF_C30) (FIGS. 2a, 2b), while particles synthesized with T30
      were spherical (AuNP_T30, FIG. 2c). The flower-shaped gold
      nanoparticles had a broad surface plasmon absorbance that peaked
      at 600 nm (for AuNF_C30) or 630 nm (for AuNF_A30) (FIG. 1a), which
      is consistent with the absorbance of gold nanoflowers prepared by
      other reported methods.&lt;36 &gt;<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Poly G30 was not tested due to synthetic difficulties
      caused by the formation of a guanine tetraplex structure.&lt;37
      &gt;Instead, a shorter DNA consisting of 10-mer poly G was tested,
      and the resulting nanoparticles were nearly spherical (FIG. 3). In
      contrast, only spherical nanoparticles were formed in the absence
      of DNA (FIG. 2d) or in the presence of salt only (FIGS. 4a and b).<br>
      <br>
      [0138] No metal nanoparticles were formed upon mixing DNA, NH2OH
      and HAuCl4 together, without the addition of AuNS as seeds. These
      results demonstrated that the DNA mediates the morphology of the
      gold nanoparticles, and the nanoparticle shape is sequence
      dependent.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] To understand the DNA sequence-dependent nanoparticle
      formation and to determine the stability of DNA-adsorbed AuNs, the
      adsorption step of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) on AuNS was
      investigated. Unmodified ssDNA is able to adsorb onto AuNS, and
      enhances the electrostatic repulsion between AuNSs, thereby
      reducing or preventing salt-induced aggregation.&lt;38 &gt;First,
      100 [mu]L of 1 nM, 20 nm AuNS solutions were incubated with 1
      [mu]M DNA (either poly A30, poly C30, or poly T30, respectively).
      After 15 min incubation, 0.1 M NaCl was introduced to each of the
      solutions. UV-vis spectroscopy was used to record the absorbance
      of each solution before and after the addition of NaCl.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] As shown in FIGS. 5a-e, aggregation of AuNS happened
      immediately when the T30 DNA sequence was used for incubation with
      the AuNS, while AuNS incubated with A30 or C30 sequences remained
      stable. Since the stability of the AuNS at the same salt
      concentration is determined by the number of DNA adsorbed on its
      surface,39 it was concluded that many fewer T30 molecules were
      adsorbed onto the AuNS surface compared to A30 or C30, which is
      consistent with the lower binding affinity of T30 towards the gold
      nanoparticle surface. This result explains the differences in
      shaping the gold nanoparticle by the T30 sequence in comparison
      with A30 or C30.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] To further evaluate the mechanism of shape control process
      of the flower-shaped nanoparticle directed by DNA, varying amounts
      of HAuCl4 were added to A30, which was incubated with AuNS and 20
      mM NH2OH to initiate the reduction. Since NH2OH was in large
      excess, it was expected that the HAuCl4 would be completely
      reduced to gold metal in the presence of AuNS seeds.&lt;35 &gt;As
      shown in FIGS. 6a-f, with the addition of increasing amount of
      HAuCl4, the resultant nanoparticle evolved from sphere shape to a
      bud sphere and then into the flower-like shape. Upon further
      increase of the HAuCl4 amount, the flower shaped nanoparticle
      would grow even bigger.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] In order to investigate how the nanoparticle morphology was
      affected by the number of DNA oligomers adsorbed on AuNS, varying
      amounts of A30 were incubated with AuNS and followed by reduction
      of equal amounts of HAuCl4. FIGS. 7a-f shows that the nanoparticle
      shape changed from spherical to flower-like with increasing
      numbers of DNA oligomers adsorbed on AuNS, while the size of the
      gold nanoparticle remained the same. From the above observations,
      it was determined that DNA of chain-like structure was able to
      direct the deposition of the reduced gold metal on the AuNS and
      guide the nanoparticle growth from a spherical into a flower-like
      shape. This conclusion was further supported by the control
      experiments, which showed that when the single deoxynucleotide,
      adenosine monophosphate (AMP) was incubated with AuNS instead of a
      DNA chain, the nanoparticles obtained were nearly spherical, while
      a random 30-mer DNA sequence of mixed A, T, G, C caused the
      formation of flower-shaped nanoparticles (FIGS. 8a-b).<br>
      <br>
      [0143] To further probe this DNA mediated AuNF growing process,
      the absorbance of AuNF growth solution was monitored using
      UV-visible spectroscopy. As shown in FIG. 9, after initiation of
      the reaction for 3 seconds, the intensity of the nanoparticle
      absorbance increased significantly, and the peak of the AuNSs at
      520 nm broadened and red-shifted. With growth of the AuNS, a new
      absorbance peak at 630 nm from the resultant AuNFs appeared, and
      the reaction completed in about 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] This time-dependent AuNF growth process was further studied
      using TEM by stopping the reaction at the early stages of NP
      growth with excess mercaptopropionic acid (MPA). MPA has been
      shown to quench the NP growth effectively by forming the less
      reactive Au(I)-MPA complex with gold ion.&lt;40 &gt;As shown in
      FIGS. 10a-r, both the 20-nm AuNSs and 1-3 nm small nanoparticles
      (SNPs) could be observed after initiation of the reaction at 0.5
      second.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] A further control experiment showed that formation of the
      SNPs could be due to the conversion of Au(I)-MPA complexes into
      metal particles on the TEM grid upon electron-beam irradiation
      during TEM imaging (FIG. 11). Flower-like nanoparticle
      intermediates were observed after 2 seconds of reaction in both
      A30 and T30 mediated syntheses. Interestingly, the flower-like
      intermediates prepared with T30 grew further into nanospheres
      within 30 s while the intermediates prepared with A30 maintained
      their flower-like structure and stable AuNFs were produced. In the
      absence of DNA, the AuNSs grew into bigger nanospheres and no
      flower-like intermediate was observed. These results suggest that
      DNA adsorbed on the AuNS surface acts as a template to mediate the
      formation of flower-like gold nanoparticles. The formation of the
      AuNF results from either selective deposition of the reduced gold
      metal on AuNS templated by surface-bound DNA or from uneven growth
      of the AuNS due to the binding of DNA to the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] As depicted in FIG. 12, due to the strong binding affinity
      of poly A (SEQ ID NO: 4) or poly C (SEQ ID NO: 6) to AuNS, a
      number of A30 or C30 bind tightly to AuNS and induce the
      inhomogeneous growth of AuNS, producing the flower-like
      nanoparticles. In contrast, fewer poly T molecules bind weakly and
      loosely to AuNS. The weakly bound poly T molecules produce the
      flower-like intermediates at a very initial stage. However, they
      are not able to stabilize the flower-like structures, and the
      spherical particles are eventually formed.<br>

      mM thiolated DNA was first mixed with 1.5 [mu]L of 10 mM TCEP

      acetate buffer (pH 5.2) to activate the thiolated DNA. After a
      30-minute reaction, the mixture was transferred into 3 mL of 5-nm
      AuNS solution (82 nM, in pure water) followed by addition of 10 mM
      Tris-HCl buffer (Tris=2-amino-2-hydroxymethyl-1,3-propanediol, pH

      [0148] Fluorophore (FAM) labeled poly A30 was used for AuNF
      synthesis. The AuNFs were synthesized by incubating 1 [mu]M of
      Fluorophore (FAM) labeled poly A30 (FAM-A30) with 300 [mu]L of 0.5
      nM 20 nm AuNS solution for 15 min. 15 [mu]L of 400 mM NH2OH (pH 5)
      and 2.1 [mu]L 1% (wt/wt) HAuCl4 were added to the nanoparticle
      solution to initiate the AuNF formation (three samples were
      prepared separately). Meanwhile, 300 [mu]L 1 [mu]M FAM-A30
      solutions were prepared with the addition of 15 [mu]L of 400 mM
      NH2OH (pH 5) and 2.1 [mu]L pure water and these solutions were
      used as control solutions. After AuNF synthesis, the supernatants
      were collected by removing the nanoparticles with centrifugation.
      The oligonucleotide concentrations in both the collected
      supernatants and the control solutions were quantified and
      compared by using UV absorbances at 260 nm. The DNA concentration
      in the supernatants was 825.6 nM, so the DNA attached to the AuNFs
      during synthesis were 174.4 nM. Dividing this number by the AuNS
      concentration (0.5 nM), it was estimated that the average number
      of attached oligonucleotides on each AuNF was ~349.<br>

      <br>
      [0149] To probe the stability of the DNA attached to AuNFs, the
      number of oligonucleotides on AuNFs after treatment with
      mercaptoethanol was quantified using a fluorescence-based
      method.&lt;56 &gt;The AuNF solutions (0.5 nM) were treated with
      mercaptoethanol (ME) to a final concentration of 14 mM overnight.
      The solutions containing the displaced oligonucleotides were
      separated from AuNFs by centrifugation. Each supernatant (100
      [mu]L) was added to 400 [mu]L 62.5 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2).
      The pH and ionic strength of the sample and calibration standard
      solutions were kept the same for all measurements due to the
      sensitivity of the fluorescent properties of FAM to these
      conditions. The fluorescence maximums (520 nm) were measured and
      then converted to molar concentrations of the FAM labeled
      oligonucleotides by using a standard linear calibration curve.
      Standard curves were carried out with known concentrations of
      fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotides under same buffer pH, salt,
      and mercaptoethanol concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The average number of displaced oligonucleotides for each
      AuNF was obtained by dividing the calculated oligonucleotide molar
      concentration by the original AuNF concentration. The results
      demonstrated only ~110 strands were displaced by mercaptoethanol
      (ME), and the majority (~240 strands) was still bound to the AuNF
      after the treatment. Thiol-gold chemistry is the most used method
      to conjugate DNA to gold surface. Under the same ME (14 mM)
      treatment, however, all of the thiolated DNA oligonucleotides were
      displaced by ME from the gold surface.&lt;42 &gt;<br>

      [0151] Considering the remarkably high binding affinity of DNA to
      the AuNFs (higher than thiol-gold binding), it was hypothesized
      that the DNA in situ attached to AuNFs during reduction could be
      partially buried in the AuNFs. To test this hypothesis and also
      the functionality of the DNA on the AuNFs, experiments were
      performed to test the melting point of the DNA in-situ attached on
      the AuNFs.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] AuNFs were first treated with thiolated PEG (polyethylene
      glycol, 6 [mu]M) molecules overnight to displace any weakly bound
      DNA on AuNF surfaces.&lt;43 &gt;Purified AuNF_A30 (2 nM) was
      hybridized with fluorophore (FAM) labeled Poly T30 (FAM-T30) (1
      [mu]M) in a buffer solution containing 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.1)
      and 50 mM NaCl. The mixture solution was heated up to 65[deg.] C.
      and cooled down to room temperature in about two hours. The
      unhybridized fluorophore strands were removed by centrifugation,
      and the AuNFs (2 nM) were redispersed in the same buffer solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] A fluorimeter (FluoroMax-P; Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison,
      N.J.) coupled with a temperature controller was used to obtain the
      melting curve of the DNA hybridization on AuNFs. Since a gold
      nanoparticle can effectively quench the fluorescence from its
      surrounding fluorophores, the release of the fluorophore labeled
      DNA from AuNFs due to DNA melting will result in a fluorescence
      increase of the nanoparticle solution. The sample was kept at
      target temperatures for 72 seconds after the temperature was
      reached to ensure that the sample was at the stated temperature
      during data collection at each temperature. As a comparison, free
      A30 labeled with an organic quencher (Blank Hole Quencher-1, 200
      nM)) was hybridized with FAM-T30 (200 nM) in the same buffer under
      identical conditions, and its melting curve was collected as well.<br>

      situ attached to AuNFs (around 42[deg.] C.) was significantly
      lower than the free DNA (around 50[deg.] C.). This result
      indicated that a small segment of DNA might be buried in the AuNFs
      during the nanoparticle growth, while the majority part of DNA
      exposed outside was still functional for DNA hybridization.<br>

        DNA-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0155] The synthesized AuNF_A30 solution was first purified by
      centrifugation (9000*g, 5 min.) twice and then redispersed in
      water. The AuNF_A30 particles were then treated with 6 [mu]M mPEG
      thiol for 2 hours and purified. After purification, AuNF_A30 (0.5
      nM) was mixed with purified AuNS (50 nM) modified with thiolated
      complementary DNA (AuNS5nm-S_A30 or AuNS5nm-S_T30 respectively) in
      the presence of 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 0.1 M NaCl. The
      mixture solution was incubated overnight to allow nano-assembly.
      The same procedure was used to assemble AuNS_T30 with
      AuNS5nm-S_A30 or AuNS5nm-S_T30. After incubation, the nanoparticle
      mixture solution was centrifuged at (9000*g, 2 min.) to remove
      free 5-nm gold nanoparticles in the supernatant, and the pellet
      was redispersed in buffer solution for TEM sample preparation.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] TEM was then employed to assess the assembly of the
      nanoparticles. As shown in FIG. 14a, AuNF_A30 was surrounded by a
      number of AuNS5nm_S_T30, forming the satellite structure. As a
      comparison, when 5-nm AuNS functionalized with non-complementary
      DNA A30 (AuNS5nm_S_A30) were used to incubate with AuNF_A30, no
      assembly was observed (FIG. 14b). Additional large-area TEM images
      containing multiple satellite assembled nanostructures are shown
      in FIGS. 15a-d. These results further confirmed that the DNA
      molecules were not only densely functionalized to AuNFs in a large
      number, but also retained their molecule recognition properties.
      Interestingly, when AuNS_T30 were incubated with AuNS5nm_S_A30
      under similar conditions, only a few 5-nm particles were assembled
      on AuNS_T30, while little assembly was observed with
      non-complementary AuNS5nm_S_T30 (FIGS. 14c, 14d). This observation
      indicates that fewer numbers of T30 oligonucleotides were attached
      during synthesis, consistent with the fact that fewer T30
      oligonucleotides were adsorbed on AuNS compared to A30 or C30.<br>

      <br>
      [0157] SERS enhancement from DNA functionalized AuNFs was compared
      with AuNSs. Raman tag labeled DNA (Trama-A30) was used to grow
      AuNFs and then the Raman signal was collected. As shown in FIG.
      16, under the same conditions (excitation (603 nm), nanoparticle
      concentration (0.5 nM), etc.), the Raman signal from the Raman tag
      with the AuNFs was clearly observed while the signal from the
      Raman tag with AuNS was too low to distinguish. These results
      indicated that AuNFs provide a much stronger SERS effect over the
      AuNS. The Raman spectrometer was a home-made instrument located at
      Materials Research Lab at University of Illinois.<br>

      <br>
      [0158] AuNFs were synthesized with 1 [mu]M of fluorophore (FAM)
      labeled poly A30 (FAM-A30) by following the procedure in Example
      2. The AuNFs were purified by centrifugation.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells were cultured in
      Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM; Cell Media Facility,
      University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, Ill.)
      supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (50
      U/ml), and streptomycin (50 [mu]g/ml), at 37[deg.] C. in a
      humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were seeded at a density of
      1*10&lt;5 &gt;cells/cm&lt;2 &gt;on 4 well Lab-Tek chambered #1
      Borosilicate coverglass system (Fisher Scientific), and the cells
      were grown for 24 hours before treatment with nanoparticles. After
      18 hours, the cells were washed with 1*PBS buffer and fresh media
      was added.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] To investigate the cell uptake of the AuNFs, nanoparticles
      (0.5 nM or 1 nM) synthesized with fluorophore (FAM) labeled A30
      were added to the cells and incubated for 18 hours. Excess AuNFs
      were removed by washing the cells with 1*PBS five times prior to
      imaging.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] Dark-field light-scattering images were taken to visualize
      the AuNF uptake by the cells.&lt;47 &gt;The light scattering
      property of the AuNFs was first investigated using a dark-field
      microscope coupled to a CCD digital camera. The digital camera was
      white-balanced so that the observed colors represented the true
      color of the scattered light. The AuNFs showed bright orange color
      in the dark field image (FIG. 17). As shown in FIG. 18a, the
      orange dots representing the AuNFs were observed in the
      intracellular region of the cells while the untreated control
      cells appeared dim yellow to green color due to the intrinsic
      cellular scattering (FIG. 18b). This nanoparticle cellular uptake
      was further confirmed by the 3-D reconstructed confocal microscope
      images of the AuNF treated cells, showing that the AuNFs were
      distributed inside the cells (FIGS. 19a-h). The results
      demonstrated that AuNFs entered into cells during the incubation.
      It is believed that this ability of the AuNF to be taken up by the
      cell might be due to the high DNA loading on the AuNF
      surface&lt;48 &gt;and/or the shape effect.&lt;49 &gt;The cellular
      uptake ability and light scattering property make the AuNFs
      promising nanocarriers for drug or gene delivery and contrast
      agents for intracellular imaging.<br>

        Nanoparticles</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0162] Gold nanoprisms were synthesized in the presence of
      surfactants and iodine by following a previously reported
      method.&lt;50 &gt;After removing the free surfactant with
      centrifugation, these purified nanoseeds were incubated with DNA
      of different sequences (A30, T30, C30) respectively for 15
      minutes. NH2OH and HAuCl4 were then added to the nanoparticle
      solution to initiate the particle growth.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] The morphologies of the prepared nanoparticles were studied
      using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Surprisingly, the
      nanoprisms incubated with A30 or C30 grew into thicker round
      nanoplates, while nanoprisms incubated with T30 grew into 2-D
      six-angled nanostars (FIGS. 20a-c). Nanoprisms incubated with G10
      also produced 2-D multiple angled nanostars were produced (FIG.
      20d). These results demonstrated that DNA of different sequences
      could direct the growth of the nanoprism into different shapes,
      and each sequence encodes the formation of nanoparticles with
      certain shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] Nanoparticle growth was also tested using gold nanorods as
      seeds. Remarkably, the nanorods (FIG. 21a) were converted into
      dogbone-like nanoparticles in the presence of A30 after growth
      (FIG. 21b), while the nanorods were converted into peanut-like
      nanoparticles in the presence of T30 (FIG. 21c).<br>
      <br>
      [0165] These results indicate that embodiments of the DNA-mediated
      shape-control method can be readily adapted to synthesize other
      non-spherical nanoparticles. This method can be used as a general
      methodology to control growth of metal nanoparticles, and holds
      great promise to produce a series of novel nanoparticles with
      different shapes and unique properties.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Nanoflower Size and Quality
        Control</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0166] Nanoflower size can be precisely controlled by controlling
      the growth conditions for nanoflowers, e.g., by varying the amount
      of gold available and/or by varying the nanoseed size.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] In one example, nanoflowers were synthesized using 300
      [mu]L of a 0.5 nM solution of 13-nm gold nanoseeds (synthesized
      according to available protocols) with increasing amounts of a 1%
      w/v solution of HAuCl4, and the resulting nanoflowers were
      analyzed by TEM. The nanoseeds were incubated with an AS1411
      aptamer (1 [mu]M; SEQ ID NO: 2) or a randomized control construct
      (1 [mu]M; SEQ ID NO: 1) prior to gold salt reduction. The protocol
      described above in Example 1 was followed during synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] As shown in FIGS. 22a-d, increasing gold salt concentration
      under identical conditions leads to increasing nanoflower size
      with good uniformity. Using additional gold resulted in
      non-uniform structures (not shown). FIGS. 22a-d are TEM images of
      nanoflowers synthesized with the AS1411 aptamer under the

      [0169] The relationship between gold salt concentration and
      nanoflower size was determined to be linear (FIGS. 23a-b). The
      nanoflowers in FIG. 23a were synthesized with the randomized DNA
      construct, and the nanoflowers in FIG. 23b were synthesized with
      the AS1411 aptamer.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] In another example, nanoflower size was controlled by
      varying the size of the nanoseed. Nanoflowers were synthesized
      using 1 [mu]M AS1411 aptamer and 1% w/v HAuCl4 with 15-nm, 30-nm,
      and 50-nm gold nanoparticles as nanoseeds. FIGS. 24a-c are TEM
      images of the nanoflowers grown from 15-nm, 30-nm, and 50-nm gold
      nanoparticle seeds synthesized with the AS1411 aptamer under the
      conditions shown in Table 2. The protocol described above in
      Example 1 was followed during synthesis. As seen in FIGS. 24a-c,
      the nanoflower size increased with increasing nanoseed size.<br>

      [0171] The nanoflower structure is ideally suited for photothermal

      be tuned to absorb strongly within the near-IR window (i.e., from
      700 nm to 900 nm). As shown in FIG. 25, the nanoflowers grown from
      50-nm gold nanoparticle seeds are candidates for photothermal
      applications with an absorption peak at 800 nm.<br>

      [0172] Two types of nanoflowers were synthesized. The first

      construct was identical except the aptamer sequence was randomized
      (SEQ ID NO: 1). The DNA sequences are shown in Table 3 below. Both
      types of nanoflowers were grown from 15 nm gold seeds and
      incubated with MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer cells).
      Nanoflowers were synthesized following the protocol described
      above in Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] Cells were incubated and grown according to standard
      procedures and plated on glass cover slips inside a 6-well plate
      (~100,000 cells per well). Cells were incubated for 12 hours in
      cell medium (10% FBS) and washed with PBS buffer. After washing,
      the cells were incubated with 100 [mu]L of nanoflower solution (10
      nM suspended in deionized water) diluted with 900 [mu]L of
      Opti-MEM for 2 hours at 37[deg.] C. and 5% CO2. After incubation,

      [0177] The antibody (or small molecule) may be conjugated to the
      gold surface or to a DNA oligomer. The antibody-AuNF conjugates
      may then be administered to a subject using routine methods, for
      example by injection (for example intratumorally or i.v.). After
      waiting for a period of time sufficient to allow the conjugates to
      travel to and bind to the tumor cell antigens, the conjugates may
      be visualized by CT or x-ray imaging, thus permitting
      visualization of the tumor.<br>
      <br>
      [0178] Alternatively, an antibody that recognizes a tumor cell
      antigen may be prepared. A second antibody that recognizes the
      anti-antigen antibody may be conjugated to the AuNFs. The
      anti-antigen antibody and the antibody-AuNF conjugates may be
      administered sequentially or simultaneously to the subject. After
      waiting for a period of time sufficient to allow the anti-antigen
      antibody to bind to the tumor cell antigen, and the antibody-AuNF
      conjugates to bind to the anti-antigen antibody, the conjugates
      may be visualized by CT or x-ray imaging.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] In some examples, the antibody-AuNF conjugates are used to
      image tumor cells ex vivo. For example, tumor cells from a subject
      can be obtained (for example during a biopsy), and then incubated
      with the antibody-AuNF conjugates under conditions that permit the
      antibody to bind to its target protein. IN some examples live
      cells are incubated with the antibody-AuNF conjugates, while in
      other examples killed or fixed cells are incubated with the
      antibody-AuNF conjugates. The cells can be processed for imaging
      (for example fixed and embedded), for example using electron

        Nanoparticles</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0180] Embodiments of the disclosed shaped nanoparticles (e.g.,
      nanoflowers, nanoplates, nanostars, nanopeanuts, etc.) may be
      delivered to a target cell of interest for use in photothermal
      therapy. A shaped nanoparticle of a particular size and shape may
      be selected based on its absorbance of energy within a given
      wavelength range, e.g., near-infrared radiation. In certain
      embodiments, the shaped nanoparticle is conjugated to a moiety
      capable of recognizing and binding to the target cell. Suitable
      moieties include but are not limited to antibodies and fragments
      thereof, drug molecules, proteins, peptides, and aptamers.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] In one example, AuNF conjugates may be delivered to tumor
      cells by the methods outlined in Example 10. Suitable AuNF doses
      may range from 20 mg per kg body weight to 20 g per kg body
      weight. Because AuNF conjugates are capable of absorbing
      near-infrared (NIR) radiation, the tumor site may be irradiated
      with NIR radiation (700 nm-1500 nm), such as from an NIR laser.
      For example, a red laser that emits light with a wavelength of 790
      to 820 nm or 800 nm to 810 nm (such as 800 nm or 810 nm) may be
      used. In one example, the tumor is irradiated at a dose of at
      least 0.5 W/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 2 to 60 minutes, for example 5 to 30
      minutes or 3 to 10 minutes, such as at least 2 W/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 2
      to 60 minutes, for example 5 to 30 minutes or 3 to 10 minutes, at
      least 10 W/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 2 to 60 minutes, for example 5 to 30
      minutes or 3 to 10 minutes, or 0.5 to 50 W/cm&lt;2 &gt;for 2 to 60
      minutes, for example 5 to 30 minutes or 3 to 10 minutes. The tumor
      cells may be destroyed via photothermal heating caused when the
      AuNFs absorb energy from the laser.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Drug Delivery with Shaped
        Nanoparticles</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0182] Embodiments of the disclosed shaped nanoparticles (e.g.,
      nanoflowers, nanoplates, nanostars, nanopeanuts, etc.) may be
      utilized to deliver a therapeutic drug molecule to a subject. For
      example, AuNFs can be synthesized as described in Example 1.
      Therapeutic drug molecules may be conjugated to the AuNFs by any
      suitable means. The drug molecule may be conjugated to the gold
      surface or to a DNA oligomer. The drug-AuNF conjugate may then be
      administered to a subject as described above at a therapeutically
      effective dose. The drug-AuNF conjugates may be taken up by cells
      (e.g., by endocytosis or receptor-mediated endocytosis), thereby
      delivering drug to the cell interior. In one example, the drug is
      a chemotherapeutic agent, and is administered to a subject in
      order to treat a tumor in the subject.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] Alternatively, the drug-AuNF conjugate may further be
      conjugated to an antibody that recognizes an antigen on a target
      cell. The drug-AuNF-antibody conjugate may be administered to a
      subject. The antibody may then bind to the target cell antigen,
      thereby delivering the drug to the immediate vicinity of the
      target cell while minimizing drug delivery to non-target cells.<br>
