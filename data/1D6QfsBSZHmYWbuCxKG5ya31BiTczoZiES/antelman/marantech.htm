            <p>What ever happened to the Aids cure Tetrasilver Tetroxide
              (US Patent #5,676,977) which you commented about a few
              years ago. The company marantech is gone from the net and

            <p>Although the company appears to have vanished there was a
              small study reported last year from Kinshasa on
              Tetrasilver Tetroxide (Imusil). Here is the link. </p>
            <p>Actually not all the news was bad. Of the 3 subjects
              treated, one had a false positive HIV test with a negative
              HIV viral load at baseline this subject appears to have
              done quite well after treatment. The other 2 subjects who
              actually were infected with HIV did not so well with a
              consistent increase in viral load following Imusil. </p>

            </center>
            <p>Dear Dr. Pierone, MD. </p>
            <p>Recently you were asked online about the possibility that
              Tetrasilver Tetroxide was patented as a "cure" for
              AIDS/HIV. Your response was that it was a pesticide with
              "little hope" and you gave an EPA reference. </p>
            <p>I would invite you to look at Dr. Marvin S. Antelman's
              background as a world renowned chemist, who patented the
              Tetrasilver, and now Tetracopper, TetraCobolt, (there are
              many other) Tetroxides multivalent crystal redox
              devices...as well as USPTO Patents pertaining to these
              devices as to their pharmaceutical efficacy against
              bacteria, fungus and viruses. Because these novel devices
              are miniature reduction/oxidation devices that have
              polyvalent cations in their crystall latices, they posess
              unique electrical activity, and activity against
              pathogens, unlike the mechanism of action of other
              anti-virals aimed at fusion inhibition or viral
              replication via those target sites (eg. cell surface
              receptors, GP41/GP120 or transcriptases) or the terrible
              toxic-poisons known as nucleoside-derivates...AZT might as
              well be the HIV equivalent to Uracil Mustard. </p>
            <p>In your expert medical opinions, before to discount
              Ag404, Could you please review USPTO Patents
              (5,676,977)(6,645,531)(5,571,520) (5,336,499) &amp;
              (6,258,385)...all relevant on Imusil (infusion) and
              Tetrasil(Tetrasil marketed as a topical ointment)..both
              Ag404...you're previous reference to the EPA compound was
              one of Dr. Antelman's earlier compounds used as an agent
              against bacteria in water sources. These newer compounds
              are formulated and being tested in vitro/vivo against HIV,
              Herpses, and other viral agents and bacteria and have
              shown great efficacy against the virus and associated
              infections in AIDS patients. You can contact Dr. Marvin S.
              Antelman yourself as well at the Weizmann Institute in
              Rehovot, Israel. impy@netvision.net.il. </p>
            <p>I think its important to look at the data, the science,
              and the real possibility that the antivirals on the market
              including Fuzeon (Trimeris) may have a unique competitor
              that has fewer toxic effects, and a wide spectral activity
              against many human pathogens. </p>
            <p>I would love to see/hear your response after reading thru
              those patents... If you would like to rephrase the reply
              to your last questionaire that it "doesn't look promising"
              after more thorough research, that would be delightful. </p>
            <p>Not only is it "promising", it appears to work. </p>
            <p>Best, Mark </p>

            <p>I first thought that Tetrasil was just another harmless
              and ineffective treatment promoted by herb merchants. The
              patent reports are beyond imagination and show that this
              is really scary stuff! </p>
            <p>Data are presented with intravenous infusions of Tetrasil
              in a clinic in Honduras for people with the "candidiasis
              etiological category of AIDS". Well, did they have HIV at
              all? One would never know from this "research report". </p>
            <p>"All were terminal, some, however, were in moderate
              condition, and others in poor" What is this nonsense about
              terminal AIDS patients? </p>
            <p>"...indicates whether hepatomegaly occurred. This was an
              unfortunate consequence of the treatment which resulted in
              enlarged livers in all patients except the second one"
              Unfortunate, indeed! </p>
            <p>As I read this patent report detailing the "cure" or AIDS
              with Tetrasil my overwhelming sense was that the evidence
              presented would fail a 5th grade science project. But
              beyond that, the studies detailed were unethical to the
              exteme. </p>
            <p>Stay away from this stuff like the plague! </p>
            <p>See excepts below: </p>
            <p>Five patients afflicted with AIDS of the candidiasis
              etiological category were segregated for Tetrasil
              treatment. The rationale for selecting them was based on
              facts presented in an article by Peter H. Duesberg and
              Brian J. Ellison entitled "Is The AIDS Virus A Science
              Fiction?" (Policy Review, Summer 1990 pp. 40-51). </p>
            <p>Only the factual presentations of the article were
              utilized and the hypothesis of the authors was ignored.
              The facts presented in the article related to the method
              of selecting AIDS patients based on the five
              aforementioned etiological subgroups targeted by the CDC,
              and the evidence presented, that there is AIDS without HIV
              as well as with it so that an anti-viral agent in most
              instances will not necessarily restore the immunity
              system. </p>
            <p>Evaluations with Tetrasil were conducted on AIDS patients
              at Lucha Contra el Sida, Comayaguela, Honduras. The
              patients two weeks prior to inoculation were removed from
              their AZT, AIDS therapy. Tetrasil was administered at
              approximately 40 PPM of blood volume per patient as a
              suspension in a proprietary buffer solution (pH=6.5),
              supplied by Holipharm Corporation. </p>
            <p>The results of evaluations with candidiasis are tabulated
              in Table I under its disease category. All patients
              evaluated were terminal. Some, however, were in moderate
              (m) condition and others in poor (p) as designated in the
              Table. The I and F designations refer to initial and final
              values as shown. WBC indicates white cell blood count. The
              H column, following CD 8, indicates whether hepatomegaly
              occurred. This was an unfortunate consequence of the
              treatment which resulted in enlarged livers in all
              patients except the second one. Despite hepatomegaly,
              there was no interference with liver function. </p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> </p>
            <p>For several years, Boyd Graves and Leonard Horowitz have
              spoken about HIV AIDS being manufactured and funded by the
              US government with the knowledge that it could be used to
              kill massive populations of humans. Since the mid-1980s, I
              have maintained that it is a race-specific weapon and even
              wrote about it being such in 1990-91. It was in 1996 that
              some scientists found this to be the case, linked to the
              CCR5 Delta 32 negative genetic mutation making it
              impossible for millions of whites to contract HIV AIDS.
              Such is not the case for Africans and Asians, the highest
              birthrate groups. I also indicated they manufactured a
              strain of the virus that targeted certain genetic
              characteristics with white homosexual men. The reason for
              the targeting of this group was because eugenicists
              discovered that where there is high homosexuality among
              whites, the birthrates are lower. The case I quoted in
              1988-89 was with Denmark and Sweden, having the highest
              homosexuality rate and the lowest negative birthrate of
              all Western European countries. This videos main theme is
              about the patent, purported to be a cure for HIV AIDS. The
              text of this patent in this video is clear and readable.
              Barack Obama has stated publicly that it is absurd to
              believe the US government created the HIV AIDS. We did not
              press him about his wrong assumption because had he stated
              the truth, as most blacks know it to be, it would have
              politically stopped his run for the presidency. You can't
              bring about big changes if you're not the president. It is
              now different and we're going to press this very, very
              serious issue far more devastating to Blacks around the
              world. I promise that we shall make this a key agenda in
              America, far beyond gays wanting to be married. I'm sure
              millions of blacks dying in Africa, in America and
              elsewhere is a much more important issue. It is crippling
              economies all across the African continent with millions
              of orphaned children and adults too sick to work and build
              economies. <br>

            </center>
            <p>TETRASILVER has been studied for over 10 years, showing
              that it is, both, very effective and very safe in skin
              care applications. </p>
            <p><b>In-Vitro Testing:</b> </p>
            <p>"In-vitro" means an artificial environment created
              outside a living organism (e.g., a test tube or culture
              plate) used in experimental research to study a disease or
              process. Before tetraSILVER became our products’ unique
              ingredient it was tested by 14 independent research labs
              against gram-negative bacteria, gram-positive bacteria,
              fungi, yeast, and viruses. The labs included Quintiles,
              Parexel, MDS/Pharma, and other world renowned research
              organizations. Test after test documented the powerful
              antimicrobial properties of tetraSILVER. </p>
            <p><b>Toxicity Testing:</b> </p>
            <p>In 1966, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
              approved tetraSILVER as an effective disinfectant in
              swimming pools, after extensive tests showed this Silver
              Oxide was capable of quickly killing a wide spectrum of
              germs. In the same series of studies, the EPA also
              determined that TetraSILVER was safe, after passing a
              series of oral (swallowing), dermal (skin), and ocular
              (eye) toxicity tests. These tests were very important
              because some people are in pools every day. </p>
            <p><b>Clinical Testing:</b> </p>
            <p>Initial clinical investigations with 328 people
              (conducted by research dermatologists), in addition to
              reports from doctors throughout the world, strongly
              suggest that TetraSILVER, as a key ingredient in skin care
              products, provides outstanding benefits and supports the
              body's ability to quickly resolve many common skin
              problems. </p>

            <p>March 3, 2008 </p>
            <p>Dear Mr. Goldsmith: </p>
            <p>This letter concerns your firm’s marketing of the
              products Tetrasil and Genisil on your websites,
              www.myskincure.com, www.genisil.com and
              www.aidanceskincare.com. According to information on your
              websites, your “Tetrasilver Tetroxide (TST) Ointments,”
              are intended to prevent, treat, or cure disease
              conditions. Statements on your websites that document
              these intended uses include, but are not limited to, the
              following: </p>
            <p>Tetrasil (www.myskincure.com) </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Tetrasil's key ingredient, (TST),
              has a natural attraction to the surface of bacteria, fungi
              and viruses. These pathogens are responsible for the
              itching, rashes, redness, burning and other unwanted
              symptoms of the skin conditions. Upon contact, TST's
              unique chemical structure releases both a micro electrical
              charge and oxygen, which immediately begins to kill the
              pathogens.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Regardless of the stage of your
              Genital Herpes, Tetrasil may begin to provide relief in as
              fast as TWO DAYS.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Before using Tetrasil, I had tried
              using Favmir and Valtrex. Each only worsened the length of
              my outbreaks and their severity. I had tried numerous
              expensive substances, ointments, and injections, and found
              myself being a guinea pig for researchers as well. It had
              been a long, disappointing five-year search only to find
              nothing worked. Tetrasil, however, was going to be the
              last thing I tried, and I am glad I did.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “On your lip, Tetrasil's active
              bio-electro chemistry (TST) surrounds the cold sore and
              quickly begins to attack the herpes simplex virus (HSV)
              that causes the tingling, blistering and weeping.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Tetrasil Spells the End of Herpes
              Related Breakouts” <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, I am a woman with a history of
              Herpes Simplex Virus. About every month I would have a
              severe outbreak on my face caused by the herpes virus. . .
              I have tried many other treatments for my outbreaks, but
              only Tetrasil effectively rid me of them.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “People report success and relief
              from Shingles using Tetrasil during any of the active
              stages of the shingles virus (Herpes Zoster).” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Doctor's Report #2: “Tetrasil is
              effective for the treatment of Erysipelas infections of
              the skin caused by the A Group B-Hemolytic Streptococcus
              and healed the skin in a conducive manner." </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Tetrasil ointment appeared to be
              extremely efficient against the opportunistic pathogens
              present in diabetic feet, as well as the healing of the
              infection." </p>
            <p>Genisil (www.genisil.com) </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “There is NO CURE for Herpes. RIGHT?
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Think again! If you’ve been looking for
              a herpes product that actually delivers on its promises,
              your search is over.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “The silver and oxygen in Genisil
              will begin to kill the inflammation causing herpes virus
              quickly and safely upon contact, BEFORE YOU EVER SEE AN
              OUTBREAK.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “EJC Molecules have a selective
              attraction to exposed nitrogen groups on the membrane
              proteins of bacteria, viruses and fungi. Upon contact,
              EJC's go through an oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction,
              which studies suggest may be instrumental in speeding
              wound healing.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “When oxygen is introduced into the
              area it attacks microbes without a coating and diseased
              cells with deficient wall enzymes. It [oxidises] them,
              allowing them to be cleared from the body and replaced
              with healthy new cells. The broad application of oxygen
              therapy in medicine is based on the simple principle that
              diseased cells cannot exist in the presence of oxygen and
              that cells cannot become diseased if they are supplied
              with sufficient oxygen.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Genisil is a uniquely formulated
              all-natural ointment. It contains a patented compound of
              the most potent natural anti-virals on earth, plus other
              ingredients that work FAST to resolve herpes issues.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “With four silver atoms, patented
              EJC Molecules are significantly more potent than other
              silvers in the speed with which it kills viruses, bacteria
              and fungi, including Staphylococcus aureus, responsible
              for bacterial folliculitis and the yeast responsible for
              fungal folliculitis.” </p>

              found on each website www.myskincure.com &amp;
              www.genisil.com: </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “Doctor's Report <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two patients with severe recurring
              genital herpes outbreaks used it, applying the ointment
              three times daily. Over a period of 2-4 days, the Herpes
              sores regressed and dried out." </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “the frequency of herpes outbreaks
              have been reduced by 50%, as well as their healing time.
              For me, it has been the ONLY product that has helped to
              reduce the reoccurrence and severity of my outbreaks.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “An RN: The sore disappeared in 24
              hours <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a 42 year old female who has
              suffered from Herpes virus for the last 6 years. Trying
              most of the pharmaceutical remedies, nothing seemed to
              work. So I started searching for an alternative. Applying
              it to an area that was inflamed, red, painful and itchy
              (signs of an outbreak for me) the sore disappeared within
              24 hrs and I have not had a sign of it since. It's almost
              been a year. Sherry, R.N., Oregon” </p>
            <p>Claims for TST Ointments found on www.aidanceskincare.com
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “TsT’s Interaction on Herpes Simplex
              Virus: As TST makes contact with the HSV virus, it will
              start electrocuting the gp-G terminals as well as the
              entire protein envelope. TST will continue its REDOX
              reaction and form chelate complexes of silver around the
              entire viral surface. The combination of electrocution and
              chelation will prevent the virus from performing its
              essential life functions and cause its death within
              minutes.” </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • “In addition to EJC’s anti-microbial
              properties, the combination of electrical energy and
              singlet oxygen apparently promote the growth of tissue,
              thus serving as a potential treatment for burn victims and
              other applications requiring a stimulus of tissue growth.”

            <p>These claims are supplemented by the metatags that you
              use to bring consumers to your websites. The metatags
              include “cold sores,” “oral herpes,” “shingles,”
              “treatment for skin disease or disorder,” “herpes,”
              “herpes simplex,” “genital herpes,” “herpes simple virus,”
              “HSV,” “vaginal herpes,” “penal herpes,” “herpes

            <p>Your “Tetrasilver Tetroxide (TST) Ointments,” including
              “Tetrasil,” and “Genisil,” are drugs, as defined by
              section 201(g)(1) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
              Act (the Act), 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1), because they are
              intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation,
              treatment, or prevention of disease. Moreover, these
              products are new drugs, as defined by section 201(p) of
              the Act, 21 U.S.C. § 321(p), because they are not
              generally recognized as safe and effective for their
              labeled uses. Under sections 301(d) and 505(a) of the Act,
              21 U.S.C. §§ 331(d) and 355(a), a new drug may not be
              introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate
              commerce unless an FDA-approved application is in effect
              for it. Your sale of Tetrasil and Genisil without approved
              applications violates these provisions of the Act. </p>
            <p>Furthermore, because Tetrasil and Genisil are offered for
              conditions, such as herpes, which are not amenable to
              self-diagnosis and treatment by individuals who are not
              medical practitioners, adequate directions cannot be
              written so that a layman can use it safely for their
              intended uses. Thus, your products’ labeling fails to bear
              adequate directions for their intended uses, causing them
              to be misbranded under section 502(f)(1) of the Act, 21
              U.S.C. § 352(f)(1). </p>
            <p>Moreover, your Tetrasilver Tetroxide (TST) Ointments, to
              the extent that they are labeled and promoted for over the
              counter (OTC) use, are subject to 21 CFR § 310.548, which
              states that there is a lack of adequate data to establish
              general recognition of the safety and effectiveness of
              silver salts for OTC use in the treatment or prevention of
              any disease. Any OTC drug products containing these
              ingredients that are promoted, labeled, or represented for
              the treatment or prevention of any disease are regarded as
              new drugs within the meaning of section 201(p) of the Act,
              21 U.S.C. § 321(p), and require approved applications
              under section 505 for marketing. Thus, Tetrasil and
              Genisil are unapproved new drugs and their delivery into
              interstate commerce violates section 301(d) of the Act, 21
              U.S.C. § 331(d). </p>

              common skin problems on the head, face, neck, arms, chest,
              back, and legs. The all-natural ingredients in Tetrasil
              include natural jojoba oil, beeswax, the tetraSILVER®
              silver oxide, and an essential oil from the palmarosa
              plant. </p>

            <p>According to the manufacturer: </p>
            <p><b>What is Tetrasil®?</b> </p>
            <p>Tetrasil® is a powerful multi-purpose topical ointment.
              It has been used for the treatment of a wide range of skin
              conditions. Tetrasil's active ingredient, Tetrasilver
              Tetroxide, interacts with the surfaces of bacterial,
              fungal and viral membranes. These pathogens are
              responsible for the itching, rashes, redness, burning and
              other unwanted symptoms of the skin conditions. </p>
            <p>Upon contact, TETRASIL's unique chemical structure
              releases both a micro electrical charge and therapeutic
              oxygen, which immediately begins to kill the pathogens.
              The result is not just rapid relief, but elimination of
              the root cause. </p>
            <p>Tetrasil is protected by US and international patents,
              plus additional patents pending. </p>
            <p>Tetrasil® is the product that launched Aidance Skincare
              and that people worldwide use for a wide range of common
              skin problems on the head, face, neck, arms, chest, back,
              and legs. The all-natural ingredients in Tetrasil include
              natural jojoba oil, beeswax, the tetraSILVER® silver
              oxide, and an essential oil from the palmarosa plant. </p>
            <p>Nothing else works like Tetrasil®. </p>
            <p>Upon contact, Tetrasil's unique bio-electro chemistry
              begins to attack the bacterial, viral and fungal skin
              infections that cause itching, rashes, redness, burning
              and other unwanted symptoms. Customers say the result is
              not just rapid relief, but elimination of the root cause.
              And, with natural ingredients, Tetrasil soothes the skin
              as it heals. </p>
            <p><b>Chemistry:</b> </p>
            <p>Tetrasilver Tetroxide is a charged silver oxide molecular
              device. Unlike colloidal silver, Tetrasilver Tetroxide is
              an Electron-Jumping Compound® with a naturally occurring
              electrical potential many times more powerful than
              colloidal silver. Further, unlike colloidal silver,
              Tetrasilver Tetroxide (also called TST™) does not bind
              with healthy tissue. Therefore it does not produce either

            <p>Prepare a solution of silver nitrate or silver oxide in
              dilute nitric acid. Any concentration of 1 to 2 mol/l for
              the nitric acid is OK. </p>
            <p>Add some solid sodium persulfate to the liquid. Adding a
              fairly concentrated solution of sodium persulfate also
              works. When this is done, then the liquid becomes brown
              and remains clear. The brown color is due to silver (III)
              ions. The brown color is formed quickly, although not
              instantaneously. It takes a few seconds. </p>
            <p>The two pictures below show the brown liquid and a small
              quantity of this liquid, diluted in some dilute nitric
              acid. These picture clearly show the brown color of silver
              (III) ions (*).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*) see remark below. </p>
            <p>Silver (III) ions are not very stable. Even in the fairly
              strongly acidic liquids, the compound slowly decomposes. A
              black precipitate is formed and oxygen is released very
              slowly. This black precipitate is due to combined
              hydrolysis and reduction of the silver (III) ions. A mixed
              silver (I) silver (III) oxide is formed, which
              precipitates from the liquid as a black solid. </p>
            <p>Remarkably, when persulfate is added to a neutral
              solution of silver nitrate, then no brown color is formed.
              In that case the liquid first remains colorless, but in
              the course of a few minutes it slowly turns turbid and a
              dark brown/black precipitate is formed. Apparently, <b>at
                higher pH, the brown silver (III) ion is not formed at
                all and the mixed silver (I) silver (III) oxide is
                formed immediately.</b> </p>
            <p><b>Addition of sodium hydroxide, quick formation of
                Ag(I)Ag(III)O2</b> </p>
            <p>When the brown liquid is added to a solution of sodium
              hydroxide, then the process of formation of the black
              silver (I) silver (III) oxide is almost immediate. As soon
              as the brown liquid is added to a solution of sodium
              hydroxide, a dark brown very finely divided precipitate is
              formed. The solid particles stick together quickly and
              larger black particles are formed. The black solid slowly
              evolves oxygen and every few minutes it moves to the
              surface, due to many small bubbles of oxygen, which are
              trapped inside the precipitate. When these small bubbles
              of oxygen are lost, then the solid mass sinks to the
              bottom again. This 'dance' is repeated several times. </p>
            <p>The three pictures below show the liquid, immediately
              after adding it to a slight excess amount of a solution of
              NaOH. The second picture shows the same liquid a few
              minutes later, when the particles of the precipitate stick
              to each other. The final picture shows the precipitate
              near the surface, due to lots of trapped bubbles of
              oxygen. All the pictures clearly show the bubbles of
              oxygen. </p>
            <p><b>Discussion of the results</b> </p>
            <p>Here, the reactions with nickel (II) and silver (I) are
              covered separately. </p>
            <p><b>&nbsp;Reaction with nickel</b> </p>
            <p>Persulfate oxidizes nickel hydroxide to nickel (IV) oxide
              in water. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ni(OH)2 + 2OH– + S2O82- ? NiO2 +
              2SO42- + 2H2O </p>
            <p>In the wet environment, the compound NiO2 does not exist
              as such, as suggested by the simplified equation, given
              above. In fact a non-stoichiometric compound, which can
              best be described as NiO2.nH2O is formed, with n some
              indeterminate number. </p>
            <p>On acidification with nitric acid or sulphuric acid, the
              nickel (IV) compound decomposes again: </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2NiO2.nH2O(s) + 4H+(aq)&nbsp; ?
              2Ni2+(aq) + O2(g) + 2H2O + nH2O </p>
            <p>When dilute hydrochloric acid is added, then the liquid
              gives a strong smell of chlorine. In that case, the
              chloride ion is oxidized to chlorine. The liquid still
              bubbles in that case. Probably there will be oxidation of
              chloride to chlorine and still the decomposition reaction,
              as described above. </p>
            <p><b>Reaction with silver</b> </p>
            <p>In acidic media, persulfate is capable of oxidizing
              silver (I) ions to silver (III) ions. These silver (III)
              ions are brown. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ag+(aq) + S2O82-(aq) ? Ag3+(aq) +
              2SO42-(aq) </p>
            <p>Silver (III) ions are not very stable. This liquid slowly
              looses its color and gives off oxygen. A black precipitate
              is formed of silver (I) silver (III) oxide. The silver
              (III) ions slowly oxidize the water, in which they are
              dissolved. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4Ag3+ + 6H2O ? 2AgIAgIIIO2 + 12H+ + O2
            </p>
            <p>When the liquid is made more basic, then the reaction
              proceeds much faster, as the experiment demonstrates. The
              following reaction occurs in that case. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4Ag3+ + 12OH– ? 2AgIAgIIIO2 + 6H2O +
              O2 </p>
            <p>The compound AgAgO2 in turn also decomposes. It slowly
              looses oxygen and is converted to simple silver (I) oxide.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2AgIAgIIIO2 ? 2AgI2O + O2 </p>
            <p>(*) Remark: Whether the brown color is due to plain Ag3+
              or due to some mixed valency complex of silver (I) and
              silver (III) is not clear to me. It might be that the
              brown color is due to a mixed valency complex of silver
              (I) and silver (III). Examples of mixed valency complexes
              are also given on the following pages: copper (I) / copper
              (II) and titanium (III) / titanium (IV). </p>
            <p><b>General remarks</b> </p>
            <p>Both the silver (III) compounds and the NiO2 compound are
              very strong oxidizers. Both compounds are capable of
              oxidizing manganese (IV) and manganese (II) to the +7
              oxidation state as permanganate and chromium (III) is
              oxidized to the +6 oxidation state as dichromate or
              chromate. </p>
            <p>Silver nitrate is a catalyst in many reactions with
              persulfate in acidic media. Persulfate is a strong
              oxidizer, but it also is somewhat sluggish. The reaction
              between silver (I) and persulfate in acidic media, however
              is quite fast. Silver (III) in turn reacts with manganese
              (II) or chromium (III) quickly to form permanganate or
              dichromate, itself being converted to silver (I) again.
              So, in the presence of a small amount of silver nitrate,
              the persulfate anion can be used as a fast and very strong
              oxidizer. The catalytic action of silver is based on the
              fact that an other pathway for the final redox reaction is
              provided, with Ag3+ as intermediate species. </p>
            <p>A similar catalytic action can be observed with nickel
              hydroxide in basic solutions. The reaction between nickel
              hydroxide and persulfate is very fast (instantaneously, at
              least in terms of human observation). Nickel (IV) oxide in
              turn is capable of oxidizing e.g. manganese (IV) oxide to
              permanganate. This property can be used as a sensitive
              method for detecting manganese. </p>
            <p>Another important remark is that in both experiments, the
              presence of chloride ions should be avoided. Especially
              with the silver experiment, chloride ions are really
              disturbing. They make the liquid cloudy, due to formation
              of silver (I) chloride and they interfere, due to
              oxidation to chlorine. </p>
            <p>For the nickel experiment the presence of chloride is not
              of a direct concern, but if one wants to use NiO2 for
              detection of manganese by conversion to the deep purple
              permanganate, then even small amounts of chloride
              interfere and make the detection fail. </p>

              silver (III) chemistry can be found in the following book:
              Chemistry of the Elements, second edition, written by
              Greenwood and Earnshaw, pages 1181 and 1188. </p>

              According to the book "Chemistry of the Elements" of
              Greenwood, the compound silver (II) oxide is not a true
              silver (II) compound, but a mixed oxidation state silver
              (I) silver (III) oxide, hence AgO can better be described
              as Ag(I)Ag(III)O2, or if you wish Ag(I)2 Ag(III)2 O4. </p>
            <p>Silver (III) compounds can even be formed in solution by
              dissolving some silver nitrate in dilute nitric acid and
              adding a solution of sodium persulfate or potassium
              persulfate. The solution becomes brown and remains clear.
              After a while, however, it becomes lighter again and while
              doing so, it slowly produces oxygen (I think the Ag(3+)
              oxidizes the water). I'm not sure whether the brown ion is
              plain aqueous Ag(3+) or a mixed valency compound of Ag(3+)
              and Ag(+). When the solution is not sufficiently acidic,
              then a black precipitate is formed of the above mentioned
              silver (I) silver (III) oxide. </p>

              argyria gives a rather ashen or pale look to the skin, and
              severe argyria turns the skin a dark gray blue, sometimes
              with a slight violet cast. And it can also be deposited
              unevenly, making one appear very splotchy. Areas exposed
              to light will tun much more than areas not exposed to
              light, since this is nothing more than the normal
              development process anywhere light can reach, including
              the eyes. </p>
            <p>The process is rather interesting though. Silver salts
              spontaneously reduce to metallic silver upon exposure to
              light. This is called a virtual image in photography. Then
              if there is sufficient silver compounds in the blood, and
              a developer in the blood, more silver will plate out on
              the particles, cause them to grow rather dramatically. If
              they grow too large too fast, then they get stuck, and
              become essentially a permanent tattoo. The other thing
              required for development to take place is that the blood
              must be basic, which it is in a healthy person. </p>
            <p>Why would someone have a developer in the blood? Well,
              turns out lots of chemicals are rather effective
              developers, including caffeine, and tannin. So drinking a
              cup of coffee after taking silver compounds such as silver
              nitrate, then going out into the sun can be all that is
              required to cause this condition. The medical literature
              says that the condition is not reversible, but experience
              has shown that to be incorrect. Apparently some substances
              will do a fair job of chelating silver and reducing this
              problem over time. IP6 ( <b>Inositol Hexaphosphate</b> )
              extracted from rice bran appears to be one such substance.

              process, and then make treatment claims for the product:
              "treat a variety of bacterial, viral, fungal and other
              skin conditions". Sorry, but any firm that doesn't want to
              prove that their product works and won't hurt me in the

              Wow, This stuff is a miracle. It kills bacteria, fungus
              and viri. Amazing. When/where can I get some stock in the
              company. This cure-all should not be suppressed by the
              FDA. They should approve it NOW. <br>

              Here's an idea: instead of clinical trials, let's have
              Xtreme Pharmaceuticals - a reality show where contestants
              with a range of conditions, from life threatening to
              minor, take an unidentified substance to see if it helps
              or hurts them. </p>
            <p>Watch the bodybuilder's liver implode! Share the drama of
              the little old lady with arthritis as she realizes she'll
              never see her grandkids graduate. Jeer the male model with
              mild acne that winds up disfiguring himself. </p>
            <p>There can be twists - when a drug is found that actually
              works, the contestant has to select their drug from
              several different sources - which is from an inspected US
              factory? - which is from an uninspected factory in China?
              - which was concocted in a garage in Arizona? <br>

              SilDate. That means the registrant had to prove it
              controls bacteria in pools &amp; spas, as the label

            <p>Controlling bacteria in water is a far cry from curing

              treating, or managing a condition of an animal, such as a
              mammal. The animal is administered with a therapeutically
              effective amount of at least one electron active compound,
              or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof, that
              has at least two polyvalent cations, at least one of which
              has a first valence state and at least one of which has a
              second different valence state, to prevent, treat, or
              manage the condition, or a symptom thereof. A multivalent
              metal oxide, such as Ag(I,III), Cu(I,III), Pr(III,IV), and
              Bi(III, V) oxides or a pharmaceutically acceptable
              derivative thereof, may be administered to the animal in
              an amount and for a period of time which is
              therapeutically effective to prevent, treat, and/or manage
              such a condition(s) afflicting the animal. </p>

              The diamagnetic semiconducting molecular crystal
              tetrasilver tetroxide (Ag4O4) is utilized for destroying
              the AIDS virus, destroying AIDS synergistic pathogens and
              immunity suppressing moieties (ISM) in humans. A single
              intravenous injection of the devices is all that is
              required for efficacy at levels of about 40 PPM of human
              blood. The device molecular crystal contains two mono and
              two trivalent silver ions capable of "firing" electrons
              capable of electrocuting the AIDS virus, pathogens and
              ISM. When administered into the bloodstream, the device
              electrons will be triggered by pathogens, a proliferating
              virus and ISM, and when fired will simultaneously trigger
              a redox chelation mechanism resulting in divalent silver
              moieties which chelate and bind active sites of the
              entities destroying them. The devices are completely
              non-toxic.; However, they put stress on the liver causing
              hepatomegaly, but there is no loss of liver function. </p>

            </center>
            <p><b>SPECIFICATION</b> </p>
            <p><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
            <p>This invention relates to compositions containing
              multivalent silver compounds that have been exposed to
              ozone, and more particularly to aqueous solutions
              containing ozone-activated tetrasilver tetroxide. </p>
            <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
            <p>It is conventionally understood that water, particularly
              standing bodies of water, can be an effective breeding
              ground or reservoir for a variety of undesirable microbes.
              Thus, a wide variety of water treatment systems have been
              developed to disinfect potable water and/or maintain it at
              a safe level. </p>
            <p>Perhaps the most common disinfection method for drinking
              or recreational water is chlorination. However, it has
              been found that chlorine has an objectionable odor, and
              can cause skin irritations and serious eye irritations to
              users of recreational bodies of water, such as pools,
              spas, etc. More importantly, chlorine forms
              trihalomethanes in the presence of organic materials and
              these compounds present a potential health threat due to
              their carcinogenicity and mutagenicity. Because of the
              long term health threat and objectionable physical
              properties of chlorine, a number of alternate water
              treatment systems that operate without chlorine have been
              developed in recent years. </p>
            <p>Another gas used to disinfect water is ozone. According
              to <b>U.
                S.
                Patent No. 4,176,061</b> to Stopka, the ability of ozone
              to purify drinking water has been appreciated for some
              time. </p>
            <p>Stopka cites a number of references that teach the
              advantages of using ozone rather than chlorine to
              decontaminate water. What Stopka does not disclose is that
              ozone, like chlorine, has some disadvantages. Perhaps most
              significant of these disadvantages is that ozone, as a
              gas, can dissipate from water over time, leaving the water
              once again susceptible to contamination by various
              pathogens. </p>
            <p>A number of water disinfection systems rely on the
              oligodynamic effect provided by the addition to water of,
              e. g., transition metals such as silver. </p>
            <p>For example, <b>U. S. Patent No. 4,608,247</b> to
              Heinig, Jr. discloses water treatment systems comprising
              exposing the water to a material which erodes to provide
              particulate silver in the water. Although the particulate
              silver is said to be ionic, and the patent does not
              disclose the valency of the ions formed by erosion, other
              references, such as Antelman,"Silver (II, III)
              Disinfectants,"Soap/Cosmetics/Chemical Specialties, pp.
              52-59 (March 1994) at page 52, third paragraph, suggest
              that trace ions formed from silver metal are monovalent. </p>
            <p><b>U. S. Patent No. 5,352,369</b> to Heinig, Jr.
              acknowledges that water treatment systems like that
              disclosed in Heinig's earlier 247 patent are only
              partially effective in avoiding the use of chlorine as an
              antimicrobial agent, in that such systems often require
              the addition of reduced amounts of chlorine to water
              treated by such systems. The 369 patent purports to avoid
              this limitation on prior silver-based systems, in
              providing a method of treating water by generating an
              active oxidizer in the water which is capable of attacking
              and killing a wide range of microorganisms therein. The
              method comprises exposing the water to a silver catalyst
              in the presence of oxygen to form an active oxidizer in
              the water and, in some instances to also release silver
              ions (presumably monovalent silver ions as discussed
              above) therein via an erosion process similar to that set
              forth in Heinig's 247 patent. The silver catalyst utilized
              in the method comprises an alumina matrix having between
              approximately 0.1% and 5% by weight of elemental silver
              chemically deposited thereon. The oxygen utilized in the
              method preferably also comprises ozone. </p>
            <p><b>U. S. Patents Nos. 5,017,295,5,073,382,5,078,902,
                5,089,275,5,098,582,5,211,855 and 5,223,149</b> to
              Antelman disclose water treatment methods comprising
              adding multivalent silver compounds to water. </p>
            <p><b>U. S. Patent No. 5,211,855</b> to Antelman discloses
              and claims a water treatment method comprising adding
              tetrasilver tetroxide to water bodies, such as reservoirs.
              At column 1, Antelman discloses that his previous patents
              were incorrect in identifying the antimicrobial agent as
              silver (II) oxide (i. e., AgO), when it is actually
              tetrasilver tetroxide (i. e., Ag404), wherein each
              molecule comprises one pair of monovalent silver atoms and
              one pair of trivalent silver atoms. </p>
            <p><b>U. S. Patent No. 5,223,149</b> to Antelman discloses
              the use of trivalent silver compounds as bactericidal and
              algicidal agents in water treatment. Antelman asserts that
              these trivalent silver compounds are an improvement over
              his earlier divalent silver compounds, which are disclosed
              and claimed in his earlier U. S. patents identified above.
              Antelman at the paragraph bridging columns 1-2 teaches
              that oxidizing agents are not required to be used with the
              trivalent silver compounds. </p>
            <p>Despite the foregoing developments, there is still room
              in the art for improved water treatment systems. </p>

              employing the ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide and
              compositions comprising the ozonated tetrasilver
              tetroxide. Examples of compositions of the invention
              include beverages and disinfectants. </p>
            <p>In addition, the invention provides a method for
              increasing the half-life of ozone in water, said method

              along with the ozone. </p>
            <p><b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b> </p>
            <p>The invention will be described in conjunction with the
              following drawings in which like reference numerals
              designate like elements and wherein: Figs. 1,2 and 3 are
              Multiple Angle Light Scattering (MALS) graphs of log
              intensity vs. angle. </p>
            <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
            <p>The inventor has discovered that the ozonated form of the
              compound tetrasilver tetroxide has an antimicrobial effect
              greater than that of non-oxidated tetrasilver tetroxide.
              Prior to the inventor's discovery, it was known that
              potassium monopersulfate could activate the antimicrobial
              effect of tetrasilver tetroxide, but the inventor is
              unaware of any suggestion in the prior art that ozone is
              also capable of activating this effect. In embodiments of
              the invention, ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide has an
              antimicrobial effect at least equal to that of potassium
              monopersulfate-activated tetrasilver tetroxide. Moreover,
              activating tetrasilver tetroxide with ozone avoids the
              drawbacks of using potentially hazardous and/or toxic
              chemicals as activation agents. </p>
            <p>Although there has been some confusion in the art
              regarding the precise nature of tetrasilver tetroxide, U.
              S. Patent No. 5,211,855 describes tetrasilver tetroxide as
              a molecule, Ag404, having one pair of monovalent silver
              atoms and one pair of trivalent silver atoms. While not
              necessarily wishing to be bound by this theory in its
              entirety, the term"tetrasilver tetroxide"as used herein is
              intended to identify the compound Ag404. </p>
            <p>Tetrasilver tetroxide is the most preferred oligodynamic
              compound of the invention; however, it is contemplated
              that the other oligodynamic compounds, such as trivalent
              silver (see, e. g., U. S. Patent No. 5,223,149 to
              Antelman), multivalent copper (see, e. g., U. S. Patent
              No. 5,336,416 to Antelman), and other multivalent heavy
              metal compounds, can be substituted for tetrasilver
              tetroxide in certain embodiments of the invention. </p>
            <p>Tetrasilver tetroxide is ozonated by a process comprising
              providing non-activated tetrasilver tetroxide and ozone in
              a fluid medium. The medium can be ozonated before, during
              and/or after addition of tetrasilver tetroxide thereto.
              Water is the preferred fluid medium, but other liquid or
              gaseous media in which ozone can be solubilized can be
              suitable for use in the invention, e. g., various
              peroxides, ethers, alcohols or acids, such as peracetic
              acid. </p>
            <p>The initial ratio of ozone to tetrasilver tetroxide
              provided in the medium is preferably 1: 10 to 10: 1, more
              preferably at least 1: 2, most preferably at least 1: 1.
              The amount of ozone is preferably from 0.5 to 7.0 ppm, and
              more preferably from 4 to 6 ppm. The concentration of
              non-activated tetrasilver tetroxide is preferably from 0.5
              to 7.0 ppm, and more preferably from 2 to 6 ppm. Greater
              amounts of either ingredient might be wasteful or cause
              undesirable side effects. </p>
            <p>Lesser amounts of either ingredient might not be
              sufficiently microcidal to achieve a desired antimicrobial
              effect. </p>
            <p>Although it is preferred to initially provide ozone in
              the above-identified concentrations, such concentrations
              need not be maintained throughout the life of the
              resulting composition. In embodiments, ozone is actively
              removed or passively dissipates from the composition over
              time, yielding a composition substantially devoid of ozone
              in which ozone-activated tetrasilver tetroxide continues
              to function as an antimicrobial agent. </p>
            <p>In view of the heretofore unknown ability of ozone to
              activate tetrasilver tetroxide, it is not necessary to
              provide other activating agents in the composition, such
              as potassium monopersulfate. </p>
            <p>Compositions of the invention are suitable for a wide
              variety of purposes. For example, the compositions can be
              consumed as beverages (e. g., as bottled water, municipal
              tap water, etc.) or can be applied as cleaning agents to
              substrates in need of cleaning (i. e., disinfection,
              etc.). The concentration of tetrasilver tetroxide and/or
              ozone may be adjusted according to the intended use. For
              example, the concentration of at least one ingredient
              might be raised above the preferred concentrations
              mentioned above to prepare a disinfectant composition
              unsuitable for human consumption. Of course, such a
              composition would preferably be packaged in a container
              labeled as a cleaning product so as to avoid accidental
              human consumption. </p>
            <p>Water disinfection is the most preferred use for ozonated
              tetrasilver tetroxide of the invention. water disinfection
              according to the invention can be as simple as providing
              ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide in water. This can be done
              in accordance with the methods described above for
              providing ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide compositions. The
              water decontaminated can be used for consumption (e. g.,
              via municipal water distribution systems), recreation (e.
              g., in pools), manufacturing (e. g., as a raw material,
              solvent, etc.), etc. </p>
            <p>The water disinfection method of the invention enjoys
              several advantages over conventional water treatment
              methods employing ozone without tetrasilver tetroxide or
              tetrasilver tetroxide without ozone. In addition to the
              unexpected activation of tetrasilver tetroxide by ozone
              described above, tetrasilver tetroxide has an unexpected
              effect on ozone. The inventor has discovered that the
              half-life of ozone in water is increased by tetrasilver
              tetroxide. As the dissipation of ozone from treated water
              over time and distance has posed a major limitation on the
              use of ozone in municipal water treatment, the ability of
              tetrasilver tetroxide to extend the half-life of ozone in
              water is a very significant advantage of the invention. </p>
            <p>The combined effects of ozone and tetrasilver tetroxide
              also facilitate the use of lesser amounts of at least one
              of the two ingredients relative to prior art methods using
              only one of the two ingredients. This can improve the
              quality of the product of the method (e. g., by minimizing
              the undesirable odor of ozone), while decreasing
              production costs. </p>
            <p>Embodiments of the invention are useful to kill
              pathogens, including but not limited to: vegetative
              bacteria and spores, such as Clostridium or Bacillus
              species; viruses; protozoans; and protozoan cysts and
              oocysts, such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium.
              Non-pathogenic simulants, such as Bacillus subtilis and
              Bacillus stearothermophilus spores, are used to
              demonstrate the efficacy of treatment because they are
              more resistant to disinfection than any known water-borne
              pathogens. </p>
            <p>The invention will be illustrated in more detail with
              reference to the following Examples, but it should be
              understood that the present invention is not deemed to be
              limited thereto. </p>
            <p>Comparative Examples Efficacy of tetrasilver tetroxide on
              E. coli K12 Culture E. coli has long been recognized for
              its association with fecal contamination of water and the
              presence of many enteric pathogens. A sample of E. coli
              K12 strain was grown on TSA (tryptic soy agar) at 37°C for
              24 hours for use as a test organism. The following
              measurements were obtained after 24 hours: Acridine Orange
              Direct Count: 1.05 x 108 cells/mL; Plate Count on TSA:
              3.95 x 108 cells/mL; Stock Culture Plate Count: 2.27 x 108
              cells/mL; and 1 hour culture in water: 2.71 x 107 cells/mL
              (untreated control). </p>
            <p>The efficacy of tetrasilver tetroxide (SILDATE, N. &amp;
              Co., Bensalem, PA) in the absence of ozone was evaluated
              by performing TSA plate counts on E. coli K12 strain
              samples having the following additives: (A) 1 ppm
              tetrasilver tetroxide + 10 ppm potassium monopersulfate
              (PMP); (B) 2 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide + 20 ppm of PMP;
              (C) 5 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide + 50 ppm of PMP; and (D)
              10 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide + 100 ppm of PMP. </p>
            <p>PMP is a compound known to activate the antimicrobial
              effect of tetrasilver tetroxide. The counts were taken at
              various time intervals. The results are tabulated in Table
              1. </p>
            <p>Table 1: TSA plate counts (E. coli K12 survival) Plate

              D0---- It was observed that 10 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide
              activated with 100 ppm PMP kills 100% of the test pathogen
              at five minutes or less. Other studies have indicated that
              10 ppm or less tetrasilver tetroxide kills 100% of E. coli
              K12 strain within 30 minutes. Tetrasilver tetroxide (5
              ppm) activated with 50 ppm PMP kills 90% in 5 minutes and
              100% in 10 minutes. Tetrasilver tetroxide (2 ppm)
              activated with 20 ppm PMP kills 95% in 10 minutes and 100%
              in 20 minutes. Tetrasilver tetroxide (1 ppm) activated
              with 10 ppm PMP kills 4 logs in 30 minutes and 100% in 1
              hour. </p>
            <p>Efficacy of Ozone The efficacy of ozone in the absence of
              tetrasilver tetroxide was evaluated by challenging
              Bacillus subtilis spores with 2 ppm ozone and measuring
              the survival rate over time by MALS, acridine orange
              direct counts (AODC) and by counting colony forming units
              (CFU) at 24 hours. The results are tabulated in Table 2.

              intensity as a direct function of increasing time of
              exposure to ozone, thus demonstrating the killing effect
              of ozone in water. Similar results were obtained using a
              spore suspension of B. stearothermophilus. Water
              suspensions of bacterial spores were chosen because they
              are the most resistant form of microbes known, even more
              resistant than oocysts of Cryptosporidium and cysts of
              Giardia, neither of which is inactivated by chlorine. </p>
            <p>Ozone is, of course, effective against enteric pathogens.
            </p>
            <p>For example, adding 3.2 ppm 03 to a test culture kills
              1.95 x 106 cells/mL of E. coli in 1 minute and kills 1.5 x
              106 cells/mL of P. aeruginosa in 1 minute. </p>
            <p>Example 1: Ozone-Activated Tetrasilver Tetroxide with
              Ozone Removed An ozone generator was used to study the
              effects of ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide (OTT) on E. coli
              K12 Survival. </p>
            <p>The ozone generator for all of the examples was a Model
              CD-1B generator supplied by AQUA-FLO, Inc., 6244 Frankford
              Ave., Baltimore, MD 21206. Ozone was generated from oxygen
              supplied from a tank with oxygen purity of more than
              99.9%. The generator was fitted with a voltage regulator
              and an oxygen flow regulator which enabled the oxygen
              flow/voltage parameters to be precisely set so that the
              desired concentration of ozone could be maintained
              continuously or a given level attained and allowed to
              revert back to oxygen based on its half-life. When oxygen
              flowed through the generator, high voltage converted it to
              ozone, which was bubbled into water. Excess (head) ozone
              passed through a platinum catalyst that converted it back
              to oxygen. </p>
            <p>By use of toggle switches, the ozone was directed through
              glass spargers into either of two specially designed
              2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks containing 1 liter of water.
              Either a solution of a test chemical or a suspension of
              microorganisms or both could be introduced into the flasks
              via tubes at the top which passed through a rubber stopper
              (which seals off the system). </p>
            <p>Samples could be withdrawn at the bottom of the flask by
              opening a stopcock. </p>
            <p>Ozone concentrations were measured by a chemical
              oxidation of indigo dye by using an indigo dye colorimeter
              manufactured by HACH, Inc. </p>
            <p>Water containing 6 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide was ozonated
              with 3 ppm ozone for 15 minutes, followed by 40 minutes of
              vigorous aeration to remove ozone from the water. The
              ozone concentration was measured by a HACH POCKET
              COLORIMETER using ACCUVAC ampules by the indigo dye
              oxidation method. The initial ozone concentration of 3.0
              mg/L (i. e., 3 ppm) was reduced to 0. 09 mg/L after 40
              minutes of aeration and was further reduced to
              undetectable levels before the ozone-activated tetrasilver
              tetroxide solution was used to challenge E. coli K12. </p>
            <p>E. coli overnight cultures were challenged with either
              3.0 or 6.0 ppm of ozone-activated (i. e., ozonated)
              tetrasilver tetroxide and plated onto TSA after each
              exposure time. The results are tabulated in Table 3. </p>

              activated by ozone, and persists after separation of the
              ozone from the tetrasilver tetroxide. </p>

              ozone level of 0.03 ppm. An E. coli K12 overnight culture
              (22 hours) was then treated with 0,1,2 or 6 ppm of the
              activated tetrasilver tetroxide for 0,10,20 or 30 min. The

              a final ozone concentration of 0.04 ppm. An E. coli K12
              overnight culture (22 hours) was then treated with 1 or 2
              ppm of the activated tetrasilver tetroxide for 0,10,20 or
              30 min. The results are tabulated in Table 5. </p>

              0.32 ppm ozone to evaluate the killing efficacy of the
              combination. The survival rate over time was measured by

              Fig. 2 shows a reduction in the log intensity as function
              of increasing time of exposure to ozone and tetrasilver
              tetroxide, thus demonstrating the antimicrobial effect of
              ozonated tetrasilver tetroxide in water. </p>
            <p>Fig. 3 is a MALS graph showing the antimicrobial effects
              of: (a) a sixty-minute treatment with 2 ppm tetrasilver
              tetroxide; (b) a twenty-minute treatment with 0.3 ppm
              ozone; and (c) a twenty-minute treatment with 0.3 ppm
              ozone and 2 ppm tetrasilver tetroxide. The tetrasilver
              tetroxide alone (a) was little more effective than the
              untreated control (d). Twenty minutes of ozone alone (b)
              produced a significant killing effect, but the combination
              of ozone and tetrasilver tetroxide (c) was much more
              potent than either compound alone. </p>
            <p>Without wishing to be bound by any theories, it appears
              that in addition to acting as a killing agent in its own
              right, ozone is surprisingly able to activate the
              antimicrobial activity of tetrasilver tetroxide, thus
              yielding a synergistic killing effect exceeding the
              individual killing effects of either non-activated
              tetrasilver tetroxide or ozone. </p>
            <p>Example 5: Ozone Stability Testing 6.1 mg/L (6.1 ppm) of
              ozone was provided in deionized, distilled water over a 15
              minute period. The solution was allowed to stand with
              stirring by a magnetic stirrer over a 24-hour period,
              taking periodic readings of the ozone concentration. By 2
              hours, the ozone concentration was 3 ppm and progressively
              dropped to 0.01 ppm by 18 hours. This represented a
              half-life of approximately 2 hours. When 2 ppm tetrasilver
              tetroxide was added, the rate of decay was unexpectedly
              lengthened, such that 0.12 ppm of ozone was present after
              18 hours (approximately an order of magnitude higher than
              would have been expected in the absence of tetrasilver
              tetroxide) and by 24 hours, 0.03 ppm of ozone oxidizing
              activity was still present. </p>
            <p>Further research showed that neither tetrasilver
              tetroxide alone nor chemically-activated tetrasilver
              tetroxide (i. e., activated with potassium monopersulfate
              as described in the Comparative Examples) gave measurable
              oxidation as measured by the indigo dye method. Thus, the
              reduced half-life of ozone in the presence of tetrasilver
              tetroxide does not appear to be merely an additive effect
              or an experimental flaw arising from the use of the indigo
              dye method, but rather appears to be a surprising
              synergistic effect. </p>
            <p>While the invention has been described in detail and with
              reference to specific examples thereof, it will be
              apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes
              and modifications can be made therein without departing
              from the spirit and scope thereof. </p>
