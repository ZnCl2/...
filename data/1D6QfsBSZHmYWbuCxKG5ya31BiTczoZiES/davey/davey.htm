              Resonance to Boil Water Inexpensively.</font></b> </p>

      <p>HOT PROSPECT: Peter Davey, a 92-year-old Christchurch inventor
        and saxophone player, says he has used his love of music to come
        up with a device that boils water rapidly, in just the amount
        required. </p>
      <p>Inventor and saxophone player Peter Davey has come up with a
        device that he claims boils water in no time. </p>
      <p>He calls it the "sonic boiler" because he claims it uses the
        power of sound. How the heater actually works has confounded
        experts. </p>
      <p>The device looks oddly like a bent desk lamp, with a metallic
        ball at the end instead of a lightbulb. When plugged into the
        power supply, and the ball is lowered into water, it boils the
        liquid within seconds -- even as little as a tablespoonful. </p>
      <p>"Everybody boils twice the amount of water they need so I
        decided I would find a way to boil water and make steam more
        economically," said Davey, a former Spitfire pilot. </p>
      <p>"This boils exactly what you want to drink." </p>
      <p>Davey, who lives in a tumbledown two-storey historic homestead
        called Locksley in Dallington, has been using the boiler to make
        hot drinks for 30 years. </p>
      <p>He said he first came up with the concept 50 years ago and it
        took him half of those years to figure out how to make the
        device. </p>
      <p>"The principle is beautiful. I have cashed in on a natural
        phenomenon and it's all about music," he said. </p>
      <p>"If I hadn't been playing the saxophone, I probably wouldn't
        have come up with the idea." </p>
      <p>Davey noticed as he played the saxophone at home that
        everything resonated at a different frequency. </p>
      <p>"The glasses will tinkle on one note. Knives and forks in the
        drawer will tinkle on another note and I realised that
        everything has its point of vibration," he said. "In the same
        way, a component in the ball is tuned to a certain frequency." </p>
      <p>Davey said it took years of trial and error to get the device
        to where it is now. He has made a number of prototypes using the
        same principle, including a steamer. </p>
      <p>Friends dropping by over the years have urged Davey to make
        them a sonic boiler and that got him thinking commercially. </p>
      <p>Davey, who turns 92 today, is now looking for a manufacturer
        who will buy the technology and make the devices for the mass
        market. </p>
      <p>"Nowadays, with the economy of water and electricity, I think
        it could be even more important than when I conceived the idea,"
        he said. "They could sell a million of the things in China." </p>
      <p>Davey estimated boilers could be made as cheaply as $9 each. He
        could imagine cafes using them as a gimmick to make express tea
        and coffee. </p>
      <p>"I cannot wait to explain the principle to somebody who wants
        to take it on," he said. </p>
      <p>The Press invited a retired Canterbury University engineer,
        Professor Arthur Williamson, to look at the boiler and he was
        stumped. </p>
      <p>He watched Davey boil various quantities of water, took notes
        of the energy used and temperatures reached. He left scratching
        his head. </p>
      <p>"I don't know enough about sound to know whether you can
        transfer that amount of energy via soundwaves. I doubt it," said
        Williamson. </p>
      <p>He did remember an alternative kettle years ago that had two
        perforated metal plates inside. The power ran between the
        plates, through the water. "The resistance through the water
        provided the load. I wonder if it isn't working like that?
        Without taking it to bits, you can't tell." </p>
      <p>The kettle was specially designed to prevent people getting a
        shock from touching the boiling water. </p>
      <p>Williamson's verdict of the sonic boiler? "It is an interesting
        gimmick, irrespective of how it works. I would probably buy one
        as a gimmick. I think more homework needs to be done." </p>
      <p>Also queuing up for a boiler, after first seeing one in the
        1960s, is Stu Buchanan, leader of the Garden City Big Band and a
        friend of Davey. </p>
      <p>"It's rather spectacular. I don't know why it has never taken
        off as a utensil for people. I think it's a class act," said
        Buchanan. </p>
      <p>Davey was born in Hamilton in 1916. During World War 2 he flew
        Spitfires for the 602 City of Glasgow Squadron of the Royal
        Auxiliary Air Force. The squadron operated along the south coast
        of England, escorting bombers to Holland and Belgium, doing
        convoy patrols and fighter sweeps into France. </p>
      <p>After the war's end he married and had two children. He bought
        Locksley in 1964. Davey shares the top storey of the homestead
        with his 55-year-old son, also called Peter, and a grey tabby
        cat called Santa. The ground floor is let to lodgers who help
        pay the bills. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Revolutionary Sonic Boiler Probably Not A
              Scam!</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Well, we don’t really know how quickly Peter Davey’s “sonic
        boiler” is supposed to be working. The article says it boils the
        water “within seconds”, which is a bit of a fuzzy definition.
        I’d like to see exactly how fast it actually does boil it. </p>
      <p>And if you want to transfer energy to a liquid, hitting the
        resonant frequency of that amount of liquid in that container is
        actually not a good way to do it. That’ll just spray water up
        the walls. And talk of “resonances” is of course practically
        diagnostic of crackpottery. </p>
      <p>But, making the usual allowances for scientific illiteracy in
        the popular press, it’s possible that someone could have come up
        with a way to dump energy into water faster than your normal
        immersed heating element can do it. </p>
      <p>Immersed elements are already pretty darn good, though. </p>
      <p>The “2200-2400W” electric jug in my kitchen will bring half a
        litre of water to a good enthusiastic boil in about eighty
        seconds, and it draws as much power as you can get from the
        maximum ten-amp-per-socket current rating of 220-240V countries
        like Australia and New Zealand, where this inventor resides. </p>
      <p>The sonic boiler could be running at 15 amps or more, but
        that’s cheating; 15-amp sockets are special equipment (used for
        things like air conditioners), and anybody can boil tons of
        water in half a second if they’re allowed to use as much
        electricity as they like. </p>
      <p>About 500ml is the minimum amount you can put in most electric
        jugs without leaving some of the heating element hanging in the
        air to overheat. It’s also two mugs worth of liquid. So, as
        Peter Davey says, people certainly do often boil more water than
        they need. But making an electric jug of conventional design
        that can heat one mug worth of liquid is not a great engineering
        challenge. Let’s do the sums and see how fast such a jug could
        perform, in Physics Experiment Land where pulleys have no
        friction and cows are spherical. </p>
      <p>The (physics, rather than dietary) calorie is the amount of
        thermal energy necessary to raise the temperature of one gram of
        water by one Celsius degree. So if you start with 250
        millilitres of water at 25°C (which means almost exactly 250
        grams of it) and need to raise it all to 100°C, you need
        75*250=18,750 calories, which is 78,450 joules. </p>
      <p>A joule is a watt-second. So if you’ve got a 2400-watt heater
        that transfers heat with perfect efficiency to water, you must
        run it for 32.7 seconds to do this job. </p>
      <p>Taking that into account, my electric jug is, clearly, not that
        far from the theoretical maximum water-heating efficiency. </p>
      <p>Assuming its element could be fully submerged in only 250ml of
        water, that water would boil in about forty seconds, which is
        only 1.22 times the Physics Experiment Land time for the job. </p>
      <p>Given that the element has to heat up from the inside out, and
        that some energy is lost through the walls of the jug, and that
        some more is lost to internal evaporation and sound and so on,
        this electric jug is clearly working about as well as it even
        theoretically could, when you take real-world limitations into
        account. Some other 2400-watt heater, built in such a way as to
        be less limited, could only possibly do the job in 82% of the
        time, unless it was magically getting energy from nowhere. And
        Peter Davey does not appear to be making any such claims. </p>
      <p>(I’m also assuming that he’s not cheating by pre-heating the
        boiler before it’s dipped in the water. It’s not hard to boil
        water “instantly” if you drop a red-hot rock in it.) </p>
      <p>So I say good luck to this bloke. He may well have come up with
        a genuinely new and interesting heater element design, which may
        have advantages over existing bare immersible heaters, which are
        generally rather dangerous things. And his heater may work very
        nicely with even small amounts of water, which in itself is a
        step forward; you can get electric kettles with the element
        built into the baseplate which work with arbitrarily small
        amounts of water, but they take longer to heat up in the first
        place because of all the extra metal around the element. There
        may indeed be a niche for this sonic heater, if it performs as
        advertised. </p>
      <p>But there ain’t no such thing as a free lunch. If the sonic
        heater works very much faster, in seconds-per-gram terms, than
        any old discount-store electric jug, then it’s another perpetual
        motion machine, which would have a few applications beyond just
        making a quick cup of tea. </p>

      <p>1. Technically, you could change the pressure of the water to
        make it boil at a lower temperature. That’s cheating, though.
        (This actually might be how the device works; it also gives a
        reason for the talk of resonance.) </p>
      <p>Comment by evilmrhenry — January 31, 2008 @ 7:24 pm <br>
        2. Well, the picture doesn’t give any indication of a pressure
        vessel, and a device that lowered the air pressure in an
        unsealed container filled with water would act as a straw and
        draw the water out. </p>
      <p>The thing about resonance is that its main useful property in
        an application such as this would be to transmit mechanical
        energy- and given that converting electrical energy to
        mechanical energy is not as efficient as converting electrical
        energy to thermal energy, then even if your
        mechanical-&gt;thermal conversion is 100% efficient, you’ve used
        more energy than you would if you converted electrical energy
        directly to thermal energy, which is bloody close to 100%
        efficient as it is. </p>
      <p>Unless there’s something weird like sonoluminescence going on
        (possible I guess) I can’t see how this is more effective than
        an straight resistive element job. </p>

        3.&nbsp; Out of curiosity… what’s the energy coupling like of a
        microwave oven? Does a 1000W microwave heat up water as fast as
        a 1000W kettle would? I’m assuming that the 1000W lable is the
        power available within the cooking area, as the magnatron is
        hardly 100% efficient. </p>

        4. About your water heating math…been along time since I was in
        high school chemistry, but isn’t getting water to the boiling
        temperature the easy part of boiling? I seem to recall that
        there’s a “transition energy” you need to pump in to actually
        make the transition from very hot water to steam. </p>
      <p>Comment by opus7600 — February 1, 2008 @ 12:31 am <br>
        5.&nbsp; I wonder if this device includes one of those
        ultrasonic transducers that atomize water like those “cool mist”
        vaporizers. You turn it on and the water immediately starts
        bubbling and you get a mist out of it. The water isn’t getting
        any warmer, but you get the illusion of boiling. The fact that
        the inventor is using his bare hands to hold the glass of
        boiling water gives me pause. Even though glass is, in general,
        a good insulator, it isn’t that good. </p>
      <p>So, take the ultrasonic transducer out of a vaporizer, add a
        traditional resistive heating element, and you get a device that
        makes water appear to boil right away, and you can stall any
        skeptics until the regular heating element actually heats the
        water. </p>
      <p>One other thought came to mind: a small-scale reverse-cycle air
        conditioner, which has been mentioned by Dan on several
        occasions. Assuming you could get the dimensions of such a
        device small enough, you could put a whole lot more power into
        the water than just the energy from the wall socket. </p>

        6.&nbsp; You can see in the picture that the person just out of
        the shot is holding a temp probe in the water. So I doubt he’d
        be fooled by simulated boiling. </p>
      <p>Comment by Jax184 — February 1, 2008 @ 8:03 am <br>
        7.&nbsp; Well, he does mention sonics and heat pumps are great
        for cheating thermodynamics - maybe he has built a very small
        thermoacoustic heater. If you squint hard enough that bulb might
        even be a Helmholtz resonator - although I am not sure that such
        would be useful in this application. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;If the device is a mini-heat pump (rather than an
        immersion heating element that does not need to be fully
        submerged) then that is a terrific achievement - whatever the
        technology. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Comment by aLUNZ — February 1, 2008 @ 1:16 pm <br>
        &nbsp; 8.&nbsp; Actually, no this is not really that new. This
        technology and immersion ultrasound horns/plates/cups are
        already used by many researchers in the fields of
        chemistry/physics/health. However, it will never be used for
        this reason, there is no way. Look up Sonochemistry in google.
        Back to the drawingboard… or your day job. Interesting but bad
        idea. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;Comment by Sonochemist — February 2, 2008 @ 12:07 pm <br>
        &nbsp; 9.&nbsp; Oh I forgot to add….Depending on the frequency
        the temperature of the bulk solution and the temperature of the
        solution during ultrasound could be different. Also, it doesn’t
        take much energy to get the “boiling” effect you see when
        ultrasound is induced on an aqueous medium. Less than 10W. </p>

      <p>The photos shown to date reminded me of a website I found a
        couple of years ago describing a similar thing. Here are my
        notes from that find; </p>
      <p>"As a sensitive musician Mr Davey noticed, that there was such
        a frequency of the motor and propeller buzzing, when the
        aeroplane cabin and his body were getting into a resonance. At
        this unique resonance frequency he always was experiencing an
        influx of heat in his aeroplane cabin. He did not know yet, that
        in future this phenomenon will be utilised in ultrasonic weapon
        systems for effective and undetected killing of people. But he
        decided to test whether the same phenomenon is to appear, if a
        metal hemisphere which simulates his pilot cabin is submerged in
        water and is excited into a resonance frequency. So he found two
        tops from old bicycle bells, joined them together, tuned one of
        them to 50 Hz frequency, attached electricity wire to each one
        of them, and thrown them into water. Surprisingly, water started
        to boil extremely fast. So he made his first heater patent based
        on this observation. This patent was already registered in 1944.
        After a hero return from the war, he had a device, which
        repetitively proved to everyone who measured it, that it has the
        efficiency decisively exceeding 100%. Realising this, he
        believed that the world is going to pounce on the opportunity of
        production and use of this technical miracle. After all, people
        are full of declarations about apparent saving on energy,
        resources, about protection of our natural environment, etc.
        However, the reality turned out to be completely opposite.
        Immediately after it was experimentally confirmed that the
        device has unexplainably high efficiency, the heater and the
        inventor fell into disfavour of various institutions that are
        interested in selling electricity and that protect the monopoly
        on electrical power. In the result, this extraordinary invention
        received an extraordinary treatment! Namely authorities were
        doing everything in their powers to disallow the production and
        sale of this heater in New Zealand. One of legal tricks that
        were used against this heater, was that it was declared
        officially to be "unsafe to health and life of users". (Please
        notice that practically every electrical device working on 220
        Volts can be declared unsafe, if someone in the position of
        authority wishes to put it down.) In turn in New Zealand it is
        impossible to undertake the production and sale of anything,
        that is not officially approved by the government. In the
        result, Mr Davey was fighting for almost 50 years to receive a
        permit for the industrial production of this heater. And during
        these almost 50 years, the permission was continually refused to
        him, no matter what research outcomes he submitted to please
        authorities, and no matter how hard he tried. But it is
        interesting, that in Australia an electric jug with a heating
        element of the design very similar to the Davey’s heater was put
        in mass production (this Australian jug most probably is
        produced in there still even today). This Australian jug is
        working on the principle of electrical resistance of water (i.e.
        not telekinesis as the heater of Mr Davey does). Water that it
        heats is a resistor, in which heat is generated because of the
        electric current flows through this water. This Australian jug
        is exactly the same "dangerous to the health and lives", like
        the telekinetic heater of Mr Davey. Only that it did not
        encountered in Australia similar bureaucratic resistance because
        the energy efficiency of it is "normal". When I met Mr Davey for
        the first time in 1990, he still was appealing to authorities,
        and still had a hope to receive a permit for the production of
        his heater - in spite of these almost 50 years of lost battles
        with bureaucrats. He was even showing to me a large stock of
        components he gathered to start a production immediately after
        the permit is granted to him. However, he gave up the
        experimental production of research copies of his heater. </p>
      <p>The design of the Davey's sonic heater is extremely simple. It
        actually is composed of two major parts only - see Figure K8 (3)
        from monograph [1/4]. The most important out of these two parts
        is a resonating hemispherical bowl (1) made of a sound inducing
        metal plate. The second part is a buffering hemispherical bowl
        (2) almost identical in shape to the bowl (1). This second bowl
        has the radius around 4 mm larger than the resonating
        hemispherical bowl (1). Both bowls are assembled symmetrically
        one around the other, means the hemispherical bowl (1) is placed
        inside of the hemispherical bowl (2). Coin is 32 mm wide =
        1.25984 inches / Big bowl approximately 1.75 inches wide and .75
        inches thick / Small bowl approximately 1 3/8 inches wide. Of
        course, apart from these two bowls, the heater also includes a
        long rod, nuts, washers, and electrical wires. These are to hold
        it together, to supply electricity to both bowls, and to allow
        the heater to be submerged into water that it heats. But these
        other parts are marginal additions only. The major parts are the
        bowls. During experimental production of this heater, the
        resonating hemispherical bowl (1) usually is made from an old
        cover for a bicycle bell. The dimensions of this hemispherical
        bowl are not important. It is only vital that it falls into a
        sonic resonance at the frequency of 50 Hertz, and that it has
        the outer surface which is parallel and equidistant from the
        external buffering hemispherical bowl (2). To each of these two
        bowls a different wire of the household electricity supply (i.e.
        220 V, 50 Hz) is connected. The heater must be submerged in
        water that it heat. It brings water to the boiling point
        extremely fast. More details about the design and operation of
        this sonic heater is provided in subsection K3.3 from volume 10
        of monograph [1/4]. After being constructed, the Davey's
        telekinetic heater must be "tuned" in two different manners. The
        first tuning depends on providing the hemispherical bowl (1)
        with such frequency of the own oscillations, that makes this
        bowl to resonate acoustically when a sound of the frequency 50
        Hertz is emitted nearby. The second tuning of the heater depends
        on appropriate selecting the distance "L" between both bowls (1)
        and (2). On this distance depends the formation of the standing
        wave between both bowls. Thus it decides about the energy
        efficiency of the entire heater. From the information that the
        inventor repeated to me, I gather that the measurements carried
        out by New Zealand scientists suggested that this heater may
        consume even less than the equivalent for around 5% of the
        energy that it generates in form of heat. This would indicate,
        that the electrical efficiency of this heater is around 2000%. </p>

        Subject: George Wiseman on the Dumas Effect<br>
        Date: Mar 10, 2015<br>
        <br>
        Hola Folks!<br>
        <br>
        George Wiseman is an expert on HHO and has done many
        fascinating&nbsp; experiments, many documented at his
        www.eagle-research.com website. I sent him the DUMAS info and he
        shares this;<br>
        <br>
        Jerry,<br>
        <br>
        I independently discovered what you are calling the Dumas Effect
        (I'm calling it the Wise Heater) in the early 1990's when I was
        trying to find a method to split water without using electrolyte
        (using pure water).<br>
        <br>
        I danced for joy when I started making copious volumes of gas
        with little electricity... But I noticed that the little jar I
        was experimenting with was getting really hot; so I thought some
        of the gas might be steam...<br>
        <br>
        So I dutifully put a condenser on the gas output, which would
        condense any steam and allow it to drip back into the jar.<br>
        <br>
        I was really sad (happy dance stopped) when I concluded that the
        gas was 99.99% steam. Not one bit of Brown's Gas was generated
        by this method.<br>
        <br>
        But I found the effect interesting, because the jar did heat up
        twice as fast as I would expect for the energy
        consumption.&nbsp; And MOST of my money making innovations come
        from side effects of my main research...<br>
        <br>
        So I dutifully made measurements and compared the Wise Heater to
        a heating element that used a similar amount of wattage (my
        soldering iron).&nbsp; I used a wattmeter to measure the energy
        input (calculated to joules) and a thermometer on the jars.<br>
        <br>
        I report this experiment in my Brown's Gas, Book 1, written in
        the early 1990's see excerpt below:<br>
        <br>
        Experiment One<br>
        I placed two copper plates .0625 inch (1/16’) from each other in
        about 276 ml (just over a cup) of de-ionized water.<br>
        <br>
        Note: the water used in this experiment must be as pure as
        possible. ANY impurity will cause electrical consumption to
        rise.<br>
        <br>
        The plates were about .5 inch high by 1.5 inches long. They were
        held together by plastic bolts and apart by plastic washers. I
        soldered #14 solid copper leads to the plates.<br>
        <br>
        I plugged this directly into 120 VAC, as I had been assured (by
        MAXA) that Brown’s Gas could be produced by AC current.<br>
        <br>
        My electrolyzer as described in Experiment 1, drew only .5 Amp
        of current but went from 20°C (68°F) to 50°C (122°F) in ten
        minutes and to 94°C (201.2°F) in 25 minutes from the start of
        the experiment.<br>
        <br>
        I got all excited because there was a lot of gas. But I thought
        some of it must be steam, because of the high temperature. So I
        sealed my electrolyzer, assembled a condenser to separate the
        steam from the Brown’s Gas and directed all the vapors through
        the condenser, and then to a ‘displacement’ container.<br>
        <br>
        I figured the steam would condense (turn back to liquid) and
        drain back to the electrolyzer. I figured the Brown’s Gas (being
        oxygen and hydrogen) would remain in a vapor state when cooled
        and would displace water in my displacement container.<br>
        <br>
        By condensing the steam, I found that the vapors being produced
        by the electrolyzer were nearly all steam (99.99%).<br>
        <br>
        So much for copious Brown’s Gas.<br>
        <br>
        So much for a simple AC application with no electrolyte and no
        transformer.<br>
        <br>
        I did discover that the plates allowed the most current flow
        when they were in a horizontal position (plate surfaces vertical
        but depth shallow), so that the bubbles could remove themselves
        from between the plates quickly, allowing more liquid to come in
        from underneath.<br>
        <br>
        Bubbles between the plates impedes the electrical flow that
        produces more gas.<br>
        <br>
        I also discovered that the electrical forces involved were
        powerfulenough to rip the molecules right out of the copper
        plates.<br>
        <br>
        When operating this experiment for a period of time the water
        becomes cloudy with copper.&nbsp; When examined, the plates show
        obvious loss of copper.<br>
        <br>
        A side effect of this experiment seems to be ‘over-unity’ heat.
        Over-unity means that more energy is produced by a device than
        is supplied to it. To take 276 ml from 20°C to 50°C in ten
        minutes<br>
        indicates 34,643.52 joules. The electrical power used was about
        36,000 joules.<br>
        <br>
        This may not seem to be over unity on the face but you must
        remember that this was an open container at 3000 ft elevation
        with no insulation to prevent radiation, conduction and
        convection losses.<br>
        <br>
        I ran a side experiment with electric resistance heaters drawing
        the same amperage at the same voltage in the same container with
        the same volume of water and it took twenty minutes to go from
        20°C to 50°C and almost an hour to reach 85°C (185°F). The
        electric element was never able to bring the water to a full
        boil.<br>
        <br>
        Note, electric elements are supposed to be 98% efficient, so the
        above experiment 'indicates' that the Wise Heater is more than
        twice as efficient at heating water as an electric element.<br>
        <br>
        I also discovered that DC current flow (with set-up as per
        Experiment1, but with a bridge rectifier installed) at this high
        voltage still produced the ‘over-unity’ heat.<br>
        <br>
        I duplicated this experiment several times and have had friends
        duplicate it.<br>
        <br>
        However, getting back to the original experiment, high voltage
        (AC or DC) and no electrolyte did not produce significant
        amounts of H2 and O2, and what was produced was certainly not
        Brown’s Gas.<br>
        <br>
        The high voltage seemed to cause the H and O to reduce directly
        back to water as soon as it formed in the electrolyzer; with the
        net result of simply converting electricity into heat...<br>
        <br>
        So I suggest to you, as I did to Sterling during the Brown's Gas
        on Catalyst experiments, That the Wise Heater experiment be
        repeated, but use stainless steel plates (to increase
        electrodeposition voltage; so the plates won't degrade).<br>
        <br>
        The idea is to use plates like they are capacitor plates and
        'vibrate' the water to heat it up.<br>
        <br>
        There is a magnetic field between capacitor plates (I've proven
        that by putting a flat coil between pates and putting AC onto
        the plates; the coil output electricity like a transformer.)<br>
        <br>
        Water is polarized by magnetic fields, so when you put AC to the
        plates, it causes the water to be polarized one direction and
        then the other as the AC reverses voltage.&nbsp; Pulsing DC acts
        similarly.&nbsp; The 'flipping' of the water molecules back and
        forth heats up the water.<br>
        <br>
        Obviously, 50 or 60 Hz may not be the optimum, and both the
        plate spacing and plate height need to be experimented with, but
        the technology is valid and works as is.&nbsp; No need to be
        complicated, it's very simple.&nbsp; BTW, a glass jar prevents
        electrical shock, yet allows the heat to be gathered.<br>
        <br>
        You want to use pure water because any ions that cross the
        'capacitor' gap 'bleed' electricity.&nbsp; You want any
        electrical charge that's built up on a plate to return to the
        Grid on the opposite cycle, thus 'conserving' electricity.&nbsp;
        The Wise Heater technology could be considered a spinoff of my
        'Energy Conserver Theory" and my "Capacitive Power Supply"
        projects.<br>
        <br>
        Thus I can confirm that the Dumas Effect is likely REAL because
        of my own independent experiments.<br>
        <br>
        May the blessings be<br>
        <br>
        George Wiseman<br>
        <br>
        Peter Daysh Davey believed it to be a sonic effect more than
        just electricity, that you had to 'tune' the gap to make it
        produce large volumes of steam quickly and cheaply.<br>

        <br>
        "Well as it uses from 100% to around 20% of a normal forced
        current heater like a commercial waterboiler. The consumption
        depends on factors I have not investigated yet.<br>
        <br>
        By the way - there are no splitting water into H/O2 or forming
        of gasses whatsoever. So no electrolysis here!<br>
        <br>
        But something even more interesting is the viscosity of the
        water once resonated. It gets much thicker than tap water. And
        it seems to get rid of all the impurities in the water - laying
        at the bottom in a brownish colour.<br>
        <br>
        When resonating salt water the same thing happens. Only now
        there is a much thicker layer at the bottom - now including the
        salt.<br>
        <br>
        This could be a starters point for understanding Keely resonance
        technology, as water is a miracle learning tool. In my view
        mainly because of it's willingness to form any crystal bundles
        whatsoever - the incredible water memory capacity.<br>
        <br>
        Keely also noted water is as made for frequency manipulation.
        The Oxygen atom weighing exactly 16 times that of the hydrogen
        atom also makes it perfect for frequency disassociation.?"<br>

        But he decided to test whether the same phenomenon is to appear,
        if a metal hemisphere which simulates his pilot cabin is
        submerged in water and is excited into a resonance frequency.<br>
        <br>
        So he found two tops from old bicycle bells, joined them
        together, tuned one of them to 50 Hz frequency, attached
        electricity wire to each one of them, and thrown them into
        water.<br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, water started to boil extremely fast. So he made
        his first heater patent based on this observation. This patent
        was already registered in 1944.<br>

        have attached a pdf of if - JWD)<br>
        <br>
        After a hero return from the war, he had a device, which
        repetitively proved to everyone who measured it, that it has the
        efficiency decisively exceeding 100%.<br>

        <br>
        Mr Davey was a musician who volunteered to defend freedom and
        his country as a fighter pilot during the World War Two. He took
        part in the Battle for Britain. Fighter aeroplanes of that time
        had propellers and engines, which during acrobatics of aerial
        battles were making the pilots cabin to vibrate at various
        frequencies.<br>
        <br>
        As a sensitive musician Mr Davey noticed, that there was such a
        frequency of the motor and propeller buzzing, when the aeroplane
        cabin and his body were getting into a resonance.<br>
        <br>
        At this unique resonance frequency he always was experiencing an
        influx of heat in his aeroplane cabin.<br>
        <br>
        He did not know yet, that in future this phenomenon will be
        utilised in ultrasonic weapon systems for effective and
        undetected killing of people. But he decided to test whether the
        same phenomenon is to appear, if a metal hemisphere which
        simulates his pilot cabin is submerged in water and is excited
        into a resonance frequency of an AC current.<br>
        <br>
        So he found two tops from old bicycle bells, joined them
        together, tuned one of them to 50 Hz frequency, attached
        electricity wire to each one of them, and thrown them into
        water.<br>
        <br>
        Surprisingly, water started to boil extremely fast. So he made
        his first heater patent based on this observation. This patent
        was already registered in 1944.<br>
        <br>
        In times when I kept in touch with Mr Davey he explained to me
        that the fine tuning of the bowl (1) to the frequency of the
        current he carried out with the saxophone.<br>
        <br>
        Namely, holding the heater in his fingers he played on the
        saxophone the tune "low B" - which (the tune) is harmonic to the
        frequency of 50 Hz. (Other easily accessible sources of sounds
        having frequency 50 Hz include: piano - "low D", tuning fork -
        "50 Hz", buzzing electrical transformer, modern oscilloscope
        with a speaker.)<br>
        <br>
        If the bowl (1) of the heater would NOT fall into a resonance
        (i.e. would NOT vibrate noticeably) during this playing, then he
        slightly grinded (on a fast grinder) the front face of this bowl
        and then tried again. These repetitions he carried out as long
        as required for the bowl (1) always fall in the resonance
        (vibrations) when he played this tune.<br>
        <br>
        In turn the fine tuning of the distance "L" the inventor carried
        out by measuring the electricity consumption by the heater
        (means measuring the value of Amperes that flow through the
        heater). Namely he measured this power consumption for several

        This invention relates to electrical immersion heaters and more
        particularly to electrical immersion heaters which utilize the
        conductivity of liquid for their operation.<br>
        <br>
        It is well known that co-axial electrodes in water heaters and
        particularly for use with such a heater for immersion in a
        vessel of liquid including a system through which water flows
        are common to the art in connection with electric immersion
        heaters.<br>
        <br>
        The objects of this invention are to provide an improved
        electrical immersion heater which is very rapid in raising
        liquid temperatures when in use and which will not when in use
        undergo any ill effects if the liquid in which it is placed
        should evaporate entirely or the liquid supply is cut off; but
        will operate again immediately further liquid is provided for
        the heater.<br>
        <br>
        According to this invention the improved heater comprises a
        central electrode, circular electrodes arranged concentrically
        about the central electrode, means for holding the circular
        electrodes so that they vibrate and an electrical connection
        from one side of a source of alternating current to the central
        electrode and to electrodes alternate from the central
        electrode, and an electrical connection from the other side of a
        source of alternating current to the circular electrode adjacent
        he central electrode and to circular electrodes alternate from
        the circular electrode adjacent the central electrode.<br>
        <br>
        Further the invention comprises a casing having holed ends and a
        side or sides separating the ends, a central electrode holding
        the ends and sides together, grooves in the inner surfaces of
        the ends loosely retaining electrodes therein an electrical
        connection from one side of a source of alternating current to
        the central electrode and to circular electrodes alternate from
        the central electrode, and an electrical connection from the
        others side of a source of alternating current to the circular
        electrode adjacent the central electrode and to circular
        electrodes alternate from the circular electrode adjacent the
        central electrode.<br>
        <br>
        The invention will now be further described with reference to
        the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>

        <br>
        In accordance with the present invention the improved heater as
        schematically represented in Figure 1 has a central electrode 1
        surrounded by a second electrode 2 spaced therefrom and which,
        in turn, is surrounded by a third electrode 3 spaced therefrom,
        the space 4 between the second electrode 2 and central electrode
        1 and the space 5 between the second electrode 2 and third
        electrode 3 are equal, and the first and third electrodes 1, 3
        are in electrical connection with one another. When a heater
        having such circuit arrangement is immersed in a liquid and the
        second electrode 2 is connected with a terminal 6 of a source of
        alternating current and the first and third electrodes 1, 3 are
        connected with a terminal 7 to said source, the current passing
        through the electrodes 2, 1, and 3 and the liquid heats the
        liquid very rapidly.<br>
        <br>
        As illustrated any desired number of electrodes, concentric with
        the electrode 1 can be used and spaced apart, provided an
        earthed electrode 8 as a safety factor.<br>
        <br>
        The heater may be used by mere immersion in a bulk of liquid,
        see Figures 2, 3, and 4, or it may be interposed in a conduit
        through which liquid flows, e.g., a water pipe, see Figure 5.<br>
        <br>
        The size of the gaps or spaces such as 4, 5 between the
        electrodes 1, 2, or 3 controls the speed of heating, the smaller
        the gap or spaces such as 4, 5, the greater is the speed f
        heating, hence, if the heater be interposed in a water pipe or
        the like, see Figure 5, the gap or space such as 4, 5 must be
        determined according to the desired temperature and flow-volume.<br>
        <br>
        In the simplest form of the invention, the central electrode 1
        is&nbsp; a brass rod of circular cross section and the second
        and third electrodes 2, 3 are also of brass and are tubular and
        co-axial with said rod 1, the third electrode 3 is electrically
        connected with the first electrode 1 by a brass strip or wire 9
        integral with, or secured to, the third electrode 3, and the
        second electrode 2 has a brass strip or wire 10a spaced from
        said strip or wire 9 sufficiently to prevent sparking if the
        circuit remains closed after all the liquid has evaporated, or
        said strips or wires 9, 10a can be electrically insulated from
        each other. The electrodes may be plated brass.<br>
        <br>
        As an example suitable sizes of the parts may be a brass rod for
        central electrode 1 of 1/4" diameter with tubular brass second
        and third electrodes 2, 3&nbsp; 1/32" thick and spaced 1/4" from
        each other, the gap or space 4 between the second and first
        electrode also being 1/4". The assemblage may be 1-1/2" in
        height and the second electrode 2 may be spaced from the strip
        or wire 9 which connects the third electrodes 1, 3 about 1/8".<br>
        <br>
        As applied to a portable immersion heater for a bulk of liquid,
        the form of the invention as illustrated in Figure 5, 2, 3 and a
        casing made up of ends 10, 11 which have holes 12, 13 , 14&nbsp;
        having ingress and egress for liquid being treated, and thus to
        provide for the convective movement of liquid as it is heated,
        and also made up of sides 14 which separate the ends 10, 11. The
        central electrode 1 such as a brass rod is utilized to hold the
        casing together by screws 15, 16 countersunk into the ends 10,
        11, see Figure 4. The ends 10, 11, and side 14 are made of
        electrical insulating material such as porcelain. The inner
        surfaces of the ends 10, 11 have oppositely positioned grooves
        18 and the grooves 17 are concentrically spaced on said
        surfaces. The spacings of the grooves 17 are arranged to give
        desired spacing to electrodes such as 1, 2, 3 as set forth
        above. The grooves 17 are also arranged to accommodate the ends
        of the electrodes such as 2, 3 so that the latter are loosely
        retained in the grooves 17 and are free to move from side to
        side therein as electric current passes from liquid in the
        spaces between the electrodes. In this form of the invention an
        earthed electrode 8 is fastened round the outside of the side 14
        as a safety means in the event of an electrical fault developing
        in the heater. Various methods can be employed satisfactorily in
        effecting and maintaining an electrical connection and in one
        example the electrodes may be separated and retained in place
        with rubber blocks, the resiliency of rubber allowing a small
        movement of oscillation to take place. In this case contact may
        be maintained by brass strips clamped between the rubber blocks
        and the electrodes. Flexible retaining grooves may be used where
        connections may be made with stranded copper wire crimped and/or
        soldered to the rims of the electrodes.<br>
        <br>
        As indicated in Fiure 3 the electrical connections as described
        above are incorporated in the end 10, the earth connection 8
        being illustrated in Figures 2 and 4. When a heater made
        according to this form of the invention is immersed in liquid in
        a vessel it will be found that the liquid in its immediate
        neighborhood boils very rapidly and convection currents are set
        up through the concentric electrodes and through the holes 12
        and 13, thus enabling the whole bulk of the liquid to be heated
        speedily.<br>
        <br>
        In another form of the invention as illustrated in Figure 5, the
        immersion heater is interposed axially in the length of a water
        pipe and will be found to heat adequately a sufficient flow of
        water passing through the water pipe. In this form of the
        invention, as referenced in Figure 5, a conduit 18 leading from
        a controlled source of water supply is widened to form a casing
        19 which contains the end plates 10, 11 with holes 12, 13 and
        the electrodes 1, 2, 3 or a multiple thereof as previously
        described. The electrical connections may be from terminals 6, 7
        in the casing 19 and electrically wired to the respective
        electrodes as described before herein. After passing through the
        holes 12, 13 heated water emerges into a narrow conduit again
        and passes through the conduit to a faucet.<br>
        <br>
        In as much as there is no flow of electric current when there is
        no liquid to complete the circuit it follows that the heater
        cannot burn out if, through negligence, all the liquid is
        allowed to evaporate, or the source of liquid supply to a
        conduit in which the immersion heater is affixed is cut off.<br>

        When you put two plates or half balls of silver or copper and
        use distiled or rain water the device produces nano silver or
        nano copper particles and oxides like tetrasilvertetroxide or
        both if you use silver/copper metal.<br>
        <br>
        After at least two hours boiling one liter water with reflux
        condenser the water will contain a huge amount of monoatoms,
        nanoparticles and nano oxides.<br>
        <br>
        Such harmless waters can cure all viruses and all cancers. <br>
