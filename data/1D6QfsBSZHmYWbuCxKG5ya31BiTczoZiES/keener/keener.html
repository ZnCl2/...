      <br>
      A Purdue University researcher has found a way to eliminate
      bacteria in packaged foods such as spinach and tomatoes, a process
      that could eliminate worries concerning some food-borne illnesses.<br>
      <br>
      Kevin Keener designed a device consisting of a set of high-voltage
      coils attached to a small transformer that generates a
      room-temperature plasma field inside a package, ionizing the gases
      inside. The process kills harmful bacteria such as E. coli and
      salmonella, which have caused major public health concerns.<br>
      <br>
      Keener's process is outlined in an article released online early
      in LWT - Food Science and Technology, a journal for the Swiss
      Society of Food and Technology and the International Union of Food
      Science and Technology.<br>
      <br>
      "Conceptually, we can put any kind of packaged food we want in
      there," said Keener, an associate professor in the Department of
      Food Science. "So far, it has worked on spinach and tomatoes, but
      it could work on any type of produce or other food."<br>
      <br>
      By placing two high-voltage, low-watt coils on the outside of a
      sealed food package, a plasma field is formed. In the plasma
      field, which is a charged cloud of gas, oxygen has been ionized
      and turned into ozone. Treatment times range from 30 seconds to
      about five minutes, Keener said.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone kills bacteria such as E. coli and salmonella. The longer
      the gas in the package remains ionized, the more bacteria that are
      killed. Eventually, the ionized gas will revert back to its
      original composition.<br>
      <br>
      The process uses only 30-40 watts of electricity, less than most
      incandescent light bulbs. The outside of the container only
      increases a few degrees in temperature, so its contents are not
      cooked or otherwise altered.<br>
      <br>
      Other methods of ozone treatment require adding devices to bags
      before sealing them to create ozone or pumping ozone into a bag
      and then sealing it. Keener's method creates the ozone in the
      already sealed package, eliminating any opportunity for
      contaminants to enter while ozone is created.<br>
      <br>
      "It's kind of like charging a battery. We're charging that
      sample," Keener said. "We're doing it without electrode intrusion.
      We're not sticking a probe in the package. We can do this in a
      sealed package."<br>
      <br>
      Keener said testing has worked with glass containers, flexible
      plastic-like food-storage bags and rigid plastics, such as
      strawberry cartons and pill bottles. He said the technology also
      could work to ensure pharmaceuticals are free from bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about
      40,000 cases of Salmonellosis, an infection caused by salmonella,
      are reported each year in the United States, causing 400 deaths.
      The CDC reports that about 70,000 E. coli infections are reported
      each year, causing dozens of deaths.<br>

      and U.S. provisional application No. 61/162,785, filed on Mar. 24,
      2009, each of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] The present application relates an apparatus and method for
      treating packaged products to reduce undesirable contamination
      from viruses, bacteria, yeast, and mold, including spores and
      toxins, or for other treatment using a reactive gas atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] Biological decontamination and surface sterilization is
      crucial throughout society: in military applications such as the
      decontamination of equipment and facilities exposed to deadly
      biological agents, or in a broad array of civilian applications
      including medical applications, food production and consumer
      goods. Chemical, heat, high-energy electron beams, x-ray or
      gamma-ray irradiation systems are presently used in commercial
      treatments; however, utilization of these systems may not be
      practical due to the cost, efficiency, immobility, electric power
      requirements, toxic waste, personal hazard and the time required
      to decontaminate items.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Over the last decade, considerable research has been
      conducted in using atmospheric plasmas as a decontamination method
      of surfaces. Atmospheric plasmas have the ability to generate
      unique radiolytic profiles. Research has shown that biological
      contaminants exposed to atmospheric plasmas can be sterilized in
      seconds to minutes. Atmospheric plasmas are fairly easy to
      produce; and, the equipment needed is relatively inexpensive.
      There are no hazardous wastes and the gaseous by-products can be
      locally controlled. Up to this time, utilization of atmospheric
      plasmas has been through sealed chambers and jets.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Atmospheric, non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) is an example of
      a non-thermal processing method. There is a wide variance in the
      terminology for the process to produce such a plasma. In the
      literature, a variety of terminology is used to describe the
      phenomenon including atmospheric glow discharge, surface barrier
      discharge (SBD), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), Single
      Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD) and Surface Plasma Chemistry
      Process (SPCP). For convenience herein, the term dielectric
      barrier discharge (DBD) is used, without intending to exclude any
      of the ANEP plasma generating mechanisms implied by choosing a
      specific terminology for description of the technique herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] FIG. 1 shows simplified examples of DBD configurations that
      may be used to produce an ANEP in an ambient air environment. A
      high voltage generator 10 applies an alternating current potential
      to a pair of metallic plates 20, 30, spaced apart from each other
      to form a region 50 in which an object may be placed. At least one
      dielectric layer 40 is disposed between a first plate 20 and the
      second plate 30. In this manner, the effect of the dielectric
      layer is to limit the current of any filamentary discharge that is
      formed between the plate 20, 30 so as to prevent the formation of
      a high current arc. The discharge in region 50 is thus limited in
      energy and results in an ANEP where variety of reactive species
      may be formed from the gas (He, O2, N2, CO2 and water vapor)
      and/or interaction with the packaged product. FIG. 1A shows a
      configuration with one dielectric layer 40 laid against an
      electrode 20. FIG. 1B shows an example where a dielectric plate 40
      is laid against an electrode 20 and another dielectric plate 60 is
      laid against a second electrode 30. The charge accumulation on the
      plates which may be used in conjunction with the voltage waveform
      to estimate the power consumption may be measured by determining
      the voltage developed across a conventional capacitor 75. FIG. 1C
      illustrates a situation where a single dielectric layer 50 is
      disposed between the electrodes 20, 30, so that there are two
      regions 50 in which an ANEP may be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] As the possibility of an arc forming directly between the
      plates 20, 30 exists, by air paths around the dielectric, at least
      one electrode is often fully enclosed in an insulating material,
      and, the exposed electrode may be grounded. The insulating
      material may be the same material as used for the dielectric 40,
      60; however, the two materials may have differing properties. For
      example, the dielectric plate may be quartz and the insulating
      material may be a moldable material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0008] A system for treating an object is disclosed, including an
      apparatus configured to create an atmospheric non-equilibrium
      plasma (ANEP) using a working gas in a closed storage volume sized
      and dimensioned to contain an object to be treated. The voltage
      gradient applied to the working gas may be greater than about 1.4
      times an ionization voltage gradient of the working gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In an aspect the ANEP column length is greater than about
      2.0 cm. In another aspect, the voltage applied to electrodes of
      the apparatus may be greater than about 50 kV RMS.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The working gas may be selected from air, O2, N2, CO2, He,
      Ar, or a combination of these gasses, depending on the specific
      object to be treated. The object may be disposed either inside or
      outside the ANEP column.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] This technology generates reactive gas species in a sealed
      package. If the package is designed from a low permeability film
      then minutes to hours of contact time between the generated
      reactive gas species and the object can be realized, resulting in
      very large reductions in pathological microbialspecies. The
      technique may also be used to treat objects where the desired
      effect is a reaction of the ionized species with surface
      contaminants or with the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Many common packaging materials, used as the package, work
      well with this technology including: LDPE, HDPE, PP, PET,
      cardboard, Kraft paper, TYVEK (high density polyethylene fibers)
      and glass.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] A method of treating an object is disclosed including the
      steps of: providing a dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) device;
      providing a package suitable for substantially completely
      enclosing the object; inserting the object into the package;
      filling the package with a working gas at substantially
      atmospheric pressure; disposing a portion of the package with
      respect to the DBD device such that reactive species are produced
      in the package by the DBD apparatus; and, activating the DBD
      device for a first period of time by applying a voltage gradient.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The voltage gradient applied to the DBD device is greater
      than approximately 1.4 times an ionization voltage gradient of the
      working gas. In an aspect first period of time may be less than
      about 15 seconds. In another aspect, the first period of time may
      be less than about 60 seconds. The object may be retained in the
      treatment volume for a second period of time so as to permit the
      generated reactive species to interact with the object being
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In an aspect the container may be manipulated so as to
      provide more even application of the reactive species to the
      object being treated.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0022] Exemplary embodiments may be better understood with
      reference to the drawings. Like numbered elements in the same or
      different drawings perform equivalent functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In the interest of clarity, not all the routine features of
      the examples herein are described. It will of course be
      appreciated that in the development of any such actual
      implementation, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be
      made to achieve a developer's specific goals, such as
      consideration of system, regulatory and business related
      constraints. These goals will vary from one implementation to
      another.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Atmospheric pressure “cold” plasmas have been shown to be
      effective in reducing or eliminating surface bacterial
      contamination of food samples. The term “cold plasma” is meant to
      describe a plasma discharge, which may be a non-equilibrium
      plasma, occurring at a pressure of about one-atmosphere and at
      near ambient temperature (ANEP). This is to distinguish the ANEP
      plasma from a thermal plasma discharge operating at a bulk gas
      temperature of hundreds or thousands of degrees above the ambient
      temperature. In a “cold plasma” at atmospheric pressure the
      electrons may have a significantly higher temperature than the ion
      and neutral species; however, the bulk temperature of the working
      gas is not significantly increased with respect to the ambient
      temperature In this context, the term “cold” should not be
      interpreted to require refrigeration or other cooling to perform
      the decontamination or treatment functions described herein;
      however, this does not exclude the treating or the subsequent
      storage of the treated object at an appropriate temperature, which
      may include refrigeration or cooling. Keeping the gas at a
      near-ambient temperature may contribute to avoidance of heat
      damage to the object being treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] One technique of creating an atmospheric non-equilibrium
      plasma is to apply a high voltage to the volume to be ionized,
      while inhibiting the transition from a glow discharge to an arc
      discharge by limiting the discharge current. This may be done, for
      example, by covering at least one of the electrodes of the
      apparatus with a dielectric layer; resistive layers have also been
      used. The discharge current is self-limited by charge build up on
      the dielectric surface. Typically, the excitation voltage
      frequency is in the kHz range, but may range from power line
      frequencies to radio frequencies. The experimental data presented
      herein used a 60 Hz frequency due to the availability of high
      voltage transformers, whose output voltage could be easily be
      adjusted by controlling the input voltage thereof with a variable
      voltage transformer.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Dielectric-barrier discharges (DBD) are a type of
      alternating-current high-voltage gaseous discharges that may be
      formed in a nominally atmospheric pressure environment. The
      presence of a dielectric layer between the electrodes prevents the
      charge generated in the gas by the discharge from reaching at
      least one of the conducting electrode surfaces. Often the
      dielectric layer is applied to both of the electrodes. Within each
      half-cycle of the driving voltage waveform, when the voltage
      gradient applied across the gas exceeds that required for
      breakdown, the formation of narrow ionized discharge filaments
      initiates the conduction of electrons toward the more positive
      electrode, and ions towards the more negative electrode, although
      the mobility of the electrons is greater than that of the ions. An
      electrical charge accumulates on the dielectric layer(s) at the
      end(s) of each ionized filament; and, the voltage drop across the
      ionized filament reduces until the voltage falls below the
      discharge-sustaining level, so that the discharge is extinguished.
      The duration of the filamentary discharge is believed to be quite
      short: of the order of 100 nanoseconds or less. However, the
      resultant reactive species may have a significantly longer
      lifetime. The low charge mobility along the surface of the
      dielectric also limits the lateral region over which the gap
      voltage is diminished, so that a plurality of filaments may form
      in close proximity to one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Production of ozone and other reactive species in a DBD
      occurs between the two electrodes when operated at a particular
      voltage, frequency, and geometry. In air, mixtures of O2 and N2,
      or O2 alone, reactive oxygen species are generated which react
      with each other as well as oxygen molecules resulting in the
      formation of ozone. Other reactive species are created when N2, or
      other gases such as CO2, H2O or Cl are present. The most oxidative
      species in air and oxygen gas include ozone (O3), singlet oxygen
      (O or O&lt;−&gt;), superoxide (O2&lt;−&gt;), peroxide (O2&lt;−2
      &gt;or H2O2), and hydroxyl radicals (OH). Most of these species
      have very short half-lives (in the range of milliseconds);
      however, ozone has a much longer half-life ranging from minutes to
      days depending on conditions. The effects of gaseous ozone on
      foods has previously been studied with promising results and ozone
      has been shown to be more efficient at lower concentrations and
      treatment times than more standard sanitizers, including chlorine.
      Presently, the use of ozone has been limited to the treatment of
      unpackaged products.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The effectiveness of the system and method described herein
      is due to an extent on the ability to generate reactive gas
      species in a sealed package. If the package is fabricated from a
      low permeability film. then minutes to hours of contact time
      between the reactive gas species and the bacteria can be realized,
      resulting in very large reductions in microbial populations. Over
      the duration of the storage time, the ozone and nitrogen oxides in
      the package will convert back to simple oxygen and nitrogen
      molecules, and upon reaching a final destination (e.g., grocery
      store or medical supply store), the reactive gas species in the
      package will have been converted back to original gas composition
      (air or modified atmosphere).<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In particular, the object to be treated may be enclosed in
      a sealed or substantially sealed container. The container need not
      be hermetic unless the level of decontamination desired is such
      that subsequent contamination from another source is to be
      avoided. Low permeability containers may retain long-lived
      reactive species, which may extend the effective treatment time
      and improve the resultant decontamination results. Non-hermetic
      containers may be used in applications where subsequent
      re-contamination of the sample is prevented by the characteristics
      of the packaging. Non-hermetic containers may be permeable to some
      extent to air, and to the other constituent gases or the radicals
      or reactive species produced by the ANEP. That is, the packaging
      may be porous to gases, but prevent spoilage or pathogenic
      material from entering the package. The composition of the
      container may be a plastic such as TYGON, low-density polyethylene
      (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDP), polypropylene (PP),
      polyethylene terapthalate (PET), TYVEK, or polystyrene; however,
      various other substantially dielectric materials can be used,
      including, glass, wax, cardboard, paper, foil, eggshells, low
      dielectric constant materials, or the like. The foil may be a
      plastic having a thin metallic coating. This may permit the
      treatment of objects stored in a foil package, or having a foil
      liner.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] An apparatus for treating a sample is shown in FIG. 2. An
      object to be treated 200 is placed in a substantially closed
      dielectric container or package 100. The container may be rigid or
      flexible and may be sealed by a ZIPLOC closure, by heat, by a
      close-fitting cap, or any other mechanism that has a similar
      effect. The container should have an ability to substantially
      retain the reactive species that are the residual of the generated
      ANEP plasma for a period of time that is sufficient for a
      particular treatment process. The working gas, which may be air,
      or a modified atmosphere packaging (MA) mixture, may be introduced
      into the container 100 prior to treatment. The container 100 may
      be purged prior to charging with the working gas so as to control
      the resulting gas mixture. The container may be sealed either
      permanently or temporarily prior to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A region within the container is selected where an ANEP may
      be generated. This may be a specific formed region of a semi-rigid
      or rigid container, or may be formed by manipulation of a flexible
      container where the gas pressure gives the container a deformable
      shape. In rigid containers, the gas pressure may be less than an
      atmosphere, while the gas pressure in a flexible container is an
      atmosphere or greater. This does not exclude situations, for
      example, where vacuum packing is used, and a working gas may be
      introduced for the purposes of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 2A illustrates a situation where the object being
      treated is disposed between the plates of the apparatus, while
      FIG. 2B illustrates the situation where the object being treated
      is disposed so that a small thickness of the storage bag having a
      gap between the opposing surfaces is disposed between the plates
      of the apparatus. For the situation of FIG. 2B, the ANEP is
      created inside a portion of the storage container; however, the
      object to be treated may not be directly exposed to the active
      ANEP (“out-of-field” configuration). Rather, the residual reactive
      species may be diffused or circulated within the volume of
      container having the object to be treated. This configuration may
      reduce the voltage needed to establish the ANEP as the distance
      between the electrodes may be reduced compared with the thickness
      of the object. In addition, where the termination of the plasma
      filaments on the object itself may be undesirable, that situation
      is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In contrast, the arrangement of FIG. 2A disposes the object
      to be treated between the electrodes, and the object itself may
      behave as a dielectric, similar to that used on one or more of the
      electrodes. In this circumstance, the filaments creating the ANEP
      may extend from the electrode, or the dielectric barrier on an
      electrode, or an electrode without a dielectric barrier, to a
      surface of the object to be treated; and an active ANEP may also
      surround the object (“in-field” configuration). The electrons and
      the ions created in the ANEP may directly impinge on the surface
      of the object. Similarly to the arrangement of FIG. 2B, the object
      may continue to be exposed to the ANEP byproducts after the active
      phase of ANEP generation has been completed. Each of the processes
      may be repeated, if needed, where the object or the storage bag or
      container is manipulated to better distribute the active
      byproducts or expose other portions of the object to the plasma or
      the ANEP products. Conductive objects may also be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As shown in FIG. 2A, the container 100 having a working gas
      300 and an object to be treated 200 may be disposed between the
      plates of a DBD apparatus 2. The plates 20, 30 are spaced apart so
      as to admit at least portion of the container 100 containing the
      object to be treated 200. The distance between the plates may be
      controlled by mechanical means, if desired, so that the container
      100 may conveniently be placed between the plates 20, 30, and the
      spacing between the plates subsequently adjusted so as to
      partially compress the container 100, so as to achieve an
      appropriate gap spacing for the creation of the ANEP within the
      container 100. In this configuration, filamentary discharges may
      occur between the dielectric surface 40 of the top plate 20 and
      the opposing surface of the object 200 being treated, and may also
      occur between the bottom plate 30 and the object being treated
      200. The ANEP may also be created by electrical currents flowing
      directly from one plate to another, as mediated by the dielectric
      layer on the plate. Other mechanical arrangements may also be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Where the object to be treated has the general
      characteristics of a dielectric material, the filaments will
      exhibit a behavior similar to that which would occur in a DBD
      apparatus without an introduced object, except that the filaments
      may terminate one end thereof on the object. So, the object will
      be directly exposed to the filamentary discharges creating the
      ANEP, as well as to the shorter lasting and longer lasting
      reactive species that are generated during the active treatment
      phase. As the surface density of filaments is governed by the
      electrical field distribution, and the shape and electrical
      properties of the object to be treated, the entire surface of the
      object may not be subject to the same intensity of direct
      treatment. Should more uniform treatment be desired, the object to
      be treated 200 may be manipulated to expose other parts of the
      object to direct treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The high voltage is often sinusoidal and may be produced by
      a high-voltage transformer connected to the power grid, a signal
      generator connected to an amplifier, or the like. Other voltage
      waveform shapes may be used, including sawtooth, trapezoidal,
      pulsed, symmetrical, asymmetrical, or displaced from DC. The
      amplitude of the voltage may be controlled during operation of the
      apparatus by, for example, a VARIAC transformer, or by controlling
      the signal generator amplitude output, or the amplifier gain. The
      frequency of operation may be fixed or variable. In the
      experiments described herein, the local power line frequency (60
      Hz) was used for convenience in configuring the experimental
      apparatus and cost considerations. ANEP plasmas can also be
      created using DC where a resistive layer is used as a a current
      limiter or ballast.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The voltage gradient at which a glow discharge is formed is
      a function of the constitutive gases present between the
      electrodes, various geometrical considerations, and the gas
      pressure. The constituent gases may be modified so as to achieve a
      desired concentration and species of ionized particles. In
      addition to air, O2, N2, CO2, H2O, Cl, and other mixtures, or pure
      gases, including inert and noble gases, are usable, depending on
      the application.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As shown in FIG. 2B when a flexible container 100, which
      may be a plastic storage bag, is used, the gas fill level may
      selected so a that a portion of the container may be compressed
      between the plates 20, 30 so as to form a smaller gap to
      facilitate creation of the ANEP at a lower voltage. Here, the
      container is shown in a state where a portion 110 of the container
      100 is positioned between the electrodes of the DBD apparatus 3,
      so that a portion of the container 100 may be temporarily formed
      into a region where the ANEP may be created. The filaments
      creating the ANEP are formed between the surface of the dielectric
      40 and the other electrode plate 30, such that the object 200 to
      be treated is not disposed therebetween. Portions of the container
      surface disposed so as to form the region in which the ANEP is to
      be formed may be held against the dielectric 40 and the plate 30
      by the internal gas pressure. The effect of the dielectric layer
      of the container surface may be small, as the charge distributions
      are likely to be dominated by those of the electrodes and the
      dielectric 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 2C shows a top view of the DBD apparatus 3 of FIG. 2B.
      The dielectric material extends so as to inhibit stray discharges,
      and, the electrodes may be disposed opposite only a portion of the
      storage volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The electrodes may be planar, as shown; however, other
      geometries may be used to conform to a container such as a box,
      pill bottle, jar, or other shape. Shaped electrodes may be used to
      encourage the formation of a plasma jet, or better distribute the
      reaction products using induced convection. For example, large
      cardboard containers may be processed by using a pair of
      electrodes oriented at a 90° angle and placed along one or more of
      the edges. Similar configuration may be used for large packages of
      other materials and shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The term package has been used to represent the enclosure,
      bag, container, treatment volume or storage volume in which the
      object is treated and subsequently stored. At least parts of the
      package are fabricated from a dielectric material compatible with
      the treatment process, and could be, for example, a bottle, a
      vial, an opaque plastic food tray sealed with a thin transparent
      film, or the like. The objects to be processed need not be
      dielectric, as metallic objects could be exposed as well. The
      apparatus and technique described herein may be used to sterilize
      or otherwise decontaminate objects such as medical supplies,
      including surgical instruments, syringes, consumer products, or
      other treatable objects and materials. They do not need to be
      removed from the packaging after treatment and until immediately
      prior to use. One may repeat the sterilization process in the
      hospital or physician's office or at a point of sale or
      distribution prior to opening the packaging for further
      suppression of contaminants or pathogens. It should be noted that
      the dielectric characteristics of the material forming the
      container may be used as the dielectric barrier of the DBD,
      providing that the electrical characteristics thereof prevent
      dielectric breakdown.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The inventors have discovered unexpected results where
      process or apparatus parameters such as relative humidity, voltage
      gradient, electrode geometry, and voltage, in addition to the gas
      composition and package type, may have a significant effect on
      performance in a sterilization or decontamination application.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The data presented herein illustrates the use of an
      apparatus and method of killing Bacillus subtilis spores, as a
      representative of biological contaminants, under a variety of
      plasma generation voltages ( ̃13 kV, 50 kV, 80 kV RMS), electric
      field gradients (12.5-20 kV/cm), gap distances (1.0, 2.5 and 4.5
      cm) and gas compositions (air, MA) where the object to be treated
      is disposed within a sealed package and either inside and outside
      of the plasma field. Unexpected improvements in performance obtain
      when certain process parameters are adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] An apparatus (PK-1), is based on a dielectric barrier
      discharge (DBD) process, with plate electrodes comprised of
      insulated conductors connected to a power unit with specifications
      of 18 kV RMS (max) @ 30 mA @ 60 Hz. The sample package is in
      disposed such that opposing sides thereof are in contact with the
      insulated high voltage electrodes, providing a dielectric barrier
      between the electrodes, thereby limiting current flow through the
      sample package and controlling the power requirements for
      treatment. Only 40-50 W of power was needed to ionize an air
      atmosphere inside a 4 L (nominal) re-sealable plastic (LDPE) bag.
      Other means of insulating the electrodes, which may be a flat
      plate, flat wound coil, or the like, include a dielectric sheet
      disposed between an electrode and the package, or a dielectric
      layer formed around the electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The high-voltage applied to the electrodes may ionize a
      gas, which may be a mixture of gasses, within the electric field
      inside the package containing the sample. The sample may be, for
      example, a food or a medical device. or other object to be
      sterilized, decontaminated or otherwise plasma treated. Ionization
      produced by the DBD process can result in the production of
      significant concentrations of reactive molecules, including ozone
      concentrations above 1% in a few minutes, without a noticeable
      increase in the sample surface temperature. Specific treatment
      times for targeted spore or bacterial reductions are dependent on
      sample contamination, packaging material, gas composition, and
      package/electrode configuration. The in-package ionization process
      has been demonstrated in a number common packaging materials
      including, cardboard, glass, various plastics such as LDPE, HDPE,
      PET, polystyrene, TYGON, rubber and others.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] A second similar apparatus (PK-2) was also built and has
      specifications of 130 kV RMS (max) at 20 mA @ 60 Hz, so as to
      enable exploration of different parameters. The PK-2 system can
      ionize a sealed package of air with an electrode gap of up to
      about 10 cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The PK-1 and PK-2 systems were comparatively evaluated for
      reduction in pathological organisms by studying the reduction of
      Bacillus subtilis spores in packages containing either air or a
      variety of MA (modified atmosphere) gases, where the sample was
      disposed either inside or outside of a plasma field.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A 2×3×1×1×2×3 experimental series design was selected that
      utilized two voltage conditions: 13.5 kV RMS/44 W/1.0 cm gap (PK-1
      ionization system) and 80 kV RMS/150 W/4.5 cm gap (PK-2 ionization
      system); 3 treatment conditions: infield ionization, out-of-field
      ionization, and no ionization; a treatment time of 300 s (PK-1)
      and 120 s (PK-2), respectively; room temperature; two package gas
      types: air (78% N2, 22% O2) and modified atmosphere, MA (65% O2,
      30% CO2, 5% N2); and replicated in triplicate.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Air (78% N2, 22% O2) and modified atmosphere (MA) gas (65%
      O2, 30% CO2, 5% N2) were purchased from a local gas supplier at
      specified concentrations with a certificate of analysis. These gas
      composition(s) were then metered into sealed package at a rate of
      2.1 L/min. using a shielded flow meter with stainless steel ball
      (Gilmont Instruments, Inc., Barrington, Ill., USA) yielding final
      fill volume of 1.5 L with average fill time of 45 s.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Clear, 3.78 L Ziploc™ (SC Johnson and Son, Inc., Racine,
      Wis., USA) heavy-duty freezer bags were obtained from a local
      grocery store. The bags were made of low-density polyethylene
      (LDPE) and had a 1.6 mm thick wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Bacillus subtilis var. niger (B. atrophaeus) spore strips
      (NAMSA, Northwood, Ohio, USA) with size of 3.2 cm×0.6 cm, each
      containing Bacillus populations of 1.5-2.5×10&lt;6&gt;/strip or
      6.18-6.40 log10 were loaded into an open sterile petri dish inside
      the treatment package and then used in the experiments. For
      in-field ionization with PK-1 system, one end of each spore strip
      was secured with transparent tape to the inside of the storage bag
      within electrode gap space prior to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The PK-1 system was operated 13.5 kV RMS at 44 W and 60 Hz
      generating a 13.5 kV RMS/cm gradient between the electrodes (1.0
      cm gap). The electrodes consisted of coils of wire wound around a
      flat dielectric object with a treatment area of 51 cm&lt;2
      &gt;(8.5 cm×6 cm). The PK-2 system was operated at 80 kV RMS at
      150 W and 60 Hz across circular stainless steel electrodes (15 cm
      dia, 4.5 cm gap, 17.8 kV RMS/cm voltage gradient). The high
      voltage transformer of the PK-2 was obtained from Phenix
      Technologies, Accident, Md.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The storage bags containing spore samples were filled with
      the working gas (air or MA) and purged three times to ensure
      purity of the gas in the bag. A small, uniform amount of gas was
      expelled from the bag to allow for orientation of plasma
      electrodes if needed to achieve desired gap distance. The
      electrodes opposed each other, with the bag disposed therebetween
      and having an approximate gap distance of 1.0 cm (PK-1) and 4.5 cm
      (PK-2). Each system was activated for treatment times of 300 s
      (PK-1) or 120 s (PK-2). The gas volume in the bag was agitated
      manually (by pressing lightly back-and-forth on the bag) once
      treatment was complete to allow for a more uniform distribution of
      gas inside the bag prior to double-bagging for 24 h storage at
      room temperature (22° C.).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The temperature of the electrodes and treated storage bags
      was measured prior to and immediately after treatment using an
      infrared thermometer (Omega Engineering, Inc., Stamford, Conn.,
      USA). All storage bag temperatures of treated samples registered
      at room temperature after treatment for both systems. Ozone and
      nitric oxide concentrations were measured immediately following
      the 300 s or 120 s treatments as well as after 24 h storage using
      DRAEGER Short-Term Detector tubes (Draeger Safety AG &amp; Co.,
      Luebeck, Germany) Carbon monoxide concentrations were also
      measured after the 24 h storage period. The tubes were chosen for
      ease of use with the given experimental setup and for their rapid
      measurement capabilities. The tubes contain a reagent which
      changes color upon coming into contact with the specified gas and
      are calibrated for specific sampling volumes. Tubes were connected
      to a bellows hand pump, Accuro Gas Detector Pump (Draeger Safety
      AG &amp; Co., Luebeck, Germany), and calibrated such that one pump
      action equals 100 mL of gas. The Ozone tubes (part no. CH21001)
      had an indicated range of 20-300 ppm. Nitrous oxides (part no.
      24001) tubes had an indicated range between 20-500 ppm. A
      cross-sensitivity of 50 ppm NOx per 1,000 ppm ozone was
      identified. Carbon monoxide tubes (part no. 33051) had an
      indicated range between 25-300 ppm.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] It was noted that carbon monoxide tubes had an interference
      with ozone. Thus, no carbon monoxide measurements could be taken
      with ozone present. In order to determine ozone values when
      measuring very high concentrations, smaller gas sample volumes
      were collected in 5 mL or 20 mL syringes. The syringe was
      connected to the detection tube by means of flexible tubing. A
      syringe volume was expelled into the detection tube and then
      removed allowing total flow volume of 100 ml to occur. The
      observed gas concentration was then multiplied by the volume ratio
      of the detection tube volume over the syringe volume. The DRAEGER
      portable gas detection system had a precision of ±15% (Draeger
      Safety AG &amp; Co., Luebeck, Germany).<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Spore recoveries and aseptic methods were in accordance
      with manufacturer (NAMSA, Northwood, Ohio, USA) instructions for
      population verification of Bacillus subtilis spore strips. After
      ionization treatment and 24 h storage, each strip was aseptically
      removed from bag and transferred into sterile 20×150 mm test tube
      containing 10 mL of 0.1% sterile peptone. Seven to ten sterile 6
      mm glass beads were then added to each test tube. Each test tube
      was vortexed (model vortexer 59, Denville Scientific, Inc.,
      Metuchen, N.J., USA) on high speed for 120 s or until the spore
      strip was fully macerated into loose fibers. Test tubes were then
      heat shocked by placing into a 500 mL beaker with 300 mL of water
      heated to 90° C. and maintained at 80-85° C. for 10 minutes. Test
      tubes were transferred to a cold tap water bath momentarily (2
      min), and then to ice water bath to rapidly cool test tubes to
      0-4° C. Test tubes were then removed from ice bath and further
      serial dilutions were performed including 10&lt;−2&gt;,
      10&lt;−3&gt;, 10&lt;−4&gt;, and/or 10&lt;−5 &gt;based on
      treatments or recoveries of positive (+) controls (Bacillus
      populations of 1.5-2.5×10&lt;6&gt;/strip, 6.18-6.40 log10). The
      required aliquot volumes from corresponding serial dilutions were
      then plated into respective petri dishes (100×15 mm) containing
      sterile Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) prepared per Difco Manual
      specifications for spore colony enumeration [5]. TSA plates were
      incubated at 30-31° C. and colony growth and recoveries were
      monitored at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Relative humidity and temperatures inside the storage bags
      were measured using a Springfield® Precise Temp™ relative humidity
      sensor (Taylor Precision Products, Oak Brook, Ill., USA) recorded
      at 0 h and 24 h storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 3 and FIG. 4 document the reactive oxygen species
      generation during in-package ionization at the specified times for
      both 13.5 kV and 80 kV. It can be seen from these data that high
      levels of reactive oxygen species can be generated for both air
      and MA gas. At 13.5 kV, an ozone generation rate of 1,200 and
      1,500 ppm per minute were observed for air and MA gas,
      respectively. At 80 kV, an ozone generation rate of 3,750 ppm and
      6,250 ppm per minute were observed for air and MA gas,
      respectively. These results suggest that increased ionization
      voltage increases the generation rate of reactive oxygen species.
      In air, the nitrous gas concentrations did not significantly
      change with ionization voltage. Both voltages (13.5 kV and 80 kV)
      achieved maximum nitrous gas concentration of approximately 1,000
      ppm with an air atmosphere. However, the MA gas nitrous gas
      concentrations reached a significantly higher level with increased
      ionization voltage. Nitrous gas concentrations at 80 kV reached
      over 4,000 ppm at 120 seconds treatment time.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] At least some of the increase in the ozone generation rate,
      and the resultant concentrations at the higher voltages may be
      attributed to the longer ionization path resulting from the 4.5 cm
      electrode spacing when using 80 kV in some of the experiments.
      However, some of the increase may also be due to the higher
      voltage gradients, which may also generate other reactive species
      that have not yet been measured. Each of the constituent gases has
      a different ionization potential at atmospheric pressure. These
      factors interact, and thus a different set of experiments would be
      performed to optimize these parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Both ozone and nitrous oxides levels decayed to zero within
      24 hours of treatment. However, there was a measureable carbon
      monoxide concentration in MA gas at 24-hours post-treatment with
      levels 200 ppm and 400 ppm for the 13.5 kV and 80 kV at treatment
      times of 300 s and 120 s, respectively. The current carbon
      monoxide measurement method did not allow measurement in the
      presence of ozone (e.g., time zero).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 5 and FIG. 6 illustrate the spore reductions achieved
      with ANEP treatment. In-package ionization both inside and outside
      of the ionization field at 13.5 kV and 80 kV may eliminate
      Bacillus subtilis spores. At 13.5 kV, treatment times for MA gas
      spore elimination were 180 s and 300 s for outside and inside
      field positioning, respectively. At 13.5 kV, treatment times for
      air atmosphere, spore elimination occurred at 300 s inside
      ionization field with insignificant spore reductions (&lt;1.2 log)
      outside of the ionization field.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] However, at 80 kV, complete elimination of spores was
      obtained in 15 s or less with no measureable difference in spore
      reduction rates between air and MA gas. When the samples were
      disposed inside the field, high voltage treatment times showed
      increased spore populations (&gt;2 log) recoveries at 48 h
      compared to 24 h; however, no addition organisms were recovered at
      72 h. These results demonstrate that using an 80 kV in-package
      ionization process, air or MA gas can provide complete elimination
      of Bacillus subtilis spores in 15 s or less. For these studies,
      dry air was used and all samples were maintained at between 20%
      and 30% relative humidity at room temperature. Elevated humidity
      may provide an even greater spore reduction rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Atmospheric or MA plasma may be advantageous to quickly
      remove microorganisms from surfaces. These experimental results
      clearly demonstrate the sterilization capability of in-package
      ionization for Bacillus subtilis spores, and would be indicative
      of results that should be obtained with other microorganisms.
      Using in-package ionization processes with higher ionization
      voltages, voltage gradients and MA gas resulting in shorter
      sterilization times. A complete elimination of spores was observed
      in less than 15 s or less for air and MA gas at 80 kV. In
      addition, at 13.5 kV spore elimination can be achieved with MA and
      air in 300 s or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In yet another aspect, to further understand the results of
      the voltage gradient and the different MA packaging atmospheres on
      the efficacy of in-package plasma-based sterilization, a further
      two-phase series of experiments was performed. In phase I,
      in-package ionization was performed on empty, sealed packages for
      sixteen gas blends and the concentrations of reactive gas species
      measured. The composition of these gas blends were selected to
      encompass a wide range of common gases (oxygen, nitrogen, carbon
      dioxide, helium, and argon) and shown in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] These data were used to identify three gas blends that
      yielded high concentrations of measured reactive gas species
      (e.g., ozone, nitric oxides, carbon monoxide) and, along with air,
      were then used for sporicidal treatment in phase II. The selection
      of the particular gas mixtures was appropriate for a survey
      experiment where a large range of valid data was being collected,
      rather than in an experiment exploring one or more of the mixtures
      in detail. As such, the selection of the gas mixtures, and the
      voltages and voltage gradients that were used should be understood
      as providing for comparable sporicidal treatment data between the
      differing parameters, rather than limiting the scope of the MA
      mixtures and processing parameters that may be desirable in a
      particular situation.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Phase I of this experiment series comprised a 16×7×2
      experiment: 16 gas blends of O2, N2, CO2, He, and Ar were
      configured (Table 1) and placed inside of packages sealed in a
      Cryovac B2630 high barrier package. The sealed packages (22 cm×30
      cm) were filled with 1.76 L of the selected gas blend using a
      calibrated flow meter and stored at room temperature (22° C.). All
      of packages were treated in duplicate with the PK-2 ionization
      system at 50 kV RMS (65-75 W @ 0.5-0.8 mA) with a depth of 2.5 cm.
      Ionization electrodes consisted of rectangular wrappings of wire
      coils approximately 7.5 cm×11.5 cm placed directly above and below
      the center of the package. Underneath the package was a TYVEK
      layer (0.1905 mm) and a layer of red polypropylene (1.94 mm)
      sandwiched between the package and the bottom electrode The TYVEK
      layer was intended to simulate a bag that had layers of two
      different materials, as while TYVEK is a preferred material for
      use in medical instrument packaging, the material is not gas
      tight, so it would likely be combined with a gas tight
      polypropylene or other such bag as used in these experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Treatment times used were: 0 s, 15 s, 30 s, 60 s, 150 s,
      300 s, and 600 s. Ozone and nitrogen oxide gas measurements were
      taken using the DRAEGER gas analysis system immediately after
      treatment and at 24 h room temperature storage.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Carbon monoxide measurements using the DRAEGER system
      cannot be taken in the presence of high ozone concentrations due
      to interference and were only taken after 24 h. Relative humidity
      and temperature were also recorded.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In summary, the results of phase I were that all of the
      selected gas blends could be ionized to generate bactericidal
      molecules (e.g., ozone, nitric oxides, and carbon monoxide). In
      general, a greater concentration of ozone was observed for gas
      blends with higher oxygen content, except when a noble gas (in
      these experiments, argon or helium) was added to the gas blends.
      When a noble gas was added to the gas blend, the minimum voltage
      needed for ionization was reduced; however, the benefit of adding
      noble gas to generate increased reactive gas species was mixed.
      Some gas blends showed increased ozone concentrations while others
      showed reduced ozone concentrations. Maximum ozone concentrations
      were obtained in gas blend #12-16,000 ppm at 150 s and 18,750 ppm
      at 600 s. Maximum nitric oxide concentrations of 4,500 ppm were
      also generated in gas blend #12 with a number of other gas blends
      (#10, #11, and #16) having maximum nitric oxide concentrations
      between 1,500 and 2,000 ppm. Carbon monoxide measurement is only
      available after 24 h due to measurement interference from high
      concentrations of nitric oxide and ozone. After 24 h storage,
      maximum carbon monoxide levels of 375 ppm were obtained from gas
      blend #9 at 600 s treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In phase II of this experiment series a 4×5×2×2 experiment
      was performed. Four gas blends identified in phase I with
      significant concentration of reactive gas species were selected
      (shown in bold in Table 1). Active plasma treatment times used
      were: 0 s, 15 s, 30 s, 60 s, and 120 s. Single spore strips
      (1.5-2.5×10&lt;6 &gt;cfu) of Bacillus subtilis var. niger were
      placed in open petri dishes at the center (direct exposure to the
      ionizing field) inside the sealed bag and at the right edge
      (indirect exposure) inside of the bag. The packages (22 cm×30 cm)
      were then sealed and filled with two liters of the selected gas
      (#7, #9, #12, #16) using a calibrated flow meter and stored at
      room temperature (22° C.). All packages were treated in duplicate
      with the PK-2 ionization system at 50 kV RMS (65-75 W @ 0.5-0.8
      mA) with a depth of 2.5 cm. All treated packages were stored for
      24 h and then bacterial spore recoveries were conducted using
      standard microbiological methods as previously described. In
      addition, a 72 hour recovery was also performed to ensure no
      regrowth.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In summary, for phase II, the results documented complete
      elimination of bacterial spores with all treatments for both
      direct and indirect exposure after 24 h storage. The time required
      for complete elimination (greater than 6 log reduction) varied
      with the gas blend. The shortest times for spore elimination were
      60 s for both direct and indirect treatment in gas blend #9 and
      #16. The longest times were 120 s for gas blend #7 (air) and #12.
      Additional reductions in treatment times may likely be achieved by
      further adjustment of processing parameters such as increasing
      electric field voltages, reducing electrode gap, and electrode
      geometry. The results demonstrate that in-package ionization can
      eliminate bacterial spores, whether under direct or indirect
      exposure, from inside medical packages and potentially provides an
      alternative non-thermal sterilization method for these products.<br>

      [0072] The protocol for this second series of experiments was
      similar to that of the first set of experiments and only salient
      differences in the protocol are presented.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] Gas tanks with 16 different compositions were purchased
      from a local gas supplier at specified concentrations, each with a
      certificate of analysis. These gas composition(s) were then
      metered into sealed package at a rate of 2.112 L/min using a flow
      meter (Model 2260, Gilmont Instruments, Inc., Barrington, Ill.,
      USA) yielding final fill volume of 1.76 L with average fill time
      of 50 s. The gas compositions were verified using an oxygen
      analyzer to verify oxygen concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Treatments were carried out utilizing PK-2 system. The
      electrodes were made from coils of wire wound around a planar
      dielectric form with a treatment area of 86.25 cm&lt;2 &gt;(7.5
      cm×11.5 cm), and spaced apart by the treatment distance: in this
      case 2.5 cm or 4.5 cm. The storage bags containing spore samples
      were filled with the working gas and purged three times to ensure
      purity of the gas in the bag.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The temperature of the electrodes was measured prior to and
      immediately after treatment using an infrared thermometer (Omega
      Engineering, Inc., Stamford, Conn., USA). The electrodes were
      allowed to cool to reach room temperature (23-25° C.) between
      treatments for uniform treatment temperature conditions. Relative
      humidity and temperatures inside the storage bags were measured
      using a Springfield® Precise Temp™ relative humidity sensor
      (Taylor Precision Products, Oak Brook, Ill., USA) recorded at 0 h
      and 24 h storage. Relative humidity varied daily and ranged from
      20-50% for all samples tested. Ozone and nitric oxide
      concentrations were measured immediately following the treatment
      and after 24 h storage using the techniques previously described.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Bacillus subtilis var. niger (B. atrophaeus) spore strips
      (NAMSA, Northwood, Ohio, USA) with size of 3.2 cm×0.6 cm, each
      containing Bacillus populations of 1.5-2.5×10&lt;6 &gt;colony
      forming units per strip were loaded into open sterile petri dish
      inside treatment package and then used in ionization treatments.
      Spore recoveries and aseptic methods were followed per
      manufacturer (NAMSA, Northwood, Ohio, USA) for population
      verification of Bacillus subtilis spore strips as previously
      described<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Gas concentrations and Bacillus subtilis populations were
      analyzed in SAS Version 9.2 (Statistical Analysis Software, Cary,
      N.C.). Mean comparisons were performed using the GLM Procedure and
      the Tukey Multiple Mean Comparison with a p&lt;0.05.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] All of 16 gas blends could be ionized to generate
      measurable levels of ozone, nitric oxides, and carbon monoxide
      under the specified conditions, with the results shown in Table 2.
      In general, greater concentrations of ozone were observed for gas
      blends with higher oxygen content except when Ar or He gas were
      added into gas blends. These noble gases have low ionization
      energy requirements, and, when blended with other gasses reduce
      the minimum ionization voltage gradient required. When a noble gas
      was blended into 22% oxygen gas blends the maximum ozone
      concentration increased. This is shown in the results where gas
      blends #8 and #9 (8% noble gas) achieved 1125 ppm ozone at 15 s
      ionization whereas gas #7 (air—a similar (22%) oxygen composition
      without noble gas) took approximately 30 s. Further, gas #7
      reached a maximum ozone concentration of 2,750 ppm whereas gas
      mixtures #8 and #9 reached a maximum 8,000 ppm.<br>

      [0079] Interestingly, for all gas blends evaluated the maximum
      ozone concentration was achieved for gas blend #12 (65% O2-5%
      N2-30% CO2) which contained no noble gas. It achieved ozone
      concentrations of 15,000 ppm at 150 s and a maximum 18,750 ppm at
      600 s. This concentration of 15,000 ppm at 150 s is 2.5 times
      greater than any other gas blend. When noble gas was blended into
      a 65% O2 gas (#13 and #14) reduced ozone concentrations were
      obtained. It is suspected that the helium ions are preferentially
      ionized creating lower energy electrons which in turn create less
      ozone and nitric oxides. Further, in gases #15 and #16 when the
      oxygen content is increased (80% O2) and noble gas is added the
      ozone concentration again increases to very high levels
      (&gt;10,000 ppm). The details of the plasma dynamics are not yet
      fully understood. However, it is clear that a range of gas and
      voltage parameters has been identified where efficacious results
      are obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Nitric oxide concentrations immediately after treatment are
      shown in Table 3. The maximum nitric oxide concentration of 4,250
      ppm were generated in gas blend #12 at 600 s with a number of
      other gas blends (#9, #11, and #16) having maximum nitric oxide
      concentrations between 1,500 and 2,000 ppm. There were no
      measurable concentrations of ozone or nitric oxide after 24 h.
      Carbon monoxide measurements were only available after 24 h due to
      measurement interference from high concentrations of NOx and O3.
      After 24 h storage, maximum carbon monoxide measurements of 375
      ppm CO were obtained from gas blend #9 at 600 s treatment (Table
      4).<br>

      [0081] Results in phase II showed complete elimination of
      bacterial spores with all treatment parameters for both direct and
      indirect exposure of the sample and are presented in Table 5. The
      time required for complete elimination of the spores (greater than
      6 log reduction) varied with the gas blend. The shortest times for

      <br>
      [0082] Additional reductions in treatment times may likely be
      achieved by further adjustment of processing parameters such as
      electric field voltages, electrode gap, and electrode geometry.
      The results from the studies demonstrate that with in-package
      ionization treatment, whether under direct or indirect exposure,
      bacterial spores can be eliminated from inside packages,
      potentially providing non-thermal sterilization for medical
      products.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Since the voltage gradient of about 12.5 kV/cm represents
      the about lowest value of ionization potential for other than the
      noble gasses, this value represents about a lower bound on the
      voltage gradient that could be effective. However, the relatively
      low rate of production of reactive species at the low voltage is
      reflected in the longer ANEP generation time to achieve an
      effective sporicidal effect. As many production processes place an
      emphasis on throughput, the reduction in processing times that can
      be achieved with higher voltages and voltage gradients may be
      beneficial. The type of MA to be selected may depend on the
      particular object to be processed; and, the sensitivity of the
      object to oxidation may place limits on the percentage composition
      of O2 that is desirable. Carbon dioxide MA packaging gasses may
      preferentially produce CO and this reactant may be effective in
      processing certain food products.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The higher voltages and the longer ANEP column length
      between the electrodes contribute to both higher rates of
      generation and possibly to the generation of other reactants,
      whose effect may be seen in the reduction in processing times.
      Raising the processing voltage so that the voltage gradient is
      about 1.4 times the ionization potential of oxygen has been shown
      to be effective over a wide range of MA gas compositions. The
      combination of increasing the voltage gradient and the length of
      the ANEP plasma column with respect to the volume of the container
      has been shown to be efficacious.<br>

      A system and method for decontamination of product is described.
      An object to be treated, which may be a food product or a medical
      device, is placed in a substantially closed dielectric container
      with a working gas. The container is placed in an apparatus
      capable of producing a controlled electrical discharge so as to
      create reactive ion species within the package. The object to be
      treated may be exposed either the immediate products of the
      electrical discharge or the long lasting reactive ion species, or
      both, so as to treat the object to reduce or eliminate specific
      contaminants, which may be biological pathogens or the cause of
      product spoilage, or inorganic contaminants. The reactive ion
      species may result from an atmospheric non-equilibrium plasma
      (ANEP) formed by the apparatus and the treatment may be performed
      without significantly increasing the bulk temperature of the
      object being treated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present application relates an apparatus and method for
      treating packaged products to reduce undesirable contamination.
      More, specifically a system and method of reducing the level of
      organisms which may be related to deterioration of the product or
      to human pathology is described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Recent trends in dieting and healthy eating have shown a
      high demand for fresh produce. According to USDA Economic Research
      Service statistics, fresh spinach, for example, reached a record
      consumption in 2005 with 738 million pounds in the United States:
      more than 12 times the amount consumed in 1970. Processed spinach
      consumption, conversely, has tended to decline over the last few
      decades. This high demand for fresh, nutritious produce puts
      pressure on producers and processors to ensure that products are
      safe for human consumption, yet continue to retain expected
      nutritious and aesthetic qualities. Minimal processing and
      treatment appears desirable in order to maintain the fresh taste,
      texture, and nutrition of produce. However, many sources of
      contamination exist that can affect produce before, during, and
      after harvesting. Sources of contamination include fecal matter
      from animals, both wild and domestic, contaminated irrigation
      water, flooding of crops, as well as from personnel involved with
      handling of products<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Due to the specific growth conditions of produce,
      particular varieties are not always in season locally, and are
      often shipped from all parts of the nation and world to meet the
      demands of consumers. Many aspects of shipping can cause a
      decrease in the quality of fresh produce. Spoilage could occur
      from, for example, unsanitary transportation vehicles, lengthy
      shipping schedules, and improper storage temperatures and
      ventilation of storage areas. Conventional methods of sanitizing
      fresh produce involve various washing procedures. More efficient
      processing methods are needed to reduce the risk of contaminated
      produce, while still maintaining its fresh qualities.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Atmospheric, non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) is an example of
      a non-thermal processing method. There is a wide variance in the
      terminology for the process to produce such a plasma. In the
      literature, a variety of terminology is used to describe the
      phenomenon including atmospheric glow discharge, surface barrier
      discharge (SBD), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), Single
      Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD) and Surface Plasma Chemistry
      Process (SPCP). For convenience herein, the term dielectric
      barrier discharge (DBD) is used, without intending to exclude any
      of the ANEP plasma generating mechanisms implied by choosing a
      specific terminology for description of the technique herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] FIG. 1 shows simplified examples of DBD configurations that
      may be used to produce an ANEP in an ambient air environment. A
      high voltage generator 10 applies an alternating current potential
      to a pair of metallic plates 20, 30, spaced apart from each other
      to form a region 50 in which an object may be placed. At least one
      dielectric layer 40 is disposed between a first plate 20 and the
      second plate 30. In this manner, the effect of the dielectric
      layer is to limit the current of any filamentary discharge that is
      formed between the plate 20, 30 so as to prevent the formation of
      a high current arc. The discharge in region 50 is thus limited in
      energy and results in an ANEP where variety of reactive species
      may be formed from the O2, N2 and possibly water vapor. FIG. 1A
      shows a configuration with one dielectric layer 40 laid against an
      electrode 20. FIG. 1B shows an example where a dielectric plate 40
      is laid against an electrode 20 and another dielectric plate 60 is
      laid against a second electrode 30. The charge accumulation on the
      plates, which may be used in conjunction with the voltage
      waveform, to estimate the power consumption, may be measured by
      determining the voltage developed across a conventional capacitor
      75. FIG. 1C illustrates a situation where a single dielectric
      layer 50 is disposed between the electrodes 20, 30, so that two
      regions 50 are formed in which an ANEP may be formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] As the possibility of an arc forming directly between the
      plates 20, 30 exists, by air paths around the dielectric, at least
      one electrode is often fully enclosed in an insulating material,
      and the exposed electrode may be grounded. The insulating material
      may be the same material as used for the dielectric 40, 60 however
      the two materials may have differing properties. For example, the
      dielectric plate may be quartz, and the insulating material may be
      a moldable material.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The food industry is always seeking a better method for
      maintaining food safety and ozone treatment may be an effective
      possibility due to its antimicrobial properties and lack of
      residual substances. However, ensuring minimal to no exposure of
      employees to ozone is a concern. Similar considerations would
      apply to the medical field, where sterilizing packaged objects and
      maintaining sterile conditions is important.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] A system and method are described where reactive species
      may be produced by an atmospheric non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) in
      a closed package containing an object to be decontaminated, so as
      to suppress or eliminate contaminants. The reactive species may be
      of a short lifetime so as to perform the treatment during a period
      of time during and shortly after a discharge creating the plasma.
      Longer lifetime species may remain so as to perform, or to
      continue to perform, the treatment for an extended period of time.
      Eventually, the reactive species may be eliminated from the
      treatment volume by reacting with the contents of the package, the
      package, or with each other. As the reactive species may be
      contained within the package, exposure of personnel to such
      reactive species may be minimized.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The package may form a storage space for a product, which
      may be, for example, a food product, or a medical device, which
      may remain inside the package during and after treatment. The
      package may also contain a working gas fill, which may be air, or
      a mixture of gases, which may include noble gases. An atmospheric
      non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) is produced within the package by a
      voltage gradient applied from outside the package. By selecting
      the working gas mixture, the duration of the ANEP creation, and
      the duration of the treatment, the treated product may have
      reduced contamination, or be sterilized, depending on the specific
      application. The working gas mixture, the equipment geometry and
      the operation voltage are selected so that the electrodes may be
      situated in the ambient manufacturing environment and produce
      reactive species within the package, while avoiding or minimizing
      the production of such species outside of the package.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A system for treating a product is described that uses an
      apparatus configured to create a reactive species in a part of a
      package or storage volume sized and dimensioned to contain an
      object to be treated. The object to be treated is stored within
      the storage volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In an aspect, a system for treating a product is described,
      having an apparatus configured to create a atmospheric
      non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) in a working gas in a storage volume
      sized, and dimensioned to contain an object to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The working gas includes a noble gas in a percentage
      sufficient to reduce a voltage gradient needed to create the ANEP.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In another aspect, a method of decontaminating an object
      includes the steps of providing a dielectric barrier discharge
      (DBD) device; providing a container suitable for substantially
      completely enclosing the object and a working gas; inserting the
      object into the container; disposing at least a portion of the
      container such that reactive species may be produced in the
      container by the DPD apparatus; and activating the DBD device.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] Exemplary embodiments may be better understood with
      reference to the drawings, but these examples are not intended to
      be of a limiting nature. Like numbered or labeled elements in the
      same or different drawings perform equivalent functions. When a
      specific feature, structure, or characteristic is described in
      connection with an example, it will be understood that one skilled
      in the art may effect such feature, structure, or characteristic
      in connection with other examples, whether or not explicitly
      stated herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It will of course be appreciated that in the development of
      any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific
      decisions must be made to achieve specific development goals, such
      as compliance with system and business related constraints, and
      that these goals will vary from one implementation to another.
      Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort
      might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a
      routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in
      the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Atmospheric pressure “cold” plasmas have been shown to be
      effective in reducing or eliminating surface bacterial
      contamination of food samples. The term “cold plasma” is meant to
      describe a plasma discharge, which may be a non-equilibrium
      plasma, occurring at a pressure of about one-atmosphere and at
      near ambient temperature (ANEP). This is to distinguish the ANEP
      plasma from a thermal plasma discharge operating at a bulk gas
      temperature of hundreds or thousands of degrees above the ambient
      temperature. In an atmospheric pressure “cold plasma” the
      electrons may have a significantly higher temperature than the ion
      and neutral species; however, the bulk temperature of the working
      gas is not significantly raised. In this context, however, the
      term “cold” should not be interpreted to require refrigeration or
      other cooling to perform the decontamination or treatment
      functions described herein; however, this does not exclude the
      treating or the subsequent storage of the treated object at an
      appropriate temperature, which may include refrigeration or
      cooling. Keeping the gas at a near-ambient temperature may
      contribute to avoidance of heat damage to the sample being
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] One technique of creating a non-equilibrium plasma is to
      apply a high voltage to the volume to be ionized, while inhibiting
      the transition from a glow discharge to an arc discharge by
      limiting the discharge current. This may be done, for example, by
      covering at least one of the electrodes of the apparatus with a
      dielectric layer; resistive layers have also been used. The
      discharge current is self-limited by charge build up on the
      dielectric surface. Typically, the excitation voltage frequency is
      in the kHz range, but may range from power line frequencies to
      radio frequencies. The experimental data presented herein used a
      60 Hz frequency due to the availability of high voltage
      transformers, whose voltage could be easily be adjusted by
      controlling the input voltage thereof with a variable voltage
      transformer.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Dielectric-barrier discharges (DBD) are a type of
      alternating-current high-voltage gaseous discharges that may be
      formed in a nominally atmospheric pressure environment. The
      presence of a dielectric layer between the electrodes prevents the
      charges generated in the gas by the discharge from reaching at
      least one of the conducting electrode surfaces. Often the
      dielectric layer is applied to both of the electrodes. Within each
      half-cycle of the driving voltage waveform, when the voltage
      gradient applied across the gas exceeds that required for
      breakdown, the formation of narrow ionized discharge filaments
      initiates the conduction of electrons toward the more positive
      electrode, and ions towards the more negative electrode, although
      the mobility of the electrons is greater. Electrical charge
      accumulates on the dielectric layer(s) at the end(s) of each
      ionized filament, and the voltage drop across the ionized filament
      reduces until the voltage falls below the discharge-sustaining
      level, so that the discharge is extinguished. The duration of the
      filamentary discharge is believed to be quite short: of the order
      of 100 nanoseconds or less. However, the resultant reactive
      species may have a significantly longer lifetime. The low charge
      mobility along the surface of the dielectric also limits the
      lateral region over which the gap voltage is diminished, so that a
      plurality of filaments may form in close proximity to one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Production of ozone in a DBD occurs between the two
      electrodes when operated at a particular voltage, frequency, and
      geometry. In air, mixtures of O2 and N2, or O2 alone, reactive
      oxygen species are generated which react with each other as well
      as oxygen molecules resulting in the formation of ozone. Other
      reactive species are created when N2, or other gases such as CO2,
      H2O or Cl are present. The most oxidative species in air and
      oxygen gas include ozone (O3), singlet oxygen (O or O&lt;−&gt;),
      superoxide (O2&lt;−&gt;), peroxide (O2&lt;−2 &gt;or H2O2), and
      hydroxyl radicals (OH). Most of these species have very short
      half-lives (in the range of milliseconds); however, ozone has a
      much longer half-life ranging from minutes to days depending on
      conditions. The effects of gaseous ozone on foods has previously
      been studied with promising results and ozone has been shown to be
      more efficient at lower concentrations and treatment times than
      more standard sanitizers, including chlorine. The use of ozone has
      been limited to the treatment of unpackaged products.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Plasma-generated species may be capable of reacting readily
      with various materials and organisms. Oxygen- and nitrogen-based
      reactive species are effective in the inactivation of
      microorganisms and may include ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO).
      For example, E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce was shown to be reduced by
      1.79 log10 (CFU/g) (colony-forming units per gram) after 15 min of
      treatment with gaseous ozone. Similar reductions of E. coli
      O157:H17 and Salmonella enterica inoculated on blueberries have
      been reported. A number of researchers were able to inactivate
      various food-borne pathogens in unpackaged samples using assorted
      plasma systems with treatment times ranging from seconds to
      minutes on fresh produce surfaces including apples, cantaloupes,
      and lettuce. After production thereof, reaction products of an
      ANEP may have the ability to decompose or recombine, leaving no
      residual chemicals or reactive species.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Many examples of the creation of such plasmas are in
      flowing gases or in the ambient environment. However, such plasmas
      quickly dissipate or are transported away from the sample to be
      treated by air currents or pressure differentials. Here, an
      apparatus and method for localizing the ionized and other reactive
      species that are created is described, so that the treatment time
      may be extended and the ionized and other reactive species
      confined to the neighborhood of the object being treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In particular, the object to be treated may be enclosed in
      a sealed or substantially sealed container. The container need not
      be hermetic unless the level of decontamination desired is such
      that subsequent contamination from another source is to be
      avoided. Non-hermetic containers may be used in applications where
      subsequent re-contamination of the sample is prevented by the
      characteristics of the packaging. Non-hermetic containers may be
      permeable to some extent to air, and to the other constituent
      gases or the radicals or reactive species produced in the ANEP.
      That is, the packaging may be porous to gases, but prevent
      spoilage or pathogentic material from entering the package. The
      composition of the container may be a plastic such as TYGON,
      low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE),
      polyethylene terapthalate (PET), or polystyrene; however, various
      other substantially dielectric materials can be used, including,
      glass, wax, cardboard, paper, foil, eggshells, low dielectric
      constant materials, or the like. The foil may be a plastic having
      a thin metallic coating. This may permit the treatment of objects
      stored in a foil package, or having a foil liner.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The system and method described herein may achieve at least
      1-3 log10 reductions of spoilage organisms and greater than 5
      log10 reductions (total kill for oxygen working gas at room
      temperature and refrigeration after 24 hr storage) of E. coli
      O157:H7 in fresh produce with minimal quality changes in seconds
      to minutes of active treatment. The amount of contaminant
      reduction needed depends on the specific product to be treated,
      the subsequent storage conditions, storage time and similar
      considerations, which will often be governed by economic and
      regulatory factors. While the studies described herein are related
      to bacteria, similar effects should be experienced for fungi and
      virus contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] An apparatus for treating a sample is shown in FIG. 2. An
      object to be treated 200 is placed in a substantially closed
      dielectric container 100. The container may be rigid or flexible
      and may be sealed by a ZIPLOC closure, by heat, by a close-fitting
      cap, or any other mechanism that has a similar effect. The
      container should have an ability to substantially retain the
      reactive species that are the residual of the generated ANEP
      plasma for a period of time that is sufficient for a particular
      treatment process. The working gas, which may be air, or a
      modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) mixture, may be introduced
      into the container 100 prior to treatment. The container 100 may
      be purged prior to charging with the working gas so as to control
      the resulting gas mixture. The container may be sealed either
      permanently or temporarily prior to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] A region within the container is selected where an ANEP may
      be generated. This may be a specific formed region of a semi-rigid
      or rigid container, or may be formed by manipulation of a flexible
      container where the gas pressure gives the container a deformable
      shape. In rigid containers, the gas pressure may be less than an
      atmosphere, while the gas pressure in a flexible container is an
      atmosphere or greater. This does not exclude situations, for
      example, where vacuum packing is used, and a working gas may be
      introduced for the purposes of the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 2A illustrates a situation where the object being
      treated is disposed between the plates of the apparatus, while
      FIG. 2B illustrates the situation where the object being treated
      is disposed so that a small thickness of the storage bag having a
      gap between the opposing surfaces is disposed between the plates
      of the apparatus. For the situation of FIG. 2B, the ANEP is
      created inside a portion of the storage container; however, the
      object to be treated may not be directly exposed to the active
      ANEP. Rather, the residual reactive species may be diffused or
      circulated to the volume of container having the object to be
      treated. This configuration reduces the voltage needed to
      establish the ANEP as the distance between the electrodes has been
      reduced compared with the thickness of the object. In addition,
      where the termination of the plasma filaments on the object itself
      may be undesirable, that situation is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In contrast, the arrangement of FIG. 2A disposes the object
      to be treated between the electrodes, and the object itself may
      behave as a dielectric, similar to that used on one or more of the
      electrodes. In this circumstance, the filaments creating the ANEP
      may extend from the electrode or the dielectric barrier on an
      electrode, or an electrode without a dielectric barrier, to a
      surface of the object to be treated, and an active ANEP may also
      surround the object. The electrons and the ions created in the
      ANEP may directly impinge on the surface of the object. Similarly
      to the arrangement of FIG. 2B, the object may continue to be
      exposed to the ANEP byproducts after the active phase of ANEP
      generation has been completed. Each of the processes may be
      repeated, if needed, where the object or the storage bag is
      manipulated to better distribute the active byproducts or expose
      other portions of the object to the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As shown in FIG. 2A, the container 100 having a working gas
      300 and an object to be treated 200 may be disposed between the
      plates of a DBD apparatus 2. The plates 20, 30 are spaced apart so
      as to admit at least portion of the container 100 containing the
      object to be treated 200. The distance between the plates may be
      controlled by mechanical means so that the container 100 may
      conveniently be placed between the plates 20, 30, and the spacing
      between the plates subsequently adjusted so as to partially
      compress the container 100, so as to achieve an appropriate gap
      spacing for the creation of the ANEP within the container 100. In
      this configuration, filamentary discharges may occur between the
      dielectric surface 40 of the top plate 20 and the opposing surface
      of the object 200 being treated, and may also occur between the
      bottom plate 30 and the object being treated 200. The ANEP may
      also be created by electrical currents flowing directly from one
      plate to another, as mediated by the dielectric layer on the
      plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Where the object to be treated has the general
      characteristics of a dielectric material, the filaments will have
      a behavior similar to that which would occur in a DBD apparatus
      without an introduced object, except that the filaments may
      terminate one end thereof on the object. So, the object will be
      directly exposed to the filamentary discharges creating the ANEP,
      as well as to the shorter lasting and longer lasting reactive
      species that are created during the active treatment phase. As the
      surface density of filaments is governed by the electrical field
      distribution, and the shape and electrical properties of the
      object to be treated, the entire surface of the object may not be
      subject to the same intensity of direct treatment. Should more
      uniform treatment be desired, the object to be treated 200 may be
      manipulated to expose other parts of the object to direct
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The high voltage is often sinusoidal and may be produced by
      a high-voltage transformer connected to the power grid, a signal
      generator connected to an amplifier, or the like. For the
      experiments described herein, a maximum voltage of about 18 KV
      (RMS) was used, however informal experiments are being performed
      using a higher voltage of about 75 KV, with an objective on
      exploring the range up to about 120 KV. In experiments performed
      at about 65 KV, with the same gap as used at lower voltages, the
      rate generation of reactive species appears to substantially
      faster, with about the same concentration of reactive being
      achieved after 15 seconds as was observed after 5 minutes at about
      15 KV.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Other voltage waveform shapes may be used, including
      sawtooth, trapezoidal, or pulsed, and the voltage waveform may be
      symmetrical, asymmetrical, or displaced from DC. The amplitude of
      the voltage may be controlled during operation of the apparatus
      by, for example a VARIAC transformer, or by controlling the signal
      generator amplitude output, or the amplifier gain. The frequency
      of operation may be fixed or variable. ANEP plasmas have been
      created using frequencies ranging from DC (where a resistive layer
      is used a current limiter or ballast) to radio frequencies (RF).
      In the experiments described herein, the local power line
      frequency (60 Hz) was used for convenience in configuring the
      experimental apparatus and cost considerations.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The voltage gradient at which a glow discharge is formed is
      a function of the constitutive gases present between the
      electrodes, various geometrical considerations, and the gas
      pressure. For most of the experimental data presented herein, a
      simple ambient air mixture or pure oxygen was used. For purposes
      of visualization of the filamentary discharges, pure helium (He)
      was sometimes used due to the substantially lower ionization
      potential and to produce a clearly visible glow in the ionized
      region and on the dielectric surfaces. The constituent gases may
      be modified so as to achieve a desired concentration and species
      of ionized particles. In addition to air, O2, N2, CO2, H2O, Cl,
      and other mixtures, or pure gases, including inert and noble
      gases, are usable, depending on the application.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] As shown in FIG. 2B when a flexible container 100, which
      may be a plastic storage bag, is used, the internal gas pressure
      may selected so a that a portion of the container may be
      compressed between the plates 20, 30 so as to form a smaller gap
      to facilitate creation of the ANEP at a lower voltage. Here, the
      container is shown in a state where a portion 110 of the container
      100 is positioned between the electrodes of the DBD apparatus 3,
      so that a portion of the container 100 may be temporarily formed
      into a region where the ANEP may be created. The filaments
      creating the ANEP are formed between the surface of the dielectric
      40 and the other electrode plate 30, such that there the object
      200 to be treated is not disposed therebetween. In this manner,
      larger objects may be treated without having to use very high
      voltages. Portions of the container surface disposed so as to form
      the region in which the ANEP is to be formed are held against the
      dielectric 40 and the plate 30 by the internal gas pressure. The
      effect of the dielectric layer of the container surface may be
      small, as the charge distributions are likely to be dominated by
      those of the electrodes and the dielectric 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 2C shows a top view of the DBD apparatus 3 of FIG. 2B.
      The dielectric material extends so as to inhibit stray discharges,
      and the electrodes are disposed opposite only a portion of the
      storage volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The electrodes may be planar, as shown; however, other
      geometries may be used to conform to a container such as a box,
      pill bottle, jar, or other shape. Shaped electrodes may be used to
      encourage the formation of a plasma jet, or better distribute the
      reaction products using induced convection. For example, large
      cardboard containers may be processed by using a pair of
      electrodes oriented at a 90° angle and placed along one or more of
      the edges. Similar configuration may be used for large packages of
      other materials and shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The effects of ANEP treatment of packaged produce was
      studied using, fresh, bagged spinach and chicken. Spinach was
      chosen due to its popularity as a fresh health food, yet subject
      to recent outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 found on packaged spinach
      leaves. Leaves of packaged spinach were treated in plastic food
      storage bags containing one of two different gases and stored at
      two different temperatures. The effectiveness of in-package ANEP
      treatment in suppressing spoilage organisms and E. coli O157:H7
      was tested, as well as the effects of treatment and storage on
      quality of spinach leaves.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The spinach used in the experiments was obtained from a
      local supermarket in West Lafayette, Ind. The spinach had been cut
      and bagged, and was stored under refrigeration in the supermarket.
      The same brand of spinach was used for each test (Dole Food Co.,
      Thousand Oaks, Calif.). Full-sized spinach leaves were used for
      spoilage organism tests while baby spinach leaves were used for E.
      coli O157:H7 tests. The average surface area of leaves used for
      spoilage organism tests was 56.2 cm2. The average weight of leaves
      used for E. coli O157:H7 tests was 0.570 g. All bags were stored
      at 5° C. after purchase and were used in the experiment prior to
      the expiration date listed on the outside of the bag. An unopened
      bag of spinach was used as the source of spinach leaves for each
      test.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Prior to treatment, spinach leaves of visually similar
      surface area were selected from the bag. Leaves were weighed and
      placed on aseptic wax paper and an outline tracing made for
      subsequent determination of leaf surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Clear, 3.78 L storage bags were obtained from a local
      grocery store in West Lafayette, Ind. Two different brands were
      used throughout the course of the spinach experiment: Great Value
      Food Storage Bags (Great Value, Walmart, Bentonville, Ark.) and
      Glad Food Storage Bags (The Glad Products Company, Oakland,
      Calif.). The bags are believed to be fabricated from low-density
      polyethylene (LDPE) and were 1.6-mm thick. It is known that
      storage of spinach leaves in a controlled atmosphere (CA) of 7-10%
      O2 and 5-10% CO2 delays discoloration; however, plastic films used
      for commercial packaging are usually chosen to maintain an
      environment of 1-3% O2 and 8-10% CO2. Retail zip-top bags were
      chosen as the dielectric material for the ozone treatment
      experiments of spinach, as only one of two gases would be used in
      each bag for this study: either air or oxygen. The retail bags
      were low cost, easy-to use, and were sufficient for
      proof-of-concept of an in-package treatment. Other bag
      technologies and materials may be used, depending on costs,
      storage duration, storage conditions, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The values of leaf surface area were then used to determine
      the CFU/cm&lt;2 &gt;of each leaf. The average population of
      spoilage organisms on the spinach leaves prior to treatment was
      3.19 log10 (CFU/cm&lt;2&gt;). After tracing, leaves were placed on
      aseptic stands that were designed to allow plasma exposure on both
      sides of the leaves during treatment and storage. The stands were
      then placed inside individual sterile, re-sealable, polyethylene
      bags, each bag containing a single spinach leaf.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A single strain of E. coli O157:H7 (6460) was used for the
      evaluation of the ANEP treatments. The strain was obtained from
      Dr. R. H. Linton of the Food Science Department at Purdue
      University, West Lafayette, Ind. Cultures of the bacteria were
      grown in trypticase soy broth (TSB) and placed in a shaking
      incubator for 18 h at 37° C. Spinach leaves were weighed and
      placed in sterile petri dishes prior to inoculation. Each spinach
      sample was spot inoculated (8-10 spots) with 100 μL of the E. coli
      culture and placed in a biosafety hood for 1 h to allow for
      bacterial attachment. The average population of control samples
      was 5.40 log10 (CFU/mL).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The oxygen content in each bag was measured before
      treatment and after storage using a gas analyzer (MOCON, Inc.,
      Minneapolis, Minn.). The analyzer had a syringe connected to a
      tube which fed to the analyzer. The syringe tip was placed inside
      the bag through the re-sealable opening (bags were not punctured)
      to measure the gas inside. Two readings were taken during each
      measurement to ensure values were accurate.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The temperature of the surfaces of the leaves and the
      electrodes was measured and recorded just prior to, and just
      after, treatment with an infrared thermometer (Omega Engineering,
      Inc., Stamford, Conn.).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The relative humidity inside storage bags containing a
      single spinach leaf was measured. A single, un-inoculated spinach
      leaf and a relative humidity sensor (Thermo-Hygro Control Co.,
      Friendswood, Tex.) were placed inside the storage bag. The bag was
      then filled with either air or oxygen gas as before. The relative
      humidity was recorded before and after the 5 min treatment or
      storage. Relative humidity tests were replicated 10 times for air
      and oxygen and treated and untreated samples.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The treatment system used operated at a frequency of 60 Hz
      generating about 12 kV of potential between the electrodes, and
      the power consumption was 40 W. The voltages for all experiments
      were measured with a conventional voltmeter, yielding RMS voltage
      values. The electrodes were made of coils of insulated wire wound
      around a planar dielectric form with a treatment area of about 51
      cm&lt;2 &gt;(8.5 cm by 6 cm). Treatment of all samples occurred at
      ambient laboratory temperature (nominally 22° C.).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Bags containing the samples were filled with the working
      gas (air or oxygen for this example) and purged three times to
      ensure purity of the gas in the bag, which was verified with the
      gas analyzer. A small amount of gas was expelled from the bag to
      allow for orientation of plasma electrodes. The electrodes were
      placed above and below the bag, oriented on top of each other. The
      bag in between the electrodes had an approximate gap distance of
      3-3.5 mm, which permitted formation of an ANEP with the available
      voltage. The system was then activated for a 5-min active
      treatment period.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The gas in the bag was agitated manually, once during each
      minute of treatment, for about 10-15 s, to allow for a more
      uniform distribution of gas inside the bag. This was done by
      pressing lightly back-and-forth on the bag so as minimize the
      change in the alignment of the electrodes or disturb the sample.
      The bag was then placed in a stable location at either room
      temperature (22° C.) or refrigeration (5° C.) for a predetermined
      storage period (0.5, 2, or 24 h).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] After storage for the specified time, the ozone and/or
      nitrous oxide content was measured by means of DRAEGER Short-Term
      Detector tubes (Draeger Safety AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Luebeck,
      Germany). Tubes (specific to measuring ozone) of two different
      scales were used to measure ozone concentration, 0.05-0.7 ppm and
      20-300 ppm ozone for volumes of 100 mL. One type of tube (specific
      for measuring nitrous oxides) was used for determining nitrous
      oxide concentration. This tube had two scales depending on the
      volume drawn through the tube. Scales ranged between 2-50 ppm and
      5-100 ppm for volumes of 500 mL and 1000 mL. In order to determine
      concentration values when measuring very high concentrations of
      species, the tubes were connected to syringes by means of flexible
      tubing. Volumes of gas were drawn through tubes and estimates of
      actual concentrations were determined by comparing the ratio of
      values of measured concentration and volume to actual
      concentration and volume, and solving for the actual
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Measurement of these gases gave approximate concentrations.
      The detector tubes had accuracies off 10% to +15%. Also, the
      nitrous oxide tubes had cross sensitivities with ozone making for
      less accurate results for the nitrous oxide concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Following storage, the leaves were aseptically removed from
      bags and placed in 100 mL of 0.1% peptone water. Leaves were
      stomached for 2 min on high to remove microbes from the leaf
      surface. Serial dilutions were then performed using standard
      procedures for microbial recovery and 0.1 mL samples were
      surface-plated on plate count agar (PCA) for spoilage organisms,
      and Sorbitol-MacConkey Agar with Cefixime-Tellurite (CTSMAC) for
      E. coli O157:H7. All samples were incubated at 37° C. for 24 h.
      Survivors were counted after incubation and recorded as log10
      (CFU/cm&lt;2&gt;) for spoilage organisms and log 10 (CFU/mL) for
      E. coli O157:H7.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Microorganism reductions observed for all treatments are
      listed in Table 1. The results from the treatment of spoilage
      organisms showed multiple log 10 reductions in populations for
      most treatments, with the exception of the samples treated in
      air-based ANEP and stored for 24 h at room temperature (22° C.).
      In this case, after 24 h of storage the level of spoilage
      organisms actually increased by 0.77 log10 (CFU/cm&lt;2&gt;) when
      compared with the initial population of spoilage organisms on
      control samples. The increase in population of this sample after
      storage is believed to be due to organisms which survived
      treatment and the effects of remaining ANEP species, e.g., the
      ozone and nitrous oxides, during storage and subsequently grew at
      room temperature. This may suggest that the air ANEP treatment
      prior to refrigeration of samples would need adjustment of the
      treatment conditions from those used in the experiment as any
      surviving spoilage organisms could potentially increase in
      population between treatment and refrigeration. However, samples
      treated with air and oxygen ANEP and stored under refrigerated
      conditions showed multiple log10 reductions (2.47 and 3.55 log10
      for air and oxygen ANEP, respectively) as indicated in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Oxygen ANEP showed increased effectiveness at reducing
      spoilage organisms when compared with ANEP generated with air. The
      increased bactericidal effect from oxygen ANEP is believed to be
      caused by the increased levels of ozone generated. So, a longer
      treatment time in air or a more intense phase of ozone generation
      may be indicated for treatment of spoilage microorganisms. The
      bactericidal effects at these levels for the other treatment cases
      could increase shelf-life of produce if the produce was
      refrigerated immediately after treatment, allowing for fresh
      products to be shipped further and potentially last longer in the
      homes of consumers.<br>

      <br>
      [0060] All of the treated leaf samples inoculated with E. coli
      O157:H7 showed reductions in populations following storage. The
      reductions of E. coli O157:H7 treated in both air and oxygen ANEP
      increased as storage time increased. This may suggest the
      long-acting effect of the confined reactive products. Multiple
      storage times (0.5, 2, and 24 h) were used to obtain data to
      ascertain when a total kill of the pathogen occurred. As evidenced
      in Table 1, multiple log10 reductions were indicated after 2 h
      storages for all samples. Samples treated with ANEP containing
      oxygen as the gas present, and stored for 24 h, showed no
      surviving E. coli O157:H7 organisms. Further testing is being
      performed for 24 h room temperature storage data for samples
      treated with air ANEP.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Samples treated with oxygen as the gas for ANEP generation
      showed increased log 10 reductions for most samples when compared
      with samples treated in air, with the exception of samples stored
      at room temperature with oxygen ANEP (0.34 log 10 reduction).
      Again, the increased effectiveness of ANEP generated in oxygen gas
      fill is believed to be due to the increased concentration of ozone
      produced during treatment. This data suggests that produce
      potentially contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 could effectively
      treated to eliminate the pathogen before the produce arrives at
      the grocery store or market.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] All the leaves were at room temperature just before
      treatment (between 21° C. and 22° C.). The sample temperatures did
      increase slightly after treatment however this increase was, on
      average, in the range of 0.1° C.-0.2° C. This data suggests that
      the treatment was effectively non-thermal and that the reductions
      in CFU were due to generated plasma species and the storage
      temperatures (room temperature and refrigeration). The average
      temperature of the ANEP electrodes before and after 5 min of
      treatment was 27.0° C. and 50.3° C., respectively. This is an
      average increase of approximately 23° C. for the electrodes. The
      heating of the electrodes may be reduced by cooling and other
      design measures in an industrial application.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The measured species generated in air-based ANEP include
      ozone and nitrous oxides, while only ozone was measured for
      oxygen-based ANEP. Ozone and nitrous oxides were the two most
      readily measurable species produced during ANEP treatment. A 5 min
      treatment with the ANEP system produced very high levels of both
      species, particularly ozone. Oxygen-based ANEP produced an average
      of 1730 ppm ozone and air-based ANEP produced averages of 650 ppm
      and 460 ppm for ozone and nitrous oxides, respectively,
      immediately after treatment. These species decreased in
      concentration during the storage period, eventually reaching an
      undetectable or zero level, leaving no residual species after 24 h
      of storage, as indicated in Table 1. The data obtained indicates
      that oxygen ANEP produces, on average, substantially higher
      concentrations of ozone than air ANEP. This is apparently due to
      the initial concentration of oxygen in the base gas, oxygen gas
      being 100% oxygen and air containing only 21% oxygen. Despite the
      wide range of results with the current measurement method, it is
      still evident from the resulting reductions of spoilage organisms
      and E. coli O157:H7 as well as the discoloration of leaves, that
      the pure oxygen ANEP system consistently produces high levels of
      oxidative reactive species.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] All of the test conditions showed no detectable ozone after
      24 h of storage, suggesting that measurable ozone had either
      decayed to a neutral gas, or had reacted with the test samples
      inside the package, with the package itself, or had diffused
      through the package material. The rate of decay of ozone for each
      set of temperature and gas type conditions was calculated by
      plotting ozone concentrations at storage times of 0, 0.5, and 2 h
      and fitting an exponential curve to the data points. Half-lives
      were calculated from the resulting fitted exponential equation.
      Calculated half-lives for ozone generated in oxygen and stored at
      room temperature and refrigeration were 78 and 87 min,
      respectively. Half-lives for ozone generated in air and stored at
      room temperature and refrigeration were 160 and 99 min,
      respectively. When measured ozone levels were compared between
      temperatures for each gas there was no significant difference
      (P&lt;0.05) between refrigerated and room temperature
      concentrations at each storage period suggesting that the
      calculated half-lives may not significantly different.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] A follow-up study was conducted to assess the affect of
      water presence on half-lives of ozone in the plastic bags utilized
      for treatments. Bags were filled with air or oxygen only or air or
      oxygen and 1 g of liquid water. Samples were actively treated for
      5 min with the experimental system and stored for 0, 2, 4, and 24
      h at room temperature (RT) (22° C.) and refrigeration (5° C.).
      Ozone concentrations were measured and half-lives were calculated
      as before. The half-lives of ozone were longer in all refrigerated
      samples when compared with samples stored at room temperature. The
      presence of nitrogen in air during the generation of ozone may
      also produce reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as NO. These RNS
      species could cause different reaction pathways between the E.
      coli O157:H7, the spinach leaves, and the package, than the
      reaction pathways in pure oxygen, under the same conditions, and
      during the storage period.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The color of spinach leaves was assessed visually after
      treatment/storage. A rank number was assigned to each leaf
      evaluated indicating the relative percentage of leaf area that had
      been discolored after storage. The scale used ranged from 1-5,
      with 5 being the best quality (no discoloration) and 1 being the
      worst (entire leaf was discolored). The experimentally determined
      values were averaged and are presented in Table 2.<br>

      <br>
      [0067] Control samples were of a crisp texture and medium to dark
      green color, with few to no blemishes or tears in the leaf prior
      to treatment. All of the samples were initially judged to have a
      rating of 5. After drying samples for 1 h in the biosafety hood,
      leaves were somewhat less crisp due to moisture loss; however, the
      color did not degrade during drying. Treated samples showed
      increased wilting and discoloration after storage. Discoloration
      and wilting increased with longer storage times. Samples treated
      with air ANEP changed from the initial solid green color to having
      spots of yellowish-brown discoloration after 0.5 h of storage.
      Samples treated with oxygen ANEP changed from solid green to
      having solid white spots after 0.5 h of storage. Discoloration
      usually occurred at the stem and outer edges of the leaf. Leaves
      treated with oxygen ANEP seemed to maintain their original green
      color most effectively in the unaffected portions of the leaves.
      Leaves treated with air ANEP tended to degrade in color over the
      entire area of the leaf. Occasionally, samples stored for 0.5 hr
      showed no discoloration; however, all samples recovered after 0.5
      h of storage had high levels of E. coli O157:H7 still surviving on
      the leaf. Refrigerated samples tended to show a greater crispness
      than samples stored at room temperature. This observation suggests
      that spinach leaves should be placed in a refrigerated environment
      as soon as possible after harvest in order to lessen quality
      degradation when treated with ANEP. Tests are still underway to
      assess physical quality changes in the leaves. Particularly, tests
      need to be conducted to determine the color change of untreated
      leaves after similar storage periods.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The treatment method utilized in this study of spinach was
      a scenario in which maximum concentrations of ozone and nitrous
      oxides could be produced without causing further heating of
      electrodes. While this method shows effective reductions of
      spoilage organisms and pathogens, changes in the protocol may need
      to be made in order to maintain quality of leaves, or any other
      produce, while still reducing microorganisms to safe levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The results of this experimental study suggest that an ANEP
      treatment system may be capable of reducing spoilage organisms and
      pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7, on prepackaged, ready-to-eat
      spinach leaves. This means that spinach leaves, or nearly any
      produce, can be packaged prior to treatment, avoiding the
      possibility of cross-contamination. The packaged produce could be
      treated with ANEP at the packaging facility and then shipped to
      market. During shipment, spoilage organisms would be reduced and
      pathogens would be eliminated, with no residual chemicals or
      gases. Products would arrive at the grocery store safer and
      fresher.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In contrast to free-air or moving air techniques, a
      substantial fraction of the reactive species produced in the ANEP
      may be caused to be formed and retained within the sample
      container. Apart from being an efficient use of the power devoted
      to ionization, the reactive species formed within the container
      remain within the container until they become neutralized by
      natural chemical processes. As such, the reactive species created
      may be expected to remain in proximity to the object to be treated
      for a longer period of time than when the object has not been
      packaged. Personnel are not exposed to the ANEP products directly.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Informal experiments were performed using lettuce, tomato,
      apple, both whole and sliced, cranberries, bologna slices, skin,
      eggs, both individually and in a carton, plant seeds, and a glass
      pill bottle, with pills inside. All of the test samples were
      placed in a plastic bag of suitable size, similarly to the
      approach used with the spinach samples. The glass pill bottle was
      also treated as the container itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Generally there were two configurations of packaging used.
      For the individual eggs and the apple, as an example, the storage
      bag was placed in the DBD apparatus such that the sample was
      disposed between the electrode plates as shown in FIG. 2A. In
      other examples, the sample was not disposed between the electrode
      plates, so that the electrode plates could be brought physically
      closer together as shown in FIG. 2B. The treatment with the sample
      “in-field” may expose the sample to direct, short term, ionization
      products, whereas treatment with the sample “out-of-field” may
      limit the exposure to longer lifetime ionization products.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] For purposes of visualization of the ANEP created, a helium
      (He) fill was used in some experiments, as the voltage gradient
      needed for He ionization is about one tenth of that needed for air
      or oxygen as working gasses. As the particular experimental
      apparatus was limited to about 18 kV and 60 Hz, the He MAP
      permitted visualization of effects which were likely to be
      obtained in air or O2 mixtures using higher voltages and greater
      electrode spacings than in the spinach experiments described
      previously, and where in-field exposure would occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The ionization characteristics of other noble gases such as
      Ar and Xe is similar to He at near atmospheric pressure. While the
      visualization MAP was a relatively pure noble gas, observations of
      gas mixtures comprising a smaller amount of noble gas and other
      gases such as O2, N2, CO2 and H2O exhibited similarly lowered
      ionization energy requirements. This may arise from the noble gas
      forming a glow discharge and providing seed paths for the
      ionization of some or all of the remaining constituent gases. So,
      either the applied voltage may be decreased, or the DBD gap
      increased. That is, the product of the applied voltage and the gap
      distance needed to create an ANEP would be reduced with respect to
      a MAP that did not use a noble gas as a constituent. Observations
      of an ANEP with He as the MAP were made at 18 KV and a gap of 10
      cm; a similar effect may be expected with a MAP where He is a
      constituent. This means that the object to be treated may be
      placed directly between the electrode plate and the dielectric
      barrier, even in the case of a head of lettuce.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A brief series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the
      required voltage gradient for a working gas having a noble gas as
      a component gas. The same experimental arrangement as for the egg
      example was used, except that there was no object to be treated
      within the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The minimum voltage gradients needed for the creation of an
      ANEP, based on working gas composition, were determined to be:<br>
      <br>
      [0077] 100% He—4.5 kV/in;<br>
      <br>
      [0078] 50% He/50% air—16.8 kV/in;<br>
      <br>
      [0079] 10% He/90% air—24 kV/in; and<br>
      <br>
      [0080] 100% air—43.2 kV/in.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Since the voltage gradient needed to create an ANEP in a
      working gas having a noble gas component is less than the voltage
      gradient needed in air, the ANEP may be created in the storage
      volume without the likelihood of a plasma discharge occurring in
      the region surrounding the storage volume. That is, a direct
      discharge between the plates of the DBD apparatus would require a
      higher voltage than is needed to create the ANEP within the
      storage volume. In addition to increasing the distance between the
      plates that can be used for a fixed apparatus voltage, a noble gas
      component of the working gas would permit the entire storage area
      to be located between the plates of the DBD apparatus and the ANEP
      created inside the entire storage volume not occupied by the
      object without creating ozone in the free air space surrounding
      the package.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Providing that the available voltage is sufficient to
      produce an ANEP plasma within the package, only a small percentage
      of the working gas need be a noble gas such as He, Ar, or Xe, to
      reduce the ionization voltage gradient within the package to less
      than that of the surrounding air. Since a 10% He component of the
      working gas reduced the ionization gradient by almost a factor of
      two, perhaps 5% or less may reduce the relative ionization
      potential within the package with respect to the surrounding
      environment so as to permit the ANEP generation to be confined
      within the package, yet permit the entire package to be subject to
      the dielectric-barrier-discharge effect. The specific percentage
      of noble gas in the working gas mixture will depend on the
      apparatus geometry, the effects of the objects in the storage
      volume, and the other constituent gases. However, the specific
      values can be determined by experimental studies.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Where the breakdown voltage gradients in the storage volume
      and in the surrounding air are essentially the same, the electrode
      area of the DBD is generally selected so as not to be large enough
      to produce an ANEP in the entire storage volume, as there is the
      risk that a more substantial discharge would occur in the air
      environment. Such discharges result in reactive species
      generation, to which personnel would be exposed, and may also
      result in pinholes in the storage volume surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Where food is the object to be treated, the object may be
      considered as a dielectric. Although the dielectric may be
      imperfect, the losses are likely to be small at low frequencies.
      The voltage distribution between the electrodes of the DBD will be
      modified by the presence of the object so that the effective
      voltage gradient in the working gas gap between the dielectric of
      the DBD apparatus and the object is increased. This may further
      decrease the voltage that may need to be applied in order to
      initiate ANEP plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In another aspect, it seems likely that the working voltage
      may be decreased after the ANEP plasma has been initiated. The
      selection of gas mixtures may depend on the product and packaging
      characteristics as each type of product may have an optimal MAP,
      treatment time, storage conditions, or the like. A person of skill
      in the art would understand that a series of optimization
      experiments would be conducted to obtain the optimum parameters in
      each case.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] FIG. 3 shows an example of two eggs, enclosed in a plastic
      bag subject to in-field ANEP exposure with He as the MAP working
      gas. The filamentary nature of the DBD discharge is clearly seen,
      with the streamers terminating on the eggs and on the package. A
      more diffuse discharge is present in the region between the DBD
      electrodes where there is no egg. The specific arrangement of
      streamers would depend on the surface characteristics of the
      object as a dielectric, such as roughness, contaminants and the
      like, and that of the container, and may differ for different
      products to be treated. The streamers appear to be preferentially
      formed between the DBD electrodes and DBD dielectric and the egg,
      where the egg acts as a dielectric object disposed between the
      plates. This result appears qualitatively consistent with the
      voltage gradients that would obtain in the region without an ANEP
      present.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] An apple was also treated in a He MAP atmosphere, similarly
      to the egg sample shown in FIG. 3, so as to visualize the process.
      The apple was located between the plates of the DBD apparatus, and
      ionization of the He MAP was possible at the 15 KV potential due
      to the lower ionization voltage required. After exposure, the
      apple was removed from the bag and distinctly smelled of ozone.
      This may arise from the property of apples that about 20 percent
      of the volume thereof is formed by small air sacs. The ozone may
      be produced by ionization of the air in the sacs. Alternatively,
      the skin may be the region in which the ozone formation occurs. In
      either case, the formation of the ozone may lead to improvements
      in at least the surface cleanliness and storage life. Other fruits
      and vegetables may also benefit from this treatment. Treatment of
      sliced or diced product should also be practical. The use of He in
      the experiment and the absence of O2 in the gas mixture enabled
      the smell detection of the ozone produced within the apple or
      remaining on the surface thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] While the present experiments have focused on food
      products, the same techniques may be used for medical equipment or
      other objects to be rendered less contaminated or sterile within a
      package. Based on the observations of the ionization
      characteristics produced in the reported experiments, it was
      possible to recognize that placing plastic tubing between the
      electrodes, with the electrodes close to or contacting the tube,
      may result in forming an ANEP plasma within the tube, thus
      processing the interior portion of the tube. The exterior of the
      tube, enclosed in the overall packaging, may be processed by using
      the same or a greater electrode spacing so that an ANEP may be
      formed within a package containing the tubing. Alternatively,
      there should be a voltage gradient range where both processes may
      occur with a single electrode spacing. Other gas mixtures may be
      used in medical equipment processing, which may not be considered
      appropriate for consumable products. A variety of medical devices,
      including metallic devices may be similarly treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In the previous examples, the bag was closed, and remained
      closed during the treatment and the storage. However, depending on
      the objective of the treatment, and the desired after storage
      conditions, the bag may be punctured, opened, perforated, or the
      like. Depending on the specific apparatus configuration, the bag
      may be partially ventilated with holes. This may permit the
      generation of an ANEP plasma jet in the bag or package, similar to
      that being developed as thrusters in avionics.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] FIGS. 4 A and B illustrate a configuration where a bag 500
      containing an object to be treated 200 has apertures and the DBD
      has at least one electrode 420 that is not dielectric coated or
      isolated. The dielectric 440 is disposed between the exposed
      electrode 420 and the lower electrode 430 so that an ANEP is
      formed in the region of the surface of the dielectric 440 and
      terminating at the exposed electrode 420. In such an example, the
      processes at the instantaneous anode and the cathode electrodes
      may not be the same, and a person of skill in the art would expect
      a plasma jet to be generated. Even when the bag does not have
      apertures 510, the asymmetrical nature of the ANEP generation may
      lead to gas currents. The gas currents associated with such a jet
      or asymmetrical ANEP generation, produced internal to the bag,
      could be effective in distributing the reaction products
      throughout the bag, and mitigating a heat rise in the bag so that
      a more intense discharge may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] FIG. 4C illustrates a situation where the DBD apparatus may
      be used to process objects that have been stored in a
      substantially dielectric container, such as a cardboard box. The
      interior of the box may be sealed with a plastic layer or a foil
      layer, although this is not needed in all applications. The
      electrodes 620 and 630 are protected from excessive discharge
      current by the dielectric layers 640 and 650, and the electrodes
      are disposed at an approximately right angle to each other, and
      placed along the edge of the container so that the ANEP is formed
      in the interior angle therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The term bag has been used to represent the enclosure,
      container, treatment volume or storage volume in which the object
      is treated and subsequently stored. However, this should be
      understood to represent any dielectric material compatible with
      the treatment process, and could be a bottle, a vial, an opaque
      plastic food tray sealed with a thin transparent film, or the
      like. The objects to be processed need not be dielectric, as
      metallic objects could be exposed as well. The metal surfaces
      would likely behave similarly to the metal surface that is not
      covered with a dielectric in case where only one of the electrodes
      is dielectric protected. Thus, the apparatus and technique may be
      used to sterilize or otherwise decontaminate objects such as
      medical supplies, including surgical instruments, syringes, and
      the like so that they do not need to be removed from the packaging
      after treatment and until immediately prior to use. One may repeat
      the sterilization process in the hospital or physician's office
      prior to opening the packaging for further suppressing
      contaminants or pathogens. It should be noted that the dielectric
      forming the container may be used as the dielectric barrier of the
      DBD, providing that the electrical characteristics thereof prevent
      dielectric breakdown.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] As may be expected, the ozone concentration increases with
      the time duration of ANEP generation, being dependent, for each
      reactive species, on the details of the recombination process.
      FIG. 5 shows the results of tests where the ozone concentration
      was measured as a function of the duration of ANEP generation.
      Preliminary tests at higher voltages suggest that an increase in
      the rate of reactive species generation may be possible, and that
      the electrode gap may also be increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Thus, objectives of the treatment of an object using
      in-storage-volume ANEP generation may vary depending on the
      particular circumstance, ranging from improving the storage
      characteristics by reducing surface contamination, reducing the
      number of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria related to
      spoilage or species that are human pathogens, sterilization of the
      food or object, or the like. Each circumstance will determine the
      gas composition, plasma concentration and exposure time that may
      be appropriate.<br>

      A system and method for decontamination of product is described.
      An object to be treated, which may be a food product or a medical
      device, is placed in a substantially closed dielectric container
      with a working gas. The container is placed in an apparatus
      capable of producing a controlled electrical discharge so as to
      create reactive ion species within the package. The object to be
      treated may be exposed either the immediate products of the
      electrical discharge or the long lasting reactive ion species, or
      both, so as to treat the object to reduce or eliminate specific
      contaminants, which may be biological pathogens or the cause of
      product spoilage, or inorganic contaminants. The reactive ion
      species may result from an atmospheric non-equilibrium plasma
      (ANEP) formed by the apparatus and the treatment may be performed
      without significantly increasing the bulk temperature of the
      object being treated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present application relates an apparatus and method for
      treating packaged products to reduce undesirable contamination.
      More, specifically a system and method of reducing the level of
      organisms which may be related to deterioration of the product or
      to human pathology is described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Recent trends in dieting and healthy eating have shown a
      high demand for fresh produce. According to USDA Economic Research
      Service statistics, fresh spinach, for example, reached a record
      consumption in 2005 with 738 million pounds in the United States:
      more than 12 times the amount consumed in 1970. Processed spinach
      consumption, conversely, has tended to decline over the last few
      decades. This high demand for fresh, nutritious produce puts
      pressure on producers and processors to ensure that products are
      safe for human consumption, yet continue to retain expected
      nutritious and aesthetic qualities. Minimal processing and
      treatment appears desirable in order to maintain the fresh taste,
      texture, and nutrition of produce. However, many sources of
      contamination exist that can affect produce before, during, and
      after harvesting. Sources of contamination include fecal matter
      from animals, both wild and domestic, contaminated irrigation
      water, flooding of crops, as well as from personnel involved with
      handling of products<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Due to the specific growth conditions of produce,
      particular varieties are not always in season locally, and are
      often shipped from all parts of the nation and world to meet the
      demands of consumers. Many aspects of shipping can cause a
      decrease in the quality of fresh produce. Spoilage could occur
      from, for example, unsanitary transportation vehicles, lengthy
      shipping schedules, and improper storage temperatures and
      ventilation of storage areas. Conventional methods of sanitizing
      fresh produce involve various washing procedures. More efficient
      processing methods are needed to reduce the risk of contaminated
      produce, while still maintaining its fresh qualities.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Atmospheric, non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) is an example of
      a non-thermal processing method. There is a wide variance in the
      terminology for the process to produce such a plasma. In the
      literature, a variety of terminology is used to describe the
      phenomenon including atmospheric glow discharge, surface barrier
      discharge (SBD), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD), Single
      Dielectric Barrier Discharge (SDBD) and Surface Plasma Chemistry
      Process (SPCP). For convenience herein, the term dielectric
      barrier discharge (DBD) is used, without intending to exclude any
      of the ANEP plasma generating mechanisms implied by choosing a
      specific terminology for description of the technique herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] FIG. 1 shows simplified examples of DBD configurations that
      may be used to produce an ANEP in an ambient air environment. A
      high voltage generator 10 applies an alternating current potential
      to a pair of metallic plates 20, 30, spaced apart from each other
      to form a region 50 in which an object may be placed. At least one
      dielectric layer 40 is disposed between a first plate 20 and the
      second plate 30. In this manner, the effect of the dielectric
      layer is to limit the current of any filamentary discharge that is
      formed between the plate 20, 30 so as to prevent the formation of
      a high current arc. The discharge in region 50 is thus limited in
      energy and results in an ANEP where variety of reactive species
      may be formed from the O2, N2 and possibly water vapor. FIG. 1A
      shows a configuration with one dielectric layer 40 laid against an
      electrode 20. FIG. 1B shows an example where a dielectric plate 40
      is laid against an electrode 20 and another dielectric plate 60 is
      laid against a second electrode 30. The charge accumulation on the
      plates, which may be used in conjunction with the voltage
      waveform, to estimate the power consumption, may be measured by
      determining the voltage developed across a conventional capacitor
      75. FIG. 1C illustrates a situation where a single dielectric
      layer 50 is disposed between the electrodes 20, 30, so that two
      regions 50 are formed in which an ANEP may be formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] As the possibility of an arc forming directly between the
      plates 20, 30 exists, by air paths around the dielectric, at least
      one electrode is often fully enclosed in an insulating material,
      and the exposed electrode may be grounded. The insulating material
      may be the same material as used for the dielectric 40, 60 however
      the two materials may have differing properties. For example, the
      dielectric plate may be quartz, and the insulating material may be
      a moldable material.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The food industry is always seeking a better method for
      maintaining food safety and ozone treatment may be an effective
      possibility due to its antimicrobial properties and lack of
      residual substances. However, ensuring minimal to no exposure of
      employees to ozone is a concern. Similar considerations would
      apply to the medical field, where sterilizing packaged objects and
      maintaining sterile conditions is important.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] A system and method are described where reactive species
      may be produced by an atmospheric non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) in
      a closed package containing an object to be decontaminated, so as
      to suppress or eliminate contaminants. The reactive species may be
      of a short lifetime so as to perform the treatment during a period
      of time during and shortly after a discharge creating the plasma.
      Longer lifetime species may remain so as to perform, or to
      continue to perform, the treatment for an extended period of time.
      Eventually, the reactive species may be eliminated from the
      treatment volume by reacting with the contents of the package, the
      package, or with each other. As the reactive species may be
      contained within the package, exposure of personnel to such
      reactive species may be minimized.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The package may form a storage space for a product, which
      may be, for example, a food product, or a medical device, which
      may remain inside the package during and after treatment. The
      package may also contain a working gas fill, which may be air, or
      a mixture of gases, which may include noble gases. An atmospheric
      non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) is produced within the package by a
      voltage gradient applied from outside the package. By selecting
      the working gas mixture, the duration of the ANEP creation, and
      the duration of the treatment, the treated product may have
      reduced contamination, or be sterilized, depending on the specific
      application. The working gas mixture, the equipment geometry and
      the operation voltage are selected so that the electrodes may be
      situated in the ambient manufacturing environment and produce
      reactive species within the package, while avoiding or minimizing
      the production of such species outside of the package.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A system for treating a product is described that uses an
      apparatus configured to create a reactive species in a part of a
      package or storage volume sized and dimensioned to contain an
      object to be treated. The object to be treated is stored within
      the storage volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In an aspect, a system for treating a product is described,
      having an apparatus configured to create a atmospheric
      non-equilibrium plasma (ANEP) in a working gas in a storage volume
      sized, and dimensioned to contain an object to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The working gas includes a noble gas in a percentage
      sufficient to reduce a voltage gradient needed to create the ANEP.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In another aspect, a method of decontaminating an object
      includes the steps of providing a dielectric barrier discharge
      (DBD) device; providing a container suitable for substantially
      completely enclosing the object and a working gas; inserting the
      object into the container; disposing at least a portion of the
      container such that reactive species may be produced in the
      container by the DPD apparatus; and activating the DBD device.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] Exemplary embodiments may be better understood with
      reference to the drawings, but these examples are not intended to
      be of a limiting nature. Like numbered or labeled elements in the
      same or different drawings perform equivalent functions. When a
      specific feature, structure, or characteristic is described in
      connection with an example, it will be understood that one skilled
      in the art may effect such feature, structure, or characteristic
      in connection with other examples, whether or not explicitly
      stated herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] It will of course be appreciated that in the development of
      any such actual implementation, numerous implementation-specific
      decisions must be made to achieve specific development goals, such
      as compliance with system and business related constraints, and
      that these goals will vary from one implementation to another.
      Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a development effort
      might be complex and time-consuming, but would nevertheless be a
      routine undertaking of engineering for those of ordinary skill in
      the art having the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Atmospheric pressure “cold” plasmas have been shown to be
      effective in reducing or eliminating surface bacterial
      contamination of food samples. The term “cold plasma” is meant to
      describe a plasma discharge, which may be a non-equilibrium
      plasma, occurring at a pressure of about one-atmosphere and at
      near ambient temperature (ANEP). This is to distinguish the ANEP
      plasma from a thermal plasma discharge operating at a bulk gas
      temperature of hundreds or thousands of degrees above the ambient
      temperature. In an atmospheric pressure “cold plasma” the
      electrons may have a significantly higher temperature than the ion
      and neutral species; however, the bulk temperature of the working
      gas is not significantly raised. In this context, however, the
      term “cold” should not be interpreted to require refrigeration or
      other cooling to perform the decontamination or treatment
      functions described herein; however, this does not exclude the
      treating or the subsequent storage of the treated object at an
      appropriate temperature, which may include refrigeration or
      cooling. Keeping the gas at a near-ambient temperature may
      contribute to avoidance of heat damage to the sample being
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] One technique of creating a non-equilibrium plasma is to
      apply a high voltage to the volume to be ionized, while inhibiting
      the transition from a glow discharge to an arc discharge by
      limiting the discharge current. This may be done, for example, by
      covering at least one of the electrodes of the apparatus with a
      dielectric layer; resistive layers have also been used. The
      discharge current is self-limited by charge build up on the
      dielectric surface. Typically, the excitation voltage frequency is
      in the kHz range, but may range from power line frequencies to
      radio frequencies. The experimental data presented herein used a
      60 Hz frequency due to the availability of high voltage
      transformers, whose voltage could be easily be adjusted by
      controlling the input voltage thereof with a variable voltage
      transformer.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Dielectric-barrier discharges (DBD) are a type of
      alternating-current high-voltage gaseous discharges that may be
      formed in a nominally atmospheric pressure environment. The
      presence of a dielectric layer between the electrodes prevents the
      charges generated in the gas by the discharge from reaching at
      least one of the conducting electrode surfaces. Often the
      dielectric layer is applied to both of the electrodes. Within each
      half-cycle of the driving voltage waveform, when the voltage
      gradient applied across the gas exceeds that required for
      breakdown, the formation of narrow ionized discharge filaments
      initiates the conduction of electrons toward the more positive
      electrode, and ions towards the more negative electrode, although
      the mobility of the electrons is greater. Electrical charge
      accumulates on the dielectric layer(s) at the end(s) of each
      ionized filament, and the voltage drop across the ionized filament
      reduces until the voltage falls below the discharge-sustaining
      level, so that the discharge is extinguished. The duration of the
      filamentary discharge is believed to be quite short: of the order
      of 100 nanoseconds or less. However, the resultant reactive
      species may have a significantly longer lifetime. The low charge
      mobility along the surface of the dielectric also limits the
      lateral region over which the gap voltage is diminished, so that a
      plurality of filaments may form in close proximity to one another.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Production of ozone in a DBD occurs between the two
      electrodes when operated at a particular voltage, frequency, and
      geometry. In air, mixtures of O2 and N2, or O2 alone, reactive
      oxygen species are generated which react with each other as well
      as oxygen molecules resulting in the formation of ozone. Other
      reactive species are created when N2, or other gases such as CO2,
      H2O or Cl are present. The most oxidative species in air and
      oxygen gas include ozone (O3), singlet oxygen (O or O&lt;−&gt;),
      superoxide (O2&lt;−&gt;), peroxide (O2&lt;−2 &gt;or H2O2), and
      hydroxyl radicals (OH). Most of these species have very short
      half-lives (in the range of milliseconds); however, ozone has a
      much longer half-life ranging from minutes to days depending on
      conditions. The effects of gaseous ozone on foods has previously
      been studied with promising results and ozone has been shown to be
      more efficient at lower concentrations and treatment times than
      more standard sanitizers, including chlorine. The use of ozone has
      been limited to the treatment of unpackaged products.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Plasma-generated species may be capable of reacting readily
      with various materials and organisms. Oxygen- and nitrogen-based
      reactive species are effective in the inactivation of
      microorganisms and may include ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO).
      For example, E. coli O157:H7 on lettuce was shown to be reduced by
      1.79 log10 (CFU/g) (colony-forming units per gram) after 15 min of
      treatment with gaseous ozone. Similar reductions of E. coli
      O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica inoculated on blueberries have
      been reported. A number of researchers were able to inactivate
      various food-borne pathogens in unpackaged samples using assorted
      plasma systems with treatment times ranging from seconds to
      minutes on fresh produce surfaces including apples, cantaloupes,
      and lettuce. After production thereof, reaction products of an
      ANEP may have the ability to decompose or recombine, leaving no
      residual chemicals or reactive species.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Many examples of the creation of such plasmas are in
      flowing gases or in the ambient environment. However, such plasmas
      quickly dissipate or are transported away from the sample to be
      treated by air currents or pressure differentials. Here, an
      apparatus and method for localizing the ionized and other reactive
      species that are created is described, so that the treatment time
      may be extended and the ionized and other reactive species
      confined to the neighborhood of the object being treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In particular, the object to be treated may be enclosed in
      a sealed or substantially sealed container. The container need not
      be hermetic unless the level of decontamination desired is such
      that subsequent contamination from another source is to be
      avoided. Non-hermetic containers may be used in applications where
      subsequent re-contamination of the sample is prevented by the
      characteristics of the packaging. Non-hermetic containers may be
      permeable to some extent to air, and to the other constituent
      gases or the radicals or reactive species produced in the ANEP.
      That is, the packaging may be porous to gases, but prevent
      spoilage or pathogentic material from entering the package. The
      composition of the container may be a plastic such as TYGON,
      low-density polyethylene (LDPE), high density polyethylene (HDPE),
      polyethylene teraphthalate (PET), or polystyrene; however, various
      other substantially dielectric materials can be used, including,
      glass, wax, cardboard, paper, foil, eggshells, low dielectric
      constant materials, or the like. The foil may be a plastic having
      a thin metallic coating. This may permit the treatment of objects
      stored in a foil package, or having a foil liner.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The system and method described herein may achieve at least
      1-3 log10 reductions of spoilage organisms and greater than 5
      log10 reductions (total kill for oxygen working gas at room
      temperature and refrigeration after 24 hr storage) of E. coli
      O157:H7 in fresh produce with minimal quality changes in seconds
      to minutes of active treatment. The amount of contaminant
      reduction needed depends on the specific product to be treated,
      the subsequent storage conditions, storage time and similar
      considerations, which will often be governed by economic and
      regulatory factors. While the studies described herein are related
      to bacteria, similar effects should be experienced for fungi and
      virus contaminants.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] An apparatus for treating a sample is shown in FIG. 2. An
      object to be treated 200 is placed in a substantially closed
      dielectric container 100. The container may be rigid or flexible
      and may be sealed by a ZIPLOC closure, by heat, by a close-fitting
      cap, or any other mechanism that has a similar effect. The
      container should have an ability to substantially retain the
      reactive species that are the residual of the generated ANEP
      plasma for a period of time that is sufficient for a particular
      treatment process. The working gas, which may be air, or a
      modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) mixture, may be introduced
      into the container 100 prior to treatment. The container 100 may
      be purged prior to charging with the working gas so as to control
      the resulting gas mixture. The container may be sealed either
      permanently or temporarily prior to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] A region within the container is selected where an ANEP may
      be generated. This may be a specific formed region of a semi-rigid
      or rigid container, or may be formed by manipulation of a flexible
      container where the gas pressure gives the container a deformable
      shape. In rigid containers, the gas pressure may be less than an
      atmosphere, while the gas pressure in a flexible container is an
      atmosphere or greater. This does not exclude situations, for
      example, where vacuum packing is used, and a working gas may be
      introduced for the purposes of the treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 2A illustrates a situation where the object being
      treated is disposed between the plates of the apparatus, while
      FIG. 2B illustrates the situation where the object being treated
      is disposed so that a small thickness of the storage bag having a
      gap between the opposing surfaces is disposed between the plates
      of the apparatus. For the situation of FIG. 2B, the ANEP is
      created inside a portion of the storage container; however, the
      object to be treated may not be directly exposed to the active
      ANEP. Rather, the residual reactive species may be diffused or
      circulated to the volume of container having the object to be
      treated. This configuration reduces the voltage needed to
      establish the ANEP as the distance between the electrodes has been
      reduced compared with the thickness of the object. In addition,
      where the termination of the plasma filaments on the object itself
      may be undesirable, that situation is avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In contrast, the arrangement of FIG. 2A disposes the object
      to be treated between the electrodes, and the object itself may
      behave as a dielectric, similar to that used on one or more of the
      electrodes. In this circumstance, the filaments creating the ANEP
      may extend from the electrode or the dielectric barrier on an
      electrode, or an electrode without a dielectric barrier, to a
      surface of the object to be treated, and an active ANEP may also
      surround the object. The electrons and the ions created in the
      ANEP may directly impinge on the surface of the object. Similarly
      to the arrangement of FIG. 2B, the object may continue to be
      exposed to the ANEP byproducts after the active phase of ANEP
      generation has been completed. Each of the processes may be
      repeated, if needed, where the object or the storage bag is
      manipulated to better distribute the active byproducts or expose
      other portions of the object to the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] As shown in FIG. 2A, the container 100 having a working gas
      300 and an object to be treated 200 may be disposed between the
      plates of a DBD apparatus 2. The plates 20, 30 are spaced apart so
      as to admit at least portion of the container 100 containing the
      object to be treated 200. The distance between the plates may be
      controlled by mechanical means so that the container 100 may
      conveniently be placed between the plates 20, 30, and the spacing
      between the plates subsequently adjusted so as to partially
      compress the container 100, so as to achieve an appropriate gap
      spacing for the creation of the ANEP within the container 100. In
      this configuration, filamentary discharges may occur between the
      dielectric surface 40 of the top plate 20 and the opposing surface
      of the object 200 being treated, and may also occur between the
      bottom plate 30 and the object being treated 200. The ANEP may
      also be created by electrical currents flowing directly from one
      plate to another, as mediated by the dielectric layer on the
      plate.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Where the object to be treated has the general
      characteristics of a dielectric material, the filaments will have
      a behavior similar to that which would occur in a DBD apparatus
      without an introduced object, except that the filaments may
      terminate one end thereof on the object. So, the object will be
      directly exposed to the filamentary discharges creating the ANEP,
      as well as to the shorter lasting and longer lasting reactive
      species that are created during the active treatment phase. As the
      surface density of filaments is governed by the electrical field
      distribution, and the shape and electrical properties of the
      object to be treated, the entire surface of the object may not be
      subject to the same intensity of direct treatment. Should more
      uniform treatment be desired, the object to be treated 200 may be
      manipulated to expose other parts of the object to direct
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The high voltage is often sinusoidal and may be produced by
      a high-voltage transformer connected to the power grid, a signal
      generator connected to an amplifier, or the like. For the
      experiments described herein, a maximum voltage of about 18 KV
      (RMS) was used, however informal experiments are being performed
      using a higher voltage of about 75 KV, with an objective on
      exploring the range up to about 120 KV. In experiments performed
      at about 65 KV, with the same gap as used at lower voltages, the
      rate generation of reactive species appears to substantially
      faster, with about the same concentration of reactive being
      achieved after 15 seconds as was observed after 5 minutes at about
      15 KV.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Other voltage waveform shapes may be used, including
      sawtooth, trapezoidal, or pulsed, and the voltage waveform may be
      symmetrical, asymmetrical, or displaced from DC. The amplitude of
      the voltage may be controlled during operation of the apparatus
      by, for example a VARIAC transformer, or by controlling the signal
      generator amplitude output, or the amplifier gain. The frequency
      of operation may be fixed or variable. ANEP plasmas have been
      created using frequencies ranging from DC (where a resistive layer
      is used a current limiter or ballast) to radio frequencies (RF).
      In the experiments described herein, the local power line
      frequency (60 Hz) was used for convenience in configuring the
      experimental apparatus and cost considerations.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The voltage gradient at which a glow discharge is formed is
      a function of the constitutive gases present between the
      electrodes, various geometrical considerations, and the gas
      pressure. For most of the experimental data presented herein, a
      simple ambient air mixture or pure oxygen was used. For purposes
      of visualization of the filamentary discharges, pure helium (He)
      was sometimes used due to the substantially lower ionization
      potential and to produce a clearly visible glow in the ionized
      region and on the dielectric surfaces. The constituent gases may
      be modified so as to achieve a desired concentration and species
      of ionized particles. In addition to air, O2, N2, CO2, H2O, Cl,
      and other mixtures, or pure gases, including inert and noble
      gases, are usable, depending on the application.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] As shown in FIG. 2B when a flexible container 100, which
      may be a plastic storage bag, is used, the internal gas pressure
      may selected so a that a portion of the container may be
      compressed between the plates 20, 30 so as to form a smaller gap
      to facilitate creation of the ANEP at a lower voltage. Here, the
      container is shown in a state where a portion 110 of the container
      100 is positioned between the electrodes of the DBD apparatus 3,
      so that a portion of the container 100 may be temporarily formed
      into a region where the ANEP may be created. The filaments
      creating the ANEP are formed between the surface of the dielectric
      40 and the other electrode plate 30, such that there the object
      200 to be treated is not disposed therebetween. In this manner,
      larger objects may be treated without having to use very high
      voltages. Portions of the container surface disposed so as to form
      the region in which the ANEP is to be formed are held against the
      dielectric 40 and the plate 30 by the internal gas pressure. The
      effect of the dielectric layer of the container surface may be
      small, as the charge distributions are likely to be dominated by
      those of the electrodes and the dielectric 40.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIG. 2C shows a top view of the DBD apparatus 3 of FIG. 2B.
      The dielectric material extends so as to inhibit stray discharges,
      and the electrodes are disposed opposite only a portion of the
      storage volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The electrodes may be planar, as shown; however, other
      geometries may be used to conform to a container such as a box,
      pill bottle, jar, or other shape. Shaped electrodes may be used to
      encourage the formation of a plasma jet, or better distribute the
      reaction products using induced convection. For example, large
      cardboard containers may be processed by using a pair of
      electrodes oriented at a 90° angle and placed along one or more of
      the edges. Similar configuration may be used for large packages of
      other materials and shapes.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The effects of ANEP treatment of packaged produce was
      studied using, fresh, bagged spinach and chicken. Spinach was
      chosen due to its popularity as a fresh health food, yet subject
      to recent outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7 found on packaged spinach
      leaves. Leaves of packaged spinach were treated in plastic food
      storage bags containing one of two different gases and stored at
      two different temperatures. The effectiveness of in-package ANEP
      treatment in suppressing spoilage organisms and E. coli O157:H7
      was tested, as well as the effects of treatment and storage on
      quality of spinach leaves.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The spinach used in the experiments was obtained from a
      local supermarket in West Lafayette, Ind. The spinach had been cut
      and bagged, and was stored under refrigeration in the supermarket.
      The same brand of spinach was used for each test (Dole Food Co.,
      Thousand Oaks, Calif.). Full-sized spinach leaves were used for
      spoilage organism tests while baby spinach leaves were used for E.
      coli O157:H7 tests. The average surface area of leaves used for
      spoilage organism tests was 56.2 cm2. The average weight of leaves
      used for E. coli O157:H7 tests was 0.570 g. All bags were stored
      at 5° C. after purchase and were used in the experiment prior to
      the expiration date listed on the outside of the bag. An unopened
      bag of spinach was used as the source of spinach leaves for each
      test.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Prior to treatment, spinach leaves of visually similar
      surface area were selected from the bag. Leaves were weighed and
      placed on aseptic wax paper and an outline tracing made for
      subsequent determination of leaf surface area.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Clear, 3.78 L storage bags were obtained from a local
      grocery store in West Lafayette, Ind. Two different brands were
      used throughout the course of the spinach experiment: Great Value
      Food Storage Bags (Great Value, Walmart, Bentonville, Ark.) and
      Glad Food Storage Bags (The Glad Products Company, Oakland,
      Calif.). The bags are believed to be fabricated from low-density
      polyethylene (LDPE) and were 1.6-mm thick. It is known that
      storage of spinach leaves in a controlled atmosphere (CA) of 7-10%
      O2 and 5-10% CO2 delays discoloration; however, plastic films used
      for commercial packaging are usually chosen to maintain an
      environment of 1-3% O2 and 8-10% CO2. Retail zip-top bags were
      chosen as the dielectric material for the ozone treatment
      experiments of spinach, as only one of two gases would be used in
      each bag for this study: either air or oxygen. The retail bags
      were low cost, easy-to use, and were sufficient for
      proof-of-concept of an in-package treatment. Other bag
      technologies and materials may be used, depending on costs,
      storage duration, storage conditions, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The values of leaf surface area were then used to determine
      the CFU/cm&lt;2 &gt;of each leaf. The average population of
      spoilage organisms on the spinach leaves prior to treatment was
      3.19 log10 (CFU/cm&lt;2&gt;). After tracing, leaves were placed on
      aseptic stands that were designed to allow plasma exposure on both
      sides of the leaves during treatment and storage. The stands were
      then placed inside individual sterile, re-sealable, polyethylene
      bags, each bag containing a single spinach leaf.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A single strain of E. coli O157:H7 (6460) was used for the
      evaluation of the ANEP treatments. The strain was obtained from
      Dr. R. H. Linton of the Food Science Department at Purdue
      University, West Lafayette, Ind. Cultures of the bacteria were
      grown in trypticase soy broth (TSB) and placed in a shaking
      incubator for 18 h at 37° C. Spinach leaves were weighed and
      placed in sterile petri dishes prior to inoculation. Each spinach
      sample was spot inoculated (8-10 spots) with 100 μL of the E. coli
      culture and placed in a biosafety hood for 1 h to allow for
      bacterial attachment. The average population of control samples
      was 5.40 log10 (CFU/mL).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The oxygen content in each bag was measured before
      treatment and after storage using a gas analyzer (MOCON, Inc.,
      Minneapolis, Minn.). The analyzer had a syringe connected to a
      tube which fed to the analyzer. The syringe tip was placed inside
      the bag through the re-sealable opening (bags were not punctured)
      to measure the gas inside. Two readings were taken during each
      measurement to ensure values were accurate.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The temperature of the surfaces of the leaves and the
      electrodes was measured and recorded just prior to, and just
      after, treatment with an infrared thermometer (Omega Engineering,
      Inc., Stamford, Conn.).<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The relative humidity inside storage bags containing a
      single spinach leaf was measured. A single, un-inoculated spinach
      leaf and a relative humidity sensor (Thermo-Hygro Control Co.,
      Friendswood, Tex.) were placed inside the storage bag. The bag was
      then filled with either air or oxygen gas as before. The relative
      humidity was recorded before and after the 5 min treatment or
      storage. Relative humidity tests were replicated 10 times for air
      and oxygen and treated and untreated samples.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The treatment system used operated at a frequency of 60 Hz
      generating about 12 kV of potential between the electrodes, and
      the power consumption was 40 W. The voltages for all experiments
      were measured with a conventional voltmeter, yielding RMS voltage
      values. The electrodes were made of coils of insulated wire wound
      around a planar dielectric form with a treatment area of about 51
      cm&lt;2 &gt;(8.5 cm by 6 cm). Treatment of all samples occurred at
      ambient laboratory temperature (nominally 22° C.).<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Bags containing the samples were filled with the working
      gas (air or oxygen for this example) and purged three times to
      ensure purity of the gas in the bag, which was verified with the
      gas analyzer. A small amount of gas was expelled from the bag to
      allow for orientation of plasma electrodes. The electrodes were
      placed above and below the bag, oriented on top of each other. The
      bag in between the electrodes had an approximate gap distance of
      3-3.5 mm, which permitted formation of an ANEP with the available
      voltage. The system was then activated for a 5-min active
      treatment period.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The gas in the bag was agitated manually, once during each
      minute of treatment, for about 10-15 s, to allow for a more
      uniform distribution of gas inside the bag. This was done by
      pressing lightly back-and-forth on the bag so as minimize the
      change in the alignment of the electrodes or disturb the sample.
      The bag was then placed in a stable location at either room
      temperature (22° C.) or refrigeration (5° C.) for a predetermined
      storage period (0.5, 2, or 24 h).<br>
      <br>
      [0055] After storage for the specified time, the ozone and/or
      nitrous oxide content was measured by means of DRAEGER Short-Term
      Detector tubes (Draeger Safety AG &amp; Co. KGaA, Luebeck,
      Germany). Tubes (specific to measuring ozone) of two different
      scales were used to measure ozone concentration, 0.05-0.7 ppm and
      20-300 ppm ozone for volumes of 100 mL. One type of tube (specific
      for measuring nitrous oxides) was used for determining nitrous
      oxide concentration. This tube had two scales depending on the
      volume drawn through the tube. Scales ranged between 2-50 ppm and
      5-100 ppm for volumes of 500 mL and 1000 mL. In order to determine
      concentration values when measuring very high concentrations of
      species, the tubes were connected to syringes by means of flexible
      tubing. Volumes of gas were drawn through tubes and estimates of
      actual concentrations were determined by comparing the ratio of
      values of measured concentration and volume to actual
      concentration and volume, and solving for the actual
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Measurement of these gases gave approximate concentrations.
      The detector tubes had accuracies of ±10% to ±15%. Also, the
      nitrous oxide tubes had cross sensitivities with ozone making for
      less accurate results for the nitrous oxide concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Following storage, the leaves were aseptically removed from
      bags and placed in 100 mL of 0.1% peptone water. Leaves were
      stomached for 2 min on high to remove microbes from the leaf
      surface. Serial dilutions were then performed using standard
      procedures for microbial recovery and 0.1 mL samples were
      surface-plated on plate count agar (PCA) for spoilage organisms,
      and Sorbitol-MacConkey Agar with Cefixime-Tellurite (CTSMAC) for
      E. coli O157:H7. All samples were incubated at 37° C. for 24 h.
      Survivors were counted after incubation and recorded as log10
      (CFU/cm&lt;2&gt;) for spoilage organisms and log10 (CFU/mL) for E.
      coli O157:H7.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Microorganism reductions observed for all treatments are
      listed in Table 1. The results from the treatment of spoilage
      organisms showed multiple log10 reductions in populations for most
      treatments, with the exception of the samples treated in air-based
      ANEP and stored for 24 h at room temperature (22° C.). In this
      case, after 24 h of storage the level of spoilage organisms
      actually increased by 0.77 log10 (CFU/cm&lt;2&gt;) when compared
      with the initial population of spoilage organisms on control
      samples. The increase in population of this sample after storage
      is believed to be due to organisms which survived treatment and
      the effects of remaining ANEP species, e.g., the ozone and nitrous
      oxides, during storage and subsequently grew at room temperature.
      This may suggest that the air ANEP treatment prior to
      refrigeration of samples would need adjustment of the treatment
      conditions from those used in the experiment as any surviving
      spoilage organisms could potentially increase in population
      between treatment and refrigeration. However, samples treated with
      air and oxygen ANEP and stored under refrigerated conditions
      showed multiple log10 reductions (2.47 and 3.55 log10 for air and
      oxygen ANEP, respectively) as indicated in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Oxygen ANEP showed increased effectiveness at reducing
      spoilage organisms when compared with ANEP generated with air. The
      increased bactericidal effect from oxygen ANEP is believed to be
      caused by the increased levels of ozone generated. So, a longer
      treatment time in air or a more intense phase of ozone generation
      may be indicated for treatment of spoilage microorganisms. The
      bactericidal effects at these levels for the other treatment cases
      could increase shelf-life of produce if the produce was
      refrigerated immediately after treatment, allowing for fresh
      products to be shipped further and potentially last longer in the
      homes of consumers.<br>

      <br>
      [0060] All of the treated leaf samples inoculated with E. coli
      O157:H7 showed reductions in populations following storage. The
      reductions of E. coli O157:H7 treated in both air and oxygen ANEP
      increased as storage time increased. This may suggest the
      long-acting effect of the confined reactive products. Multiple
      storage times (0.5, 2, and 24 h) were used to obtain data to
      ascertain when a total kill of the pathogen occurred. As evidenced
      in Table 1, multiple log10 reductions were indicated after 2 h
      storages for all samples. Samples treated with ANEP containing
      oxygen as the gas present, and stored for 24 h, showed no
      surviving E. coli O157:H7 organisms. Further testing is being
      performed for 24 h room temperature storage data for samples
      treated with air ANEP.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Samples treated with oxygen as the gas for ANEP generation
      showed increased log10 reductions for most samples when compared
      with samples treated in air, with the exception of samples stored
      at room temperature with oxygen ANEP (0.34 log10 reduction).
      Again, the increased effectiveness of ANEP generated in oxygen gas
      fill is believed to be due to the increased concentration of ozone
      produced during treatment. This data suggests that produce
      potentially contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 could effectively
      treated to eliminate the pathogen before the produce arrives at
      the grocery store or market.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] All the leaves were at room temperature just before
      treatment (between 21° C. and 22° C.). The sample temperatures did
      increase slightly after treatment however this increase was, on
      average, in the range of 0.1° C.-0.2° C. This data suggests that
      the treatment was effectively non-thermal and that the reductions
      in CFU were due to generated plasma species and the storage
      temperatures (room temperature and refrigeration). The average
      temperature of the ANEP electrodes before and after 5 min of
      treatment was 27.0° C. and 50.3° C., respectively. This is an
      average increase of approximately 23° C. for the electrodes. The
      heating of the electrodes may be reduced by cooling and other
      design measures in an industrial application.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The measured species generated in air-based ANEP include
      ozone and nitrous oxides, while only ozone was measured for
      oxygen-based ANEP. Ozone and nitrous oxides were the two most
      readily measurable species produced during ANEP treatment. A 5 min
      treatment with the ANEP system produced very high levels of both
      species, particularly ozone. Oxygen-based ANEP produced an average
      of 1730 ppm ozone and air-based ANEP produced averages of 650 ppm
      and 460 ppm for ozone and nitrous oxides, respectively,
      immediately after treatment. These species decreased in
      concentration during the storage period, eventually reaching an
      undetectable or zero level, leaving no residual species after 24 h
      of storage, as indicated in Table 1. The data obtained indicates
      that oxygen ANEP produces, on average, substantially higher
      concentrations of ozone than air ANEP. This is apparently due to
      the initial concentration of oxygen in the base gas, oxygen gas
      being 100% oxygen and air containing only 21% oxygen. Despite the
      wide range of results with the current measurement method, it is
      still evident from the resulting reductions of spoilage organisms
      and E. coli O157:H7 as well as the discoloration of leaves, that
      the pure oxygen ANEP system consistently produces high levels of
      oxidative reactive species.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] All of the test conditions showed no detectable ozone after
      24 h of storage, suggesting that measurable ozone had either
      decayed to a neutral gas, or had reacted with the test samples
      inside the package, with the package itself, or had diffused
      through the package material. The rate of decay of ozone for each
      set of temperature and gas type conditions was calculated by
      plotting ozone concentrations at storage times of 0, 0.5, and 2 h
      and fitting an exponential curve to the data points. Half-lives
      were calculated from the resulting fitted exponential equation.
      Calculated half-lives for ozone generated in oxygen and stored at
      room temperature and refrigeration were 78 and 87 min,
      respectively. Half-lives for ozone generated in air and stored at
      room temperature and refrigeration were 160 and 99 min,
      respectively. When measured ozone levels were compared between
      temperatures for each gas there was no significant difference
      (P&lt;0.05) between refrigerated and room temperature
      concentrations at each storage period suggesting that the
      calculated half-lives may not significantly different.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] A follow-up study was conducted to assess the affect of
      water presence on half-lives of ozone in the plastic bags utilized
      for treatments. Bags were filled with air or oxygen only or air or
      oxygen and 1 g of liquid water. Samples were actively treated for
      5 min with the experimental system and stored for 0, 2, 4, and 24
      h at room temperature (RT) (22° C.) and refrigeration (5° C.).
      Ozone concentrations were measured and half-lives were calculated
      as before. The half-lives of ozone were longer in all refrigerated
      samples when compared with samples stored at room temperature. The
      presence of nitrogen in air during the generation of ozone may
      also produce reactive nitrogen species (RNS) such as NO. These RNS
      species could cause different reaction pathways between the E.
      coli O157:H7, the spinach leaves, and the package, than the
      reaction pathways in pure oxygen, under the same conditions, and
      during the storage period.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The color of spinach leaves was assessed visually after
      treatment/storage. A rank number was assigned to each leaf
      evaluated indicating the relative percentage of leaf area that had
      been discolored after storage. The scale used ranged from 1-5,
      with 5 being the best quality (no discoloration) and 1 being the
      worst (entire leaf was discolored). The experimentally determined
      values were averaged and are presented in Table 2.<br>

      <br>
      [0067] Control samples were of a crisp texture and medium to dark
      green color, with few to no blemishes or tears in the leaf prior
      to treatment. All of the samples were initially judged to have a
      rating of 5. After drying samples for 1 h in the biosafety hood,
      leaves were somewhat less crisp due to moisture loss; however, the
      color did not degrade during drying. Treated samples showed
      increased wilting and discoloration after storage. Discoloration
      and wilting increased with longer storage times. Samples treated
      with air ANEP changed from the initial solid green color to having
      spots of yellowish-brown discoloration after 0.5 h of storage.
      Samples treated with oxygen ANEP changed from solid green to
      having solid white spots after 0.5 h of storage. Discoloration
      usually occurred at the stem and outer edges of the leaf. Leaves
      treated with oxygen ANEP seemed to maintain their original green
      color most effectively in the unaffected portions of the leaves.
      Leaves treated with air ANEP tended to degrade in color over the
      entire area of the leaf. Occasionally, samples stored for 0.5 hr
      showed no discoloration; however, all samples recovered after 0.5
      h of storage had high levels of E. coli O157:H7 still surviving on
      the leaf. Refrigerated samples tended to show a greater crispness
      than samples stored at room temperature. This observation suggests
      that spinach leaves should be placed in a refrigerated environment
      as soon as possible after harvest in order to lessen quality
      degradation when treated with ANEP. Tests are still underway to
      assess physical quality changes in the leaves. Particularly, tests
      need to be conducted to determine the color change of untreated
      leaves after similar storage periods.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The treatment method utilized in this study of spinach was
      a scenario in which maximum concentrations of ozone and nitrous
      oxides could be produced without causing further heating of
      electrodes. While this method shows effective reductions of
      spoilage organisms and pathogens, changes in the protocol may need
      to be made in order to maintain quality of leaves, or any other
      produce, while still reducing microorganisms to safe levels.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The results of this experimental study suggest that an ANEP
      treatment system may be capable of reducing spoilage organisms and
      pathogens, such as E. coli O157:H7, on prepackaged, ready-to-eat
      spinach leaves. This means that spinach leaves, or nearly any
      produce, can be packaged prior to treatment, avoiding the
      possibility of cross-contamination. The packaged produce could be
      treated with ANEP at the packaging facility and then shipped to
      market. During shipment, spoilage organisms would be reduced and
      pathogens would be eliminated, with no residual chemicals or
      gases. Products would arrive at the grocery store safer and
      fresher.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In contrast to free-air or moving air techniques, a
      substantial fraction of the reactive species produced in the ANEP
      may be caused to be formed and retained within the sample
      container. Apart from being an efficient use of the power devoted
      to ionization, the reactive species formed within the container
      remain within the container until they become neutralized by
      natural chemical processes. As such, the reactive species created
      may be expected to remain in proximity to the object to be treated
      for a longer period of time than when the object has not been
      packaged. Personnel are not exposed to the ANEP products directly.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Informal experiments were performed using lettuce, tomato,
      apple, both whole and sliced, cranberries, bologna slices, skin,
      eggs, both individually and in a carton, plant seeds, and a glass
      pill bottle, with pills inside. All of the test samples were
      placed in a plastic bag of suitable size, similarly to the
      approach used with the spinach samples. The glass pill bottle was
      also treated as the container itself.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Generally there were two configurations of packaging used.
      For the individual eggs and the apple, as an example, the storage
      bag was placed in the DBD apparatus such that the sample was
      disposed between the electrode plates as shown in FIG. 2A. In
      other examples, the sample was not disposed between the electrode
      plates, so that the electrode plates could be brought physically
      closer together as shown in FIG. 2B. The treatment with the sample
      “in-field” may expose the sample to direct, short term, ionization
      products, whereas treatment with the sample “out-of-field” may
      limit the exposure to longer lifetime ionization products.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] For purposes of visualization of the ANEP created, a helium
      (He) fill was used in some experiments, as the voltage gradient
      needed for He ionization is about one tenth of that needed for air
      or oxygen as working gasses. As the particular experimental
      apparatus was limited to about 18 kV and 60 Hz, the He MAP
      permitted visualization of effects which were likely to be
      obtained in air or O2 mixtures using higher voltages and greater
      electrode spacings than in the spinach experiments described
      previously, and where in-field exposure would occur.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] The ionization characteristics of other noble gases such as
      Ar and Xe is similar to He at near atmospheric pressure. While the
      visualization MAP was a relatively pure noble gas, observations of
      gas mixtures comprising a smaller amount of noble gas and other
      gases such as O2, N2, CO2 and H20 exhibited similarly lowered
      ionization energy requirements. This may arise from the noble gas
      forming a glow discharge and providing seed paths for the
      ionization of some or all of the remaining constituent gases. So,
      either the applied voltage may be decreased, or the DBD gap
      increased. That is, the product of the applied voltage and the gap
      distance needed to create an ANEP would be reduced with respect to
      a MAP that did not use a noble gas as a constituent. Observations
      of an ANEP with He as the MAP were made at 18 KV and a gap of 10
      cm; a similar effect may be expected with a MAP where He is a
      constituent. This means that the object to be treated may be
      placed directly between the electrode plate and the dielectric
      barrier, even in the case of a head of lettuce.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A brief series of experiments was conducted to evaluate the
      required voltage gradient for a working gas having a noble gas as
      a component gas. The same experimental arrangement as for the egg
      example was used, except that there was no object to be treated
      within the container.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The minimum voltage gradients needed for the creation of an
      ANEP, based on working gas composition, were determined to be:<br>
      <br>
      [0077] 100% He—4.5 kV/in;<br>
      <br>
      [0078] 50% He/50% air—16.8 kV/in;<br>
      <br>
      [0079] 10% He/90% air—24 kV/in; and<br>
      <br>
      [0080] 100% air—43.2 kV/in.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Since the voltage gradient needed to create an ANEP in a
      working gas having a noble gas component is less than the voltage
      gradient needed in air, the ANEP may be created in the storage
      volume without the likelihood of a plasma discharge occurring in
      the region surrounding the storage volume. That is, a direct
      discharge between the plates of the DBD apparatus would require a
      higher voltage than is needed to create the ANEP within the
      storage volume. In addition to increasing the distance between the
      plates that can be used for a fixed apparatus voltage, a noble gas
      component of the working gas would permit the entire storage area
      to be located between the plates of the DBD apparatus and the ANEP
      created inside the entire storage volume not occupied by the
      object without creating ozone in the free air space surrounding
      the package.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Providing that the available voltage is sufficient to
      produce an ANEP plasma within the package, only a small percentage
      of the working gas need be a noble gas such as He, Ar, or Xe, to
      reduce the ionization voltage gradient within the package to less
      than that of the surrounding air. Since a 10% He component of the
      working gas reduced the ionization gradient by almost a factor of
      two, perhaps 5% or less may reduce the relative ionization
      potential within the package with respect to the surrounding
      environment so as to permit the ANEP generation to be confined
      within the package, yet permit the entire package to be subject to
      the dielectric-barrier-discharge effect. The specific percentage
      of noble gas in the working gas mixture will depend on the
      apparatus geometry, the effects of the objects in the storage
      volume, and the other constituent gases. However, the specific
      values can be determined by experimental studies.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Where the breakdown voltage gradients in the storage volume
      and in the surrounding air are essentially the same, the electrode
      area of the DBD is generally selected so as not to be large enough
      to produce an ANEP in the entire storage volume, as there is the
      risk that a more substantial discharge would occur in the air
      environment. Such discharges result in reactive species
      generation, to which personnel would be exposed, and may also
      result in pinholes in the storage volume surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] Where food is the object to be treated, the object may be
      considered as a dielectric. Although the dielectric may be
      imperfect, the losses are likely to be small at low frequencies.
      The voltage distribution between the electrodes of the DBD will be
      modified by the presence of the object so that the effective
      voltage gradient in the working gas gap between the dielectric of
      the DBD apparatus and the object is increased. This may further
      decrease the voltage that may need to be applied in order to
      initiate ANEP plasma.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] In another aspect, it seems likely that the working voltage
      may be decreased after the ANEP plasma has been initiated. The
      selection of gas mixtures may depend on the product and packaging
      characteristics as each type of product may have an optimal MAP,
      treatment time, storage conditions, or the like. A person of skill
      in the art would understand that a series of optimization
      experiments would be conducted to obtain the optimum parameters in
      each case.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] FIG. 3 shows an example of two eggs, enclosed in a plastic
      bag subject to in-field ANEP exposure with He as the MAP working
      gas. The filamentary nature of the DBD discharge is clearly seen,
      with the streamers terminating on the eggs and on the package. A
      more diffuse discharge is present in the region between the DBD
      electrodes where there is no egg. The specific arrangement of
      streamers would depend on the surface characteristics of the
      object as a dielectric, such as roughness, contaminants and the
      like, and that of the container, and may differ for different
      products to be treated. The streamers appear to be preferentially
      formed between the DBD electrodes and DBD dielectric and the egg,
      where the egg acts as a dielectric object disposed between the
      plates. This result appears qualitatively consistent with the
      voltage gradients that would obtain in the region without an ANEP
      present.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] An apple was also treated in a He MAP atmosphere, similarly
      to the egg sample shown in FIG. 3, so as to visualize the process.
      The apple was located between the plates of the DBD apparatus, and
      ionization of the He MAP was possible at the 15 KV potential due
      to the lower ionization voltage required. After exposure, the
      apple was removed from the bag and distinctly smelled of ozone.
      This may arise from the property of apples that about 20 percent
      of the volume thereof is formed by small air sacs. The ozone may
      be produced by ionization of the air in the sacs. Alternatively,
      the skin may be the region in which the ozone formation occurs. In
      either case, the formation of the ozone may lead to improvements
      in at least the surface cleanliness and storage life. Other fruits
      and vegetables may also benefit from this treatment. Treatment of
      sliced or diced product should also be practical. The use of He in
      the experiment and the absence of O2 in the gas mixture enabled
      the smell detection of the ozone produced within the apple or
      remaining on the surface thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] While the present experiments have focused on food
      products, the same techniques may be used for medical equipment or
      other objects to be rendered less contaminated or sterile within a
      package. Based on the observations of the ionization
      characteristics produced in the reported experiments, it was
      possible to recognize that placing plastic tubing between the
      electrodes, with the electrodes close to or contacting the tube,
      may result in forming an ANEP plasma within the tube, thus
      processing the interior portion of the tube. The exterior of the
      tube, enclosed in the overall packaging, may be processed by using
      the same or a greater electrode spacing so that an ANEP may be
      formed within a package containing the tubing. Alternatively,
      there should be a voltage gradient range where both processes may
      occur with a single electrode spacing. Other gas mixtures may be
      used in medical equipment processing, which may not be considered
      appropriate for consumable products. A variety of medical devices,
      including metallic devices may be similarly treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In the previous examples, the bag was closed, and remained
      closed during the treatment and the storage. However, depending on
      the objective of the treatment, and the desired after storage
      conditions, the bag may be punctured, opened, perforated, or the
      like. Depending on the specific apparatus configuration, the bag
      may be partially ventilated with holes. This may permit the
      generation of an ANEP plasma jet in the bag or package, similar to
      that being developed as thrusters in avionics.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] FIGS. 4 A and B illustrate a configuration where a bag 500
      containing an object to be treated 200 has apertures and the DBD
      has at least one electrode 420 that is not dielectric coated or
      isolated. The dielectric 440 is disposed between the exposed
      electrode 420 and the lower electrode 430 so that an ANEP is
      formed in the region of the surface of the dielectric 440 and
      terminating at the exposed electrode 420. In such an example, the
      processes at the instantaneous anode and the cathode electrodes
      may not be the same, and a person of skill in the art would expect
      a plasma jet to be generated. Even when the bag does not have
      apertures 510, the asymmetrical nature of the ANEP generation may
      lead to gas currents. The gas currents associated with such a jet
      or asymmetrical ANEP generation, produced internal to the bag,
      could be effective in distributing the reaction products
      throughout the bag, and mitigating a heat rise in the bag so that
      a more intense discharge may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] FIG. 4C illustrates a situation where the DBD apparatus may
      be used to process objects that have been stored in a
      substantially dielectric container, such as a cardboard box. The
      interior of the box may be sealed with a plastic layer or a foil
      layer, although this is not needed in all applications. The
      electrodes 620 and 630 are protected from excessive discharge
      current by the dielectric layers 640 and 650, and the electrodes
      are disposed at an approximately right angle to each other, and
      placed along the edge of the container so that the ANEP is formed
      in the interior angle therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The term bag has been used to represent the enclosure,
      container, treatment volume or storage volume in which the object
      is treated and subsequently stored. However, this should be
      understood to represent any dielectric material compatible with
      the treatment process, and could be a bottle, a vial, an opaque
      plastic food tray sealed with a thin transparent film, or the
      like. The objects to be processed need not be dielectric, as
      metallic objects could be exposed as well. The metal surfaces
      would likely behave similarly to the metal surface that is not
      covered with a dielectric in case where only one of the electrodes
      is dielectric protected. Thus, the apparatus and technique may be
      used to sterilize or otherwise decontaminate objects such as
      medical supplies, including surgical instruments, syringes, and
      the like so that they do not need to be removed from the packaging
      after treatment and until immediately prior to use. One may repeat
      the sterilization process in the hospital or physician's office
      prior to opening the packaging for further suppressing
      contaminants or pathogens. It should be noted that the dielectric
      forming the container may be used as the dielectric barrier of the
      DBD, providing that the electrical characteristics thereof prevent
      dielectric breakdown.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] As may be expected, the ozone concentration increases with
      the time duration of ANEP generation, being dependent, for each
      reactive species, on the details of the recombination process.
      FIG. 5 shows the results of tests where the ozone concentration
      was measured as a function of the duration of ANEP generation.
      Preliminary tests at higher voltages suggest that an increase in
      the rate of reactive species generation may be possible, and that
      the electrode gap may also be increased.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Thus, objectives of the treatment of an object using
      in-storage-volume ANEP generation may vary depending on the
      particular circumstance, ranging from improving the storage
      characteristics by reducing surface contamination, reducing the
      number of colony forming units (CFU) of bacteria related to
      spoilage or species that are human pathogens, sterilization of the
      food or object, or the like. Each circumstance will determine the
      gas composition, plasma concentration and exposure time that may
      be appropriate.<br>
