      ...predicts a new propulsion method based on a unique
      gravito-inertial effect (discussed in Chapter 13 of the book). The
      BSM-SG suggests a successful physical model of the underlying
      structure of the physical vacuum called a Cosmic Lattice (CL),
      which also permits unveiling the structure of the elementary
      particles, including the electron (see the article in Physics
      Essays, v.16, No. 2, p. 184-195, (2003)).<br>
      <br>
      After a few year research on the effects of the properly activated
      neutral plasma, I was able to demonstrate a successful motion
      experiment based on a unique gravito-inertial effect, predicted by
      BSM-SG theory. It is achieved by a proper modulation the
      parameters of the physical vacuum, in which a quantum mechanical
      interactions occur between the oscillating electrons and the
      oscillating Cosmic Lattice nodes. The applied technical approach
      called a “Heterodyne Method” allows accessing the very high
      Compton frequency 1.236x10^20 Hz (which is found to be an
      important parameter of the Cosmic Lattice node) by a lower
      frequency activation technique. The propulsion is caused by a
      unique gravito-inertial effect, which permits obtaining a force
      field as a result of unidirectional change of the gravitational
      (and inertial) mass of the object and the gas molecules in the
      activated zone of surrounding space. The physical phenomenon is
      called Stimulated Anomalous Reaction to Gravity (SARG) Effect. The
      technical realization is not based on ion wind so it should not be
      confused with the electrogravity. The experiment was reported and
      demonstrated on the 26 Annual Meeting of the Society of Scientific
      Exploration, May 30 –June 2, 2007 East Lansing, MI, USA.
      (www.scientificexploration.org).<br>
      <br>
      Note: While the glow discharge has been investigated by many
      researchers, nobody so far envisioned its signature for
      modification of the gravitational and inertial mass. This is not
      explainable from the currently accepted concept about space. The
      physics of this phenomenon and its potential is unveiled for a
      first time by the BSM-SG Unified theory.<br>

      <b>Dr. Stoyan Sarg - Sargoytchev</b> is a Bulgarian born Canadian.
      He holds engineering diploma and PhD in Physics in the field of
      space research. From 1976 to 1990 he was involved in space
      projects sponsored by the program Intercosmos coordinated by the
      former Soviet Union.· He participated also a collaborative project
      with the European Space Agency. For his pioneering work he was
      rewarded with medals from Intercosmos, Russia and Bulgaria. In
      1990 he was invited as a visiting scientist by Cornel University
      and worked in Arecibo Observatory, P.R. on a Lidar project funded
      by the NSF (USA). This was the place where the first SETI (Search
      for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) program was operated before
      1985 using the world largest radiotelescope – radar. In 1991 he
      immigrated to Canada, where he worked on projects coordinated by
      the Canadian Space Agency. Since 2002 he is with the York
      University, Toronto, Canada. He has over 50 publications in peer
      review journals and a few patents related to space research.<br>
      <br>
      During his 30-year work in space research Dr. Sarg was aware about
      some aerial phenomena that are unsolved mysteries for contemporary
      physics. After extensive study the history of physics and
      reviewing thousand of articles in different fields of physics he
      realized that there is a problem in the current understanding of
      space. Working extensively on this issue he arrived to a
      challenging new idea about the space-time, matter and gravitation.
      For a few years of intensive but morally awarded work he was able
      to develop and publish in 2001 his treatise “Basic Structures of
      Matter - Supergravitation Unified Theory” (BSM-SG). Dr. Sarg wrote
      three books in English and one in Bulgarian language. A book
      review of his theoretical monograph was published in Physics in
      Canada journal, v. 62, No. 4, p. 206-207, (2006). His work
      provided for a first time the missing physical relation between
      the EM field and gravity. This permitted him to analyze the
      enigmatic UFO phenomenon from a new physical point of view. One of
      the major predictions of the BSM-SG theory is the possibility to
      change the gravitational and inertial mass of a specifically
      design spacecraft. Being also experimentalist Dr. Sarg discovered
      an unique gravito-inertial effect by a laboratory experiments.
      This discovery, understandable only from the BSM-SG point of view,
      was reported at the Annual meetings of the Society for Scientific
      Explorations in 2007 and 2008 in Boulder, Colorado and also at the
      Annual meeting of the Natural Philosophy Alliance, 2010, Long
      Beach, California.· His recent book is titled “Field Propulsion by
      Control of Gravity – Theory and Experiments” (Amazon.com). The
      described propulsion mechanism is completely different from the
      jet propulsion. It is invoked by EM activated plasma and does not
      need combustion or jet. The publications and experiments of Dr.
      Sarg are widely discussed in Internet. He believes that his
      discovery will contribute to the further advances in
      interplanetary and deep space travels.<br>

      &nbsp;Dear Friends, Yesterday I got something like a Hutchison
      effect unintentionally during my experiments on the
      gravito-inertial effect. I wanted to make some filtering in the
      circuit that activated the plasma and I decided to use a
      ferromagnetic road OD 0.8"" L 8"wounded by one layer of a wire
      with thick isolation. I got two such rods a year ago by one friend
      and have wound one by hand and obtain inductance of 6.5 mH. During
      the experiment for which I applied a High voltage (about 30 kV,
      but low current, a spark appeared between one turn of the wire on
      the rod and the ground and I turned the power off. I usually stay
      about 2 m from the experiment. When I took the wired ferromagnetic
      rod for a big my surprise I see that it got curved. You could not
      curve such rod even at few thousands of degree, but it happened
      just for a second or two. The dissipated power on that place was
      not more that 15 W for 2 sec. The deviation of one end is 5 mm.
      The spark point, which is visible from the picture is at 1.7""
      from the end and almost at the center of the obtained curvature.
      The rod has internal whole with ID 0.5. and from the curved side
      it also got an ellipticity of 1mm. I did not doubt that the
      Hutchison effect is a real physical phenomenon and I had even
      explanation by my theory. Now I am more convinced that during my
      experiments I modulate the space parameters (physical vacuum). It
      is equivalent to say - a temporal creation of artificial space
      curvature. What happened is that the modulation that I obtained by
      the plasma around the actuator (now enclosed in a cylinder) during
      the spark has been suddenly transferred to the spark place. It
      changes the binding conditions between the atoms in the solid
      object. So now I have my own sample of Hutchison effect.<br>

      <br>
      Yesterday morning I got a phone call from Stoyan, a physics
      research scientist, who asked me to come over to his lab in the
      basement of Petrie at York U. to<br>
      see the unexpected effects of an experiment he performed the
      previous day before our radio/TV interview with John Hutchison.<br>
      <br>
      Below is a quick e-mail Stoyan sent to me and others that same
      morning which describes what happened. I can confirm that I
      examined the wire wrapped ferric rod (a cylindrical tube), one of
      two rods that he obtained from Ole in Ottawa, and found that it
      was indeed slightly bent and somewhat flattened at one end.<br>
      <br>
      Stoyan believes this "jellificaton" of what was otherwise a very
      straight and rigid and brittle ferric rod was an accidental
      reproduction of one of the many<br>
      Hutchison Effects. Stoyan's experiment may be the first
      independent replication and identification of the Hutchison Effect
      in a research physics lab in Canada.<br>
      <br>
      Stoyan returns from the Society for Scientific Exploration
      conference in Colorado later this month where he will give a talk
      and present his findings and demonstrate the amazing propulsion
      technologies of ET flying saucers based on a new science to the
      scientific community. I think we should invite Stoyan<br>
      to give the first public talk and demo on 'Cosmic Horizons' about
      his new theory which not only predicts but explains the observed
      Hutchison Effects and<br>
      other amazing but still not understood effects that promise to
      make space travel to the stars and a free and unlimited source of
      energy from the quantum<br>
      vaccuum a reality in our lifetime.<br>
      <br>
      Stoyan heard and saw our show on ThatRadio.com/ThatChannel.com on
      Thursday night and is prepared to make his first public disclosure
      of his incredible findings.<br>
      <br>
      A colleague of ours, a retired professor and radio astronomer from
      St. Mary's University in Halifax has finished editing Stoyan's
      book on the new (alien?)<br>
      science and the clearer and more readible edition of this truly
      revolutionary scientific work should be available to everyone
      soon.<br>

      The propulsion method is based on a gravito-inertial phenomenon
      predicted by the Basic Structures of Matter - Supergavitation
      Unified Theory (BSM-SG), the practical demonstration of which is
      called a Stimulated Anomalous Reaction to the Gravity (SARG)
      effect. The SARG effect is a unidirectional change of the
      gravito-inertial mass of an object by modulation the parameters of
      the physical vacuum. The suggested technique employs an
      asymmetrical envelope of EM activated neutral plasma. The result
      is a unique force field distinguished from the reactive jet
      propulsion by lack of throwing mass and effect of reduced
      gravito-inertial mass of the spacecraft and the surrounding gas
      molecules. This means a less power for acceleration and less
      turbulence when moving in a planetary atmosphere. A small scale
      SARG effect is verified by laboratory experiments. A unique field
      shield protection against micrometeorites, also predicted by
      BSM-SG theory, can be achieved by emission of properly space and
      time correlated EM field packets and superluminal waves, known
      also as X-waves. KEYWORDS: massless propulsion, space drive, field

          We describe a simple experiment to validate the principle of
          light isotropy. The method is based on measurement of the
          ratio between refractive indices of two different optical
          media by using a collimated beam. The method exploits the
          speed-of-light dependence of light propagating at an angle
          across optical interfaces. The experiment provides a means to
          test for light anisotropy with respect to a preferred
          reference frame, for example, determined from measurements of
          the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropy. Presently, the
          operational management of the GPS system applies corrections
          indicating the existence of a universal clock. Other
          researchers have identified evidence of altitude dependence
          for the speed-of-light and other speed variation effects.
          These phenomena do not fully comply with the definition of the
          inertial frame according to Special Relativity. Previous tests
          of the speed of light may be categorized into one-way or
          two-way dependency tests. Two-way tests, such as Michelson and
          Morley's original experiment average a round trip velocity
          and, consequently, can only provide limited bounds for some
          anisotropic effects. One-way tests, such as the experiment
          described here, measuring the speed of light in a single
          direction may be designed with significantly increased
          sensitivity to time-dependent variations in light propagation.
          They may also be designed to be resilient to clock and
          wavelength variation errors. Our preliminary results indicate
          a time-dependent variation of the speed of light that is not
          correlated with CMB anisotropy but is consistent with
          anisotropy reported by other investigators. The identification
          of an absolute or preferred reference <br>
          frame would provide new experimental evidence that may
          constrain theories that seek to unify gravity with the other
          fundamental forces or improve the standard model.<br>

            ABSTRACT</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The Basic Structures of Matter - Supergravitation Unified
          Theory (BSM-SG) is based on an alternative concept of the
          physical vacuum [1,2,3,4]. At the basic level the theory
          suggests a physical model of two fundamental particles
          associated with the Planck’s scale parameters (time and
          length). In pure empty space, as assumed precondition of the
          physical vacuum, they interact by close range forces according
          to a law called Supergravitation (SG) and congregate in
          formations possessing vibration properties with embedded
          frequency ratio equal to the fine structure constant, ~ 1/137.
          Such formations are embedded in the superfine structure of the
          physical vacuum and the elementary particles. In the physical
          vacuum space, the SG forces are strong at atomic distances.
          The suggested model works well in different fields of Physics.
          It provides a relation between the electrical, magnetic and
          gravitational fields with new understanding of the gravity and
          inertia. The unveiled oscillating properties of the electron
          [5] permit understanding the physical mechanism of quantum
          mechanical interaction between the electrons in EM activated
          plasma and the physical vacuum. The new understanding about
          the physical vacuum allows predicting a possibility of
          unidirectional change the gravitational force acting on a
          material object. By proper modulation the parameters of the
          physical vacuum, the gravito-inertial mass of a specifically
          designed spacecraft would be reduced, so it could be
          accelerated with less energy. Technically the new space drive
          mechanism could be realized by electromagnetically activated
          neutral plasma surrounding the spacecraft. In such approach
          secondary effects, such as optical glow, hissing noise, light
          bending and disturbed propagation of EM waves and Earth
          magnetic field would take place in the surrounding zone. In
          atmospheric environment, the spacecraft may exhibit a reduced
          turbulence since the mass of the air molecule should be also
          affected. The predicted space drive should work also in a deep
          space. In this case a gas cloud surrounding the spacecraft is
          necessary. Initial laboratory experiments confirm some of the
          predicted effects, such as, weak propulsion, optical glow,
          hissing noise and reduced turbulence. Extensive research in
          this new field is still necessary.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Dr. Stoyan Sarg (Sargoytchev) graduated electrical engineering
          in 1971 and defended PhD in Physics in 1984, both in Bulgaria.
          From 1974 to 1990 he actively participated in number of space
          research projects coordinated by the program Intercosmos
          established by the former USSR. From 1990 to October 1991 he
          worked in Arecibo Observatory, PR, as a visiting scientist of
          Cornell University. In 1991 he moved to Canada and worked in
          space research projects with ISTS (later CRESTech), University
          of Western Ontario and York University, where he still holds a
          position. Apart of his space research activity his major
          theoretical work is the Basic Structures of Matter –
          Supergravitation Unified theory. His primary interest
          resulting from his theory is in gravity and inertia.<br>
