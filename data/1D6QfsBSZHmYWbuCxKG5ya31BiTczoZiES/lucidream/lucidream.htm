      <small> </small><big>This page describes a number of lucid dream
        induction techniques. It is recommended that you be able to
        recall <i>at least</i> one dream per night in order to maximize
        the effectiveness of these methods. </big><small> </small>

          <p><big>Certain elements are common to many of the
              lucidity-inducing techniques discussed later in this
              chapter. To better understand these techniques, these
              common components will be discussed first.</big></p>

          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>An element shared by many of the techniques is sleep
              interruption. Sleep interruption is the process of
              purposefully awakening during your normal sleep period and
              falling asleep a short time later (10–60 minutes). This
              can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock
              to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you. If
              you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it
              can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you
              to get out of bed to turn it off. Other biorhythm-based
              options involve drinking lots of fluid ( particularly
              water or tea, a known diuretic ) prior to sleep, forcing
              one to get up to urinate.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Sleep interruption is a natural part of the MILD
              technique (described below) which trains you to arise
              immediately after your dreams end.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <h3><big><small><span class="mw-headline"

          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>If you have trouble initially falling asleep, avoid
              drinking water for about an hour before going to bed.
              Otherwise, you may find yourself running to the bathroom,
              disrupting any attempts at lucidity. Also, try to avoid
              caffeine and sugar before bed. However, depending on your
              sensitivity, caffeine may only stimulate your mind as
              opposed to your body. This extra grip on consciousness
              could be helpful in inducing lucid dreams. Exercising
              during the day is an excellent way of preparing your body
              for sleep. However, be sure to not exercise inside the
              three hours before bedtime, as your body will be
              stimulated for a short time afterwards. The morning or
              afternoon is the best time for this.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>If you still have difficulty getting to sleep, try
              reading about lucid dreaming just before going to sleep.
              Your subconscious will likely absorb this information,
              increasing your chances of experiencing a lucid dream. If
              you <i>do</i> decide to read before going to sleep, keep
              a lamp next to your bed as physically getting up to turn
              off the lights may reawaken your body.</big></p>

          <h3><big><small><span class="mw-headline" id="Reality_checks">Reality










                  checks</span></small><span class="mw-editsection"><span
                  class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span><span
                  class="mw-editsection-bracket"></span></span></big></h3>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>A reality check is a test you can perform to see if
              you're dreaming or awake. It might seem odd to test
              reality when you are sure that you're awake, but making a
              habit out of one or more of these reality checks will
              hugely increase your chances of having a lucid dream. If,
              say, you hold your nose and try to breathe in through it
              several times throughout the day then you're very likely
              to dream about doing it. And when you dream about
              performing a reality check, then of course the results
              should come out differently, in this case you'll find that
              you are somehow breathing in through your closed nostrils.
              You'll know that you're dreaming, and be able to take
              lucid control!</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>So here are some reality checks. You should be
              familiar with the entire list even if you only use a few.</big></p>

          <p><big>Choose a few reality checks which you will do
              regularly. Take them seriously, do not assume you are
              awake (even when you know you are). If you practice
              performing these checks very thoroughly while awake, then
              you're more likely to perform them thoroughly while
              dreaming. You should <b>always</b> carry out more than
              one reality check. If you find that it is not a dream,
              look around you and think of what would be different if it
              were a dream. If you do this it will make it more likely
              that you will do a reality check in a dream.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Apart from doing reality checks throughout the day,
              you also need to do a reality check immediately after you
              wake up. This helps you become lucid in false awakenings,
              when you dream that you have woken up but in fact are
              still dozing. Using a digital alarm clock or mobile phone
              display to do a Reading check, every single time you wake
              up, is a quick and reliable way to catch false awakenings.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>If you have trouble bringing reality checks into your
              dreams then before going to bed imagine yourself in a
              dream, noticing odd details and doing a reality check.
              Then do a reality check in real life. If you do this a few
              times before bed you will find that you will do it more
              often in dreams.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>If you are in a situation where you cannot do a
              reality check, such as at a public speaking, try to do one
              as soon as possible. You can do some reality checks very
              discreetly, such as looking at some text on a sign. If you
              start to say “well, I can't do a reality check now” you
              should not be surprised when you make this mistake in a
              dream!</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big><b>Which reality checks are best?</b></big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>When selecting reality checks, the most important
              properties of a reality check are <i>reliability</i>, <i>speed</i>,
              and <i>discreetness</i>.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <ul>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big>The <b>reliability</b> of each reality check is
                how likely you are to recognize the dream-sign's results
                as showing that you are dreaming <b>once you do them in
                  a dream</b>. It changes for each person but some
                reality checks are overall more accurate than others.
                The figures in the table above are <i>rough only</i>
                and differ for each person.</big></li>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big>It is important for a reality check to be <b>fast</b>.
                It wastes dream time if you have to search around for a
                book or (perhaps worse) a mirror. Plus, it could also
                give your subconsciousness more time to produce
                real-life results, especially if you believe that the
                check will give real-life results.</big></li>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big>Third, a reality check should be <b>discreet</b>;
                that is, it should not draw too much attention to you
                when you do it in the waking world. Suddenly jumping in
                the air or trying to walk through a wall as a reality
                check could cause much embarrassment!</big></li>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big>Fourth, a reality check should not have "false
                positives". These occur when the reality check shows you
                are dreaming in real life. When you get a dream result,
                do another reality check to be sure!</big></li>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big>A final important note is whether or not a reality
                check should have "false negatives". These occur when a
                reality check shows you are in real life when you are
                actually dreaming. If you think you may be dreaming,
                keep doing tests until you prove yourself right!</big></li>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          </ul>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>On the table above, these are scored <b>out of 5</b>.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big><b>I have trouble remembering to do reality checks
                throughout the day. What reminders can I use?</b></big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>You are lucky to have an interesting day and forget
              about lucid dreaming! You can tag your mind to remember
              dreaming when you think of certain things, like your
              friend or your homework. It isn't advisable to explicitly
              write “reality check” or “lucid” on your hand, as this
              could create an over dependence on this reminder, which
              may not exist in a dream. However, you might want to just
              draw a dot or small circle on your hand. This should be
              enough to remind you to do a reality check.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Try putting a little label on your clock, mobile
              phone, or watch, reminding yourself to do a reality check.
              (Some weird colors will make it more noticeable and it
              will take longer for you to get used to it and ignore it.)
              If you check these regularly during the course of your
              waking day, you will be doing lots of reality checks.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>A simple coffee mug with a reminder such as "Are you
              dreaming?" printed on it or random alarms can also serve
              well, but try not to become too dependent on them. You can
              find examples of these at <span class="external text">Byte










                Red.com</span> and <span class="external text">LD4All</span>.com</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Another technique is to write down three things you do
              regularly in a day. Examples include hearing your name,
              going through a doorway, turning on a TV, beginning to
              read a book, or seeing a stranger. In the morning, choose
              three such events and intend to do a reality check
              whenever they happen in the following day.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big><b>I did a reality check in a dream but it said that I
                was not dreaming. What went wrong?</b></big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Some reality checks work perfectly for some people and
              awfully for others. These are mostly the light switches
              one and the hands one. If you find that the light switch
              works or that your hands are perfectly normal, you need to
              change to a different technique.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big><b>I did a reality check in a dream but I did not
                quite realize I was dreaming. What went wrong?</b></big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>An example of this is looking into a mirror and seeing
              some huge boils or a gray mist on your reflection and not
              realizing that you are dreaming. This is rare if you
              actually intended to look into the mirror as a reality
              check. You need to be more careful when doing your reality
              checks in real life or pick more reliable reality checks
              which show more obviously that you are dreaming. Also try
              to pick reality checks that are easy to do. For example,
              don't rely the Time Reality Check if you never wear a
              watch, and don't pick the Mirror Reality Check if you
              rarely look in the mirror during the day or you know that
              you won't find a mirror in your dream.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Another good remedy for this problem (and a good
              practice in general) is to perform two or three reality
              checks at a time. The Time Reality Check, for example, can
              be easily combined with attempting to push one hand
              through another. Or, for those with glasses, testing your
              ability to read text fits naturally with checking for
              "perfect eyesight w/o glasses".</big></p>

          <p><big>When you read through these techniques, remember that
              different techniques work for different people. There is
              no “best technique” and most techniques could be used to
              have 2–5 lucid dreams every night! You could have several
              lucid dreams in a night, but you will not know it unless
              you remember them!</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>However, you will probably want some advice as to
              which technique you should try first. Consider whether you
              want to use a method which starts from a dream or a method
              which starts from being awake.<sup>*</sup> If you master a
              technique which starts from being awake, you will
              eventually be able to have lucid dreams on demand when you
              sleep. For other techniques, you have to rely on your luck
              to give you lucid dreams after you have done your
              technique. Here are some advantages and disadvantages for
              specific techniques:</big></p>

              time (such as reading about lucid dreaming), but it is not
              required. This is best combined with other techniques;
              many people have amazing results with a MILD/WBTB
              combination. The WBTB technique significantly increases
              your chances of a lucid dream, and using MILD (see below)
              in conjunction increases your success rate if you are
              planning to sleep an hour or more after your WBTB session.
              However, you might need plenty of sleep time and therefore
              you may only be able to use it on weekends.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>If you are sleeping too deeply to become lucid, then
              you can modify this technique. Try returning to sleep
              somewhere different than where you usually sleep, e.g. on
              a couch, a different bed, or even on the floor. If you are
              unable to do this, try changing the way you sleep, e.g.
              try sleeping with a lighter blanket or reversing the
              orientation of your body while in the bed (that is,
              swapping head and feet). Do this in order to teach your
              body that these different surroundings mean you want to
              have a more conscious sleep rather than a deeper sleep. In
              the beginning, different surroundings will also make you
              more alert, which can heighten your level of consciousness
              during sleep.</big></p>

                cannot pull myself together enough to get up and out of

          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Put a bright piece of paper on the wall or ceiling so
              that you will see it when you wake up. Other stimuli could
              be a hot water bottle, a light turned on under your bed,
              or an alarm clock. A good technique is to place an alarm
              clock out of arm's reach so that you are compelled to
              physically get up from bed and turn it off. If this is
              still insufficient to restore consciousness, try making a
              note of your intentions to remain awake and place the note
              on your alarm clock. After you get a lucid dream with this
              method, you'll find it easier and easier to get out of bed
              because you'll have more motivation.</big></p>

          <p><big>As you are falling asleep, suggest to yourself that
              you will have a lucid dream either that night or in the
              near future. You can use a mantra (such as “I will
              recognize that I'm dreaming”) if you want, but make sure
              you don't try too hard to get a lucid dream. Instead of

              instead of suggesting that you'll have a lucid dream,
              suggest that you'll remember your dreams when you wake up.
              You could also use a mantra with this, such as “When I
              wake up, I will remember what I dreamt”. Just be careful
              not to put too much intentional effort into the mantra —

          <p><big>MILD stands for “Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams",
              or sometimes, “Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream". The MILD
              technique was developed by Stephen LaBerge, and is
              described fully in his book <i>Exploring the World of
                Lucid Dreaming</i>.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>With the MILD technique, as you are falling asleep,
              you concentrate on your intention to <i>remember</i> to
              recognize that you are dreaming. Repeat a short mantra in
              your head, such as “Next time I'm dreaming, I will
              remember I'm dreaming”. Think about what this means (i.e.,
              that you want to remember that you are dreaming—in the
              same way you might go to a grocery store and suddenly
              remember that you need bread), and imagine that you are
              back in a dream you've had recently, but this time you
              recognize that you are dreaming. For example, if you
              recently dreamed of flying, imagine realizing that it is a
              dream because you are flying. Keep repeating and
              visualizing the mantra until you are sure that your
              intention is set in your mind or you fall asleep. If you
              stop repeating and visualizing the mantra, then still try
              to make sure the last thing in your mind before falling
              asleep is your intention to remember to recognize that you
              are dreaming.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>In general, the MILD technique can be practiced when
              you first go to bed at night, or after you have awakened
              from a dream during the night. If you practice the MILD
              technique after you have awakened from a dream, you should
              first run through the dream to ensure that you remember
              it. Some people find it helpful to jot down a few notes
              about their dream in their dream journal.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Once you have committed the dream to memory, go back
              to sleep and follow the steps above. But this time,
              visualize the dream you just had. Move through the dream
              in your mind until you encounter a dream-sign you
              originally missed. Now, instead of missing the dream-sign,
              imagine yourself recognizing it and becoming “lucid”.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Repeat this until you have fallen asleep. You <i>will</i>
              re-enter the dream, and you <i>will</i> recognize the

          <p><big>WILD stands for “Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream”, or
              “Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams” to refer to any
              technique that involves falling asleep consciously. These
              techniques are similar to self-hypnosis. Some people
              believe that WILDs are not actual dreams, but are instead
              <span class="extiw">astral projection</span>. Various
              detailed resources are available under that moniker.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>For most people, they are far easier to induce in the
              early morning after waking up or in afternoon naps, as the
              sleep cycle will continue with a REM period. Once you are
              experienced with inducing WILDs, you can try to induce
              them at other times.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>For WILDs to occur, it is best for your body to be
              completely relaxed. When you go back to bed, lie down
              comfortably. Now tense and relax your body, starting from
              your shoulders and working downwards, then back up to the
              face. This (or similar relaxation, meditation, or trance
              techniques) should make your body feel slightly heavy and
              relaxed.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>There are many different ways to induce WILDs, but
              they all involve simultaneously attempting to keep the
              mind aware while attempting to have the body fall asleep.
              A few techniques are detailed below.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>If you pay attention to your physical body while using
              these techniques, then you will likely enter sleep
              paralysis (which usually happens after you are already
              asleep) without losing conscious awareness of your body.
              You will get a tingling and buzzing sensation (this might
              be unpleasant). These sensations might be so strong that
              you feel that you will die (e.g., you might feel a choking
              sensation), but don't worry, this is perfectly safe! In
              fact, this process happens to you every time you sleep,
              you are just not conscious during it. Sometimes you can
              simply wait until you fall asleep straight into a lucid
              dream. However, if you do not fall asleep, and you become
              completely paralyzed (with the exception of your eyes), do
              not try to move. Imagine your dream hand (or spirit hand
              if you prefer) going up and leaving your physical hand
              behind. Now you should have two separate bodies, a dream
              one and a real one. Control your dream body only — if you
              control your real one, you will wake up. Now you can try
              to roll out of bed into your dream world (alternatively,
              you can get up and walk through a mirror, or sink into
              your bed). There is a possibility that after waking up
              from a dream that you initiated using this technique, you
              may still be paralyzed. If this phenomenon occurs, it may
              be accompanied by hallucinations. For example, you may
              wake up from a lucid dream that you started using one of
              the WILD techniques, and you will still be paralyzed. A
              dark and scary figure may approach your bed, and you are
              unable to move, shout, or scream. Folklores have often
              given a name to this phenomenon: American people call it
              Old Hag , Japanese people call it kanashibari, Korean
              people call it kawi nullida (being pressed by a pair of
              scissors), and in old French it was called <i>Cauquemare</i>,
              which was later transformed into the term <i>cauchemar</i>.</big></p>

          <p><big>This has been found to be very effective in many
              cases. However, it may lead to strange after effects, such
              as up to 15 dreams in one night, but otherwise, nothing
              harmful. This technique is as follows: When you go to
              sleep, ensure the room is completely dark. Then, with eyes
              closed, try to focus on the little dots that should appear
              to be moving on your eyelids. You will find that you can
              change their color at will. Continue focusing on these
              dots; make them dance around and form patterns and change
              colors, and eventually you should enter a Lucid Dream.
              This may take a little practice, but is usually very
              effective for summoning Lucid Dreams at will. Works better
              in conjunction with WBTB and other techniques mentioned
              above, but is still extraordinarily effective on its own.</big></p>

          <small> </small>
          <p><big>Stimulate your thinking patterns by constantly
              switching your attention. After doing this long enough,
              the images and sounds should begin to take a momentum on
              their own (this is called hypnagogic imagery), and may
              they get very strange and illogical. You should enter a
              dream at this point and quickly become lucid. Otherwise,
              you will eventually realize you have entered sleep
              paralysis consciously (see above). Because hypnagogic
              sleep paralysis involves full consciousness, dreaming can
              sometimes be frighteningly real. There is often a feeling
              of being flipped upside down, spun, or being tugged upon
              by an outside force. Hypnagogic hallucinations may also
              include strange auditory hallucinations, dark beings and
              flying. It is possible to observe waking reality while in
              a hypnagogic state, but this is limited to the sensations
              of your physical body. Most hypnagogic sleep paralysis
              states occur when sleeping face up. There is evidence that
              the tendency toward experiencing Hypnagogic sleep
              paralysis may be hereditary.</big></p>

          <p><big>Another technique is to count up to 100 in your head,
              optionally adding (for example) an “I'm dreaming” between
              each number. Alternatively, you can imagine stepping down
              stairs and reading each floor number, from 100 to 0. Try
              to make this image as vivid as possible — include not only
              what you see, but also what you hear, feel (touch the
              banister), and smell. At some point this image should
              continue into a dream or you will begin to get sleep
              paralysis as described above. It is easy to lose count,
              especially with counting up to 100 with an 'I'm dreaming'
              with each number. But stay focused: you are not going to
              sleep; your body is, and you must concentrate fully.</big></p>

          <small> </small>
          <p><big>This method is for people, who can hear the
              "tinnitus". The idea is pretty much the same as the other
              WILD methods, which is to remain conscious while entering
              the dream state. In order to use this method, you must
              sleep in a perfectly quiet place. You need to hear the
              inner buzzing sound inside your ears. Lay your body down
              and relax as much as possible while trying to hear the
              sound. If you are too tired, you will fall asleep too fast
              and it will be difficult to remain conscious - it this
              case you should combine it with WBTB. By time you realize
              that the buzzing sound will increase in intensity. This
              might frighten newcomers, but be assured - nothing bad is
              going to happen. No, you will not be deaf when you wake
              up, it’s perfectly safe! *It is just an effect caused by
              your brain is trying to change mode, from listening to the
              ambient sound, to listening to the sound of dreamland,
              which is not real sound but just electrical charge inputed
              to the part of the brain to create a sensation of hearing.
              By that time, you will enter the hypnagogic state. All you
              need to do is concentrate, do not be afraid or think of
              anything, just be still, and in time your dream body will
              float, separating from your physical body, and there you
              go, you arrive in the dreamworld.</big></p>

              even throughout the day - when you pay attention to them,
              but they shouldn't be heard much aloud if you are not in
              silence and concentrating on it - *as author said. The
              formula to hear it is quite simple: come into complete
              silence close your eyes and listen: is there only absolute
              silence or is there - something else? some...? do not
              create some sound just concentrate -&nbsp;:-) The best

          <p><big>Tinnitus is a condition termed for a hissing and
              whistling sound that one hears in his/her ears. It's a
              medical term for ringing in the ears. Several reasons lead
              to this irritating condition and the most common cause is
              the damage to the nerves located inside the ear. However,
              there are some other factors as well such as earwax
              buildup, exposure to loud noises, ear infections and
              certain medications. Remember, the first step in finding a
              natural care is to determine the actual cause of tinnitus.
              Some Facts about Tinnitus.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>The foremost thing to remember is that ringing in the
              ears is a symptom and not a disease. It's normal to a
              certain extent, however, the condition could be an
              indicator of a more serious condition. It's often related
              with hearing loss that is caused by aging. It can be a
              major nuisance when the ringing becomes very loud. The
              condition cannot be cured permanently but certainly can be
              eased.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big><b>Some Causes of Tinnitus</b></big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>As mentioned above, ringing in the ear has some
              related causes and the most common out of them are damage
              of the cochlea due to aging (known as presbycusis),
              infection of the ear, exposure to loud noises and eardrum
              rupture. Amazingly, it has also been observed that excess
              ear wax buildup can also lead to this condition. Also,
              then there's the overuse of aspirin. Though, it's a very
              efficient pain reliever, its ototoxic properties
              (resulting into the damage to the ear) can result in
              tinnitus and worsen the condition in those that already
              have this ailment.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Tinnitus can also be developed by the usage of
              antibiotics, particularly amino glycoside antibiotics (a
              powerful form of infection fighting drug) and quinine.
              Also, many studies have proven the relationship between
              tinnitus and stress. When the brain is under stress, it
              has a tendency to read ordinary as well as daily sounds as
              fearful. After this, the tinnitus develops or becomes
              worse. Thus, it's very important and critical to manage
              stress. And if that's not enough, there are other causes
              for tinnitus that are not that common but are quite
              serious: Some of them are:</big></p>

          <p><big><b>Treating Tinnitus</b></big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Putting in some hours with a therapist can really be
              beneficial and in several situations it's necessary to
              mental success even after the condition is alleviated.
              It's not easy to deal with anxiety and depression and
              knowing how to ignore the problem appropriately rather
              than indulging in it can be the best solution. It's also
              suggested to see a psychiatrist or psychologist who are
              experts with the patient suffering from the condition.
              This can be one of the <span class="external text">cures
                for tinnitus relief</span> and getting control over your
              mind can build up tolerance towards this condition which
              can also benefit you in dealing with other problems as
              well.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Masking the noise in your head can also provide you
              with a solution when you're trying to sleep or get rid of
              heavy waves of noise being produced. As tinnitus can
              appear loud in a silent room, leaving it on radio static
              can let you proper sleep. Remember, alleviating your
              tinnitus is only the cure for ringing in the ear as the
              condition can only be minimized and not completely cured.</big></p>

          <p><big>For the purpose of helping to retain your conscious
              awareness, slight physical discomfort is useful while
              performing any WILD technique. This prevents you from just
              drifting off to sleep. If you are lying down on your bed
              to do WILD and you are totally comfortable then your
              chances of going to sleep instead of remaining conscious
              are very high. The WILD technique relies on a form of deep
              trance induction, and many people who induce trances for
              other reasons rely on slight physical discomfort — for
              example the lotus position, or sitting in a hard-backed
              chair. Depending on your own preferences and your
              requirements of discomfort for success, you could choose
              from the following methods, arranged in ascending order of
              discomfort:</big></p>

          <small> </small>
          <p><big>To incubate a dream about a specific topic, you should
              first think of a phrase that summarizes that topic (e.g.,
              “I want to go to Atlantis.”). It may help to write the
              phrase down. If there is something you want to do in the
              dream, think of a phrase to summarize that too (e.g., “I
              want to watch Atlantis sink into the ocean.”). If you want
              to become lucid in the dream, then you should probably
              write something like “When I dream of [the topic], I will
              remember that I'm dreaming.” beneath your topic phrase.
              Immediately go to sleep and focus on your topic phrase.
              Visualize yourself dreaming about the topic and (if you
              want to become lucid) realizing that you are dreaming. If
              there is something specific you want to do in the dream,
              visualize yourself doing it once you become lucid (not
              very likely to work if you don't become lucid in the
              dream). Think about your phrase and topic (and intention
              to become lucid) as you fall asleep. Make sure that the
              last thing in your mind before falling asleep is your
              intention to (lucidly) dream about the topic you want to
              dream about. You might want to wake yourself up when the
              dream starts to fade so that you remember more of the
              dream; you can do this by ignoring your perception of the
              dream environment — the opposite of dream stabilization
              techniques (just make sure you do a reality check when you
              wake up to make sure you are really awake).</big></p>

          <p><big>Dream-chaining or “chaining dreams” is a method to
              re-enter your dream <i>after you've woken up</i>. It can
              work for lucid and non-lucid dreams, but you will probably
              want to enter your dream lucidly.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Once you wake up from a dream (if you don't think you
              were dreaming before you woke up, it may not work well)
              you should stay still and keep your eyes closed. Small
              movements are okay, but the less movement, sensory
              stimulation, and less time awake, the better. Ideally, it
              should feel less like you've woken up, and more like
              you've taken a 30 second break from dreaming. Once you are
              prepared to go back to sleep, close your eyes and either
              visualize yourself back in your dream, or use the
              “spinning technique” given in the next chapter to imagine
              yourself spinning back “into” your dream. Spinning is a
              little faster than visualization. Be sure to maintain the
              fact that you are dreaming (unless you don't want to be
              lucid), or you may lose your lucidity while falling
              asleep. Once in the dream, stimulate your senses as early
              as possible (see the next chapter).</big></p>

          <p><big>VILD stands for “Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams”, or
              sometimes, “Visually Incubated Lucid Dream”. This
              technique has been perfected by Peter Harrison, known as
              Pedro on the <span class="external text">forums at
                ld4all.com</span>. You may wish to read <span
                class="external text">the main thread about the
                technique</span>. The version described here has been
              adapted slightly.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>First, make sure you are relaxed. You can use the
              relaxing technique mentioned in the description of the
              WILD technique. You can also imagine your brain emptying
              out and becoming sleepier. If you have a hard time falling
              asleep quickly, it should help to read a book (preferably
              about lucid dreaming) for a while before you go to sleep,
              until you feel very sleepy.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Now, you need to visualize a dream which you had
              prepared earlier. Here is an example of a prepared dream:</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <dl>
            <small> </small><big> </big><dd><big>I am in a red room
                with one door. A friend next to me asks me to show them
                what a reality check is. I do my reality checks (which
                show that I am dreaming), tell them that I am dreaming,
                and head towards the door.</big></dd>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          </dl>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Make sure you know exactly what the dream would be
              like, such as which friend, the exact words they say, and
              which reality checks you do. Reality checks that require
              no props, such as books or clocks, are recommended.
              Visualize this dream slowly three times, to make sure that
              you know every detail. Then, start going full-on and
              visualize the dream over and over. You should visualize
              the dream as though you are looking through your own eyes,
              not from a third-person perspective. If you find your
              thoughts drifting, ignore them and continue to visualize
              the dream continuously. You will need patience for this —
              don't just give up if you think it won't work.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>When you actually dream this, you will not notice the
              difference — until you do your reality checks! Continue
              with the dream as you incubated it (e.g., remember to
              thank your friend!) before continuing through the door.</big></p>

          <p><big>If visualizing keeps you awake, the VILD technique is

          <p><big>LILD stands for “Lucid Induction of Lucid Dreams”, or
              sometimes, “Lucidly Induced Lucid Dream”.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>To use this technique, you need to have a lucid dream
              in the first place, but it can help you to get more later.
              The idea is to do something in your dream that will help
              you to become lucid the next time you are dreaming. For
              example, you could ask a dream character for help — ask
              them to meet you the next night and tell you that you are
              dreaming. If it works out the way it should, then the next
              time you are dreaming, the dream character will walk up to
              you and tell you that you are dreaming, and so you'll
              (hopefully) become lucid. There are many variations on
              this technique; you could set up signs in your dreamworld
              that remind you to do a reality check or eat lucid pills
              instead! This technique is not likely to be very
              effective, but it <i>can</i> work; it relies on the
              chance that you'll subconsciously induce the reminder
              (i.e., the dream character or sign or whatever you used)
              during some later dream, and become lucid because of it.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Note that LILD is best used in conjunction with
              dream-signs and auto-suggested non-lucid dreams. The basic
              idea as explained above is to have something in your dream
              that triggers the transition from normal dream state to
              lucid dreaming. To simply tell a character to tell you
              that you are dreaming the next time you fall asleep is
              usually not enough. There is no guarantee that you will
              dream about that character and there is no guarantee that
              your subconscious will believe the character enough to
              make you snap into lucidity (make you realize that you are
              in fact dreaming).</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Now as this technique suggests, you must have some
              previous alternate means of having a lucid dream. Whatever
              technique you employ to get into this initial lucid dream
              state is not really important, but you should try to
              remember to use this technique (LILD) once you do get into
              a lucid dream state. Thinking of this before falling
              asleep (MILD) sometimes helps and usually takes many lucid
              dreams before finally remembering. Once you are in a lucid
              dream, make up a dream-sign. It can be anything. It can be
              an object. It can be food or a drink (that doesn't taste
              like anything). It is usually best to pick something that
              isn't quite right. Something that on the surface would
              appear normal in the real world, but that upon closer
              inspection is not quite right. Food or drinks are good as
              they can have no taste or not be refreshing in a dream.
              But try and pick something that you dream about a lot so
              that there is a better chance of you dreaming about this
              dream-sign later on. Now pick something else that only
              appears or happens in your lucid dream. It can be
              anything. If there is nothing in your current lucid dream,
              create something really strange. Something that could
              never be confused with the real world. Now mentally
              associate the dream-sign (food) with this unusual item or
              event that could never happen in the real world. But at
              the same time, this unusual item or event should equate to
              "lucid dreaming". When you see the unusual item, it should
              only make you think of when you have a lucid dream as this
              should be the only time you encountered it. So we have a 3
              item associative link. Do all of the above while in a
              lucid dream.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>The next time you dream about your dream-sign, your
              subconscious will think of the unusual item or event. The
              unusual item or event will make you think of lucid
              dreaming. The two combined impossibilities (1. dream-sign
              that cannot exist in the real world 2. item or event that
              only appears in lucid dreams) will make your unconscious
              try to make a decision on all this. This will make your
              conscious mind come to the surface and hopefully you will
              come to the conclusion that you are dreaming. Many times,
              you will not want to deal with it because you are too
              tired (that is why you are sleeping, no?) and fall back
              into a normal dream state. This is why it can take a few
              tries. Eventually, your subconscious will start putting
              clear signs in your dreams like billboards that spell out
              "YOU ARE DREAMING". But once it triggers, it is quite the
              realization that an instant before, you had no real
              control over your actions and now you can do whatever you
              want. Another note... if it failed, you will usually know
              why. So next time, you can choose another dream-sign or
              slightly different technique or something more shocking.
              Once you get this working once, it is relatively easy to
              use over and over as the hard part just described is over
              with. Sometimes disassociative techniques are needed if
              used too much.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>To sum up, this technique is a way to force a reality
              check while in a normal dream state where your
              subconscious has no choice but to come to the conclusion
              that you are in fact dreaming. Once your mind knows that
              you are dreaming, there will be no other conclusion than
              your conscious mind taking over. And this is what lucid
              dreaming is all about.</big></p>

          <p><big>Tibetan Buddhists practice what is known as Tibetan
              dream yoga. Probably the most time consuming way of
              inducing lucid dreams, it is also, according to the
              practitioners, the most rewarding. The basic practice is <i>awareness</i>.
              Awareness should be practiced while sleeping just as well
              as while being awake. Meditating on the question “who is
              aware?” might catapult you into a higher degree of
              awareness according to Buddhist beliefs. Keeping this
              level of awareness is another matter. The Tibetans have
              developed many yogic exercises and disciplines to be
              practiced. Maybe the most interesting difference between
              Tibetan dream yoga and modern western methods of lucid
              dream induction is the Tibetan claim of the possibility to
              be aware during deep sleep, not only in the REM periods of
              sleep. For the reader who is interested in these methods a
              good start is to begin to regard all experience as a
              dream. After all, from the countless multitude of matter
              and radiation reaching our senses the nervous system tunes
              in only to a small fraction of this chaos. For members of
              the phalanx that believes we, more or less, create our own
              reality in the above sense this practice should feel
              natural. In general though, it is recommended to gain
              instruction from a teacher in the flesh rather than from
              books (like this one!).</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>The Tibetan Methods are not "time consuming" if the
              goal is to go into deeper than Lucid states. From a Raja
              Yoga stand point, from a Daoist standpoint, and from a
              Tibetan Yoga standpoint the goal is not to "play" in Lucid
              Dreams, but to dispel the delusional nature of what we
              call "reality." Also, to heal and to develop
              super-learning. Now "super-learning" is a relative term,
              it depends on your culture, modernity (in terms of
              entrepreneurialism - in 3rd world, 2nd world, 1st world
              sense; "are you developing a better rickshaw or are you
              developing an engine that runs off of water, what is
              relevant?"), and on the "energy" you find most attractive:
              innovative, creative, joyous, blissful, love, power,
              wisdom, mirth. Are you Ambitious-Worldly or
              Ambitious-Spiritual? All these factors play into it.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>These techniques are very easy to learn and are rooted
              in a deeper science than the WILD, VILD, LILD -- one that
              does not use auto-suggestion or forced recall. In
              conclusion, the Tibetan methods are advanced yogic
              techniques that only an accomplished practitioner can
              fully teach. If one does not have access to a Tibetan
              dream yogi, one should probably concentrate on techniques
              that are more mundane from a Western point of view.</big></p>

            <li><big><b>Inducing dream-signs</b> - You can become lucid
                by trying to induce specific dream-signs to watch for
                during your dream. You can use auto-suggestion (see
                above) to associate a specific dream-sign with doing a
                reality check, or you can just get used to doing a
                reality check whenever you encounter the dream-sign
                while awake. Some dream-signs you can use: </big><small>

                <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
                <li><big><b>Thirst</b> - Avoid drinking for very long.
                    Wake up later in the night and put salt on your
                    tongue or eat chili to make you even thirstier. Fill
                    a glass of fresh cold water and take it with you
                    back to bed. Hopefully, you'll dream of getting
                    something to drink. Don't use this technique if you
                    have trouble falling asleep while thirsty.</big></li>
                <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
                <li><big><b>False Awakening</b> - Set your intention as
                    you fall asleep to wake up in the middle of the
                    night. If you are a heavy sleeper, you'll hopefully
                    dream of waking up in the middle of the night. If
                    you are a light sleeper, you are probably more
                    likely to really wake up.</big></li>
                <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
                <li><big><b>Bladder</b> - Drink large amounts of water
                    before going to sleep. You should dream of having to
                    go to the bathroom. You may wet your bed! This
                    technique should be used carefully, to avoid the
                    possibility of <span class="extiw">water
                      intoxication</span>.</big></li>

            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big><b>Conditioning</b> - Strictly punish or reward
                yourself after a dream where you failed to realize you
                were dreaming or when you do have a lucid dream. This
                could increase motivation but not necessarily cause
                lucid dreams in itself. Cognitive psychology, however,
                states that this punishment/reward system is very
                counterproductive, because it ties our self-esteem to
                the outcome of the endeavor. The opposite of this system
                would be to see each attempt, including those that fail,
                as another step towards success.</big></li>
            <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
            <li><big><b>Muscle Exhaustion</b> - Lift slight weights with
                one's arms and legs for about fifteen minutes before one
                begins to fall asleep. One should not, however, lift
                anything that strains the muscles too much, for that
                stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and excites
                the body. The method should cause a release of tension
                in the muscles and tire them out. This combined with
                relaxation techniques and any of the -ILD's should
                produce a positive result.</big></li>

              body experience (OBE) use Galantamine to increase their
              odds to achieve LD or OBE. By taking small amount of
              Galantamine (around 4 to 8 mg) after 5 to 6 hours of deep
              sleep and practice the induction technique such as
              meditation, MILD or WILD many people report more success

              will result in only a vivid dream instead. It should also
              be noted that due to a long half life Galantamine will
              stay in the body for a period of up to and over 48 hours,
              as such it is advisable to space out the use of
              Galantamine over a period of three days so that the body
              does not build a resistance to the drug ruining its

          <p><big>There are various gadgets you can use to become lucid
              easily. They generally detect when you are in the REM
              state and then provide a light and/or sound signal. This
              signal is supposed to be adjusted so that it doesn't wake
              you up but does enter your dream. The signal is then
              recognized as showing that you are dreaming, and you
              become lucid.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>The most well-known device is the NovaDreamer from the
              Lucidity Institute. However, this product is no longer
              produced. Be sure to check for recommendations for devices
              from lucid dreaming forums.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>A similar device is the <span class="external text">DreamMaker</span>.
              ( http://www.wellnesstools.com/dreammaker_quickinfo.htm
              ).The DreamMaker works very similarly to the NovaDreamer
              but without the Dream Alarm feature, which worked to wake
              the dreamer in the middle of the REM state. This device
              comes with a mask, a circuit board with adjustable
              controls, the batteries needed to operate it, a short
              owner's manual, a lucid dreaming workbook, and the <span
                class="extiw">Stephen LaBerge</span> book <i>Exploring
                the World of Lucid Dreaming</i>. The circuit board is
              supplied completely ready to use, but you have to insert
              the batteries and put the circuit board into the mask
              yourself.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>An alternative is the <span class="external text">Kvasar</span>
              ( http://brindefalk.solarbotics.net/kvasar/kvasar.html ).
              The Kvasar costs about $20 in raw materials, but needs to
              be constructed by somebody skilled in electronics as it is
              not sold commercially. It can also be hard to operate.</big></p>
          <small> </small><big> </big><small> </small>
          <p><big>Another do-it-yourself alternative to commercial
              dreaming masks is Nate True's <span class="external text">Lucid

              http://cre.ations.net/creation/face-mounted-lucid-dreaming-mask

              sensors and just uses a timer for flashing lights, and has
              (ostensibly) competitive results with all of the former
              gadgets.</big></p>

            <b>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR ATTAINING LUCID DREAM STATE</b><b><br>

            <br>
            Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DOZORTSEV DMITRI<br>
            <br>
            The invention discloses an apparatus that facilitates
            attaining of lucid dreaming state.<br>
            <br>
            0001] This application claims priority of U.S. Provisional
            Patent Application Ser. No. 61/117424 filed Nov. 24, 2008,
            which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
            <br>
            <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0002] The present invention is in the field of apparatuses
            for modulation of sleep pattern.<br>
            <br>
            <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0003] It is also known that some people may experience
            so-called lucid dreams during REM where the person is aware
            that he or she is dreaming while the dream is in progress.
            During lucid dreams, it is possible to exert conscious
            control over the dream characters and environment and have
            them perform feats which would be physically impossible in
            the waking world. Lucid dreams can be extremely real and
            vivid depending on a person's level of self-awareness during
            the lucid dream.<br>
            <br>
            [0004] The number of people who are naturally predisposed to
            lucid dreaming is small.<br>
            <br>
            [0005] However, there are methods that allow a not
            predisposed individual to experience lucid dreaming.<br>
            <br>
            [0006] For example, it is well known that during night sleep
            humans have several episodes of dreaming accompanied by
            rapid eye movements (REM).<br>
            <br>
            [0007] The devices for assisting lucid dreaming usually
            detect REM phase by monitoring eye movement using detectors
            mounted within the mask and then use flashing light or sound
            to let person know that he is dreaming without waking him up
            completely.<br>
            <br>
            [0008] It has also been known for a long time that most men
            and woman experience respectively penis or clitoris
            erections and changes in blood flow and heart rate during
            the REM phase.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0009] The disclosed invention is designed to assist an
            individual to enter lucid dreaming filled with sexual
            experience, by providing sexual stimulation when REM is
            detected.<br>
            <br>
            <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0010] The disclosed apparatus has two principal parts, one
            detecting sexual arousal during sleep and second that
            provides a sexually stimulating stimulus once such arousal
            is detected. Because sexual arousal during sleep coincides
            with dreaming phase, it becomes possible for a user to
            introduce a sexual connotation into the dream.<br>
            <br>
            [0011] Furthermore, recognizing external sexual stimulus,
            exerted by the apparatus, user will become aware of being
            dreaming, thereby transforming normal dream into lucid with
            sexual content.<br>
            <br>
            [0012] Alternatively, the monitoring unit of disclosed
            apparatus may detect dream state by other means, for example
            by monitoring REMs or heart rate or blood pressure, skin
            resistance etc and send the signal to the second unit that
            provides sexual stimulation.<br>
            <br>
            [0013] In a more simplified form, the arousal is not being
            monitored or detected. Instead, sexual stimulation is
            applied at predetermined programmed intervals during sleep.<br>

            BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS<br>
            <br>
            <b>1. Technical Field</b><br>
            <br>
            The present inventions relate to dream inducement and, more
            particularly, relate to a method and electrical apparatus
            for inducing lucid dreaming.<br>
            <br>
            <b>2. Description of the Related Art</b><br>
            <br>
            A lucid dream is one in which the dreamer obtains conscious
            awareness while still remaining in the dream. While we are
            all familiar with ordinary non-lucid dreams, the notion of
            conscious awareness within ones dream-space is quite foreign
            to most. Lucid dreaming is better understood and leveraged
            in Eastern culture. For example, the use of lucid dreams for
            personal or spiritual development has been leveraged for
            thousands of years in Buddhist practice. In the West, most
            people are too busy to apply the mental training techniques
            required to achieve this state naturally.<br>
            <br>
            Western researchers have tried to develop technological
            solutions in one sense or another to solve the challenge of
            having lucid dreams on demand. Secondary goals of such
            technology driven solutions have included maximizing dream
            vividness, recall, control or overall cognitive ability
            while in the dream.<br>
            <br>
            The possible applications of lucid dreaming are limitless.
            Not surprisingly, entertainment seems to be the most common
            application of lucid dreaming. This might include flying
            like a bird, meeting up with long lost friends or even
            romantic fantasies. More esoteric and well known lucid dream
            tasks include the elimination of recurrent nightmares,
            practicing physical tasks and having that practice within
            your dream-space impact your actual wakeful performance,
            elimination of phobias, insights into your subconscious by
            engaging in conversation with dream characters and pursuing
            creative endeavors such as writing music or poetry under
            this slightly altered state of awareness.<br>
            <br>
            Given the limitless number of applications for lucid
            dreaming, it is desired to identify a safe and predictable
            method for inducing lucid dreams. While lucid dream
            frequency is desired, it is also important to recognize that
            the recovery of full cognitive ability within the dream is
            crucial if some of the aforementioned goals are to be
            implemented by the dreamer.<br>
            <br>
            It is known in the art that the quality of lucid dreams can
            vary greatly. Perhaps the single largest challenge once
            lucidity is obtained is the application of full cognitive
            ability. Lucid dreamers will often claim they were lucid,
            but that their cognitive ability was a fraction of what they
            expect when they are awake. Ramifications of this include
            poor ability to remember or implement goals, or an inability
            to remember the details of the dream once the dreamer
            awakens.<br>
            <br>
            An early attempt at a technological solution to lucid
            dreaming was the concept of a lucid dream mask by LaBerge,
            et al in U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,716. This was essentially a
            facial mask worn during a lucid dream attempt. The mask has
            a compartment for a printed circuit board that contains a
            motion detector which aligns to the position of an eye. The
            circuit board was designed to detect rapid eye movement
            (REM). Upon this detection, the mask sent light or sound
            cues to the dreamer. These cues may manifest in the dream as
            light or sound anomalies. The dreamer had to train to use
            these cues in order to recognize that they are dreaming. The
            problems with these devices were several. First, most people
            find it difficult to sleep with a cumbersome mask strapped
            to their face. Second, the settings are very tricky. A
            little too much motion detection sensitivity and the cues
            can wake the dreamer before the dream is stable. Too little
            and the mask doesn't detect and deliver cues. Similar
            problems can be said of the brightness and sound settings.
            The worst part is that the brain becomes accustomed to this
            phenomenon and tends to either tune it out or wake upon
            light or sound stimulus. Other peculiarities can creep in
            such as the lucid dreamer feeling like the mask is on them
            during the dream leaving them unable to see. A review of
            various internet lucid dream sites will find few people
            claiming phenomenal success with such devices.<br>
            <br>
            A more recent development in lucid dream induction was that
            provided by LaBerge in US Patent Application Publication No.
            20040266659. In this application, LaBerge identified several
            classes of drugs that can positively impact dream lucidity
            and cognitive ability of the dreamer. The main focus of this
            development was the class of drugs known as acetylcholine
            esterase inhibitors. Fundamentally, these are drugs that
            slow the breakdown of acetylcholine in the brain. Commercial
            usage of drugs such as Galantamine or Huperzine-A for lucid
            dream induction resulted from this disclosure by LaBerge.
            While this class of drugs does seem to be safe and
            reasonably effective at lucid dream induction, they also
            exhibit a number of limitations. Insomnia is a common
            consequence of using these drugs. Not only can this leave
            the subject sleepy the next day, it eliminates any
            possibility of lucid dreaming. Since these drugs bias
            acetylcholine (AcH) levels, they tend to create a chemical
            balance that favors REM sleep over delta wave and other
            physically recuperative cycles of sleep. Again, this can
            often leave the subject run down and sleepy the next day due
            to a lack of recuperative sleep the prior evening. A
            noticeable tolerance to acetylcholine esterase inhibitors
            has also been exhibited and is a common problem known to
            those skilled in the art. A dose that used to cause a
            positive effect every 4th day (generally accepted as the
            minimal inter-use window for galantamine), can soon only
            realizes a positive effect once per week. Even once a week
            can become a challenge for users who have leveraged a drug
            like galantamine for a year or more. Discussion of this
            tolerance issue is well documented on internet based lucid
            dream bulletin boards. Even with the use of these AcH
            boosting drugs, lucid dreamers often report unsatisfactory
            cognitive ability and critical thinking recovery once lucid.
            The last and final challenge is the gastro-intestinal
            distress and intolerance some people realize.<br>
            <br>
            Another approach to the generalized modification of brain
            state activity was cranial electrical stimulation (CES).
            Cranial electrical stimulation was researched and developed
            in the Soviet Union in the 1950's. At the time this
            application was termed "electro-sleep" because studies
            focused mostly on resolution of insomnia in human subjects.
            By the 1960's a significant amount of private and university
            level research was underway in the United States for both
            animal and human subjects. The typical applications explored
            during this time were reduction of pain, anxiety, depression
            and elimination of insomnia.<br>
            <br>
            Cranial electrical stimulation differs from several other
            electrical or magnetic stimuli such as transcutaneous
            electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) or transcranial magnetic
            stimulation (TMS). Cranial electrical stimulation involves
            the delivery of a small micro current across the brain.
            Typically, this is delivered via electrodes clipped to the
            ear lobes. The currents involved are quite small, on the
            order of 50 [mu]A-5 mA. Research has demonstrated that the
            preferred waveforms for cranial electrical stimulation
            applications are square or rectilinear biphasic signals with
            zero mean voltage delivered over time. These types of
            biphasic signals are easily designed and implemented to have
            equal positive and negative portions to eliminate the
            possibility of elecrolysis of the blood. This
            positive/negative behavior of the signal better replicates
            the response of nerve impulses that are characterized by
            having one polarity upon application of pressure and a
            potential of equal but opposite polarity upon release of
            pressure. Pulse widths of 0.1 to 2.0 seconds are commonly
            used and the envelope of the signal typically used for
            traditional applications is designed to be periodic at a
            rate of 0.5-3.0 Hz. It is also recognized by those skilled
            in the art that dynamic modification of the signal is often
            preferred as the brain can otherwise develop a tolerance to
            a repetitive electrical stimulus and slowly become
            unresponsive to this external signal. Methods to dynamically
            modify the signal include but are not limited to using
            on/off pulses, changing the envelope frequency over time,
            using a low frequency envelope to modulate a higher
            frequency carrier wave, changing the time domain format of
            the periodic signal, making changes in signal magnitude,
            etc.<br>
            <br>
            Other cited methods are different than cranial electrical
            stimulation. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation
            (TENS) for example is typically applied to injured or
            uncomfortable muscles and/or soft tissue areas. TENS is
            typically delivered in the 50-200 Hz range at much higher
            currents. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) differs
            from cranial electrical stimulation in the stimulus itself.
            TMS is a magnetic alteration of brain response as opposed to
            an electrical stimulus.<br>
            <br>
            While decades of research have been implemented in this
            area, very little has actually been quantified in terms of
            how cranial electrical stimulation actually works. Most data
            and conclusions are empirical in nature. Blind or double
            blind studies routinely prove that low frequency cranial
            electrical stimulation in the 0.5-3.0 Hz range has positive
            effects in the aforementioned diseases and discomforts.
            Certainly it is well understood via electroencephalogram
            (EEG) measurements of patients before and after cranial
            electrical stimulation treatment that cranial electrical
            stimulation tends to eliminate irregular or abnormal electro
            chemical activity especially in the alpha range of 8-12 Hz.
            However the precise mechanism that drives this response is
            poorly understood. Most research cites the generic theory
            that cranial electrical stimulation helps to drive
            neurotransmitter balance back to a normal homeostasis.
            Cranial electrical stimulation regiments typically follow
            the model of 30 minutes of treatment per day for 5-15 days.
            Depending on the ailment and individual, positive response
            is often subjectively perceived for anywhere from 1 week to
            2 years.<br>

            </b><br>
            [0003] Dreams have been recognized as sacred and spiritual
            experiences in many cultures around the world since the
            beginning of recorded history and perhaps even earlier. In
            the last century, the understanding of dreams has changed
            from one related exclusively to the spiritual to that
            pertaining to the physical/psychological realm. Toward the
            end of the twentieth century, the idea of lucid dreaming, or
            dreaming with deliberate intention and control, has moved
            from the world of shamans or spiritualists to realization
            that lucid dreaming can be achieved by anyone with the
            assistance of nutritional supplements and practice.<br>
            <br>
            [0004] In order to facilitate the understanding of lucid
            dreaming, it is important to understand some basic elements
            about sleep and common, or non-lucid, dreaming. Humans have
            little understanding of why we sleep and dream. It is known,
            though, that the most vivid dreams occur during that phase
            of a sleep cycle called Rapid Eye Movement, or REM. It is
            known that healthy human adults go through about 3-6 cycles
            during a normal night's sleep, with each cycle being about
            90-120 minutes long. REM sleep is usually the last phase of
            each cycle. Dreams can occur during any phase of any cycle,
            however, it is known that those dreams that occur during REM
            sleep tend to be the most vivid and visual and are usually
            not directly related to current events from the dreamer's
            experiences during the prior day.<br>
            <br>
            [0005] As scientists began to learn more about the function
            of the human brain, it was discovered that the stimuli that
            produce images in dreams originate in a part of the brain
            not associated with thinking, desires or wishes, but a more
            primitive area. This lead to the neurophysiological or
            synthesis activation theory of dreams in which dreams result
            from random stimuli from the brain stem. In accordance with
            this theory, the cognitive parts of the brain play a minimal
            part in dreaming, probably limited to trying to make sense
            out of the random images originating from the primitive
            region of the brain stem.<br>
            <br>
            [0006] It is surmised that dreaming is important in the
            development of memory. Human infants spend up to 16-18 hours
            a day sleeping and approximately 50% of this is in REM
            sleep. It has been determined that intense sessions of
            learning are followed by an increase in REM sleep. Dreaming
            also seems to play a role in emotional adjustment and in
            coping with traumatic experiences.<br>
            <br>
            [0007] The term "Lucid Dreaming" was first used in 1913 by
            Fredrich van Eeden, a Dutch physician. Lucid dreaming is
            perhaps best defined as being aware that you are dreaming
            and is most likely to occur in REM sleep. Lucid dreaming can
            be either low level or high level. Low level lucid dreaming
            means that the dreamer is aware of being in a dream, but
            that not all the people, animals, things and scenes are
            constructs of his or her mind. In high level lucid dreaming,
            the dreamer is not only aware of being in a dream, but that
            all of the elements of the dream are being generated by
            their mind and are therefore potentially under their
            complete control.<br>
            <br>
            [0008] According to studies done on lucid dreaming, these
            dreams may not only be potentially pleasurable or wish
            fulfilling, they can be tools for improving the quality of
            the dreamer's waking lives by facilitating healing,
            inspiring peak athletic performances, putting an end to
            recurrent nightmares, overcoming phobias, reducing or
            eliminating various anxieties and improving problem solving
            capabilities.<br>
            <br>
            [0009] There are methods that have been developed by various
            researchers in the field, such as LaBerge and Rheingold. A
            common technique is used by the Lucidity Institute, founded
            by LaBerge, and is referred to as Mnemonic Induction of
            Lucid Dreams ("MILD"). The basics of the MILD technique
            involves various steps such as deliberately making yourself
            wake up during a dream cycle and immediately recalling the
            details of the dream. Over time, the dreamer is capable of
            recalling all of his or her dreams. The dreamer is then
            directed to use a "dream sign" to use as a cue to recognize
            that he or she is still dreaming. Becoming proficient at
            lucid dreaming requires a great deal of time, dedication and
            practice.<br>
            <br>
            [0010] In order to enhance the training of a person to
            develop strong lucid dreaming skills, various devices have
            been devised. Such devices use light and/or sound to help
            trigger lucid dreams. Among the shamans of some primitive
            cultures, they would enhance their ability to have lucid
            dreams by using various drugs. However, as one can imagine,
            most of these substances are considered illegal in the U.S.
            Among the legal substances known to promote sleep (and
            possibly dreaming) are the B-vitamins, Calea zacatechichi,
            melatonin, mugwort and passionflower. Before using such a
            substance alone or in combinations, it is important to know
            how to use it and what side effects it might cause. There is
            a need, therefore, for a safe but effective nutritional
            supplement that helps a person go to sleep and which can
            enhance lucid dreaming even without extensive mental
            preparation or exercises.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0011] The present invention is a nutritional supplement
            that acts as a sleep aid and has been found to enhance lucid
            dreaming in humans. It consists of a combination of
            ingredients in proportions calculated to provide these
            results. The primary ingredients are Calea zacatechichi,
            L-5-Hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP), and Vinpocetine. A
            secondary ingredient is Melatonin. In addition, the
            nutritional supplement of the invention may include Wild
            Lettuce Extract, Mugwort Extract, Dimethylaminoethanol
            Powder (DMAE), Passionflower Extract and Green Tea Extract.
            Further, various B-Vitamins, vitamin D, vitamin C,
            magnesium, calcium, as well as Zinc, may be added.<br>
            <br>
            [0012] The relative amounts of these ingredients used in the
            nutritional supplement will be discussed in more detail in
            the Detailed Description of the Invention. The use of this
            nutritional supplement has been seen to assist a person in
            going to sleep as well as helping to promote lucid dreaming
            in people who take the supplement prior to going to sleep.<br>
            <b><br>
            </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
            <br>
            [0013] The nutritional supplement of the invention is used
            as a sleep aid and a promoter of lucid dreaming in people
            who take it prior to going to sleep. To reiterate what was
            stated in the Background of the Invention, lucid dreaming is
            defined as being aware that the dreamer is dreaming. It is
            most likely to occur in REM sleep and can exist either at a
            low level or a high level. Low level lucid dreaming means
            that the dreamer is aware of being in a dream, but that not
            all the people, animals, things and scenes are constructs of
            his or her mind. In high level lucid dreaming, the dreamer
            is not only aware of being in a dream, but that all of the
            elements of the dream are being generated by their mind and
            are therefore potentially under their complete control.<br>
            <br>
            [0014] The nutritional supplement of the invention is useful
            in promoting lucid dreaming in people who have not
            necessarily trained themselves to lucidly dream by
            performing extensive training techniques over a long period
            of time. It has been formulated to provide the best effect
            without the need to have undergone extensive mental
            conditioning, such as that taught by many organization and
            found in various publications, or subjecting oneself to some
            of the known mechanical devices invented by Laberge.<br>
            <br>
            [0015] The primary ingredients are Calea zacatechichi
            powder, L-5 Hydroxytryptophan (L-5-HTP) and Vinpocetine. A
            secondary ingredient is Melatonin. Additional ingredients
            are Wild Lettuce Extract 4:1, Mugwort Extract 4:1,
            Dimethylaminoethanol Powder (DMAE), Passionflower Extract
            10:1 and Green Tea Extract 10:1. Further, various vitamins
            may be added, such as B, C and D, as well as zinc, calcium
            and magnesium.<br>
            <br>
            [0016] All of the ingredients of the nutritional supplement
            of the invention are known. For instance, Calea zacatechichi
            is a known dream herb, used by the Chontal natives of
            Mexico. Green Tea is a well known drink that is high in
            antioxidants. Mugwort has been used for medicinal purposes
            for centuries and is known to cause a dreamy state of
            consciousness. Passionflower (Passiflora incarnate) has mild
            sedative properties that may be used to treat insomnia and
            anxiety. Wild Lettuce is an ingredient in some sleep tonics
            and has been historically regarded as a mild sedative.
            L-5-Hydroxytryptophan is known to raise serotonin levels
            which, in turn, improves sleep quality. Dimethylaminoethanol
            is thought to increase the levels of acetylcholine (a
            neurotransmitter) in the brain. Vinpocetine (Vinca minor) is
            known to aid memory and improve mental functioning.
            Melatonin is a natural hormone that regulates sleep in
            mammals. The B Vitamins are known to regulate the body's
            energy processes and promote good health. Vitamin C is also
            a necessary ingredient in maintaining good health. Zinc is
            used by the body in hundreds of enzymes which regulate many
            of the body's functions. Vitamin D, Calcium and Magnesium
            are additional elements that are utilized by the body.<br>

            [0020] When considering lucid dreaming, one of the key
            elements, especially at a high level, is that the dreamer
            not only realizes they are in a dream but that they have the
            potential to control the progress and outcome of the dream.
            The following examples are summaries of testimonials of
            people who took the nutritional supplement of the invention
            as a sleep aid and not only were able to lucidly dream but
            were able, through their heightened awareness and control,
            to change what had been recurrent patterns in their dreams
            and their lives.<br>
            <br>
            <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
            </b><b><br>
            </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0021] In this example, the individual kept having recurrent
            nightmares over a period of about 20 years. In the dream,
            the person would start across a bridge and be grabbed by a
            monster that would begin to crush him as he was being
            dragged under water. When he realized that he would soon
            drown, he would start screaming, waking not only himself but
            his bed partner, as well. This person started taking the
            nutritional supplement of the invention and, after several
            more dreams like this, gradually increased his awareness, or
            lucidity, to the point where he was able to confront the
            monster and eventually was able to exercise enough control
            over the outcome of the dream that he killed the monster.
            The nightmares stopped.<br>
            <br>
            [0022] Apparently, the monster was a dream created
            manifestation of a real person that had abused him in the
            past. When the dreamer and the abuser faced each other in
            court to resolve a legal matter, he had gained the
            confidence to not be afraid of the abuser any more and won
            the case. In this instance, the nutritional supplement of
            the invention allowed him, through lucid dreaming, to
            conquer a long entrenched fear.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0023] The individual in this example had been similarly
            experiencing recurrent nightmares since he was about 10
            years old. In the nightmare, this person was chased by a
            dark, faceless entity and would frequently awaken screaming.
            However, after beginning taking the nutritional supplement
            of the invention, he began dreaming more and more lucidly,
            to the point where he soon realized that he could control
            his reaction to the faceless entity. He soon was able to
            angrily confront the entity which allowed him to rid himself
            of this recurrent dream. He used his experience with the
            recurrent nightmare that he could exercise control, through
            lucidly dreaming, that he could adjust his normally negative
            reactions to anxiety producing events in his life into
            positive reactions, thus enabling him to function better in
            the world.<br>

            <b>BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0001] The term "lucid dreaming" was coined by Frederik van
            Eeden who used the word "lucid" in the sense of mental
            clarity. Lucidity usually begins in the midst of a dream
            when the dreamer realizes that the experience is not
            occurring in physical reality, but is a dream. Often this
            realization is triggered by the dreamer noticing some
            impossible or unlikely occurrence in the dream, such as
            flying or meeting the deceased. Sometimes people become
            lucid without noticing any particular clue in the dream;
            they just suddenly realize they are in a dream. A minority
            of lucid dreams (according to the research of LaBerge and
            colleagues, about 10 percent) are the result of returning to
            REM (dreaming) sleep directly from an awakening with
            unbroken reflective consciousness. The basic definition of
            lucid dreaming requires nothing more than becoming aware
            that you are dreaming. However, the quality of lucidity can
            vary greatly. When lucidity is at a high level, you are
            aware that everything experienced in the dream is occurring
            in your mind, that there is no real danger, and that you are
            asleep in bed and will awaken shortly. With low-level
            lucidity you may be aware to a certain extent that you are
            dreaming, perhaps enough to fly or alter what you are doing,
            but not enough to realize that the people are dream
            representations, or that you can suffer no physical damage,
            or that you are actually in bed.<br>
            <br>
            [0002] In the circumstances described above, it is strongly
            desired in the art to develop a safe method of aiding
            dreamers attempts at more frequently achieving higher states
            of lucidity in their dreams. One class of preferred
            embodiments of this invention include neurotransmitter
            modulators such as Acetylcholine Esterase inhibitors.<br>
            <br>
            [0003] A number of substances have been suggested to enhance
            the likelihood of lucid dreaming, from vitamins to
            prescription drugs. There are few good scientific studies to
            back such claims. Lucid dreaming is highly subject to the
            placebo effect; the belief that something will stimulate a
            lucid dream is very effective. Many prescription drugs as
            well as marijuana and alcohol alter the sleep cycle, usually
            by suppressing REM sleep. This leads to a phenomenon called
            "REM rebound," in which a person experiences intense, long
            REM periods after the drug has worn off. This can manifest
            as nightmares or, possibly, as lucid dreaming, since the
            brain is highly active. Drugs in the LSD family, including
            psilocybin and tryptamines actually stimulate REM sleep (in
            doses small enough to allow sleep), leading to longer REM
            periods. The potentially dangerous and illegal nature of
            these drugs is not conducive to their use as lucidity
            enhancers.<br>
            <br>
            [0004] It is known in the scientific literature that
            Acetylcholine and its agonist as well as
            Acetylcholinesterase and its inhibitors/antagonist may be
            involved with REM and sleeping (Amatruda et al 1975;
            Baghdoyan et al 1984; Gillin et al 1985; Velazquez-Moctezuma
            et al 1991; Wauquier et al 1985). J. A. Hobson, on page 202
            of his 1988 book, "The Dreaming Brain" states: "Cholinergic
            brainstem mechanisms cause REM sleep and dreaming". It has
            also been discovered that microinjection of the
            Acetylcholine agonist carbachol in the certain locations of
            the brain, such as the Pons, elicits extended periods of REM
            sleep, and that many of the neurons critical for REM sleep
            are responsive to Acetylcholine.<br>
            <br>
            [0005] Neither Hobson, nor any other others, discuss the
            possibility of altering Cholinergic levels via Acetylcholine
            Esterase inhibitors as a means of enhancing dream recall and
            lucidity.<br>
            <br>
            [0006] Historically, there are many cultures that have
            believed to have found naturally occurring substances that
            in some way alter dream consciousness. One such substance,
            Calea zacatechichi or "Dream Weed", is, according to Lilian
            Mayagoitia, et al, in a 1986 Journal of Ethnopharmacology
            article, "a plant used by the Chontal Indians of Mexico to
            obtain divinatory messages during dreaming." The
            neuro-active compounds of this herb are reported to cause
            thought to be sesquiterpene lactones, and as far as is
            currently known, unrelated to Acetylcholine Esterase
            inhibition or inhibitors.<br>
            <br>
            [0007] Both ancient traditional medicines and modern popular
            speculation has assigned Oneirogenic, or "Dream-Inducing"
            properties to numerous herbs and other natural substances,
            including herbs like Valerian, Mugwort, Mullein, Kava Kava,
            Dittany of Crete, St. Johns Wort, Salvia Divinorum,
            Scutellaria Indica, Licorice Root, Vervain, Jasmine,
            Honeysuckle, Datura, Bee Pollen, Catnip, Hops, Sculicap,
            Mimosa, Lavender, Damiana, Withania Somnifera,
            Passionflower, Chamomile, Cardamom, Gotu Kola, Ginkgo
            Biloba, Ibogaine, Verbena, Rose, Cinnamon, Marigold, Nutmeg,
            Peppermint, Holly, Yarrow and Anise. Few if any of these
            have any scientific basis or support for these purported
            effects. Other supplements and/or drugs are also claimed to
            be linked to lucidity, including B-vitamins, Melatonin,
            DMAE, and the psychedelic DXM. Some of these drugs and herbs
            may be addictive, poisonous and/or illegal.<br>
            <br>
            [0008] Lotsof, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,499,096, issued Feb. 12,
            1985, teaches a "Rapid method for interrupting the narcotic
            addiction syndrome" via the drug Ibogaine. According to the
            patent, this drug induces "dream enhancement or
            hallucinatory effect". This claimed "oneirogenic" effect is
            due to the fact that it induces dream behavior with the ego
            perspective relatively intact. This is, as the patent
            mentions, more of a hallucinatory effect, not a lucid
            dreaming effect. Because of these hallucinatory and other
            side effects, however, this drug is illegal in the U.S., and
            is thus not a desirable means for enhancing sleep dream
            quality. This drug is also not considered to be related to
            Acetylcholine Esterase inhibitors or 'smart drugs'.<br>
            <br>
            [0009] DMAE (2-dimethylaminoethanol) is a chemical that has
            been suggested by used to treat a number of conditions
            affecting the brain and central nervous system. It is
            thought to work by increasing production of the
            neurotransmitter Acetylcholine, although this has not been
            proven. Marketed as a memory and mood enhancer, DMAE is
            believed to enhance intellectual functioning. There are few
            good clinical studies supporting this belief. Such
            substances are known as "cholinergics" because of the belief
            that they increase Acetylcholine. They have been
            traditionally used to treat diseases such as Alzheimer's
            dementia, tardive dyskinesia, and Huntington's chorea.
            Because DMAE is believed to be a cholinergic, it has been
            suggested for these disorders, even though
            placebo-controlled studies have provided essentially
            negative results. There is continued controversy over
            whether DMAE actually increases Acetylcholine. Nonetheless,
            Sergio, W. Claims in the 1988 August edition of Medical
            Hypotheses, in the article: "Use of DMAE
            (2-dimethylaminoethanol) in the induction of lucid dreams",
            subjective experiences of himself and his wife experiencing
            enhanced lucidity through use of this supplement. It is
            unclear from the article to what extent his purported
            results derive from placebo response or any specific or
            cholinergic effect.<br>
            <br>
            [0010] Also well known in the art is U.S. Pat. No.
            5,507,716, awarded to LaBerge, et al. on Apr. 16, 1996, for
            Equipment and methods used to induce lucid dreams in
            sleeping persons. In this patent, a device was employed to
            assist people to achieve lucid dreams via the detecting and
            monitoring the eye and head movements of sleeping persons,
            where eye movement activity in the absence of head movement
            is used to indicate the presence of REM sleep. By then
            applying sensory stimuli to sleepers in REM sleep can cue
            them that they are dreaming without producing awakening.
            Other persons have developed equipment, such as Keith M. T.
            Hearne who illustrated and described his respiratory
            measuring device in his 1983 U.S. Pat. No. 4,420,001. His
            device sensed temperature changes of a person's respiration
            in his or her breathing passageway, or in airflows to and
            from his or her breathing passageway. Thermistors were used,
            in an electrical circuit, to sense the temperature changes
            of the person's respiration. When the rate of these
            temperature changes reached a high predetermined level, the
            signals created in the electrical circuit initiated an
            audible sound, either to help arouse a sleeping person from
            an unpleasant dream by awaking them or to help them enter
            into a lucid dream state.<br>
            <br>
            [0011] None of the preceding references disclosed describe a
            method of enhancing lucid dreaming comprising administering
            to individuals the Acetylcholine Esterase inhibitor class of
            drugs. Use of therapeutic agents for Alzheimer"s Disease
            such as Donepizil (AriceptÂ(R)), Rivastigmin (ExelonÂ(R)),
            Galantamine (ReminylÂ(R), NivalinÂ(R)), Tacrine and
            Huperzine leads to low incidence of adverse events, such as
            insomnia and gastrointestinal symptoms, while significantly
            enhancing dreaming cognitive clarity, lucidity,
            self-reflection, recall, control, bizarreness, and visual

            <b>SUMMARY OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0012] This invention relates to the field of Lucid Dreaming
            and the enhancement of dream recall and dream lucidity
            through memory enhancing drugs, including the class of
            substances that comprise Acetylcholine Esterase inhibitors
            (AChEls). Lucid dreaming involves dreaming while knowing
            that you are dreaming. AChE inhibitors (AchEl's) inhibit the
            normal metabolic inactivation of Acetylcholine (ACh) by
            inhibiting the enzyme, Acetylcholine Esterase (AChE),
            leading to accumulation of Ach. AchEl's are most commonly
            used to enhance memory, particularly in patients suffering
            from Alzheimer's disease. Ach is also well known to be
            important in REM and thus is suggested herein to enhance
            dreaming and lucidity.<br>
            <br>
            <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            [0013] While investigating the efficacy of donepizil
            (AriceptÂ(R)) as a means to enhance lucid dreaming and
            cognitive clarity during REM sleep in normal subjects, the
            following experiment was performed with the following
            results: A randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled
            crossover trial was performed with ten normal volunteers
            self-selected for high dream recall and interest in lucid
            dreaming (7 male, 3 female, age 22-55). Subjects collected
            dream content and other self-report measures on three
            nights, separated by a washout period of at least one week.
            At bedtime, they took capsules containing 0 (placebo), 5, or
            10 mg of donepizil, with counter-balanced order of the three
            dosages. After each spontaneous awakening during the three
            nights, Ss evaluated dream content on a range of measures
            including bizarreness, complexity, and intensity, affect,
            cognitive clarity, lucidity, and control. They also
            estimated sleep quality, insomnia, and degree of any adverse
            effects.<br>
            <br>
            [0014] RESULTS: Nine of the 10 Ss (90%) reported one or more
            lucid dreams on the experimental nights, with only one S
            reporting a lucid dream on a placebo night. Cognitive
            clarity, lucidity, recall, control, bizarreness, and visual
            vividness were all significantly elevated with donepizil
            compared to placebo. The effects were generally dose-related
            with 10 mg donepizil producing significantly higher levels
            of these variables than the 5 mg dose, which in turn
            produced significant elevations compared to placebo. Odds of
            lucid dreaming for the three conditions increased from 0.031
            for placebo, to 0.429 for 5 mg donepizil, and 0.754 for 10
            mg donepizil. The lucidity odds ratio for the 10 mg dose
            compared to placebo was 24.3 (p&lt;0.001). Donepizil was
            also associated with a significantly elevated frequency of
            sleep paralysis and a 40% increase in estimated time awake
            during the night (176 vs. 126 min of a 9.0 hr night,
            p&lt;0.05). The incidence of adverse events, notably mild
            insomnia and gastrointestinal symptoms, was low and
            primarily associated with the higher dose condition (with
            two subjects reporting nausea and one vomiting).<br>
            <br>
            [0015] Thus, compared to placebo, both 5 and 10 mg dosages
            of donepizil significantly enhance self-reported cognitive
            clarity, self-reflection, and lucidity during dreaming.
            These effects may be further enhanced by combination of the
            acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with Acetylcholine
            precursors, agonists and/or lucidity inducing electronic
            devices.<br>
            <br>
            [0016] In addition to donepizil data, we have data on
            ExelonÂ(R) (rivastigmin; 6-12 mg dose) and galantamine
            (ReminylÂ(R), NivalinÂ(R)8-16 mg) as well. Both work as well
            as AriceptÂ(R)), but with perhaps fewer side effects. We
            have also tested huperzine with promising results, but
            haven't yet worked out the dose correspondence with
            AriceptÂ(R) (but 5 mg Donepizil is more potent than 150 Apg
            huperzine).<br>
            <br>
            [0017] In addition, we have reports of success with nicotine
            patches. There is also in the scientific literature studies
            showing triggering/intensification of REM sleep with
            arecoline. How much evidence do we need for these general
            claims: It should be noted that the REM altering, lucidity
            enhancing effects may be caused by a number of
            neurophysiological effects induced by these "smart drugs"
            besides Acetylcholinesterase inhibition. These include: 1.
            Using a cholinergic agonist (e.g., nicotine).<br>
            <br>
            [0018] 2. Using muscarinic receptor agonist: Drugs that
            mimic the effect of ACh on muscarinic receptors: Inc:
            muscarinic (M1), M2 and nicotinic Agonists. (Such as
            arecoline or Recoline, a muscarinic receptor agonist)3.
            Using an antagonist of presynaptic receptors to activate the
            remaining Acetylcholine neurons. (i.e. In rats, antisense
            oligonucleotide sequences that block Muscarinic M2 (but not
            M4) receptors increases extracellular Acetylcholine. This
            effect (Antisense nucleotide sequences are complementary to
            a sequence of messenger RNA. When antisense DNA or RNA is
            added to a cell, it binds to a specific messenger RNA
            molecule and inactivates it.) 4. Using allosteric modulators
            (such as allosterically potentiating ligands [APLs]) of
            Acetylcholine and nicotinic receptors (drugs that interact
            with the receptor through binding sites that are distinct
            from those for Acetylcholine and nicotinic agonists and
            antagonists).<br>
            <br>
            [0019] Other strategies for potentiating Acetylcholine
            function for dream lucidity enhancement, including the use
            of other classes of compound working in similar ways should
            be apparent to those skilled in the art from a consideration
            of the enclosed descriptions.<br>

            The invention relates to a method and apparatus for
            achieving and maintaining a lucid dream state. The process /
            device offers the possibility to achieve through the use of
            technical means the state of lucid dreaming (lucid dream).
            By this is meant that the dreaming of the state in which it
            is located, is aware that he would say that his present
            experience is a dream. This finding is a "normal" dreaming
            inaccessible. Furthermore, it offers / her the opportunity
            to retain or regain this status. First, the historical
            development of lucid dreaming is appreciated: While in the
            eastern culture very early discovered and applied the
            possibility of lucid dream experience - for Example, in the
            eighth century by Tibetan Buddhists, is this phenomenon in
            western culture until much later - the end of the 18th
            Century - at the moment few people attention. 1960-1970 was
            only about this topic in the modern scientific research
            input. In recent years, a relatively large number of related
            publications, published in academic journals and in book
            form. All methods for achieving lucid dreams described in
            this literature is based on the following principle. By
            frequently as possible (ideally permanent) Check the state
            of consciousness in the waking state (for Example, with the
            questions: Am I dreaming, I wake up? etc.) is a mental
            conditioning can be achieved on these issues, ie a special
            ability to buy this in the - that this finds its way into
            the dream experience hope - legitimate. This approach may
            thus lead to the desired result, namely the clear Will the
            dream, if the dream I have the same questions is how
            confident I am that day. However, experience shows that
            these practices are extremely laborious, requiring a lot of
            time, a very large degree of discipline and lead also
            unfortunately only rarely successful. It should be added
            that experience has shown that keeping the clarity of dream
            is often more difficult than achieving the same. The clarity
            is easily lost again and then you find yourself back in the
            normal dream state.<br>

            For the published prior art, the following is noted: From
            U.S. 5,507,716, U.S. 5,551,879 and FR 2,699,412 Devices and
            methods are known, with the help of lucid dreaming can be
            caused when a sleeping person. Here, the sleeping person are
            given through a face mask or a kind headband stimuli that
            should trigger a review of the state of consciousness. These
            devices offer the opportunity to register eye movements and
            thus REM sleep phases (here are more common dreams) to
            detect. If there is such, optical, or acoustic signals are
            triggered. However, these devices affect the one hand the
            sleeping person in their freedom of movement in no small
            measure, on the other hand, and this is very much a
            combination with the above described procedures appears (the
            conditioning during the waking state) and only to a limited
            extent, since they are not in the normal, everyday routine
            can be integrated. This possibility, DE 196 47 019 (same
            inventor / assignee as the present invention / application).
            It is the closest prior art. Here, a method and an apparatus
            is described which / to be applied during bedtime and waking
            the whole of a person. During the waking state the person
            (with the help of technical means, such, In the manner of a
            wristwatch with a vibration signal) to any selected time
            points (e.g. Example, using a random generator, so the user
            completely unexpected) External stimuli supplied. The using
            person checked at each stimulus their state of
            consciousness, ie there is a conditioning to that stimulus
            instead. If the person now mostly identical stimuli (which
            are below their awakening threshold, and are preferably
            added in the early morning hours because the longest and
            most frequent REM periods occur) during sleep is supplied,
            it will be on the learned on the day way (a conditioned
            reflex after learning theory) respond to this stimulus,
            namely by checking their state of consciousness, and they
            will then conclude with a good chance that they are dreaming
            must. At the times of the stimuli that are triggered in this
            process during sleep, the following should be noted: The
            charms can - take place in the (general) sleep state and may
            not necessarily fall into a REM stage - at any time.<br>
            <br>
            According to recent findings of the suppression Fund dream
            research is the equation of "dream sleep REM sleep equal"
            wrong. It is dreamed in all the other stages of sleep. If
            the stimuli do not fall into a dream state, the user notices
            nothing flat, and only the stimuli that fall into a dream
            state, lead to the desired effect. The proportion of time
            spent dreaming periods of total sleep duration is so high
            that even with a random choice of the timing of the stimuli
            fall enough stimuli to dream phases. The applicability of
            the first-mentioned three devices is essentially limited to
            the bedtime of a person and is mainly based on the
            scientifically validated knowledge that sleeping outside
            stimuli register. Since, as mentioned, a conditioning to the
            stimuli (light flashes, sounds) that are released from the
            sleep mask / the headband in the guard time hardly seems
            possible, the question remains on which way processes the
            person these charms in her dream, that is, opportunity with
            which these stimuli lead to a lucid dream. Significantly
            better chance to really achieve a lucid dream state also
            offers the DE 196 47 019 by the applicability of this device
            is extended to the whole waking state. The desired response
            in a dream to a stimulus (ie, checking the state of
            consciousness) can now be learned easily in the waking
            state. Based on this, the present invention seeks to provide
            a method and apparatus that / the shortened compared to the
            above methods / devices, the state of consciousness
            verification time and relieved and / the total increases the
            chance lucid dream states to reach. Furthermore, the / the
            present method / device to hold, or recovering the clarity
            in lucid dreams is to enable. This requirement of
            maintaining the clarity and of recovering the same is taken
            into account by any of the devices mentioned above. The
            object is achieved by a method having the features of claim
            1 and by an apparatus having the features of claim 23rd
            Advantageous embodiments are specified in the dependent
            claims.<br>
            <br>
            In DE 196 47 019 A method and apparatus is described in
            which the user's response to a single stimulus outside the
            review of the state of consciousness, ie, is a purely mental
            activity (in the waking state and during sleep). It is a
            simple, but fundamental difference between waking and dream
            states is neglected here, namely, that action leads in the
            waking state, as opposed to actions in the dream, to changes
            in the real environment. This makes the / the present method
            / device advantage. It / she offers the user the opportunity
            to advance in the specified Reizgebungsverfahren (ie, for
            Example, when, how and how long stimuli are given) to
            intervene at any time and to change it temporarily. The
            basic function is not affected by the surgery and will
            resume automatically once the operation is completed,
            possibly with a lag. On the one hand, a stimulus (of which
            the date for Was as specified by the base function) during
            the period in which it acts on the person changed, eg As it
            can be stopped by means of a special key, on the other hand
            can be triggered randomly at any time an extra stimulus.
            Trying to consciously acting to intervene in the
            Reizgebungsverfahren will succeed in the waking state, of
            course, but inevitably fail in the dream state. Thus, a
            situation is created which allows an immediate and clear
            assessment of the state in which it is located (waking state
            or dream state). Succeed the test of the intervention (eg
            Example, by stopping a currently occurring stimulus), one
            knows one is awake. If you fail the test, you know that you
            must be dreaming. The sometimes lengthy Check the currently
            experienced situation with the doubts and uncertainties that
            occur often omitted, the desired state assignment is
            immediately possible and absolutely clear now. Become
            stimuli triggered while the user is already in an at least
            partially lucid dream state, in this case the failure of the
            attempts at transforming the stimuli for strengthening,
            recovering and maintaining the clarity will be extremely
            helpful. A common, custom steady release of the above
            mentioned extra stimulus in the waking state, the dream
            state also lead to more frequent attempts to initiate this
            stimulus. The inevitable failure of this option also allows
            an immediate and clear state assignment. This increases the
            chance again, using the / of the present method / device to
            achieve or maintain lucid dream states. Even with these
            extra stimuli is of course the possibility of change of
            stimuli, which further increases the chances of success /
            the method / apparatus. Very useful, the ability to trigger
            an extra stimulus, also for the following reason.<br>
            <br>
            As already mentioned, the holding of clarity during a lucid
            dream is often more difficult than achieving the same. Is
            now in such a time of doubt and danger of losing the
            clarity, trying to trigger an extra stimulus, the clarity is
            either recovered immediately, or if, contrary to
            expectations should not occur alone the associated view, the
            feeling, the hands very helpful (when using the device in
            the form of a wristwatch), since according to the initially
            mentioned method for achieving lucid dream state is a very
            important method for maintaining the clarity without
            technical aids viewing and feeling of the hands.<br>
            <br>
            This is equally well with the above-mentioned possibility of
            change (eg Example of stopping) of a single stimulus of
            importance. The / the inventive method / device offers a
            more substantial relief to preserve the clarity. It / she
            offers the possibility to follow up on every single stimulus
            automatically in certain, freely selectable intervals other
            stimuli. Thus, a single stimulus of such B. 5 to 10 sec
            Duration at a distance of, for As one or two minutes a
            further stimulus 5-10 sec Duration done, etc. Instead of a
            single stimulus is now seen as a consequence of stimuli
            (duration, for B. 5 to 10 min) cast. Here, (abandonment of a
            single stimulus) also such a sequence of stimuli to be
            completed (while awake) with the above-mentioned stop
            button.<br>
            <br>
            As in the dream state, such a termination is not possible,
            such a sequence of stimuli, if the clarity threatens to be
            lost, be very helpful to keep or regain this.<br>
            Can reaching the clarity such a sequence of stimuli to be
            extremely helpful, if first stimuli should not have led to
            the desired effect, if such B. did not fall into a dream
            state, or the clarity was only partially achieved.
            Furthermore, such a sequence of stimuli - according to the
            way the individual stimulus - be triggered at an arbitrarily
            selectable time. This may, for As happened with a special
            key. Here, an arbitrary delay (for , 5 to 30 min) to the
            first stimulus of the sequence begins, can be specified.
            Pressing this hot key so leads with a time delay to a
            sequence of individual stimuli.<br>
            <br>
            It is known that the falling-asleep, whether in the evening,
            with interruptions (especially in the early morning hours)
            or during an afternoon nap in a special degree to is to
            achieve a more or less direct transition from twilight in a
            lucid dream. Here, such a sequence of individual stimuli be
            with delayed onset a very big help to achieve the clarity
            and keep. According to one embodiment, each breaks again
            press this button, the currently running special sequence of
            stimuli, even during the lag phase, from, and will
            automatically reboot with the given initial conditions. This
            is very useful if you are not asleep during the selected
            time delay. The very significant advantage of this
            opportunity, a sequence of stimuli delayed the onset of a
            stimulus sequence, is that herewith - as opposed to random
            on the night distributed stimuli or stimulus sequences - a
            triggering stimuli to times when the chances of success very
            high are is selectively enabled. The device, as described in
            DE 196 47 019 can also be combined with other devices, and
            give due to physiological measurement data stimuli or
            stimulus consequences. These measurement data of the other
            devices may be, for Example, to rapid eye movement (REM),
            act REM sleep EEG, heart rate increase, etc.. Additional
            devices may be external or integrated in the device, for
            Example, as a heart rate monitor. Default settings for the
            device, such As stimulus duration, stimulus timings etc. can
            be preset, on the device itself, or for B. also be a
            connection to a PC with appropriately developed software to
            be entered or changed. For the purpose of / the method /
            apparatus following may be cited: First, it should be
            mentioned here that so far are not aware of any negative
            side effects of lucid dreaming. Experiencing a lucid dream
            is consistently (which incidentally mentioned very clearly
            is) very pleasant and dream about the experience, as well as
            in the subsequent memory in the waking state, as experienced
            "mind-expanding". This alone makes the commercial utility of
            this device, specifically for home users, more than clear.<br>
            <br>
            Furthermore, there are many possible applications in the
            field of epistemological research, especially of
            consciousness research, as well as in use in the
            psychotherapeutic treatment (eg Example, nightmares).

            The method involves giving a number of stimuli to a person,
            which can be recognised through one of his senses. The
            person's response to the stimuli give proof of the conscious
            state of the person and conditions the person's response, as
            a conditioned reflex. When this person is in a state of
            sleep, the same stimuli are given to him to evoke the same
            responses as those which were obtained while he was awake.
            The response to the stimuli bring about a state of lucid
            dreaming in which the person knows that what he experiences

            means the state of lucid dreaming (lucid dream) reach.<br>
            By this is meant that the dreaming of the state in which it
            is located, is aware that he would say that his present
            experience is a dream.<br>
            This finding is a "normal" dreaming inaccessible.<br>

            Historical development of lucid dreaming <br>
            <br>
            While in the eastern culture very early discovered and
            applied the possibility of lucid dream experience - for
            Example, in the eighth century by Tibetan Buddhists
            (Gillespie, G. (1988) Lucid dreams in Tibetan Buddhism. In:

            until much later - the end of the 18th Century (LaBerge, S.

            exclusively in the English language with lucid dreaming, but
            there are German translations of some books before that, for
            the German research and public Currently, however, still
            receive little attention.<br>
            <br>
            State of "technology" to achieve the lucid dream state<br>
            <br>
            The previously known and applied by few persons methods to
            achieve lucid dreams are all based on autosuggestion. The
            ability to dream lucid (clear, ie conscious) can be only one
            "work on themselves" are obtained in the waking state. The
            principle underlying all these methods is the following: By
            frequently as possible (ideally permanent) Check the current
            state of consciousness - the real experience - a day (for
            Example, with the following questions: Am I dreaming? I wake
            up? Where am I? How old am I? Is it the person with whom I
            speak at the moment in my current life, or was there it at
            an earlier time? Do I have to wonder about anything? Etc
            ...) to a mental conditioning to be made on these issues, ie
            a special ability to buy and this in the hope that this
            finds its way into the dream experience. This hope is
            justified, since it is known that recur both everyday and
            especially intensely felt experiences of the day as
            so-called day residue in dreams (Freud, S. (1925) The
            Interpretation of Dreams, after the issue of 1972. Frankfurt
            am Main: Fischer Taschenbuch Verlag, 1991; dressing and

            Shortened REM latency: A Consequence of psychological
            strain. Psychophysiology 24, 262-271). This approach may
            thus lead to the desired result, namely the clear Will the
            dream, if the dream I have the same questions is how
            confident I am that day (detailed explanation and
            description of these procedures is given, for Example, Green
            (1994)).<br>
            <br>
            These procedures are according to experience extremely
            laborious, requiring a lot of time, a very large degree of

            times a month, the state of lucid dreaming . One author
            reported three lucid dreams in eight years constant effort
            (Myers (1887)). From U.S. 5,507,716 Devices and methods are

            Here, the sleeping person will be given a sleeping mask

            Many people will this / allow s method / device to achieve
            lucid dreams in the first place. The / the new process /
            device based on principles of learning theory, it is a
            training for practicing a conditioned reflex (eg Textbook
            example of the psychology of Medinzinischen sink, H. et al
            (1977), Munich, Vienna, Baltimore: Urban and Schwarzenberg;

            Springer Verlag). <br>
            <br>
            In the waking state are the using person - given stimuli
            whose time points for - preferably from outside As
            determined by a random generator. The individual charm
            reminds the person from their current intense state of
            consciousness (I watch? Am I dreaming? Etc ...) to question,
            ie the using person conditioned to this stimulus, in other
            words, it learns in the waking state to a certain stimulus
            with a very specific answer to respond, namely by
            questioning their current state of consciousness intense.
            This requires only a period of a few seconds. These charms
            are for both day , 10 to 20 times repeated during a more or
            less constant repetition is necessary in the methods used so
            far. According to scientific learning theory can be no doubt
            about the success of the vorzustellenden method. It may be
            mentioned here because of its popularity, the experiment of
            Pavlov.<br>
            This has the concept of classical conditioning, ie the
            formation of a conditioned reflex, already in 1900 set up
            (animal experiments).<br>
            <br>
            Many subsequent studies have confirmed the validity of this
            learning principle for humans (Textbook of Medical
            Psychology, Enke, 1977; psychology textbook, Zimbardo /
            Ruch, 1978). The basic idea of the method / apparatus based
            on the fact that the learned in the waking state conditioned
            reflex can also cause during a dream, as the ability to
            react to stimuli, obtained even in the absence waking
            consciousness is like the dream research proves (shrub /
            Meier (1992) The dreams on the track. Results of
            experimental dream research, Bern: Verlag Hans Huber). For
            these reasons, there can be no doubt about the success of
            the vorzustellenden method.<br>
            <br>
            For the purposes of / the method / apparatus does this mean
            the following. During sleep preferably identical outer
            stimuli are as given in the waking state. The intensity of
            the external stimuli is determined by the using person in
            the waking state so that these stimuli remain under their
            awakening threshold, but are nevertheless perceived by her
            in the dream state. (Ie, checking the state of
            consciousness, which with very good chance now leads to the
            conclusion that the dreamer on the basis of diverse
            absurdities of dream events come to the conclusion that he
            must be in a dream) allows the learned in the waking state
            response to this stimulus so the transition to the lucid
            dream experience. As with any technology device, and A
            method (for As cycling, driving a car), the handling must
            therefore be learned here, with the effort to keep
            discipline, effort and time with the / procedures / device
            within narrow limits. According to the current state of
            knowledge of research on the learning of a conditioned
            reflex is the first occurrence of lucid dreams after days,
            or later than expected a few weeks, depending on the
            susceptibility of using person. In the further application
            of the device, the user will in many cases after a certain
            time can (with increasing learning effect) waive the
            application of the waking state.<br>
            <br>
            The purpose&nbsp; of the apparatus<br>
            <br>
            First to be on negative effects of lucid dreaming, which
            could possibly be feared, received here. A short-term risk
            factor could be seen in an impairment of the normal recovery
            function of sleep. Furthermore, would imagine that lucid
            dreaming could in the longer those for user people have a
            negative effect on the attitude towards daily life.<br>
            <br>
            The current state of knowledge, the research provides no
            evidence for both fears (for detailed discussion on the
            subject in Green 1994). Experiencing a lucid dream is
            consistently experienced by lucid dreamers to be very
            pleasant and as for the waking experience and the dream
            experience as "mind-expanding". This already established the
            existence of a commercial utility of this / method /
            apparatus, since it opens up the possibility connected with
            very little effort, a new "dimension" of experiencing
            interested persons, and thus can also offer the opportunity
            for personal development. Moreover, great opportunities in
            the epistemological research and consciousness research
            results. Likewise, several possibilities are conceivable to
            incorporate lucid dreaming into the psychotherapeutic
            treatment of patients. So good results in the treatment of
            nightmares have already shown that in patients with
            nightmares of unknown cause in patients with post-traumatic
            appearance (such Example, after an accident, rape, torture,
            etc.), and do not forget to children and young people who
            often suffer from nightmares, lucid dreaming could be a very
            promising treatment approach (detailed in Green 1994). But
            here it is again emphasized that the vorzustellende
            invention can be applied by anyone without risk, so it is an
            invention for personal use and not a medical device.
            Overall, let the many possibilities that could provide lucid
            dreaming, according to experts at the time not yet
            foresee...<br>

            Equipment and methods employed to assist people to achieve
            lucid dreams (dreams in which one is aware that one is
            dreaming) function by detecting and monitoring the eye and
            head movements of sleeping persons for the presence of
            sufficient eye movement activity in the absence of head
            movement to indicate the presence of REM sleep and then
            applying sensory stimuli to sleepers in REM sleep, which if
            incorporated into their dreams, can cue them that they are
            dreaming without producing awakening. With this equipment
            and methods, people are able to have more lucid dreams than
            they otherwise would. A preferred embodiment includes a face
            mask that contains two infrared emitter-detector pairs, one
            for sensing eye movements and one for sensing body
            movements, a state-test button, and components that produce
            low intensity sensory stimuli such as light and sound. A
            microprocessor monitors the fluctuating voltage from the
            infrared pairs for the occurrence of a predetermined
            sequence of voltages, adjustable in software, and when the
            correct sequence occurs, triggers the stimuli-producing
            components in the mask into activity, to cue the sleeper to
            become lucid. The methods include many procedures and
            adjustable parameters for optimizing the timing of the
            application of the sensory cues to the sleeper. Among these
            procedures and parameters are those used to locate the time
            in the sleeper's REM periods when the cue will be most
            effective, and those used to apply the sensory stimuli at
            these optimal times.<br>
            <br>
            <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            As set forth in the book entitled Exploring the World of
            Lucid Dreaming, written by Stephen LaBerge and Howard
            Rheingold, the idea of cultivating a state of mind while
            awake for the purpose of carrying it into a dream state as a
            means of inducing lucid dreams, has been used by Tibetan
            Buddhists for more than a thousand years. However as
            recently as the late 1970's, experts were convinced that
            dreaming with consciousness that you were dreaming was a
            contradiction in terms and therefore impossible. At this
            recent time Stephen LaBerge began his Ph.D. studies of lucid
            dreams at Stanford University to establish proof that lucid
            dreaming was real, by obtaining evidence from the dream
            world that a person knew he or she was dreaming during
            sleep.<br>
            <br>
            During his studies, he, with the assistance of other
            persons, has developed experimental testing equipment for
            helping him and other persons to obtain such evidence from
            the dream world. In so doing, the developed experimental
            testing equipment, in many embodiments, has also been
            designed and built to help persons who are lucid dreamers,
            or wish to try to become lucid dreamers, to have lucid
            dreams and to have them more often and to have them more
            effectively. These lucid dreamers are referred to as being
            Oneironauts.<br>
            <br>
            Also other persons have developed equipment, such as Keith
            M. T. Hearne who illustrated and described his respiratory
            measuring device in his U.S. Pat. No. 4,420,001 of 1983. His
            device sensed temperature changes of a person's respiration
            in his or her breathing passageway, or in airflows to and
            from his or her breathing passageway. Thermistors were used,
            in an electrical circuit, to sense the temperature changes
            of the person's respiration. When the rate of these
            temperature changes reached a high predetermined level, the
            signals created in the electrical circuit initiated an
            audible sound, either to help arouse a sleeping person from
            an unpleasant dream by awaking them or to help them enter
            into a lucid dream state.<br>
            <br>
            At this time, a number of different techniques have been
            used to monitor sleep, in both the quiet phase and active
            phase, the latter also being called the rapid eye movement
            phase of sleep and referred to as REM sleep. These
            techniques include applications of: electrodes for EEG, ECG
            and EMG; infra-red sensing; and respiration measurement with
            strain-gauges or thermistors. Among these techniques,
            Stephen LaBerge and those helping him sought a method to
            reliably sense the presence of REM sleep, so that a device
            could automatically signal to a sleeper that he or she is
            dreaming. The requirements for such a device were
            portability, ease of use, low cost, and above all
            reliability and the successful induction of lucid dreams,
            which are those dreams wherein one is aware that one is
            dreaming.<br>
            <br>
            <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
            </b><br>
            Stephen LaBerge and those helping him created better methods
            to help persons lucidly dream, and, in so doing, he and
            those helping him developed various embodiments of
            experimental test equipment that is used to make sleeping
            persons aware they are in the active phase of their sleep,
            and they are having a dream, while they still continue to
            dream or become lucid, and such equipment senses eye
            movements. They selected sensing movements of a person's
            eyes, via movement of his or her eyelids, because by using
            eye movement sensing, especially when combined with body
            movement sensing, and thereafter accounting for such body
            movements, to thereby ascertain accurately eye movements,
            per se, they developed very reliable test equipment for
            detecting the phases of sleep, and especially the active
            phase of sleep, called the rapid eye movement phase, which
            is further conveniently referred to as being REM sleep.<br>
            <br>
            Their development of their methods and the experimental test
            equipment centering on eye movement sensing, undertaken by
            sensing eyelid movements, which so indicate eye movements,
            extended over a considerable period of time. Now equipment
            is soon to be made available for many persons to use in
            practicing their methods. In respect to a preferred
            embodiment of the equipment each person, during his or her
            sleep, is provided with a comfortably worn face mask
            covering face portions, and a headband supports the face
            mask about the person's head. The face mask, in turn,
            supports components of this equipment, which sense a
            person's eyelid movements during sleep, and which, then at
            the proper time, signals the person that he or she is
            dreaming, and thus should be able to be lucidly dreaming.
            The signal, preferably a light signal, occurs without
            awaking the person. Also a sound signal is selectively and
            optionally used.<br>
            <br>
            The sensing components supported on the face mask utilize a
            low level infrared emitter positioned on the face mask to
            direct infrared light to the eyelid of a sleeping person,
            and a low level infrared detector to receive the reflections
            of this infrared light from the surface of this eyelid of
            this sleeping person. The signalling components supported on
            the face mask preferably utilize small flashable lights
            and/or small speakers to signal the sleeping person that he
            or she is dreaming, and thus should be able to be lucidly
            dreaming, without awaking the person.<br>
            <br>
            A like arrangement of a low level infrared emitter, also
            positioned and supported on the face mask, but over a part
            of a person's face, which does not necessarily move with a
            person's eyelids, is also used with a low level infrared
            detector also positioned and supported on the mask, to
            detect face, head, or body movements, which are independent
            of a person's eyelid movements. These body movements are
            accounted for to avoid erroneous conclusions as to the
            eyelid movements, per se, and thereby to accurately
            determine whether or not a person is dreaming, or could be
            lucidly dreaming.<br>
            <br>
            The other components of this preferred embodiment of the
            equipment are arranged together as a shelf or table
            supported subassembly, with circuitry extending to the
            sensing and signalling components supported and positioned
            on the face mask, These other components include: analog
            signal conditioning group of components, in turn including
            alternating current coupling, a preamplifier, a low pass
            filter, a computer gain setting unit, and an integrating
            unit to receive signals from the infrared detector detecting
            eyelid movements; an analog-digital converter for converting
            the analog signals of the eyelid movements into digital
            signals; analog signal conditioning group of components, in
            turn including an alternating current coupling, a
            preamplifier, a low pass filter, a computer gain setting
            unit, and an integrating unit to receive signals from
            another infrared detector, detecting face, head, and/or body
            movements; an analog-digital converter for converting the
            analog signals of the face, head, and/or body movements into
            digital signals; a computer to receive the digital signal
            information from both the analog-digital converters, to
            receive signals via software instructions, to direct data to
            data storage, to direct signals to activate sensing lights,
            and to activate sensing speaker sounds...<br>
