      Extra-virgin olive oil contains an ingredient, oleocanthal, that
      kills cancer cells without harming healthy cells, researchers have
      found.<br>
      <br>
      A Rutgers nutritional scientist and two cancer biologists at New
      York City’s Hunter College have found that an ingredient in
      extra-virgin olive oil kills a variety of human cancer cells
      without harming healthy cells.<br>
      <br>
      The ingredient is oleocanthal, a compound that ruptures a part of
      the cancerous cell, releasing enzymes that cause cell death.<br>
      <br>
      Paul Breslin, professor of nutritional sciences in the School of
      Environmental and Biological Sciences, and David Foster and Onica
      LeGendre of Hunter College, report that oleocanthal kills
      cancerous cells in the laboratory by rupturing vesicles that store
      the cell’s waste. LeGendre, the first author, Foster, the senior
      author, and Breslin have published their findings in Molecular and
      Cellular Oncology.<br>
      <br>
      According to the World Health Organization’s World Cancer Report
      2014, there were more than 14 million new cases of cancer in 2012
      and more than 8 million deaths.<br>
      <br>
      Scientists knew that oleocanthal killed some cancer cells, but no
      one really understood how this occurred. Breslin believed that
      oleocanthal might be targeting a key protein in cancer cells that
      triggers a programmed cell death, known as apoptosis, and worked
      with Foster and Legendre to test his hypothesis after meeting
      David Foster at a seminar he gave at Rutgers.<br>
      <br>
      “We needed to determine if oleocanthal was targeting that protein
      and causing the cells to die,” Breslin said. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      After applying oleocanthal to the cancer cells, Foster and
      LeGendre discovered that the cancer cells were dying very quickly
      – within 30 minutes to an hour. Since programmed cell death takes
      between 16 and 24 hours, the scientists realized that something
      else had to be causing the cancer cells to break down and die.<br>
      <br>
      LeGendre, a chemist, provided the answer: The cancer cells were
      being killed by their own enzymes. The oleocanthal was puncturing
      the vesicles inside the cancer cells that store the cell’s waste –
      the cell’s “dumpster,” as Breslin called it, or “recycling
      center,” as Foster refers to it. These vesicles, known as
      lysosomes are larger in cancer cells than in healthy cells, and
      they contain a lot of waste. “Once you open one of those things,
      all hell breaks loose,” Breslin said.<br>
      <br>
      But oleocanthal didn’t harm healthy cells, the researchers found.
      It merely stopped their life cycles temporarily – “put them to
      sleep,” Breslin said. After a day, the healthy cells resumed their
      cycles. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The researchers say the logical next step is to go beyond
      laboratory conditions and show that oleocanthal can kill cancer
      cells and shrink tumors in living animals. “We also need to
      understand why it is that cancerous cells are more sensitive to
      oleocanthal than non-cancerous cells,” Foster said.<br>

          <b>Extraction of oleocanthal from virgin olive oil</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Process for enriching an extract containing oleocanthal, comprises
      forming a bisulfite compound by mixing the extract with a
      bisulfite of alkaline or alkaline earth metal or quaternary
      ammonium and eliminating the derivatives that are not reacting
      with the bisulfite, and deprotecting the bisulfite compound. An
      independent claim is included for a process for extracting
      oleocanthal from virgin olive oil, comprising preparing an extract
      containing oleocanthal, and enriching the extract by implementing
      the above process.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a novel process for enriching an
      extract containing oleocanthal likely to provide extracts high in
      oleocanthal, and a new method for extracting oleocanthal from
      olive oil. Maintaining the health and comfort of life has become a
      major concern of developed country populations. This results in
      growing demand for medicines, medical care and quality controlled
      food products. In particular, in the field of food, much research
      has been devoted to food supplements and supplements, leading the
      development of areas of "nutraceuticals" and "functional foods"
      for the development of food or supplements food intended to
      promote biological functions affected by aging. In addition,
      consumers are looking for today increasingly natural products or
      natural origin that has been treated as little denaturing as
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      Epidemiological studies have shown the beneficial health effects
      of the Mediterranean diet plans that include a high intake of
      fiber, fruits, vegetables, and olive oil is the main source of
      fat. Olive oil in particular contain mono-unsaturated fatty acids
      (oleic acid) as well as phenolic compounds which have the effect
      of delaying the oxidation of LDL cholesterol. Among these phenolic
      compounds, there are phenolic alcohols, such as tyrosol and
      hydroxytyrosol, benzoic acids, caffeic acid and esterified with
      elenolic tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol and flavonoids such as
      flavonols and flavones. Patent FR 2825022 describes a method for
      recovery of aqueous phase in processes for the preparation of
      olive oil by extraction of polyphenols contained therein for use
      in dietetic and cosmetic compositions. P. Andrews et al., J.
      Agric. Food Chem. 51: 5, 1415-1420 (2003) have shown that olive
      oil contains a phenolic derivative B1704FR 2 particular, namely
      deacetoxy ligstroside aglycone, which is responsible for its
      typical taste. G. K. Beauchamp et al. Nature, Vol. 437, 45-46
      (Sept. 2005), showed that the aglycone deacetoxy ligstroside or
      oleocanthal contained in virgin olive oil obtained by cold
      pressed, this inhibitory properties COX1 and COX2 enzymes, c ' is
      to say, neighboring antiinflammatory properties than ibuprofen
      molecule used for many years as anti-inflammatory drug
      non-stéroidieri. These oleocanthal the properties are also
      disclosed in WO 2006122128. The oleocanthal or deacetoxy
      ligstroside-aglycone, was detected in olive oils from various
      sources, particularly in virgin olive oil obtained by cold
      pressing at very low concentrations generally vary from 200 ppm
      (mass) or 0.002 to 0.02% by weight, depending on the origin of the
      olive oil.<br>
      <br>
      It can be represented by the general formula (I): HO 0 (I) A
      pharmaceutical or nutraceutical use of this compound requires the
      acquisition of more concentrated fractions. Moreover, oleocanthal
      is a very fragile product, easily destroyed by heat and oxidation,
      as are also the most other polyphenolic compounds naturally
      present in vegetable oils. Various methods for extracting phenolic
      compounds in olive oil were compared by Montedoro G. et al., J.
      Agric. Food Chem., 1992, 40, 9, 1571- 1576. According to the
      authors, to be optimal, extraction should be made with a methanol
      / water mixture 80/20. 3 B1704FR the purification of the extract
      is then performed by washing with hexane to extract solubilized in
      acetonitrile. However, the authors have optimized this method
      compared to total phenolic compounds in olive oil, and their study
      is not directly transposable to obtain extracts rich in
      oleocanthal.<br>
      In addition, a significant portion of the triglyceride compounds
      is still present even after purification. Other purifications
      oleocanthal are described in the literature. They use
      systematically purifications by chromatography on a glass plate,
      on open column, or by preparative chromatography, and are for the
      purpose of obtaining the product purified for characterization.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the amount of oleocanthal in olive oil is very low (20 to
      20C) is 0.002 ppm to 0.02% of oleocanthal), it is difficult to
      obtain an extract enriched enough oleocanthal without using the
      chromatographic methods.<br>
      <br>
      It is therefore desirable to develop a process for obtaining
      extracts high in oleocanthal content. Studies conducted by the
      applicant showed that it is possible to effectively enrich an
      extract containing oleocanthal including through the formation of
      intermediate compounds bisulfite. The present invention relates to
      a process for enriching a particular extract containing
      oleocanthal may provide extracts which oleocanthal content is
      greater than or equal to about 30%. The present invention also
      provides a process for enriching a sample containing oleocanthal,
      providing an extract titrated oleocanthal greater than 90% free of
      triglyceride compounds and pheno-lic impurities, in particular of
      tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. The present invention also relates to
      a method of extraction and enrichment of oleocanthal from virgin
      olive oil, preferably virgin olive oil B1704FR prepared by first
      cold pressing, providing a titrated extract oleocanthal in greater
      than 10% and can go beyond 90%.<br>
      <br>
      The enrichment process a sample containing oleocanthal according
      to the present invention comprises the following successive steps.
      a) forming a bisulfite compound by mixing said extract with an
      alkali metal sulfite or alkaline earth metal or quaternary
      ammonium, e.g., sodium bisulfite, and elimination derivatives
      unreacted with said bisulfite; b) deprotection of the bisulfite
      compound. Step a) comprises the formation of a bisulfite compound
      intermediate. In general, the term bisulfite compound a compound
      obtained by alkali metal bisulfite addition or alkaline earth
      metal or quaternary ammonium on aldehydes or ketones. Removal of
      the derivatives that do not react with the bisulfite is preferably
      carried out by liquid / liquid extraction. Step b) of the process
      according to the invention consists of deprotection of the
      bisulfite compound. This deprotection may be carried out in acidic
      medium, in a basic medium or in the presence of a silylating
      agent, in particular chlorotrimethylsilane.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the oleocanthal used initially
      containing extract is in the form of a yellowish oil, and mixing
      said extract with bisulfite is carried out by solubilization of
      the extract in an aqueous solution of bisulfite, possible - 30
      LEMENT mixed with a solvent or mixture of solvents miscible with
      water. These solvents may be selected from alkyl acetates,
      alcohols or acetonitrile. It can be a sodium bisulfite solution
      composed of a mixture of water and ethanol. 35 According to this
      embodiment, the amount of bisulfite, preferably sodium bisulfite,
      may be calculated so as to selectively form the bisulphite salts
      oleocanthal (I) of ligstroside aglycone B1704FR derivative
      represented by the formula (II) -dessous, and derivatives of
      oleuropein aglycone represented by the formulas (III) and (IV)
      below. 5 HO o // o ~~ H3CO2C (II) CHO CH3 HO HO HO H3CO2C YY1
      derivatives which do not have aldehyde (e.g., 1 -
      acétoxypinorésinol and pinoresinol) or which have not reacted with
      bisulfite of sodium are then removed by liquid / liquid extraction
      using a solvent immiscible with water, in particular using
      dichloro-methane 15 or ethyl acetate.<br>
      <br>
      The bisulfite compound is then obtained by evaporating the aqueous
      phase. After deprotection, a mixture is obtained wherein
      oleocanthal prevails and the compounds of formula (I: I), (III)
      and (IV) are present in substantially equivalent 20. The process
      just described can achieve an extract having a high content of
      oleocanthal, on the order of at least 30%, and without B1704FR
      (IV) 6 intervene organic chemical reagents whose use produces
      adverse effects on the environment. According to an advantageous
      variant of the process according to the invention may be provided
      in addition, between steps a) and b), a selective precipitation
      step of the bisulfite compound of oleocanthal. This selective
      precipitation step which occurs before the deprotection step, aims
      to obtain selectively oleocanthal thereby increasing significantly
      its content in the final extract compared to the original extract.<br>
      <br>
      The implementation of this step may allow in fact to obtain an
      extract of oleocanthal purity greater than 90%. In one embodiment,
      the selective precipitation step is carried out by solubilization
      of the bisulfite compound in water or in an alcohol, for example
      methanol, and then selective precipitation of the bisulfite
      compound of oleocanthal by a non-solvent preferably selected from
      the group consisting of alkyl acetates, ethers, ketones and
      acetonitrile, ethyl ether being particularly preferred. In this
      variant, bisulfite compound deprotection step is then performed as
      described above. In another aspect, the invention relates to a
      process for extracting oleocanthal from virgin olive oil, which
      consists of preparing an extract containing oleocanthal, said
      extract and enrich implementing the enrichment process as
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      In a preferred embodiment, the preparation of said extract
      comprises the following successive steps: - addition of a
      hydrocarbon in olive oil; extraction with a mixture of binary
      solvent water / alcohol or acetone, or ternary water / alcohol or
      acetone / solvent immiscible with water; removal of organic phase
      and total or partial concentration of the aqueous phase 35. The
      step of adding the hydrocarbon in olive oil helps to facilitate
      separation between the organic phase and the aqueous phase. The
      hydrocarbon used may include 5 B1704FR 7 to 10 carbon atoms and is
      preferably selected from the group consisting of hexane,
      cyclohexane and heptane. For the implementation of the following
      extraction step, in the case of a binary mixture of water /
      alcohol solvents, the alcohol is selected preferably from the
      group consisting of methanol, ethanol, n- propanol, isopropanol.<br>
      <br>
      When using a ternary mixture of solvents water / alcohol or
      acetone / solvent immiscible with water, it may be for example a
      chlorinated solvent, a ketone or an alkyl acetate. The chlorinated
      solvent generally has 1 to 8 carbon atoms and may be selected
      preferably from the group consisting of dichloromethane,
      chloroform and chlorocyclohexane, the ketone preferably has from 4
      to 8 carbon atoms and can be selected from the group consisting of
      methyl and pentanones, and alkyl acetate generally contains from 3
      to 8 carbon atoms and is preferably methyl acetate or ethyl.
      Solvent proportions used may vary depending on operating
      conditions, but they are general-ment between 80/20 and 40/60 in
      the case of a binary mixture of water / alcohol or acetone, and is
      advantageously used for example a mixture of water / methanol
      60/40. The next step of partially purified extract and effectively
      remove components entrained during extraction whose
      physicochemical properties are close to those of oleocanthal.<br>
      <br>
      This step is crucial to obtain an extract with a high
      concentration oleocanthal.<br>
      <br>
      The concentration of the extract may be complete by performing
      evaporation to dryness so as to obtain a dry extract, which is
      then used in the enrichment step. In case of partial
      concentration, it is advantageous to then carry out a
      centrifugation step before proceeding to the enrichment step.
      Partial concentration of the rate must be at least 50%. The
      enrichment process described in particular allows to isolate
      oleocanthal almost all other B1704FR 8 phenolic compounds
      originally present in olive oil. These include phenolic alcohols
      such as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol; free acid of the benzoic acid
      series such as protocatechuic acid, gallic, vanillic, syringic, or
      cinnamic series such as pcoumarique acids, caffeic, sinapic and;
      esterified derivatives of caffeic acid (verbascoside) or elenolic
      acid (oleuropein glycosylated or not, responsible for much of the
      bitterness of olive oil), these two acids being esterified or
      tyrosol hydroxytyrosol; and finally flavonoids such as flavones
      (luteolin) and flavonols (quercetin and kaemférol glycosylated or
      not).<br>
      <br>
      The oleocanthal is also isolated from other components in olive
      oil such as hydrocarbons (eg squalene), sterols (eg R-sitosterol),
      triterpene alcohols, and tocopherol (in the form a, p and y). It
      is particularly interesting to note that the extract obtained
      contains oleocanthal strongly predominant phenolic compound as
      well as small amounts of aglycone derivatives of oleuropein and
      ligstroside aglycone, whereas tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol and their
      derivatives in particular acetates, are completely eliminated, as
      well as triglyceride compounds. As mentioned above, according to
      the variant used, the method of the invention allows to obtain an
      extract containing not only oleocanthal with a content of at least
      30% by weight, but ausssi derivatives aglycone oleuropein and
      aglycone ligstroside in significant amounts. The proportions of
      these four compounds may be substantially equivalent.<br>
      <br>
      Such an extract containing them may be of economic interest. The
      following examples illustrate the invention in more detail without
      limiting its scope. Unless otherwise indicated, ratios and
      percentages are by weight. B1704FR 9 Example 1 Preparation of an
      extract containing oleocanthal from olive oil This example
      describes the extraction of oleocanthal May 1 mixture of binary
      solvents. From a containing 56 mg olive oil oleocanthal per
      kilogram firstly an extraction as described below. In a 50 liter
      reactor was charged with 10 kg of olive oil 10 and 20 liters of
      cyclohexane. Leer for liquid / liquid extraction is added 20
      liters of methanol / water 40/60 v / v and stirred medium at room
      temperature for 5 minutes and then allowed to settle the two
      phases. The extraction is repeated a 15 second time under the same
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Is added to the first aqueous phase 20 liters of cyclohexane. The
      medium is stirred at room temperature for 5 minutes then allowed
      to settle the two phases. Is carried out a second washing of the
      aqueous phase 20 with the same cyclohexane phase. The two aqueous
      phases are pooled and concentrated by evaporation to dryness by
      not exceeding 40 C in the bath (an oil). This gives about 4.7 g of
      extract 12% to 25 oleocanthal. Example 2 Formation of the
      bisulfite compound and deprotection in acid medium is prepared
      fresh solution of sodium bisulfite in 30 dissolving 0.817 g in 100
      ml of water (molecular weight: 104.06 g / mol, 7,85.10-2 mole per
      liter) . 20 ml of dilute aqueous sodium bisulfite (1,57.10-3 mole
      bisulfite) to the appropriate amount of extract containing
      approximately 400 mg of oleocanthal 35 (molecular weight: 304.13 g
      / mol, 1,31.10 -3 mol), obtained according to the procedure
      described in Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      If the medium is too heterogeneous, a small amount of ethanol is
      added 10 B1704FR. The solution is stirred at room temperature for
      1 hour. If ethanol is added, it is evaporated in a rotary
      evaporator.<br>
      <br>
      Then directs liquid / liquid water / dichloromethane the resulting
      aqueous phase to remove the derivatives having no aldehyde
      functions or unreacted with bisulfite. The aqueous phase is
      evaporated in a rotary evaporator, and obtained a residue A. The
      obtained R residue is taken up the minimum volume of dilute HC1
      solution (pH 3 to 5) for a total solubility of the product. Is
      allowed to react the reaction mixture stirred 15 for 30 minutes at
      room temperature. The solution is extracted 3 times with an equal
      volume of dichloromethane. Then dried over Na2SO4, the
      dichloromethane layers combined, then the solution is filtered and

      The invention discloses a method for extracting oleocanthal from
      olive oil. The method comprises the steps as follows: water is
      added to the olive oil and modified starch for mixing, and then
      the mixture is subjected to spray drying; subcritical extraction
      is performed twice with a fluid formed by propane and dimethyl
      ether in a weight ratio of (40-60):(40-60) serving as an
      extracting agent; the subcritical extraction is performed again
      with absolute ethyl alcohol serving as an extracting agent; and
      spray drying is performed after an extraction liquid is
      concentrated,, so that a finished product is prepared.; According
      to the method, the extraction process is simple, the usage amount
      of an organic solvent is small, the residual quantity is low, the
      final product yield is about 2%, the content can reach 30%-40%,
      and the oleocanthal with higher quality is effectively obtained
      from the olive oil which is difficult to extract.<br>

      ratio of 40～60:40～60 as twice of extraction agent sub critical
      extraction, take dehydrated alcohol as extraction agent sub
      critical extraction again again, after extracting solution is
      concentrated, spraying drying makes finished product.Extraction
      process of the present invention is simple, and the organic
      solvent usage quantity is few, residual quantity is low, and the
      yield of the finished product is about 2%, and content can reach
      30%～40%, and the olive that effectively from the sweet oil that is
      difficult for being extracted, obtains higher quality stimulates
