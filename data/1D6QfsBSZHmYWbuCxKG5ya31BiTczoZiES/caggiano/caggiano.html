        Early Efforts: The Bomb<br>
      </b><br>
      In the early 1970, in Brockton, Ma, I owned and operated a company
      called Debal Heating and Air Conditioning. This was about the time
      that we had that phony gasoline shortage. Each morning myself and
      12 employees would sit in the gas line with 6 trucks to get a mere
      5 gallons of gasoline. As I sat in that gasoline line day after
      day, I started to think there must be a better way. If they have
      the technology to put a man on the moon they must have the
      technology to get much better gas mileage. It wasn't long before I
      built my first fuel vaporization system. I read everything that I
      could get my hands on about this. Well sad to say it didn't work.
      It made plenty of vapors, and exploded like a BOMB. Over 70% of my
      body received 3rd degree burns. I spent 69 days in intensive care,
      kissing death several times. Don't worry, all the bugs are worked
      out now.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      October 15, 1983 was the birth of my Fuel Implosion Vaporization
      System. At this time I owned and operated a company in Brockton
      Ma, called Weatherall Energy Research and Development. I had just
      finished building a commercial high-efficiency air conditioning
      evaporation coil when I poured one gallon of gasoline into one end
      to flush it out. To my surprise massive fumes discharged from the
      other end and all I got back was less than one cup of gasoline.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I started brainstorming, I miniaturized the air conditioning
      evaporator coil, installed it in 1973 Dodge station wagon with a
      318 engine. By early 1986 we had worked out all the shortcomings
      and bugs and had a working prototype that gave between 111 to 113
      mpg. We placed an ad in the Brockton Enterprise and the Boston
      Globe, seeking people to beta test our Fuel Implosion System.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      It wasn't long before I got a call from a California corporation
      wanting exclusive rights to our invention. My attorney checked
      them out. They were a subsidiary of several other corporations and
      finally all owned by an oil company. I declined their offer.
      Shortly thereafter all my troubles started.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      First came two men, showing IDs, saying that they were from the
      FBI and that I was violating federal laws altering carburetion
      systems and that if convicted could get 20 years in a federal
      prison. I called my attorney and told him what happened. My
      attorney informed me that I wasn't in any violation of any federal
      laws.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If I was smart I should have stopped here. (BUT I AM NOT TOO
      SMART). For the next two weeks I would receive every day in the
      mail, in a plain envelope, 8"x10" close-up photos of my wife in
      the supermarket, church, and my children getting on and off the
      school bus and in the playground at school. (Just pictures only.)
      In addition we would get all kinds of weird calls mostly after 2
      a.m. My wife couldn't take it anymore; she filed for divorce and
      left me.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A few days later my attorney showed up at my office, looking white
      as a ghost. He had all my legal files and records with him, placed
      them on my desk and said that he could no longer represent me in
      any legal matters. I asked why. All he would say is: "WAKE UP!". I
      could not understand. He had been my personal friend and attorney
      for over 16 years.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      When my wife divorced me and my attorney abandoned me, I wondered
      what else could happen. Nothing, I thought, nobody can stop me
      now, so on with my fuel implosion system. Boy was I wrong: hell
      opened up and swallowed me alive.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I am a very light drinker; if I drink 6 cans of beer a year, that
      was a lot. I never did drugs or was around anybody that did. On
      July 4, 1986 the chief of the Brockton Police, Richard Sprawls,
      with a bunch of other Brockton police raided my Tremont St.
      Brockton home, and arrested me for trafficking of cocaine. My bail
      was set at $500,000.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I was lucky that I had a friend, LT. Jim Sullivan of the Brockton
      Police Department. He showed up at my bail hearing and said
      something to the judge, and my bail was reduced to $500.00. Is
      somebody trying to tell me something?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Oh well, back to work; I built two more fuel implosion systems. I
      installed them in a 1973 Olds Cutlass and 1966 Mustang. I painted
      my 1973 Dodge station wagon bright yellow, with big red letters
      all over it saying: "THIS CAR GETS OVER 100 MPG AND DOESN'T
      POLLUTE THE AIR .THE BIG BOYS ARE TRYING TO MAKE ME AND THIS CAR
      DISAPPEAR,--HELP ME! " I only got to drive my yellow wagon for 3
      days.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      On November 24,1986 Brockton chief of police, Richard Sprawls, and
      other members of the Brockton Police Department raided my Tremont
      St. Brockton home. They seized two shotguns, a 12 ga. and a 20 ga,
      both were legally registered to me. I used to use them for skeet
      shooting. I was arrested and charged with for trafficking of
      cocaine again. My bail was revoked. I was placed in maximum
      security in the Plymouth House of Correction. I was now sentenced
      to 15 years for the July 1986 trafficking of cocaine and waiting
      for the second trial for the November case.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I knew where I could get some solid evidence that would clear me,
      but I didn't know who to trust ANYMORE. So, I escaped from maximum
      security, went and got my solid evidence and gave it to the right
      person and surrendered the same day.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Boy I was lucky, they had over 240 law enforcement offers
      searching for me with guns, dogs, helicopters etc. I ran like a
      jackrabbit through the woods. My advantage was, the woods were my
      old hunting grounds.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Two days later Brockton's chief of police was arrested for
      STEALING COCAINE FROM THE POLICE EVIDENCE LOCKER. HE WAS SENTENCED
      TO TWO YEARS IN PRISON. REMEMBER THE COCAINE THAT CHIEF RICHARD
      SPRAWLS SAID HE FOUND AT MY HOME IN JULY AND NOVEMBER 1986? NOW I
      KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM, THE POLICE EVIDENCE LOCKER, AND IT FELL
      OUT OF CHIEF SPRAWL'S POCKET ONTO THE FLOOR IN MY HOME WHERE
      ANOTHER BROCKTON POLICE OFFICER FOUND IT.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Well the Massachusetts Supreme Court of Appeals overturned my
      cocaine trafficking conviction. Grounds: tainted evidence, illegal
      search and seizure.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      FREEDOM AND HOME, HERE I COME! WRONG AGAIN! HERE COMES THE FEDS.
      THEY HAD A WARRANT FOR MY ARREST FOR VIOLATING A NEW GUN LAW THAT
      WAS PASSED ON NOVEMBER 24,1986. THAT WAS JUST 10 DAYS AFTER MY
      ARREST OF November 14,1986. Remember the Brockton police seized my
      two shotguns?<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Guess what? I had the privilege of being the first person in
      Massachusetts and the third person in the United States to be
      tried, prosecuted and sentenced under this new law 18 USC 922g and
      924e. I didn't stand a chance; there was no case law in the law
      books to support my defense of this new law. I was sentenced to
      two 5 years' sentences for perjury, because when I bought the two
      shotguns there was a box that said: were you ever convicted of a
      felony. I checked the no box, because I was never convicted of a
      felony, just a misdemeanor.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Well, the feds said under federal law my misdemeanor was a felony,
      therefore, I was guilty of 2 counts of perjury and they gave me 5
      years on each count.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Next I got 5 years for being a convicted felon in possession of a
      firearm. Now I have been sentenced to a total of 15 years in
      federal prison without parole. I am still sitting in the
      courtroom. After a week of trial, my attorney said that the US
      Attorney was trying me under the second part of the new law. My
      attorney said the trial will be short, won't last more that ten
      minutes. There was no way I could be found not guilty.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Well it went like this: 1: I was convicted as a felon in
      possession of a firearm. 2: I was convicted of perjury. 3: I was
      convicted of a second count of perjury. BINGO! I HIT THE JACK
      POT!!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      USC 18922g-e1 states: If you have 3 prior felony convictions and
      have possession of a fire arm, then you are an ARMED Career
      Criminal and that carries a minimum mandatory sentence of 15 years
      without parole. Now I have a total of 30 years in federal prison
      without parole. Well, the Feds have me tucked away for 30 years
      where I cannot cause any more trouble with my fuel implosion
      system. WRONG, WRONG, WRONG:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I met a lot of powerful people in the federal prison, with
      powerful connections on the outside, among them, Kenny whose son
      was a patent attorney for a large patent law firm who did our US
      patent. #5,782,225, while I sat in the safety of the federal
      prison system.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Remember the Feds sentenced me to 30 years without parole??? Well,
      on September 13,1997 (Friday the 13th, my lucky day) I was
      released from federal prison with 5 years parole.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      STOP! Something's wrong here. I only did 10 years of a 30-year
      sentence, with no chance of parole. Well it took the federal
      courts to rule that it was legal for me to possess the two
      shotguns, that they had no jurisdiction. The case is now pending
      in the 1st District Court. They will not rule on it.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      This September 2001 will be 4 years that I have been out of
      federal prison and have been a good boy, nice and quiet, until
      now.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      My Intentions:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      In the past 20 years I found out that the oil companies will do
      EVERYTHING in their power to suppress this kind of technology,
      because it could reduce the gasoline consumption in the U.S. by
      76% over a 5-year term.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The government will lose mega bucks in gasoline taxes.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The major car manufacturers will lose billions spent on the
      technology of the fuel injection systems, my technology makes
      theirs obsolete.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I put all my patent and shop drawings up on this website, for
      anybody to use it free. I am 58 1/2 years young now; the sand is
      running out of my hour glass fast. I don't want to take this
      technology to my grave with me. If you think that I should get
      something out of this, then build my fuel implosion system, and
      after your 5th tank of gas send me the price of a tank of gas;
      otherwise I don't want a cent.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      If you believe that me and my patent and technology have been
      suppressed, then tell as many people as you can about my story and
      ask them to do the same.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Reason I Ask This Is:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I believe that millions of people around the globe want this kind
      of technology and know it exists. When we get enough people
      wanting this technology, I have powerful attorneys, who know and
      are able to present it to the courts of the globe.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I will take my remaining 7 cars, that have my fuel implosion
      system in them, out of exile and drive them from Boston to
      California with the whole world watching, and I think my chances
      of reaching California alive are excellent.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      By me publishing this website, I must be out of my mind. What else
      could happen to me? MAYBE I will get killed or something. What
      will be will be.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Thank you for your interest. Please help me spread the word. And
      for those of you that think that my story is just a bunch of bad
      luck for an unlucky inventor, you will be of those who oppose this
      type of technology. So go to my home page and VOTE NO for this
      technology.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Sincerely, Allen Caggiano, Inventor <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      P.S.: As much as I would like you to build my Fuel Implosion
      Vaporization System and succeed, I MUST URGE you NOT to build it
      without QUALIFIED and PROFESSIONAL help, if you are not a
      qualified machinist or mechanic yourself. This is NOT a simple
      D.I.Y project and working with (vaporized) fuel is dangerous! <br>

      Inventor(s): CAGGIANO ALLEN<br>
      <br>
      A fluid vaporization system comprises a first fluid inlet for
      receiving a first fluid, a second fluid inlet for receiving a
      second fluid, and a first discharge aperture for discharging the
      first fluid and the second fluid. A first connecting passage
      connects the first fluid inlet and the second fluid inlet in fluid
      communication with the first discharge aperture, mixes the first
      fluid and the second fluid to define a fluid mixture, and delivers
      the fluid mixture to the first discharge aperture. A third fluid
      inlet receives a third fluid and a second discharge aperture
      discharges the third fluid. A second connecting passage in heat
      transfer relationship with the first connecting passage connects
      the third fluid inlet in fluid communication with the second
      discharge aperture and delivers the third fluid from the third
      fluid inlet to the second discharge aperture to effect heat
      transfer from the third fluid to the fluid mixture such that the
      fluid mixture is discharged by the first discharge aperture in a
      vaporized state.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates generally to a fluid vaporization system
      and, more particularly, to a fluid vaporization system which heats
      a mixture of fluids and delivers the mixture in a vaporized state.
      The fluid vaporization system is particularly well adapted for
      heating a mixture of air and liquid fuel and delivering it to an
      internal combustion engine as a vapor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Background of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      In an effort to reduce pollution and conserve resources, continual
      efforts are being made to improve the performance of internal
      combustion engines, particularly in automobiles and other motor
      vehicles. Motor vehicle engines must operate as efficiently as
      possible while simultaneously minimizing emissions and providing
      sufficient power. Toward these goals, it has been sought to
      provide the most efficient and complete combustion of the fuel/air
      mixture consumed by the engine. In order to improve combustion of
      the fuel/air mixture, one approach has been to heat the fuel/air
      mixture to a vapor state before the fuel enters the engine.
      However, this and other attempts to achieve improved engine
      performance and reduced emissions by vaporizing the fuel/air
      mixture have suffered from a number of shortcomings.<br>
      <br>
      Some attempts have suffered from an inability to sufficiently
      control the amount of vaporized fuel produced under all engine
      load conditions, especially under full load conditions. Other
      attempts have suffered from premature detonation of the vaporized
      fuel prior to reaching the engine and excessive accumulation of
      vaporized fuel outside of the engine causing safety concerns. Yet
      other attempts have suffered from the inability to produce
      sufficient vaporized fuel under engine loads greater than an idle
      condition.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, an improved fluid vaporization system is desired that
      provides a more optimal and effective fuel/air mixture to an
      engine and is capable of supplying a fuel/air mixture in a
      vaporized state such that fuel efficiency is increased while
      emissions and safety concerns are decreased.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to provide a highly
      efficient fluid vaporization system which employs a dual
      cross-counterflow heat exchanger to provide a fuel/air vapor
      mixture to an internal combustion engine to increase the fuel
      efficiency and decrease emissions.<br>
      <br>
      It is another object of the present invention to provide a fluid
      vaporization system for an internal combustion engine in which air
      flow, fuel flow, and coolant or exhaust gas flow are all
      independently controllable such that a fuel/air mixture flowing
      through the system is fully vaporized under all engine load
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a
      fluid vaporization system comprising a vaporizing unit which is
      easily fabricated, assembled and disassembled to reduce
      manufacturing costs and facilitate field repairs.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the invention to provide a fluid
      vaporization system which can precisely control the amount of
      fuel/air mixture introduced into the vaporizing unit to adequately
      power an engine under any load condition.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fluid
      vaporization system which can precisely control the flow of a
      fuel/air mixture within the system and allow for expansion of the
      heated fuel/air mixture therein.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a fluid
      vaporization system which can be utilized in both carbureted and
      fuel injected engines.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a
      fluid vaporization system with numerous safety features that
      eliminate the risks of predetonation and excessive fuel vapor
      accumulation.<br>

      The foregoing and other objects of the present invention are
      carried out by a fluid vaporization system including a first fluid
      inlet for receiving a first fluid, a second fluid inlet for
      receiving a second fluid, and a first discharge aperture for
      discharging the first and second fluids. A first connecting
      passage connects the first fluid inlet and the second fluid inlet
      in fluid communication with the first discharge aperture, mixes
      the first fluid and the second fluid to form a fluid mixture, and
      delivers the fluid mixture to the first discharge aperture. A
      third fluid inlet receives a third fluid and a second discharge
      aperture discharges the third fluid. A second connecting passage
      in heat transfer relationship with the first connecting passage
      connects the third fluid inlet in fluid communication with the
      second discharge aperture and delivers the third fluid from the
      third fluid inlet to the second discharge aperture to effect heat
      transfer from the third fluid to the fluid mixture such that the
      fluid mixture is discharged by the first discharge aperture in a
      vaporized state.<br>

      <br>
      When assembled, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the plate assemblies
      20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 constitute the heat exchange
      housing 12 of the vaporizing unit 11 and provide three passageways
      therein: an upper passageway 120, a medial passageway 121, and a
      lower passageway 122. The upper passageway 120 is defined by the
      lower side of the upper outer plate assembly 60 and the upper side
      of the upper inner plate assembly 90. The medial passageway 121 is
      defined by the lower side of the upper inner plate assembly 90 and
      the upper side of the lower inner plate assembly 80. The lower
      passageway 122 is defined by the lower side of the lower inner
      plate assembly 80 and the upper side of the lower outer plate
      assembly 70. The upper passageway 120, the medial passageway 121,
      and the lower passageway 122 define a "first" continuous
      connecting passage having a serpentine shape which connects the
      fluid inlet or bore 64 of the upper plate 61 and the inlet channel
      59 of the left side plate 51 in fluid communication with the
      discharge opening 73 of the lower plate 71. Preferably, the height
      of each passageway varies to accommodate expansion of the fluid
      traveling therein as a result of heating. For example, when the
      vaporizing unit 11 is employed in combination with a hydrocarbon
      fuel-burning internal combustion engine, it has been found that
      the optimal height for each passageway is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      If the height of the upper passageway 120 equals x, then the
      height of the medial passageway 121 equals 1.25x, and the height
      of the lower passageway 122 equals 1.5x.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 12, 18 and 19, a fluid bar assembly 100 is
      disposed within the bore 64 of the upper outer plate assembly 60.
      The fuel bar assembly 100 comprises an upper blind bore 101 and a
      lower blind bore 102. The upper blind bore 101 opens at an inlet
      end 103 thereof and the lower blind bore opens at an inlet end
      103a thereof, both located at a left end of the fluid bar assembly
      100. Upper ports 104a, 104b, and 104c connect the upper blind bore
      101 in fluid communication with the lower blind bore 102. Lower
      ports 105a, 105b, and 105c connect the lower blind bore 102 to a
      lower surface 115 of the fluid bar assembly 100. A rod 106 is
      disposed within the lower blind bore 102 and is mounted for
      rotational movement therein. The rod 106 has bores 107a, 107b, and
      107c extending therethrough in spaced relation to establish fluid
      communication between the ports 104a, 104b, 104c and the ports
      105a, 105b, 105c, respectively, upon rotation of the rod 106.
      Disposed on the outer circumference of the rod 106 are O-ring
      gaskets 108 and seals 109 to prevent leakage of fluid from the
      outlet end of bore 102. A return spring 111 is provided for
      returning the rod 106 to a normally closed position wherein the
      rod 106 blocks passage of fluids to the ports 105a-105c. Disposed
      at outlet ends of the ports 105a, 105b and 105c are nozzles 110a,
      110b, and 110c, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, as shown in FIG. 19, the fluid bar assembly 100 is
      provided with protrusions 112a and 112b formed along the top edge
      of the fluid bar assembly 100. Mating grooves (not shown) cut in
      the plate 61 matingly receive the protrusions 112a and 112b of the
      fluid bar assembly 100 and facilitate the removal of the fluid bar
      assembly 100 from the plate 61. It is also understood that the
      fluid bar assembly 100 can be formed integrally with the plate 61,
      with the rod 106 permitted to rotate freely relative to the plate
      61.<br>
      <br>
      The operation of the fluid vaporization system 10 according to the
      present invention will be described with an internal combustion
      engine with reference to FIGS. 3a and 3b. In such an application,
      the mixture of fluids to be delivered to the internal combustion
      engine in a vaporized state comprises a mixture of liquid fuel and
      air, and the fluid bar assembly 100 comprises a fuel bar assembly.<br>
      <br>
      As shown schematically in FIG. 3a, the vaporizing unit 11 of the
      present invention is attached to the bottom part of a conventional
      carburetor 10a. The top part of the conventional carburetor,
      including the casing that contains the choke assembly, is removed
      prior to attachment of the vaporizing unit 11. In this
      arrangement, the air damper assembly 74 disposed in the lower
      outer plate assembly 70 functions as the carburetor choke
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 3b, high temperature coolant from a coolant
      source 6, preferably engine coolant, is pumped via a pump 7 to a
      coil heater 5. The heater 5 heats the engine coolant to
      approximately 180 DEG F. when and if required. Upon exiting the
      coil heater 5, the high-temperature coolant travels to inlet
      valves 8a and 8b such as, for example, conventional mechanical or
      electronic ball valves, which control the amount of coolant
      passing therethrough into the left and right inlets 28a and 28b,
      respectively, of the vaporizing unit 11. Upon entering the
      vaporizing unit 11, the high-temperature coolant travels in two
      adjacent paths defined by the various plate assemblies 20, 30, 40,
      50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 as described below.<br>
      <br>
      The first path is serially defined by the left inlet 28a and the
      left lower channel 22a of the rear outer plate 20; the left side
      channel 72a of the lower outer plate 70; the left lower cavity
      lower channel 33a, the left lower cavity 38a, and the left lower
      cavity upper channel 34a of the front outer plate assembly 30; the
      left side channel 82a of the lower inner plate assembly 80; the
      left lower medial channel 23a, the left medial cavity 24a, the
      left upper medial channel 25a of the rear outer plate assembly 20;
      the left side channel 92a of the upper inner plate assembly 90;
      the left upper cavity lower channel 35a, the left upper cavity
      32a, and the left upper cavity upper channel 36a of the front
      outer plate assembly 30; the left side channel 62a of the upper
      outer plate assembly 60; and the left upper channel 26a and the
      left outlet 27a of the rear outer plate assembly 20. It is
      apparent from the above description that the first path defines a
      "second" continuous connecting passage having a serpentine shape
      for connecting the left inlet 28a in fluid communication with the
      left outlet 27b.<br>
      <br>
      The second path is serially defined by the right inlet 28b and the
      left lower channel 22b of the rear outer plate 20; the left side
      channel 72b of the lower outer plate 70; the left lower cavity
      lower channel 33b, the left lower cavity 38b, and the left lower
      cavity upper channel 34b of the front outer plate assembly 30; the
      left side channel 82b of the lower inner plate assembly 80; the
      left lower medial channel 23b, the left medial cavity 24b, the
      left upper medial channel 25b of the rear outer plate assembly 20;
      the left side channel 92b of the upper inner plate assembly 90;
      the left upper cavity lower channel 35b, the left upper cavity
      32b, and the left upper cavity upper channel 36b of the front
      outer plate assembly 30; the left side channel 62b of the upper
      outer plate assembly 60; and the left upper channel 26b and the
      right outlet 27b of the rear outer plate assembly 20. It is
      apparent from the above description that the second path defines a
      "third" continuous connecting passage having a serpentine shape
      for connecting the right inlet 28b in fluid communication with the
      right outlet 27b.<br>
      <br>
      The inlet valves 8a and 8b are regulated, for example, by two
      independent thermostats (not shown) which are submerged in the
      coolant paths on the lower outer plate assembly 70. The foregoing
      construction facilitates maintaining, under all load conditions, a
      constant temperature across the first and second coolant paths and
      the upper, medial and lower passageways, thus preventing a drop in
      temperature which will cause the vapor fuel to undergo
      condensation and greatly decrease the fuel efficiency and increase
      exhaust pollutants. Coolant exiting from the outlets 27a and 27b
      is then returned to the engine coolant source 6. It is understood
      by those skilled in the art that the engine coolant may be
      substituted with hot engine exhaust gases if desired. It is
      apparent from the above description that the first and second
      coolant paths within the heat exchange housing 12 are capable of
      being independently regulated, and facilitate a dual
      cross-counterflow arrangement for optimal heat exchange with
      respect to the fuel/air mixture traveling through the vaporizing
      unit 11 as described below.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIG. 3a, hydrocarbon fuel from a fuel source 13
      is supplied to a high pressure fuel pump 3. The high pressure fuel
      pump 3 pressurizes the fuel to a desired pressure depending upon
      various factors including the number of chambers of the internal
      combustion engine 9 and delivers the high pressure fuel to the
      inlet end 103 of the upper blind bore 101 of the fuel bar assembly
      100 shown in FIGS. 18-19. For example, the minimum required fuel
      pressure for a four cylinder engine is 100 psi, for a six cylinder
      engine it is 125 psi, for an eight cylinder engine it is 150 psi,
      for a ten cylinder engine it is 200 psi, and for a small aircraft
      engine it is between 200 to 300 psi. The pump pressure set point
      is optimally chosen so that the vaporizing unit 11 will only
      supply enough vaporized fuel/air mixture to the engine 9
      sufficient for, for example, fifteen seconds use under full engine
      load.<br>
      <br>
      Upon entering the fuel bar assembly 100, the fuel travels through
      the upper ports 104a-104c, through-bores 107a-107c of the rod 106
      and through the lower ports 105a-105c and is discharged through
      the nozzles 110a-110c. In one example of the present embodiment,
      the pressure of the fuel exiting the fuel bar assembly 100 is
      chosen to be approximately 1/3 the discharge pressure of the pump
      3.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the rod
      106 of the fuel bar assembly 100 acts as a rotatable throttle to
      control the amount of fuel flowing through the fuel bar assembly
      100. The rotation of the rod 106 is controlled by the progressive
      linkage 114. The progressive linkage 114 also controls the
      position of the air damper assemblies 52, 74, 84, and 94 to
      regulate the amount of air drawn through the heat exchange housing
      10 as described below. However, it is understood by those skilled
      in the art that other control mechanisms are suitable for
      controlling the fuel bar assembly and the damper assemblies. For
      example, the fuel bar assembly and damper assemblies could be
      controlled by an electronically controlled servo motor (not
      shown).<br>
      <br>
      Air is drawn through the air filter 53 and heated by the heating
      coil 54 and the heated air flows through the damper assembly 52 of
      the left side outer plate assembly 50. The flow of air then enters
      the left side of the upper passageway 120. The incoming air mixes
      with the pressurized fuel exiting the fuel bar assembly 100 and
      travels along the length of the upper passageway 120. The fuel/air
      mixture then passes through the damper assembly 94 and enters the
      medial passageway 121. The fuel/air mixture travels along the
      length of the medial passageway 121, passing through the damper
      assembly 84, and enters the lower passageway 122. Next, the
      fuel/air mixture travels along the length of the lower passageway
      122 and exits the heat exchange housing 12 through the damper
      assembly 74. The fuel/air mixture is sufficiently heated by heat
      transfer occurring between the high temperature engine coolant
      flowing through the first and second paths and the fuel/air
      mixture flowing through the passageways 120, 121 and 122.
      Preferably the fuel/air mixture will be almost completely (i.e.,
      approximately 98% or more) vaporized and ready to be fed via the
      lower part of the carburetor 10a to the cylinders of the internal
      combustion engine 9.<br>
      <br>
      Acceleration of the engine 9 is achieved by manipulation of the
      progressive linkage 114 (FIG. 1) which rotates the rod 106 of the
      fuel bar assembly 100 allowing an increased flow of fuel into the
      ports 105a-105c and out through nozzles 110a-110c, while
      simultaneously rotating the air damper assemblies 52, 74, and 94
      which allow increased air and fuel/air mixture to pass through the
      vaporizing unit 11.<br>
      <br>
      It will be appreciated that the damper assemblies not only provide
      for rapid acceleration and deceleration of the fuel/air mixture,
      but also function as independent flow rate regulators to maintain
      a constant ideal vaporization environment within the heat exchange
      housing 12. Furthermore, although the damper assemblies in the
      present embodiment are controlled mechanically by a progressive
      linkage 114, it is understood by those skilled in the art that the
      damper assemblies may be controlled instead with electronic servo
      motors.<br>
      <br>
      Start-up of the engine 9 is accomplished by turning an ignition
      switch 4a to the ON position. A relay 4b is energized and
      activates a low pressure fuel pump 2. The fuel pump 2 pumps fuel
      to the lower part of the carburetor 10a since the engine must
      start on liquid fuel and the vaporizing unit 11 will not function
      effectively until it has reached a proper operating temperature.
      Accordingly, the relay 4b simultaneously activates the air heating
      coil 54 and the coolant heating coil 5 to rapidly achieve a
      minimum operating temperature (i.e., approximately 150 DEG F.) of
      the vaporizing unit 11. As the engine 9 achieves its normal
      operating temperature and thusly raises the temperature of the
      engine coolant to approximately 190 DEG F., dependence on the air
      heating coil 54 and the coolant heating coil 5 is reduced. When
      the minimum operating temperature of the vaporizing unit 11 is
      sensed by a temperature sensing array 4d, the relay 4b deactivates
      the low pressure fuel pump 2 and activates the high pressure fuel
      pump 3 which begins pumping fuel to the fuel bar assembly 100. The
      vaporizing unit 11 maintains its optimal operating temperature of
      approximately 190 DEG F. via the temperature sensing array 4d
      which controls the temperature of the air heating coil 54 and the
      coolant heating coil 5.<br>
      <br>
      Stopping of the engine 9 is accomplished by turning the ignition
      switch 4a to the OFF position, which activates a timer 4c,
      deactivates the high pressure fuel pump 3, and activates the low
      pressure fuel pump 2. The timer 4c keeps the engine 9 running for
      a sufficient time, approximately 15 seconds, to allow all of the
      vaporized fuel in the vaporizing unit 11 to be consumed by the
      engine 9 and for the bottom part of the carburetor 10a to fill
      with liquid fuel. This delayed shut-off process serves to
      eliminate accidental detonation of the vaporized fuel in the
      vaporizing unit 11 after engine shut-off and prepares the engine 9
      for a subsequent start-up.<br>
      <br>
      From the foregoing description, it can be seen that the present
      invention comprises an improved fluid vaporization system. It will
      be appreciated by those skilled in the art that obvious changes
      could be made to the embodiment described in the foregoing
      description without departing from the broad inventive concept
      thereof. For example, although the foregoing embodiment of the
      fluid vaporization system has been described with a specific
      application to an internal combustion engine, it will be
      appreciated that the fluid vaporization system is also well
      adapted for other applications, such as, for example, heating oil
      fuel processors, air conditioning systems, refrigeration systems
      and ice storage tanks. It is understood, therefore, that this
      invention is not limited to the particular embodiment disclosed,
      but is intended to cover all modifications thereof which are
      within the scope and spirit of the invention as defined by the
      appended claims.<br>

            (FIVS)</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      Allen Caggiano is open sourcing his fuel vaporizor technology that
      holds the potential to boost gas mileage several-fold while also
      improving performance and reducing emissions. The system involves
      pre-heating the fuel to over 900 degrees F to remove the additives
      that prevent vast mileage gains then subjecting the fuel to
      magnets and electromagnetic fields, resulting in a crystal clear
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      There are many proposed ways to increase gas mileage in vehicles.
      Allen Caggiano has developed an interesting technology called the
      FIVS or "Fuel Implosion Vaporization System" that manipulates
      ordinary gasoline, and changes it into another form. This new form
      of gasoline is claimed to be crystal clear, to smell "like
      strawberries", and to produce huge improvements in gas mileage. He
      claims that a 1972 Pontiac that normally obtained 16 miles per
      gallon, obtained 75 MPG with a FIVS unit attached.<br>
      <br>
      If one does some digging on the internet, they can find a long and
      mysterious story that details the origins of this technology. It
      is full of conspiracy and suppression. Anyone who wants to learn
      about the background of this technology can read an article about
      it, here. http://www.renovationpress.com/AllenCaggiano.html<br>
      <br>
      The device is somewhat expensive to build (around $1,200 to $1,500
      dollars), and seems somewhat complex. However, if it produces the
      gas mileage increases that are claimed, it could very well be
      worth the cost. A set of documents sent to us by Allen can be
      found linked at the end of this story. It details the components
      needed, gives the address of a yahoo group where more information
      can be found, and gives some history about the device.<br>
      <br>
      Here are a few bits of information, from documentation that Allen
      has provided.<br>
      <br>
      - The unit is mostly composed of T 70/76 Aircraft Aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      - A "racing" fuel pump sends fuel to the FIVS cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      - The inside of the cylinder is platinum plated. This produces a
      voltage that is important.<br>
      <br>
      - The fuel is heated to very high temperatures under high pressure
      by a heating element.<br>
      <br>
http://www.mechaheat.nl/modules/content/index.php?action=viewContent&amp;sectionID=301<br>
      <br>
      - The heated fuel is then exposed to magnetic fields produced by
      cobalt magnets and electromagnets. This changes the molecular
      structure of the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      - The fuel is then cooled by a condenser coil.<br>
      <br>
      - A regulator reduces the pressure of the fuel.<br>
      <br>
      - The fuel is then sent to the second fuel pump, and is used to
      power the engine.<br>
      <br>
      - The timing of the engine has to be moved from dead center to
      plus ten degrees.<br>
      <br>
      - A new air fuel sensor is installed to bypass the engine's
      computers.<br>
      <br>
      Allen claims that having this unit installed will result in a
      large improvement in gas mileage, almost zero emissions, better
      performance, and a cooler running engine. To learn more, you can

      If this technology works as claimed, it could be a significant
      breakthrough. We should thank Allen for open sourcing the
      technology.<br>

      <b>Overview by Allen Caggiano</b><br>
      <br>
      I Allen Hereby give full permission to build, manufacture use for
      personal or commercial use the new Fivs Gen V that was prototyped
      in Holland.<br>
      <br>
      I spent a life time of committed work and mega dollars to bring
      the fivs Gen V where it is today, I give to the world Free of
      charge my life work on the Fivs Gen V to include complete photos3d
      Cad Drawings and complete blue prints of the Fivs Gen V . 100%
      Free along with personal step-by-step instructions in a Yahoo chat
      room http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fivsgenv where I will once a
      week personal be there live to answer all questions about the
      construction and operation of the Fivs, Gen V.<br>
      <br>
      I am not opposed to any donations, in fact I would be grateful.<br>
      <br>
      Why am I giving the Fivs Gen V away Free? Well, a lot of you know
      what happened to the yellow 1973 Pontiac, all the oppression
      inflected on me, and all the lies, and disinformation posted on
      the net about me saying I was a fraud, that I scammed mega
      millions from people around the globe which is all B.S. If it was
      true I would be in prison NOW. It was only to keep the Fivs gen 1V
      and V off the market.<br>
      <br>
      The Fivs is a disrupted technology for the US Government. It has
      the potential to reduce the gas consumption by 76% in a five 5year
      time frame. They will lose mega $$$$$.<br>
      <br>
      If you don’t know the History of the Fivs then go to the net and
      type in the word the FIVS, and Fivs Renovation Press.<br>
      <br>
      The most recent events concerning the FIVS Gen V:<br>
      <br>
      MY self and KZ of Holland Built the FIVS Gen 5 in Holland. KZ is a
      citizen of Holland and Lebanon. KZ shipped a complete Fivs Gen V
      to Holland which 100% legal in Holland.<br>
      <br>
      But the United States, in the alleged interest of national
      Security, seized the FIVS Gen V and KZ Bank account,<br>
      <br>
      They charged KZ with shipping a weapon of mass destruction to a
      terrorist country.<br>
      <br>
      The Us Home land security's reason for Jurisdiction was that the
      cobalt magnets in the Fivs are used in the trigger housing of a
      Nuke BOMB. I SAY It's Just MORE B.S.<br>
      <br>
      I urge all who build a fivs not to cheep out and cut corners on
      cheep materials.<br>
      <br>
      The cost to build a single Fivs Gen V is between 1,200.00 to
      1,500.00 USD mainly depending on the cost of platinum.<br>
      <br>
      1: the major material used to build a FGIVS Gen V is T 70/76
      Aircraft Aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      A lower grade of [aluminum] will cause a buildup of a sticky
      substance from the additives put in the gasoline by the Oil
      Companies to make inventions like FIVS to Fail. We have overcome
      that problem as you will soon see.<br>
      <br>
      You will need a special heating unit that will heat up the
      gasoline to over 795 degrees.<br>
      <br>
      Those who are members of the
      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fivsgenv will be provided with the
      contact person an specs of the heating element.<br>
      <br>
      2: You are thinking heating gasoline to 795 degrees is crazy
      because it will explode . Right/// NO ITS Wrong.<br>
      <br>
      The Fivs Cylindar is over 1 inch thick made of is T 70/76 Aircraft
      Aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      Gas is heated to 795 degrees, in a vacuum and under 250 to min 240
      llbs pressure. Which keeps the gasoline in a liquid form. ONLY
      VAPORS CAN EXPLODE NOT Liquid Gasoline.<br>
      <br>
      You don’t believe me?? Then convince your self with a safe test,
      take ½ cup of gasoline and put it in the freezer for 1.1/2 hr. ,
      take it quickly out side and sink a lit wooden match deep in the
      middle of the liquid gasoline . The liquid gasoline will put out
      the flame in the wooden match.<br>
      <br>
      3. The reason that I heat gasoline to 975 degrees is that all
      known additives that the oil companies put in the gasoline to date
      will vaporize at 750 degrees or less.<br>
      <br>
      4: we have a digital device that will override all the computer
      settings like CO sensor, map sensor air flow sensor. Air fuel
      sensor. It cost about $100.00. Members of
      http://groups.yahoo.com/group/fivsgenv will given the contact
      information for this divice.<br>
      <br>
      The reason you need this device is that cars and trucks
      manufactured from 2000 to 2011 have computers that over ride any
      device that increases mileage by 10% or more,<br>
      <br>
      5. 4 cobalt magnets are used all facing south to each other. Each
      magnet is capable of picking up 150 LBS.<br>
      <br>
      These magnets, along with the magnet carriage, are nickel plated.<br>
      <br>
      The inside of the Fivs cylinder is platinum plated. This is most
      important, because it generates up to 36 DC volts together with
      all the other activity in the Fivs as follows<br>
      <br>
      6. Gasoline is plumbed up to the fivs cylinder under 250 lbs
      pressure, from a racing fuel pump controlled with a pressure
      switch that when the pressure drops to 240 pressure it restores
      pressure to 240 psi.<br>
      <br>
      7. Next, 795 degree liquid gasoline now goes through a massive pm
      magnet and electro magnetic field that completely changes the
      molecules of the high and low end carbon chain, still under 250
      lbs psi. Now the 795 degree liquid gasoline is pumped through a
      transmission or condenser coil to cool the liquid gas too about
      115 degrees. And a regulator to reduce pressure that is compatible
      with the vehicle fuel pump of the vehicle that the FIVS Gen V is
      installed.<br>
      <br>
      8. The finished product that comes from the outlet of the FIVS GEN
      V is a crystal clear, like water, and smells like strawberries. We
      sent samples to 3 different labs and they don’t know what this
      fuel mixture [is].<br>
      <br>
      I don’t know what this new fuel is but we do know what it does.
      99.6% of this fuel ignites in the combustion chamber. 0.4% ignites
      as second ignition in the valve chain, and 0% in the catalytic
      converter.<br>
      <br>
      9. Horse power increases 38% +, timing has to be set from 0 dead
      center to plus 10 degrees. It depends on the vehicle they are all
      different.<br>
      <br>
      10. The exhaust, when measured in parts per mil, shows 0<br>
      <br>
      pollutants found. You have to measure in parts per billions to
      find a trace of pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      The engine runs much cooler. You can take the vehicle on a trip,
      and as you come off the highway you can put your hand on the
      catalytic converter. And not burn your hand.<br>
      <br>
      The exhaust is cool like when you start your car on a cold winter
      day, and the exhaust smells lake fresh cut strawberries. This will
      increase engine life beyond your wildest dreams, the car will fall
      apart and the engine lives on.<br>
      <br>

        </b><big><b>Calling All Ants - The Story of Allen Caggiano and
            the FIVS</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Greater fuel economy for the internal combustion engine has always
      been possible and as early as the 1910's independent inventors
      have produced fuel saving devices that allow gasoline to burn more
      efficiently, which also means less pollution coming out of the
      tail pipe. If you're a John D. Rockefeller, you don't want fuel
      efficient vehicles because automobiles are the primary consumer of
      your Standard Oil. You want to sell more oil, not less, and you
      would be inclined to prevent any innovations in carburetors that
      could dampen the demand. You would be willing to buy the patent of
      any successful inventor just so you could put it on the shelf, out
      of sight, out of mind. If the inventor is stubborn and won't give
      you the rights, there are other ways to persuade him to your way
      of thinking. The story of the suppression of innovative fuel
      saving technologies is the story of the failure of free market
      capitalism. It's not a new story and it's been told many times,
      but the increasingly powerful corporate masters of the US economy
      have been able to prevent it from being heard.<br>
      <br>
      Allen Caggiano's experience should be a wake up call, though I
      know most Americans are asleep at the wheel and won't hear a
      thing. Too bad.<br>
      <br>
      Those who best remember the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973 were driving
      and buying gasoline at that time and are today at least 47 years
      old. Younger people have no first hand experience of what an
      energy crisis can mean and have little idea of how vulnerable we
      really are in our dependence on foreign oil. 1973 was the year
      Allen Caggiano decided he was going to do something to help his
      country become energy secure. Unlike many of his Babyboomer
      contemporaries, he was patriotic. The “oil shock” set him thinking
      about the problem of fuel efficiency. He ran his own business,
      Debal Heating &amp; Air Conditioning, and had to have fuel for his
      six trucks to keep his twelve men working. His men weren’t
      working. They were waiting in lines at gas stations to get five
      gallons each. It made no sense to him that a country that could
      send men to the Moon couldn’t produce a vehicle that would get
      high enough mileage so that we would be more energy independent.
      Vehicles powered by the internal combustion engine consume the
      greater part of the oil we use; therefore, increased miles per
      gallon for each vehicle would mean a huge reduction in oil
      consumption and less vulnerability to the whims of foreign
      suppliers.<br>
      <br>
      When he first began to think about the problem of fuel efficiency,
      he saw it as a technical issue. He was an ambitious and creative
      young man with a young man’s conviction that he could build the
      better mousetrap no matter how many others had tried and failed in
      the past. It was years later that he learned through bitter
      personal experience that fuel efficiency is not so much a
      technical problem as it is a political one.<br>
      <br>
      Al had his Eureka! moment one evening in his shop as he was
      cleaning out an evaporation coil he designed for a custom air
      conditioning unit he had contracted to build. He didn’t have the
      special solvent he needed, so he decided to use gasoline as a
      substitute. He poured one gallon into the coil and was astonished
      to see that only about a cup full of liquid came out the other
      end. The rest was turned into a large quantity of gasoline vapor.
      He saw immediately that this vaporization process could be adapted
      for use in an automobile and he began to play around with designs
      for a miniaturized coil that could do it. Carburetors and fuel
      injectors deliver a spray or fine mist of fuel and much of it
      remains unburned in the cylinders and leaves the engine as
      pollution. A vapor is composed of much finer particles and will
      burn more completely with less unburned fuel going out the tail
      pipe.<br>
      <br>
      Before he developed his first automotive fuel vaporization device,
      however, he tried out the idea on a fuel oil heating system in an
      apartment building he had bought. He was paying $500 per week to
      heat the 21 units of his building during heating season and he
      wanted to cut his heating costs. He rigged up a vaporization
      system for the furnace that worked very well at first and reduced
      his bill to $100 per week. Unfortunately, it failed disastrously
      and there was a fire. Al was burned over 70% of his body in this
      incident and one of the apartments he used to locate the fuel
      device was damaged.<br>
      <br>
      He knew he was taking risks at the time and he knew his experiment
      was technically illegal, but this incident only serves to
      highlight the dilemma innovators and inventors face in our heavily
      regulated environment. Who could afford to build and test a device
      and then secure approval from the Underwriter’s Laboratory? Only
      deep pocket corporations can innovate and follow all the rules,
      and they do very little R&amp;D without tax incentives or other
      financial support to protect the bottom line. To be good,
      sometimes you have to be bad. Al paid a heavy price. Over two
      months in hospital intensive care was the least of it.<br>
      <br>
      The state eventually prosecuted him for the fire he had caused in
      his own building and sentenced him to a year in jail with two
      years of work release. The conviction was a misdemeanor, not a
      felony, and he retained his professional licenses. While waiting
      for that trial, Al recovered sufficiently from his burns to get to
      work on the automotive vaporization system. By the time he was to
      begin his sentence in Walpole Prison he had put together his first
      prototype and installed it on a 1973 Dodge Coronet station wagon.
      This gave spectacular results and produced 111 miles per gallon of
      gas. But it failed after a short time and he was off to Walpole in
      1978 where he would have plenty of time to think things over. The
      Arab Oil Embargo was a bad memory, but Al was fully committed to
      developing a device that would be reliable and safe. Committed is
      not a strong enough word. He became obsessed<br>
      <br>
      When he got out of Walpole on work-release in 1979, he installed
      the second generation device on the 318 cubic inch Dodge V-8
      engine and called it the “FIVS Gen II”. FIVS ( rhymes with
      “gives”) stood for “fuel implosion vaporization system”, second
      generation. This second prototype proved very reliable and
      produced results as remarkable as the first, getting as much as
      113 miles to a gallon of gas. He was so confident that he placed
      ads in newspapers to tell the world. He was commuting to work each
      day from the forestry camp where he was assigned to live for the
      duration of his work- release. He was not yet a free man, but his
      spirits were soaring with visions of the success of his FIVS.<br>
      <br>
      A newspaper reporter began to secretly follow Al on his daily
      commutes to and from his work at Weatherall Energy Research and
      Development, the successor to Debal Heating &amp; Air
      Conditioning. It was being temporarily operated by his wife, Deb,
      and a friend. The mom &amp; pop Deb &amp; Al heating and cooling
      business had developed a larger vision. The reporter wanted to
      verify the claims Al was making about mileage and when he did not
      see him stop for gas for an entire month, he showed up at the work
      release facility asking to interview Allen Caggiano. The warden
      was outraged. Al was again breaking the rules by engaging in
      business of his own, which was not permitted according to the
      terms of his work release. The warden was shy of publicity of any
      kind and told Al that if he did not lie to the reporter and
      confess that he was siphoning gas from other vehicles in the
      parking lot at night, Al would spend the rest of his term behind
      bars in Walpole. Al lied.<br>
      <br>
      The moment he was his own man again in 1981, he began promoting
      the FIVS with renewed enthusiasm. He was still breaking the rules
      but didn’t let that bother him. He was beginning to feel like it
      was illegal to be Allen Caggiano. The installation of the FIVS Gen
      II required modifications to the carburetor and the removal of the
      catalytic converter. This was prohibited by EPA regulations. It
      was therefore a violation of Federal Law. Al ignored the
      regulations because he knew tail pipe emissions from his FIVS
      vehicle were much lower than the law required. He was upholding
      the spirit of the law, and he was willing to argue his case in
      court if it came to that. He wanted a confrontation, he wanted a
      chance to tell the world that his FIVS made pollution control
      devices obsolete. He painted the station wagon bright yellow and
      in bold black letters along the sides he wrote: THIS CAR GETS OVER
      100 MILES PER GALLON AND DOESN’T POLLUTE THE AIR.<br>
      <br>
      He finally had his better mousetrap. He had resolved the technical
      issues. He knew his FIVS would make the US energy independent and
      reduce harmful emissions dramatically. He was giddy with
      excitement. The world would beat a path to his door. He’d grown up
      believing that’s how the free market system worked. He’d done very
      well for himself for a kid with just a high school education, so
      he had no reason to believe otherwise. He had the potential to be
      as rich as Bill Gates. It was hard to believe, but when he did the
      math, that’s how it looked. Who could not afford to spend $2,000
      for a device that would save them that much in fuel costs within a
      year? This was the point when his political education began in a
      dramatic way.<br>
      <br>
      On the third day of his new campaign, Al got into the station
      wagon one morning and noticed a car pulling up behind him. He got
      out to greet two men in suits flashing FBI credentials. While he
      spoke to one, the other slipped away, climbed in to his station
      wagon, and drove it off. Astonished, he turned to watch his
      vehicle going down the street. Then he heard the Fed car pulling
      out behind him. Al just stood there watching the two vehicles
      disappear around the corner. An old friend, his attorney, later
      called the FBI office. The FBI denied any knowledge of the
      incident. Angry and frustrated, but undaunted, Al said good-bye to
      the Dodge Coronet, and found another similar Dodge station wagon
      and set to work installing another FIVS. He painted this one
      yellow, too, with bold black lettering.<br>
      <br>
      Not long after the first car was stolen, he received an
      interesting offer from a California based corporation. This
      corporation wanted to purchase exclusive rights to his FIVS Gen
      II. Al asked his attorney to check it out. The corporation turned
      out to be a subsidiary of several other corporations, all of which
      were finally owned by an oil company. This arrangement is typical
      of the way contemporary monopolies are structured. Al had been
      doing some reading about other inventors in the past and other
      fuel saving devices that had never seen the light of day and he
      was determined that he would never allow the Big Boys to get
      control of his device.<br>
      <br>
      After he refused the offer, two different FBI agents came calling.
      He was careful not to leave keys in his unattended vehicle this
      time. They informed him that he was violating federal laws and
      should cease and desist. Defiant and excited that he might soon
      make his case in court, he told his wife, Deb, not to worry. She
      was more than wife and mother, she was a partner. She had held him
      and his business together in the rough times, but she was losing
      her nerve. A couple of weeks after the second FBI visit, unmarked
      brown paper envelopes began arriving, containing 8 x 10
      photographs of the children and Deb. A child on the playground at
      school. A child getting off the school bus. Deb in the
      supermarket, and so on. She was terrified and ultimately gave Al a
      choice between her and his FIVS. It was the most painful moment in
      his life. He refused to back down. To him it had become a “High
      Noon” type of situation. The marriage broke up.<br>
      <br>
      Something in Denmark was really rotten. He couldn’t ignore the
      smell now. He was devastated, but also angrier and more defiant
      than ever. The FBI was behaving like the Mafia. He wrote on the
      side of his Dodge: “THE BIG BOYS ARE TRYING TO MAKE ME AND THIS
      CAR DISAPPEAR! HELP ME!” If you’re a poor Italian kid from a big
      family and your father was a barber, you know some of the things
      your father heard in his barbershop and you don’t believe the
      world is all sweetness and light. You know the police aren’t
      working for you, but you hope they leave you some room to wiggle
      in. You hope your wife loves you like you love her, and if she
      doesn’t, you hope your friends stand by you. That’s why when one
      his oldest friends, and his attorney, who was like a brother,
      refused to have anything else to do with him, he began to have a
      really bad feeling. “Wake up!” his attorney said, and then
      abruptly hung up the phone.<br>
      <br>
      The Feds weren’t going to give him his day in court to defend his
      FIVS. They had stolen his first prototype vehicle and they knew it
      worked as claimed. He had refused to relinquish his control, so
      they were going to send him back to prison, but not for violating
      federal emissions regulations. On the face of it, the
      Environmental Protection Agency appears to be imposing regulations
      on the auto makers and the oil companies in the public interest of
      protecting the quality of the air we breath, and the quality of
      the air we breath is improved over what it used to be. But in fact
      these special interests often write the legislation themselves.
      The regulations then create a profitable new area of business
      which allows the special interests to increase their control over
      the market. The public interest is best served by creative
      innovation in a free market. Al was learning Politics 101 the hard
      way. In the business of autos and oil, there is no free market. In
      a monopoly controlled market, there are anti-competitive
      regulations, dirty tricks, and active suppression. The Big Boys
      protected their turf and took control of or destroyed any
      potential competition in the hallowed tradition of John D.
      Rockefeller Sr and the robber barons of the past. That wasn’t hard
      to understand. But he was unprepared for the sophisticated tactics
      of today’s faceless robber barons.<br>
      <br>
      The Chief of Police for Brockton, MA, Richard Sproules, was a
      corrupted cop. Using cocaine stolen from police evidence, Chief
      Sproules planted it in Al’s home during a drug raid that
      ultimately put Al in prison again in 1986 for 15 years on a
      cocaine trafficking conviction, in spite of the fact that Al
      didn’t use drugs, nor associate with those who did. He fought
      back. In prison, he fashioned a key in the prison shop and simply
      let himself out. He contacted a friend on the police force and
      then turned himself in on the same day. This police officer friend
      was able to uncover evidence of the chief’s corruption. Two days
      later, Chief Sproules was arrested for stealing cocaine from the
      evidence locker, most of which he had taken home to feed his
      addicted wife. He went to prison himself, which led to the
      reversal of over 300 drug convictions that had been decided during
      his tenure. The Massachusetts Supreme Court of Appeals overturned
      Al’s conviction. For a moment, he thought he’d beaten the Big Boys
      was a free man again.<br>
      <br>
      But then the federal prosecutor stepped in and indicted him on new
      charges relating to the seizure of two shot guns during the phoney
      drug bust. A spurious interpretation of the US Code was applied.
      Al was sentenced to a total of 30 years in Allenwood federal
      prison, without parole. He got ten years for two counts of perjury
      having to do with false declarations he had made when filling out
      two forms for the purchase of his two shotguns. He had checked the
      “no” box when asked if he had ever been convicted of a felony. He
      was then given five years for possession of fire arms by a felon.
      And finally he received another fifteen years for being an “armed
      courier criminal” because he had three prior felony convictions
      and was in possession of a firearm! Under the laws of the State of
      Massachusetts he was not considered a felon.<br>
      <br>
      Al’s time in Allenwood was not wasted in self-pity or bitterness
      towards the Big Boys or the corrupted system that put him there.
      Life handed him lemons and he went on making lemonade. When he was
      seriously burned in his apartment building years before, he had
      spent sixty nine days in intensive care, kissing death so many
      times that he lost his fear of it. He came out of the hospital
      free of a burden of fear most don’t even know they carry around
      with them. Death is probably the greatest fear of the average man,
      and the second greatest may be the fear of Government, or the
      power that government can exercise: imprisonment, torture,
      execution. The two inevitabilities haunt us all: the proverbial
      death &amp; taxes! But Al looked the deadly duo in the eye and
      didn’t blink. Freedom means freedom from fear. Imprisonment cannot
      destroy a man who has put aside his own private burden of fear and
      knows the fault is in the corrupted system and not in himself.<br>
      <br>
      He was popular in Allenwood right away because of his role in
      exposing the dirty cop that overturned so many drug convictions.
      He developed a good relationship with the warden of facilities. As
      a licensed HVAC contractor, Al was able to fix the prison heating
      and cooling system that had never worked properly, saving the
      government a large amount of money. Honeywell Corporation trained
      him in the use of computers so that he could operate and maintain
      the system. The prison had an excellent machine shop which allowed
      him to continue working with his FIVS devices. He designed small
      FIVS for the prison lawn mowers and produced numerous FIVS GEN
      II’s with the collaboration of the warden of facilities that were
      secretly distributed outside.<br>
      <br>
      The US has a prison population of more than 2.1 million inmates
      and the highest rate of incarceration of any country in the world.
      Within this huge population are many talented, intelligent
      individuals. Al made many useful contacts, one of whom helped him
      secure US Patent #5,782,225, awarded July 21, 1998, for the FIVS
      Gen II, among other things. He continued to develop and refine his
      computer skills. He also designed a new FIVS, the Gen III, which
      did not violate any federal regulations, and he put together a
      plan to manufacture and distribute the Gen III . A rich man can
      say: I been broke but I ain’t never been poor! In the same vein,
      Allen Caggiano could say: I been in prison, but I ain’t never been
      a convict! He never stopped believing in his own freedom.<br>
      <br>
      And then one day he was out, free for real in 1997. Sentenced to
      30 years without parole, he was suddenly released after ten years
      with five years parole. The federal appeals court had finally
      ruled that his possession of two shotguns was legal and that it
      had no jurisdiction over the matter in the first place. Several
      years later, because he was curious, he asked a police officer
      friend to do a background check on him. No record of his
      conviction and incarceration in Allenwood was found. The stain of
      systemic corruption had been discretely removed.<br>
      <br>
      He didn’t look back and went to work to develop a prototype Gen
      III device, applied for his new patent, and implement the strategy
      he had dreamed up in prison. He was no longer politically naive,
      no longer the patriotic American he’d once been. He did not
      believe it would be possible to build the Gen III in the home of
      the brave and the land of the free, so he made arrangements to
      manufacture parts in the Ukraine, a former satellite of the
      defunct Soviet Union. He would then assemble the devices in
      Mexico. He had developed a global perspective in Allenwood. His
      network of supporters and investors was now called: “FIVS Gen III
      International” and he set up a website: www.get113to138mpg.com<br>
      <br>
      He needed to test the new Gen III device. He needed people from
      different countries in different climates with different types of
      vehicles interested in taking part in a beta testing program and
      asked them to sign a licensing agreement. The Ukrainian shop was
      willing to take the job at cost on the expectation of future
      profits. The Big Boys didn’t have clout in the Ukraine, and even
      if they did, they’d have to find the shop first! His website was
      eventually generating 70,000 hits a month from all over the world.
      His beta testers would be from different countries, with just a
      few devices in the US and Canada, thus making it very difficult
      for the Feds to interfere. He also offered the complete blue
      prints for manufacturing the earlier FIVS Gen II as a free
      download from his site so that anyone who wanted to could build
      their own. He thought this might distract the Feds and tie up
      their manpower as he implemented the Gen III strategy.<br>
      <br>
      By 2002, the delivery date for the first beta testing group was
      set. The parts were shipped from the Ukraine to Mexico where they
      were assembled. It was necessary for Al to travel South of the
      border to oversee the operation. He made the punishing drive from
      Massachusetts to Mexico several times in his FIVS equipped Pontiac
      Catalina and it functioned flawlessly, delivering more than 70 MPG
      from its 400 cubic inch engine. His friends warned him not to
      drive alone, but he made the last trip by himself and on the
      return leg of the journey, he noticed an 18 wheel truck following
      him. The intentions of this truck were soon obvious when it
      overtook him and forced him off the road. Al anticipated the
      maneuver, however, and was able keep control of the Pontiac. He
      breathed a sigh of relief and continued on, believing he’d
      outwitted them once again. He made it all the way to Massachusetts
      and was nearly home again before the truck found him a second time
      and caught him unawares. The Pontiac rolled over several times,
      but landed upright. The driver’s side door was crushed and the
      roof caved in, but the car still ran and Al was able to drive it
      home without further incident in spite of his injuries. He had to
      be cut out of the car with a torch. He had several broken ribs and
      a punctured lung and was immediately rushed to the hospital.<br>
      <br>
      The Gen III’s for the first group of licensees were shipped from
      Mexico on time, however, by means of several different shippers.
      Some devices for US licensees were shipped via United Parcel
      Service. A total of 137 units were shipped around the world. Only
      those that went UPS in the continental US and Canada, a total of
      44 units, did not arrive at their destinations. Every shipped item
      has a tracking number, of course, and when Al inquired about the
      missing 44 units and provided the tracking numbers he’d been
      given, he was informed the numbers he had did not exist. The
      attempt to turn him into road kill was not completely unexpected,
      but Al was shaken just the same. He maintained his bravado,
      however, while friends and sympathizers reacted more predictably.
      When the intent of the suppression escalated from malicious to
      deadly, most began to slip quietly away and it was High Noon
      again. Another complicating and aggravating factor was the
      appearance of a discussion group at the Yahoo website called “Get
      113to138mpgNOT”. This Yahoo Group was established by an individual
      calling himself “David Rodale”. He was not a Gen III licensee. He
      ( or she ) was a freelance public servant dedicated to helping
      those who had been ripped off by the promoter of impossibilities,
      the unscrupulous scoundrel, Allen Caggiano. He provided advice and
      counsel to those disappointed licensees who had not received their
      Gen III devices. He assured them that they could find justice in
      the courts. Al spent much time and energy fighting back against
      this defamation.<br>
      <br>
      Al was fully recovered from his “accident” by this time and had
      repaired the Pontiac. He was feeling every day of his 59 years,
      but he soldiered on with a grim determination towards whatever
      final confrontation awaited him. When a careful, bloodless voice
      on the phone proposed a compromise one day, he felt ready to
      bargain. His website was experiencing growing traffic, as many as
      70,000 hits in a month. The voice told him that if he would just
      remove the Gen III from his site he would be left alone. It felt
      like a small victory, but he didn’t relish the idea of backing
      down. If Gary Cooper had received such an offer in High Noon, he
      would have taken it.<br>
      <br>
      He knew a bargain with the devil could never work in his favor,
      but he had to catch his breath, so he played along and removed the
      Gen III from his site. It was a strategic retreat. If they would
      leave him alone, the beta testing of units already out there could
      go forward. The program was smaller than he had originally
      intended, but it was a start and if he could relax and gather his
      data, then he might ultimately win the game. However, a careful
      examination of the FIVS in his Pontiac one afternoon made his
      heart jump into his throat. He found a tiny hairline crack in the
      aluminum/titanium alloy cannister. This Gen III unit had many
      thousands of miles on it. It presaged a potential disaster and he
      immediately notified all the licensees of the problem and recalled
      the units. He worked feverishly and discovered that he didn’t have
      to redesign the cannister. A simple alteration appeared to be the
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      Though physically robust, Al had been born an epileptic and had
      used medications his entire life to keep the condition under
      control. Drugs may benefit certain ailments for which they are
      designed, but they can often provoke serious side effects. Al
      suffered this collateral damage and had developed diabetes owing
      to the effect of a drug on his pancreas, which he treated with
      oral doses of insulin. An aneurism located in the stomach region
      had also been identified ten years earlier. It was time for his
      annual visit to the hospital, a routine check up to monitor this
      potential problem.<br>
      <br>
      This check up was anything but routine. It was decided that the
      aneurism required immediate surgical treatment. After the fact,
      this prognosis was shown to be false. The aneurism had not posed a
      danger. A malpractice suit will ultimately decide whether the
      doctor and hospital were liable for what happened. In any case,
      while the surgery was underway, Al suffered a mild stroke. His
      heart stopped and he was technically dead on the operating table
      for a few minutes. In addition, the surgeon accidentally damaged
      nerves in his spinal column. Al awoke in a hospital room the next
      day, feeling more dead than alive and without the ability to move
      the legs that had worked just fine the day before.<br>
      <br>
      Without bad luck, he would have had no luck at all. It was
      sometimes difficult for him in black moods to see any advantage in
      being the Allen Caggiano who could take bold and reckless strides
      in life, but as he lay recuperating day after day he could see no
      advantage at all in being an Allen Caggiano in a wheel chair. The
      loving support of family and friends couldn’t relieve the crushing
      feelings of futility and helplessness. He kept the television
      playing in an effort to distract him from his own bloody thoughts,
      and on the local noon news on a sunny day in the spring of 2003 he
      watched a dramatic live report of a SWAT team in action. They were
      closing in around a familiar looking building. He thought to
      himself: “Hey! That’s looks like my condo! Hey! That is my condo!”
      He watched the police seizing his yellow Pontiac in the parking
      lot as the Channel 7 reporter explained that Chelmsford,
      Massachusetts, resident, Allen Caggiano, had defrauded investors
      in a fuel saver scam and then fled the country. He didn’t see how
      that could be true since he was in the IC ward of the local
      hospital, not 20 miles away, but for one fleeting moment, he did
      believe it. That’s the Allen Caggiano he wanted to be, strolling
      on a beach in the Caribbean. Such is the power of television. Then
      he shouted in outrage and he knew why he was back from the dead.
      He had unfinished business.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile “David Rodale” at Yahoo Group “Get 113to138mpgNOT” had
      found 20 disappointed Gen III licensees and was patiently building
      consensus for legal action at the state level in Massachusetts. It
      wasn’t easy to turn disappointment into outrage and a desire for
      revenge. In spite of the resources available to the Big Boys, they
      hadn’t been able to otherwise identify most of the testing program
      licensees. Al returned home to his condo to find his Pontiac with
      the repaired Gen III’s in the trunk gone from its parking space.
      It hadn’t been a bad dream, it was real! His premises had been
      ransacked, his computer hard drives removed. With his mind foggy
      from pain killers, Al tried to concentrate on getting used to a
      wheel chair. Nurses from the Visiting Nurses Association were with
      him around the clock. Gradually he stopped using the pain killers.
      He began to notice sensation returning to his legs.<br>
      <br>
      Even as he felt himself improving, his diabetic condition
      inexplicably worsened. Twice he was rushed to the hospital in a
      comatose state. The third time this happened, a nurse checked his
      pill caddy and discovered insulin pills that should not have been
      there. He was now taking insulin through injection, but the old
      insulin pills were still in the medicine cabinet and had been put
      in his pill caddy with his other medications. The nurse, Michele,
      who had done this, not once, but three times, did not again appear
      for her shift. Al tried to reach her to ask for an apology for her
      mistakes, but she had vanished. The Visiting Nurses Association
      denied having any record of her employment.<br>
      <br>
      “David Rodale” was having success convincing the disappointed
      licensees to file suit, and with the newly acquired information
      about the FIVS Gen III International operations taken during the
      SWAT assault, a postal inspector launched a preliminary inquiry
      into the feasibility of action at the federal level for mail
      fraud. Rodale was confidant that the threat to society posed by
      Allen Caggiano was now neutralized. He announced to the Yahoo
      Group members that he’d done his best and there was nothing more
      to do. He would leave the Yahoo Group in place for a while, but he
      planned to take it down in a couple of months. He was sorry that
      so many people had been taken in, and he hoped they’d be less
      gullible in the future. He was glad he could help.<br>
      <br>
      This writer telephoned Al one Monday evening in the spring of 2004
      following his first court appearance the previous Friday. The
      phone rang ten times before he finally picked up. If the phone was
      not within arm’s reach, it took him a while to get to it because
      he wasn’t walking too well. “Like Frankenstein”, he said. But he
      was out of his wheel chair and walking for short distances. He was
      on his way back.<br>
      <br>
      “You’re back!” I said.<br>
      <br>
      “Yeah, I’m discontinued until March 15,” Al said. He was alert and
      he sounded relieved.<br>
      <br>
      “So, they didn’t have a trial?”<br>
      <br>
      “No, we’re all ready for trial, right? But the district attorney
      wasn’t.”<br>
      <br>
      I realized that Caggiano sounds a lot like Marlon Brando in “A
      Street Car Named Desire”. He sometimes can’t find the word he
      wants. The story was that the DA didn’t have his case together. He
      was embarrassed and asked the judge for a 90 day continuance. Al’s
      attorney wouldn’t go for that and they finally compromised on 40
      days. The DA was having trouble getting the plaintiffs to the
      courtroom. If they aren’t there, he has no case because the
      defendant has the right to face his accusers. Al was being charged
      with larceny. Al explained that the Feds were very interested in
      this case. If the DA could get a guilty verdict in the state
      court, they would be more confidant about pursuing an indictment
      for mail fraud in a federal court.<br>
      <br>
      “I could smell those bastards. There was three of them sitting in
      the courtroom. I could pick out the three Feds,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      “Why? Were they wearing dark suits?”<br>
      <br>
      “They’re like in suits, but it’s the shoes they wear. That there
      gives them away, right? Every one of them wears the same stinking
      kind of shoe, right, the cop shoe?” “You mean the black shoe with
      thick soles?”<br>
      <br>
      “Uh huh. Yeah, uh, listen to this, uh, one time I was leaving my
      condo and I seen a telephone truck out there, and I look up the
      pole, right? And low and behold, there’s the shoe. He had the
      Verizon uniform, the phone company uniform, but he had the shiny
      black Fed shoes on! You’d think they’d change their appearance or
      whatever. I mean, the shoes are a dead give away. You got a guy
      climbing a telephone pole. He should have boots on, right?”<br>
      <br>
      “So he was up ‘fixing’ your telephone?”<br>
      <br>
      “Yeah. So I stops over to the pole and I got out of the car and I
      says, geez, I says, hey, you know, are the Feds that hard up that
      they gotta climb a pole to use the phone? Hey, you wanna use my
      phone?”<br>
      <br>
      No one could live the kind of life Al has lived without a sense of
      humor. He was bone weary and his anxiety showed through the
      bravado and feistiness. It was still High Noon and it had been
      High Noon for years. He had good lawyers and many friends but only
      he could fight the battle because it wasn’t ultimately a battle
      for control of the FIVS Gen III nor was it about money. It was
      never really about the money he said. It was a battle for the
      right to be Allen Caggiano. He wasn’t going to let anyone deny him
      the right to be himself. It was this that was to die for. It was
      the spirit of ‘76 that all the corruption of wealth and power has
      not yet been able to neutralize in this country.<br>
      <br>
      That summer, the judge dismissed the charges against Al in the
      Massachusetts court. His lawyer petitioned for the return of his
      property, the Pontiac the local police had seized a year earlier.
      He was told it had been taken to Washington, DC, and was being
      examined to determine if it violated any federal regulations. A
      grand jury in DC was convened to investigate the federal charges
      of mail fraud, but it failed to return an indictment. The
      licensees who had paid their money and signed their licensing
      agreements had agreed to assume the risks of a testing program and
      most of them did understand that part of the risk involved the
      historical efforts of the oil/auto cartel to suppress new
      technology that could affect their profitability or control over
      the markets they ruthlessly dominate.<br>
      <br>
      Through his attorney, Al received an offer for exclusive rights to
      the Gen III. The amount of money involved beggars belief, and
      suffice it to say that Al again refused, as he had done in the
      early 80's when an offer was made for the Gen II device. The Big
      Boys have never attempted to prosecute him for the violation of
      federal emission control regulations. He is clearly guilty on this
      score so far as the Gen II is concerned. To do so would result in
      the exposure of the fraud they are perpetrating on the public.
      Their technology is obsolete. As Al has pointed out on his
      website, they do not want a reduction in the demand for oil. This
      would mean a reduction in oil company profits. If the consumer
      used half or less of the oil now being used, government tax
      revenues would be reduced accordingly. If the Gen III were to
      become available the public interest in fuel economy and clean air
      would be served and Allen Caggiano would become rich beyond wild
      imaginings, but the oil/energy cartel and its partner in
      government would suffer. Therefore, the Big Boys will continue to
      do all that they can to stop Al and his FIVS and to keep the
      public ignorant of any technology they do not themselves control.
      If they don’t control it, and if you don’t buy it from them, then
      it doesn’t work, or it’s a fraud.<br>
      <br>
      “What you’re going to be doing now is not something you’re going
      to be discussing on the phone, but you are continuing, aren’t
      you?” I asked when I spoke with Al later on that summer.<br>
      <br>
      “I am continuing! I’ve got enough people behind me that know how
      to do the right thing. I’m tired of all this bullshit! The Feds
      are going to screw up one time and I’m going to get em!”<br>
      <br>
      “How’s that?”<br>
      <br>
      “I don’t know how, I just don’t, but I’m tired of their bullshit.
      They don’t scare me. I go after the big boys and I’m like a little
      ant and they’re an elephant. I go and give em a little bite on the
      leg. And one of these days, I bite em enough and I’m gonna at
      least get the leg infected. I mean, they tried everything on me.
      They tried killing me, right? I don’t die, I don’t stay dead.. I
      ain’t giving up. Hey, you know what I seen one time that really
      impressed me? I was watching Discover on TV. Maybe it was National
      Geographic. Whatever. OK? I’m looking at this elephant, right, and
      he’s gliding across the desert, sideways, instead of walking, Know
      what it was?”<br>
      <br>
      “No. That’s weird. What was it?”<br>
      <br>
      “Ants! Thousands and thousands of ‘em. African ants carrying an
      elephant across the desert! They carried him to their house there
      in the desert and they just took him apart piece by piece. The
      elephant just disappeared!”<br>
      <br>
      “Amazing!”<br>
      <br>
      “And you know what I’d like to say? I’d like to say: ‘Calling all
      ants! Calling all ants! Come and help me with this fucking
      elephant!’”<br>
      <br>
      Al’s got a new strategy for dealing with the elephant. In August,
      2004, he got his site back up on the web, www.get113to138mpg.com,
      The strategy is simple. He’s going to give away plans for the FIVS
      Gen III, just as he did with the Gen II, so that anyone, anywhere
      in the world with a computer to download the file, can have a
      detailed set of working drawings. These will be CAD drawings
      produced by an engineer that can be programmed into modern
      machines.<br>
      <br>
      The “FIVS Gen III International” enterprise has been successfully
      suppressed. Al’s fight to manufacture and distribute his invention
      and enjoy the great wealth it would have given him is over. The
      Big Boys have broken his bank, and his health. The struggle has
      nearly destroyed him. The money would have been nice, but it never
      was the money that kept him going. He is now donating his work of
      a life time to the American people. The Big Boys can harass,
      intimidate, and attempt to kill one man and his American Dream,
      but can they do the same to many thousands of Americans and others
      around the world? Not likely.<br>
      <br>
      Al will allow his patent application for the Gen III to expire. He
      can no longer afford the large investment required for a patent
      here and in at least ten other countries. His main concern now is
      to prevent the FIVS from being patented by anyone and to keep the
      device “open source”, so to speak, so that it cannot come under
      the control of the Big Boys and will remain freely available to
      the public. Though Al will not profit from his invention through
      licensing fees or royalties, there is considerable satisfaction
      for him in knowing that the Big Boys have not and will not
      ultimately win this game.<br>
      <br>
      Those who returned their FIVs Gen III’s in the original testing
      program when Al issued the recall, owing to the crack in the
      cannister, will eventually receive a modified Gen III called the
      FIVS Gen IIIa. All the original licensees of the “FIVS Gen III
      International” operation, including those 44 in the US and Canada
      whose units were disappeared via UPS, will each receive the Gen
      IIIa device. Those 20 individuals who followed the pied piper,
      “David Rodale”, and sued Al, are out of luck, he says, unless they
      are willing to pay the attorney’s fees generated by the
      litigation. As of this writing 24 Gen IIIa’s have been sent to the
      original licensees. These units are now being clandestinely
      manufactured in the US.<br>
      <br>
      Al is himself no longer involved. He is the inventor who gave it
      all away. But he will remain available to those who may want to
      discuss the FIVS Gen IIIa in the future. It is up to the people to
      carry on his American Dream and take control of their own destiny.
      The American love affair with the automobile does not have to
      spell disaster for the natural world, nor does it have to mean war
      with other countries. The FIVS Gen III provides a practical
      solution right now that will allow us to reduce our national
      demand for oil and help solve our air pollution problem. Most
      existing automobiles can be retrofitted with the FIVS right now so
      that most existing automobiles can run as efficiently and as
      pollution free as the new “hybrid” cars.<br>
      <br>
      Semi-invalid and 60 years old, Al continues to work to regain his
      ability to walk. His approach to healing and health is innovative
      and creative, and he has achieved remarkable results so far. He’s
      started a new career as a loan officer for a mortgage lender, and
      he will point out that Centurion is not associated with the oil
      companies or auto manufacturers. Take a good look at the
      photograph of Al in his banker’s pinstripe suit. He’s a high
      mileage vehicle, he’s been in a few wrecks, but he still looks
      sharp, he’s not burning any oil, and he’s not for sale. Look
      carefully, and beneath the surface you will see something you
      don’t often see in people. The courage to be. Allen Caggiano has
      the courage to be Allen Caggiano, no matter what. He’s proved it.
      And if that isn’t the American Dream, what is? When we line up at
      the Pearly Gates for our interview with St. Peter, this is the
      question he’s most interested in: did you have the courage to be
      yourself?<br>

        <i>A Brief History of Allen Caggiano and His FIVS</i><br>
        <br>
        <b>by Joseph Danison</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>There’s one point something billion people in China, they work
      for peanuts, they don’t have unions, and they don’t complain. Al
      was there in the spring of 2005. They treated him like a celebrity
      because the word was out that he was an American bringing jobs. If
      there’s just one thing the Chinese love more than American jobs it
      would be noodles. Being treated so well was quite a shock for an
      Italian guy from Massachusetts who never much liked Chinese food
      to begin with. It was a country ruled by a communist dictatorship,
      sure, but it didn’t seem half bad! A little crowded maybe, but
      friendly.<br>
      <br>
      He was traveling with Kenny DeRosa, his business partner and
      friend. When Al tried to go public with his FIVS in the ‘80's, he
      fell down a rabbit hole and before he finally got out he lost
      everything, except the FIVS and Kenny DeRosa. They were in
      Guangdong province to meet up with Neville Solomon and the Chinese
      investor, Kevin Ng. Neville was another guy who fell into a hole.
      His hole was so deep that he came out in China.<br>
      <br>
      Al had tried to warn Neville in 2004 when he was so excited about
      building the FIVS. Neville Solomon was a native South African from
      Johannesburg living happily in the US as a bone fide permanent
      resident with his American wife and seven children. He was a
      bright-eyed Republican conservative and a Christian minister at
      that time. Al was down for the count when Neville met him. The Big
      Boys thought they had finally beaten him. He would never sell them
      the rights to his Fuel Implosion Vaporization System. He had
      thumbed his nose at their deals from the beginning. He had kissed
      off millions of dollars! They took everything but his integrity.<br>
      <br>
      Then they got rough, really rough. His bank was broken by 2004,
      and his body was broken, too, but he had one last play to make. He
      published the secret design of the FIVS on his website so that
      anyone could now build it and the Big Boys would never get control
      of it. That’s how desperate he was. He gave it all up, his dream
      of wealth and success, his exclusive rights to his own invention,
      just so the FIVS would get out there, just so he could have the
      satisfaction of bringing down the Big Boys and their fucking
      monopoly.<br>
      <br>
      When Neville first talked to Al that spring of ‘04, he had no idea
      what he was in for. He had seen Al’s website and decided he would
      build Al’s FIVS himself and become obscenely rich! Al tried to
      warn him that the FIVS had become a mission and was definitely not
      a get rich quick scheme. But Neville wouldn’t listen. He thought
      Al was paranoid. The US is a free country and stuff like that just
      doesn’t happen here. And he went chasing after the dollar signs
      until his adopted country kicked him out on his ass and he found
      himself in China.<br>
      <br>
      Al could only shake his head during his first conversations with
      Neville. He would never listened to warnings, either, when the
      ambition to build a high mileage device took him over way back in
      the 70's. From that first Eureka! moment in the shop of Debal
      Heating &amp; Cooling in 1973, the die was cast. Allen Caggiano,
      proprietor, was going to create a high mileage device that would
      cut automobile fuel consumption dramatically and make the US
      energy independent. The Arabs had cut off the Middle East oil
      supply and the American economy was going into a tailspin. While
      working on a new evaporation coil for an air conditioning system
      he was designing, Al discovered the principle of fuel
      vaporization. Not a new idea, but new to him. In a flash, he saw
      how he could miniaturize the coil and adapt it for a car.
      Vaporized fuel would burn more efficiently, reducing both
      consumption and pollution.<br>
      <br>
      If he had stopped at that point to reflect, his life would have
      continued along a normal trajectory. He was doing very well in his
      business. Debbie, the “Deb” in Debal, kept the books, and could
      see that she’d chosen a winner. He was a little crazy and
      unpredictable at times. Did that have something to do with
      epilepsy? There was a flaw in the wiring of his brain and if he
      didn’t take medication, he’d have a fit. Very scary! He didn’t get
      along with his father and she didn’t blame him. The old man was a
      very hard nut. Al had more demons to fight than most. He drove
      himself relentlessly, though, and never wasted a minute feeling
      sorry for himself. He was the most creative man she’d ever known
      and a loving father to their five children. She would complain at
      times that she didn’t really know him. She gave up trying to
      control him. He sometimes frightened her. But it was a good kind
      of fear, the kind Catholic girls feel before they go off like fire
      crackers in bed.<br>
      <br>
      Al didn’t look into the history of high mileage carburetors and
      there wasn’t much written on the subject in any case. There was no
      internet in those days. He didn’t pay attention to talk of how the
      auto companies didn’t want good mileage, how they actually
      suppressed super carburetors. If some one had developed a device
      that actually worked, giving high mileage and good power, well
      then, the auto makers would use it because the consumers would
      stand in line to buy it. Jimmy Carter was talking energy
      independence. With 40% of the oil going to cars, the solution was
      obvious. He’d be the one to make it possible, the American hero!
      And billionaire. He was sure no one had been able to build one
      that really worked. He would. He was Allen Caggiano, the one and
      only. He had no time for cry babies.<br>
      <br>
      The first device he came up with was the FIVS Gen I. Phenomenal
      results on the first test run, 113 mpg! Then it blew up. Back to
      the drawing board. The FIVS Gen II performed reliably, giving
      equally fantastic results. Al began putting ads in the newspapers,
      looking for investors. An offer came in from a corporation in
      California to buy all rights for several million dollars. That was
      just chicken feed, Al believed, compared to the potential. He had
      his lawyer friend check out the company. It was a subsidiary of a
      subsidiary all owned by an oil company. Thanks, but no thanks! Deb
      was still on board at this point, though she began to get worried
      when the FBI came around. They told Al his vehicle violated the
      law and he should cease and desist.<br>
      <br>
      Technically, they were right. It was against the law to alter a
      carburetor or remove the catalytic converter, which Al had done.
      Federal EPA regulations. But Al couldn’t take this more seriously
      than a mattress tag warning. The Gen II allowed the engine to burn
      fuel much more efficiently so that it also dramatically reduced
      emissions. A Gen II vehicle without a catalytic converter would be
      less polluting than a carbureted or fuel injected car using one!
      If the Feds wanted a fight, he’d give them one. He never backed
      down. He had the tenacity of a pit bull. Deb was biting her nails.<br>
      <br>
      Two FBI agents showed up weeks later. One talked to Al to distract
      him while the other hopped into his Gen II modified Dodge station
      wagon and drove away. He never saw that car again. The FBI denied
      any knowledge of the incident. Al was outraged. He was beginning
      to see the writing on the wall. He advised Deb to stop worrying.
      He got another Dodge and installed a new Gen II. He painted the
      car a bright yellow and on the sides he wrote in bold black
      letters: “This car gets over 100 MPG and doesn’t pollute the air.
      The Big Boys are trying to make me and this car disappear. Help
      me!”<br>
      <br>
      A few weeks later, brown manila envelopes began to arrive in the
      mail box. Inside were 8x10 photos of the kids getting off the
      school bus, Deb at the supermarket, and so on. Deb was paralyzed
      with fear. Al was angry that she would cave into their dirty
      tricks. She thought he might be going off the deep end this time
      and demanded that he give up the FIVS. She warned him that it was
      going to be a choice between her and his invention. Why would he
      be so stubborn? Why did they need to be billionaires and make the
      US energy independent? Al was an immovable object. The marriage
      was over.<br>
      <br>
      Without Deb and the children, he felt like the one-legged man in
      an ass-kicking contest. But he was burning with anger. The
      bastards would not get away with this! His faith in the basic
      fairness of the American game was taking a serious hit. There was
      more going on than EPA regulations. The bastards didn’t really
      care about air pollution. They didn’t want high mileage cars. It
      was that simple. They wanted to sell as much oil as possible. The
      government got a nice cut of every gallon in taxes, so they were
      in on it, too. The Oil companies didn’t want energy independence
      for the US because they were profiting from Middle Eastern oil.
      Jimmy Carter and his energy independence campaign went down in
      flames while the scum bags made secret deals with Saddam Hussein,
      the Saudis, and even the Ayatollah Khomeini. The biggest of these
      scum bags bore the name of Bush.<br>
      <br>
      Al was mano a mano with the oil companies and their government
      cronies. They were afraid of the FIVS. They had a good thing going
      and before they let him rock the boat, they’d crush him like a
      bug. He was frightened, maybe for the first time in his life,
      truly frightened, but he didn’t back down. He could have raised
      the white flag at any time, sold the rights to his FIVS, and gone
      back to a rich and comfortable life.<br>
      <br>
      Instead, he went to prison. First he was set up on a drug charge.
      Local police planted cocaine in the condo he now called home. He
      was convicted and sent to state prison. But he knew the Brockton
      police chief was crooked. He knew that he stole cocaine from the
      evidence locker and he knew how he could prove it.. He escaped. He
      fashioned a key out of wood in the prison shop and simply let
      himself out. It was big local news with helicopters in the air and
      dogs on the ground. Al knew the woods because he’d hunted them all
      his life and they didn’t catch him before he got the job done. He
      contacted his friend on the Brockton force and then turned himself
      in on the same day he’d escaped.<br>
      <br>
      The Brockton police chief was indicted, convicted, and sent to
      prison himself. State charges against Al were dropped. Nearly 400
      convictions were over turned as a result of Al’s bold move, news
      that cheered the inmates in all the lock ups in the region and
      made him something of a hero. It was good that Al could have such
      popularity in the prison population because he was soon to join it
      again when a federal prosecutor stepped in and indicted him on
      federal charges. Al was convicted and sentenced to 30 years in
      federal prison on various manufactured charges related to the
      state charges that had been dismissed. His appeal was never heard.
      After ten years, he was suddenly released in 1997. Today, no
      record exists of his federal conviction and incarceration. Those
      who had stolen ten of his most productive adult years from age 43
      to 53 erased the evidence that they had done so.<br>
      <br>
      But if the Big Boys thought the prison experience would break his
      spirit and stop the FIVS, they were very wrong. He was bounced
      around from one federal institution to another. In one of them Al
      collaborated with the warden of facilities to produce Gen II’s in
      the prison shop and sell them outside. In others he learned
      computer technology. He acquired valuable contacts and applied for
      and was awarded patent #5,782,225 for the Gen II.<br>
      <br>
      The Gen II, as with most fuel vaporization devices, requires
      serious modification of a vehicle’s OEM systems. Federal EPA
      regulations effectively block vaporization systems from coming in
      to use. In prison, Al dreamed up the next generation of the FIVS,
      the Gen III, an entirely new device that does not violate any
      existing regulations. The Gen III is not a vaporization device
      although fuel is vaporized as part of its operation. The Gen III
      is a mini onboard fuel refinery.<br>
      <br>
      In his cell at night, Al would dream the plans and specifications
      for the new Gen III and while still asleep he would get up and
      sleep-draw at the writing table. In the morning, Al saw the
      drawings on the table and thought it was the work of his cell
      mate. He didn’t believe he had done it because he didn’t
      understand the device or why it should work. Magnets were called
      for and an electroplated platinum coating on the interior of the
      cannister and special aluminum alloy and so on. He had a very
      strong feeling that some kind of strange intelligence was trying
      to help him. It was scary if he thought about it too much. He
      wondered if he might be going crazy, for real. Deb used to say he
      was crazy, and the truth was he’d always felt a little crazy his
      whole life, but this was something different, not like anything
      he’d ever done before. Still, he felt great, and he was determined
      to build this Gen III . With the help of the warden of facilities
      who had profited handsomely from the Gen II, he built the first
      Gen III prototype in the prison shop.<br>
      <br>
      When the prison system spit him out unexpectedly in 1997 he
      focused his resources and eventually started a new operation
      called the FIVS Gen III International. Older, wiser, and empowered
      by a new sense of some kind of supernatural support, he was ready
      to take another run at the Big Boys. Prison had turned him into a
      political animal. It wasn’t just high mileage and big bucks he was
      after now. He wanted to bring the oil companies down in a big
      way.. He wanted to pry loose the hands of the energy monopoly from
      the throat of the American consumer. The FIVS could reduce US
      demand for oil by roughly half if it were retrofitted on American
      vehicles. That just might do it.<br>
      <br>
      The Gen III delivered 138 MPG on a late model vehicle. He still
      didn’t know why it worked. He simply followed the specs that he
      was given in his dreams. Ordinary gasoline went in one end and a
      new type of liquid fuel came out the other that didn’t even smell
      like gasoline. He put up a website- www.get113to138mpg.com- in
      2002 and launched on his maiden voyage. There was strong interest
      from those wanting to take part in a beta testing program. Al
      selected a small group of 137 from North America and around the
      world. The website was getting megahits every day.<br>
      <br>
      The operation was decentralized. Through prison contacts he
      arranged to manufacture the cannister in the Ukraine where the Big
      Boys couldn’t find the factory. The magnets were bought from
      China. It would be assembled in Mexico and sold in 40 countries
      around the world. At the same time he gave away free plans for the
      Gen II so that people all over the country could build their own.
      He figured that would keep the Feds so busy they wouldn’t have
      time to deal with the Gen III.<br>
      <br>
      But they found the time and the gloves were off. When Al drove his
      Gen III modified ‘74 Pontiac Catalina down to Mexico to oversee
      assembly, an 18-wheeler stalked him and drove him off the road as
      he was coming back into Massachusetts. The Pontiac rolled over
      several times, landing on its feet. The roof and doors were bashed
      in, the car was a wreck, but Al was able to drive it home. He
      suffered a punctured lung, broken ribs, and had to be cut out of
      the car with a torch. They then confiscated the UPS domestic
      shipments and disappeared the tracking numbers so that no North
      American beta tester received a FIVS, creating a small group of 44
      dissatisfied individuals in the US and Canada. If you didn’t get
      yours, did it ever really exist?<br>
      <br>
      But the worst was the tiny hairline stress crack that he noticed
      in a FIVS unit that had been in use for thousands of miles. That
      stopped the testing program more effectively than the shady
      saboteurs and assassins. He had to immediately issue a recall
      notice to all those in other countries who had received their
      FIVS. There were 93 of these out there. Al was determined to fix
      them all. Once his injuries were healed sufficiently, he came up
      with a quick and easy solution that he called the Gen IIIa. He
      drove himself mercilessly.<br>
      <br>
      The attempt on his life and the sabotage of the UPS shipments sent
      a message to Al’s associates and investors. They faded away. FIVS
      Gen III International was badly wounded. The money was
      evaporating. At the same time, a mysterious individual calling
      himself “David Rodale”, who was not a member of the testing
      program, appeared at the Yahoo website with a new Yahoo group
      called “get113to138mpgNot”. Rodale began to attract the attention
      of those in North America who had not received their FIVS, that
      tiny group of 44 individuals. He wore a white hat. He accused Al
      of being a fraud and encouraged the disappointed to take legal
      action and rid America of an unscrupulous con man. 20 of the 44
      eventually agreed to file suit. Al spent many hours of e-mail
      countering the slanders of “David Rodale” and trying to explain
      the situation. His secretary was gone. It was too much for one
      man.<br>
      <br>
      Then it came time for his annual physical check up in 2003. An
      aneurism in his stomach had been identified many years earlier.
      Doctors had said it posed no danger, but they liked to keep an eye
      on it. He had suffered migraines during his life, which had been
      cured by using a drug that eventually damaged his pancreas. This
      induced diabetes, but the diabetes was not serious and the
      condition seemed to be gradually correcting itself. The broken
      ribs and punctured lung had healed. He was stressed and on the
      point of physical exhaustion. He walked into the hospital,
      expecting to spend an hour or so, and when he finally came out
      again, it was three months later, in a wheel chair.<br>
      <br>
      Some one among the examining physicians pronounced the aneurism to
      be an immediate danger and Al was taken post haste to the OR for
      surgery. Who would argue under the circumstances? Al’s heart
      stopped three times during the operation. He recalls seeing
      himself on the operating table, feeling no pain, with a nurse bent
      forward over him, pushing on his chest, and a lot of commotion all
      around. Her dress was hiked up and he casually noticed she was
      wearing blue panties.<br>
      <br>
      Then he was somewhere completely unfamiliar and a strange man
      appeared to him, a man with swarthy skin like an Arab, and kinky
      hair gone grey like an old African. He had striking blue eyes. He
      radiated tremendous warmth, love, and peace, and Al thought that
      the man must be Jesus. The man told him that he couldn’t stay. He
      had to go back. Al didn’t want to go back, he definitely didn’t
      want to go back. The man said he had to complete his mission, he
      had to go and cut down the tree. When he got that done, he could
      come back again. Al sat up abruptly. He was resting on a gurney,
      not an operating table, and he was in a body bag. The orderly who
      had been trying to zip up the bag was screaming and running down
      the hall.<br>
      <br>
      He didn’t fully return for 30 days. He lay in the ICU in a coma
      and it was only the intervention of his daughter that prevented
      the hospital from pulling his plug. He had been clinically dead
      for so long that the doctors had no hope. But he did. He finally
      returned.<br>

      <i>The Gen IIIa modified Pontiac Catalina stolen by the local
        police in 2003 as Al lay in the hospital. From a source Al
        learned that this 400ci beast got 93 mpg when the FBI drove it
        to DC later that year. This is the second of Al’s cars the
        government seized. No accounting has been given.</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      He met the OR nurse again while he recuperated. She confirmed that
      she wore blue panties that day when she was trying to resuscitate
      him, blue panties trimmed with lace. So, it had really happened,
      and Jesus had really happened, too! But he didn’t tell her the
      Jesus part. He kept that to himself and watched television as the
      days dragged by, feeling no particular desire to do anything until
      one afternoon on the news he saw a SWAT team entering a building
      that looked very much like his condo. The news caster was
      reporting that Allen Caggiano had defrauded the public with a
      phoney high mileage device and fled the country with his ill-
      gotten gains. Police had warrants to seize his property. The
      camera showed the Pontiac being towed away, the one he had found
      to replace the wrecked one. It was definitely his. There was no
      other yellow Pontiac Catalina with bold lettering on the sides!
      His blood began to boil. There were 3 Gen IIIa’s in the trunk, all
      he had!<br>
      <br>
      Back in his condo, which was now stripped of all things that might
      relate to the FIVS, including hard drives from his computers, he
      required nursing care around the clock. He had no feeling from the
      waste down and could not walk. But sensation was slowly returning
      and he was determined to walk again. The kinky-haired Jesus had
      clarified his thinking and he began to believe that he could not
      die until he had accomplished his mission. Jesus would see to
      that. What the hell else could they do to him now, anyway? He
      started to plan a new website.<br>
      <br>
      But the Big Boys still had some dirty tricks in their bag.. He
      began to relapse into a comatose state, inexplicably, and have to
      be rushed to the hospital. On the third occasion, the night nurse
      happened to notice that insulin pills were being included in his
      pill caddy. Since his release from the hospital he had been taking
      insulin by injection. The old prescription of insulin pills left
      in the medicine cabinet should not have been put in his pill
      caddy. He was being overdosed on insulin. The shift nurse
      responsible did not return. She disappeared. The Home Nursing
      Association which contracted for Al’s care had no record of her.<br>
      <br>
      Later, it was also learned that the operation had been completely
      unnecessary. The x-rays had not been read correctly<br>
      <br>
      On his new website, Al announced: “Hey guys, I’m back! Can’t kill
      me! I don’t stay dead!” True enough! He was giving it all away now
      in the hope that the American people would carry on the fight.
      Lots of interested people called and e-mailed and Al spent his
      time on the phone answering questions, giving advice. He had to
      earn some money from his wheel chair, so he started brokering
      mortgages online and did so well that he later set up his own
      mortgage business with his youngest son in California.<br>
      <br>
      Until Neville Solomon called in early 2004, Al had not spoken with
      anyone who was such a quick study. He believed he’d found a man he
      could trust. The INS showed up one day in March of 2005, clapped
      Neville in irons, treated him abusively, and killed his American
      dream on the spot. Who cared if he had an American wife and seven
      children? Mere collateral damage. He was held at an INS detention
      center where he met Kevin Ng, a wealthy Chinese business man from
      New Orleans who was caught up in the big net of the Patriot Act.<br>
      <br>
      Kevin believed Neville’s story. Being a Christian evangelist,
      Neville has the gift of persuasion, which proved to be his own
      salvation at this low point in his life.As a citizen of Communist
      China with intimate experience of the lawless power of government,
      Kevin was not disillusioned,unlike Neville, just pissed off. He
      told Neville that if the US was so stupid, he should come to China
      and they would build the FIVS there. By summer, Neville was living
      as a guest of his generous host,Kevin Ng, in Fujian, in Guangdong
      province. Then Al showed up with Kenny. The FIVS had gone to China
      to be born again when Al sat down to make some design changes.
      With a few suggestions from Neville, Al developed the Gen IV to
      resolve Gen IIIa issues and reduce its size, among other things.
      It became a substantially different device.<br>
      <br>
      With no interference from the Big Boys, China felt like a free
      country. The Party encourages development. The Party is the
      supreme monopoly and the greates special interest group. It
      regulates the market to suit its own needs. The Party’s interests
      are best served by an open and competitive market. Ironically, the
      Chinese market has fewer inhibitions than the US, where the Big
      Boys squelch competition. Al was exuberant. He was walking more
      easily now without crutches. There was Kevin Ng’s capital, ready
      industrial space, and a hungry population of skilled workers who
      welcomed them as heroes. What could stop the FIVS now?<br>
      <br>
      Kevin Ng’s wealth was US based in an import business and two very
      successful restaurants in New Orleans. Katrina came ashore and
      smashed many dreams in the Big Easy. No doubt the Big Boys smiled.
      Things tend to go their way. Kevin Ng was suddenly at the point of
      bankruptcy. Neville was never able to test the prototypes of Al's
      new design in China. He urgently needed to support his wife and
      children who had arrived in China before Katrina hit. He went to
      work building a biodiesel facility and shipped the Gen IV
      prototypes back to Al in Massachusetts. Gone to China. Back again.<br>
      <br>
      America has been the world’s greatest engine of technological
      innovation for generations and that innovation begins in the
      little engine that could, the creative imagination of a single
      individual. The wealth and power of the Big Boys who create
      nothing themselves would not exist without that little individual.
      He or she is the goose that lays the golden egg and if they can’t
      own her, they want to kill her. Strange. They are also killing
      democracy.<br>
      <br>
      Al says that if the Big Boys don’t let him produce his FIVS here,
      then he will take his Gen IV back to China and let the Red Army
      build it. Energy efficiency creates energy abundance. Energy
      scarcity is all that prevents China from overwhelming the US
      economy.<br>
      <br>
      America is losing its technological edge, except in the area of
      military hardware, the technology of destruction, which the Big
      Boys are using to shoot themselves in the foot through their lust
      for war and global power. They are truly crazy. No doubt about it.
      Their stranglehold on energy production will be broken. The
      American people will not continue to be held hostage to their
      clever&nbsp; monopolies, dirty tricks, and lies. The American
      dream is dying for lack of clean air, water, cheap and
      non-polluting transport, and the freedom to innovate in a truly
      free market place. The time has come for the huddled masses of
      Americans to wake up and cut down this massive, old and ugly tree
      in which the Big Boys are perched, like vultures. It’s blocking
      the view of the future.<b><br>
