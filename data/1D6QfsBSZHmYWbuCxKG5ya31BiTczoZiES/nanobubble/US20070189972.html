      </b><b>Abstract</b> : The present invention relates to a method of
      forming nanobubbles that have potential utility in every
      industrial application and that impart special functions,
      especially to water. The present invention is a method of forming
      nanobubbles by applying physical irritation to microbubbles
      contained in a liquid so that the microbubbles are abruptly
      contracted to form nanobubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method of forming
      nanobubbles which have potential utility in every industrial
      application and impart special functions, especially to water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] It has been known that bubbles (microbubbles) having a
      diameter of not more than 50 [mu]m have a nature different from
      larger bubbles and are utilized in various fields.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] For example, Patent Reference 1 proposes an invention
      utilizing a nature of microbubbles wherein the presence of
      microbubbles promotes a physiological activity in creatures and
      increases metabolism, as a result of which ontogenetic growth is
      enhanced.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Recently, bubbles (bubbles having a diameter of not more
      than 1 [mu]m, hereinafter referred to as nanobubbles) with a
      diameter smaller than that of microbubbles are said to have
      beneficial effects also from an industrial point of view and have
      become a focus of attention.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] However, there is no method of forming nanobubbles. At the
      present state of the art, nanobubbles can momentarily exist only
      at the time of natural disappearance or collapse of microbubbles.
      Some nanobubbles with a diameter of the order of 1 [mu]m or less
      can be present in a stable state by the use of a surfactant or an
      organic substance. Such nanobubbles, however, are encapsulated in
      a strong shell made up of the surfactant or organic substance, so
      that they are isolated from the surrounding water. These
      nanobubbles have not functions such as an activational effect and
      a bactericidal effect on organisms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] The present invention has been made in view of the
      aforementioned circumstances and an object of the invention is to
      provide a method of forming nanobubbles that remain in a solution
      for a long time and continue to impart the solution with a
      function such as an activational effect or a bactericidal effect
      on organisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The present invention is directed to a method of forming
      nanobubbles remaining in a solution for a long time. The
      aforementioned object is achieved by applying physical irritation
      to microbubbles contained in a liquid so that the microbubbles are
      abruptly reduced in size.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The aforementioned object is achieved more effectively by
      the fact that in the step of abruptly reducing microbubbles in
      size, when the diameter of the microbubble is reduced to 200 nm or
      less, the charge density on the surface of the microbubble
      increases and an electrostatic repulsive force is produced,
      whereby the size reduction of the microbubble stops; or in the
      step of abruptly reducing microbubbles in size, due to ions
      adsorbed on the gas-liquid interface and an electrostatic
      attraction, both ions in the solution having opposite charges to
      each other and attracted to the vicinity of the interface are
      concentrated in a high concentration so as to serve as a shell
      surrounding the microbubble and inhibit dissolution of a gas
      within the microbubble into the solution whereby the microbubble
      is stabilized, or the ions adsorbed on the gas-liquid interface
      are hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions and electrolytic ions within
      the solution are used as the ions attracted to the vicinity of the
      interface whereby the microbubble is stabilized; or in the step of
      abruptly reducing microbubbles in size, the temperature within the
      microbubble sharply rises by adiabatic compression so that a
      physicochemical change in association with the ultrahigh
      temperature is applied around the microbubble whereby the
      microbubble is stabilized.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The aforementioned object is achieved more effectively when
      the physical irritation is to discharge static electricity through
      the microbubbles using a discharge device; when the physical
      irritation is to apply ultrasonic irradiation to the microbubbles
      using an ultrasonic generator; when the physical irritation is to
      cause a solution to flow by driving a rotor mounted in a vessel
      containing therein the solution and use compression, expansion and
      vortex flow which are produced during the flow; or when the
      physical irritation in the case of having a circulating circuit in
      the vessel to cause compression, expansion and vortex flow of the
      solution by passing the solution through an orifice or perforated
      plate having a single hole or a plurality of holes after receiving
      the solution that contains the microbubbles.<br>

      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] Nanobubbles formed by the present invention are
      characterized by remaining in a solution for a long time; as long
      as one or more months. Depending upon the nature of the gas within
      nanobubbles, the solution containing nanobubbles therein provides
      a physiological activation effect on organisms; a killing or
      antiproliferative effect on microorganisms such as bacteria and
      viruses; or a chemical reaction with an organic or inorganic
      substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The nature of nanobubbles and a method of forming
      nanobubbles will be described below. For illustrative convenience,
      descriptions are given only for the case of an aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The nanobubbles formed in accordance with the methods of
      forming nanobubbles of the present invention have a particle size
      or bubble diameter of not more than 200 nm. The nanobubbles formed
      in accordance with the methods of forming nanobubbles of the
      present invention remain in an aqueous solution for a long time;
      as long as one or more months. A preservation method of the
      aqueous solution containing nanobubbles therein is not
      particularly limited. Even when such a solution is stored in an
      ordinary vessel, the nanobubbles will not disappear for one or
      more months.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The physical property of a microbubble is to have a surface
      potential depending on the pH of the aqueous solution as shown in
      FIG. 2. This is because a hydrogen-bonding network of water at the
      gas-liquid interface requires more hydrogen ions and hydroxide
      ions as configuration factors. Since the electric charge keeps the
      equilibrium condition with respect to the surrounding water, it is
      constant regardless of the bubble diameter. Furthermore, an
      electrostatic force acts due to the static electrification on the
      surface, so that ions having the opposite electric charge are
      attracted to the vicinity of the gas-liquid interface.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] While the equilibrium charge state of a microbubble is
      maintained, if the microbubble is reduced in size within a short
      time, electric charges are concentrated. FIG. 3 shows the change
      of surface potential when the bubble diameter is reduced from
      about 25 [mu]m to about 5 (m for 10 seconds. It can be seen from
      FIG. 3 that reduction in bubble diameter causes deviation from the
      normal equilibrium condition, which results in the concentration
      of the electric charges. When this size-reduction speed is made
      higher increased and the bubble diameter is made smaller reduced,
      the charge amount per unit area increases inversely with the
      square of the bubble diameter.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Since the microbubble is surrounded by a gas-liquid
      interface, the interior of the microbubble is subjected to
      self-pressurization under the influence of a surface tension. The
      pressure rise in a micro bubble with respect to an environmental
      pressure can be evaluated through the Young-Laplace equation.<br>
      [Delta]P=4[sigma]/D (Eq. 1)<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Wherein [Delta]P is a the pressure rise variation, [sigma]
      is a the surface tension, and D is a the bubble diameter. In the
      case of distilled water at room temperature, for a microbubble
      with a diameter of 10 [mu]m, its internal pressure rises to about
      0.3 atmospheric pressures, and for a microbubble with a diameter
      of 1 [mu]m, its internal pressure rises to about 3 atmospheric
      pressures. The gas within the self-pressurized microbubble
      dissolves in water according to the Henry's law. Thus, the bubble
      diameter is gradually reduces reduced, which increases the
      internal pressure of the bubble so that the bubble diameter
      reduction rate is accelerated. As a result, bubbles with a
      diameter of not more than 1 [mu]m are completely dissolved almost
      instantly. That is, nanobubbles can be present only for an instant
      moment.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In contrast, according to the methods of forming
      nanobubbles of the present invention, microbubbles having a
      diameter of 10 [mu]m to 50 [mu]m are abruptly reduced by physical
      irritation. When the aqueous solution containing microbubbles
      therein is mixed with electrolytes of ferrous ions, manganese
      ions, calcium ions, sodium ions, magnesium ions or any other
      mineral ion such that the electrical conductivity in the aqueous
      solution containing microbubbles therein becomes not less than 300
      [mu]S/cm, the reduction in size of the bubbles is inhibited by
      electrostatic repulsive force. As used herein, the electrostatic
      repulsive force is an electrostatic force that acts on ions having
      the same charge and located in a diametrically opposed
      relationship to one another with respect to a spherical
      microbubble due to the increase in curvature of the sphere caused
      by the reduction in size of the microbubble. Since the microbubble
      reduced in size is subjected to pressure from surface tension, the
      tendency to reduce in size increases with the reduction in size of
      the microbubble. However, when the bubble diameter becomes smaller
      than 500 nm, the electrostatic repulsive force becomes evident and
      reduction in size of the bubble stops.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] When the aqueous solution is mixed with electrolytes of
      ferrous ions, manganese ions, calcium ions, sodium ions, magnesium
      ions or any other mineral ion such that the electrical
      conductivity in the aqueous solution becomes not less than 300
      [mu]S/cm, the electrostatic repulsive force sufficiently acts such
      that the force reducing the bubble in size and the electrostatic
      repulsive force are balanced, as a result of which the bubble is
      stabilized. While the diameter of the so stabilized bubble
      (nanobubble diameter) differs depending upon the concentration and
      type of the electrolytic ion, it becomes as small as 200 nm or
      less as shown in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The characteristics of the nanobubble are not only to keep
      gas therewithin in a pressurized state, but also to form a
      significantly strong electric field through the concentrated
      surface electric charges. This strong electric field exerts great
      influence upon the gas within the bubble and the aqueous solution
      around the bubble, which imparts the aqueous solution with a
      physiological activational effect, a bactericidal effect on
      organisms, chemical reactivity, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIG. 4 shows a mechanism where nanobubbles are present and
      stable. In the case of a nanobubble, electric charges are present
      on the gas-liquid interface in a significantly concentrated
      manner, so that the electrostatic repulsive force, which acts
      between the ions located in a diametrically opposed relationship
      to one another with respect to the sphere, inhibits the sphere
      (bubble) from being contracted. The concentrated high electric
      field serves to form an inorganic shell mainly composed of
      electrolytic ions such as iron around the bubble, which prevents
      dissipation of the gas within the bubble. This inorganic shell is
      different from a surfactant shell and an organic shell.
      Specifically, for the inorganic shell, due to the departure of the
      electric discharge that occurs when the nanobubble is brought into
      contact with other substances such as bacterium, the shell itself
      collapses easily. When the shell collapses, the gas within the
      shell is easily emitted into the aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 5 is a side view of an apparatus for forming
      nanobubbles using a discharge device.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] A microbubble generator 3 takes in an aqueous solution
      within a vessel 1 through a water inlet 31 and a gas is injected
      through a gas inlet (not shown) through which the gas for forming
      microbubbles within the microbubble generator 3 is injected. The
      gas is mixed with the aqueous solution from the water inlet 31 and
      microbubbles formed by the microbubble generator 3 are fed into
      the vessel 1 through the microbubbles-contained-solution outlet
      32. As a result, microbubbles are present in the vessel 1. The
      vessel 1 has therein an anode 21 and a cathode 22. The anode 21
      and the cathode 22 are connected to a discharge device 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] First, using the microbubble generator 3, microbubbles are
      generated within the vessel 1 containing therein an aqueous
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Then, electrolytes of ferrous ions, manganese ions, calcium
      ions, or any other mineral ion is added to the aqueous solution
      such that the electrical conductivity in the aqueous solution
      becomes not less than 300 [mu]S/cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Using the discharge device 2, the aqueous solution
      containing microbubbles therein within the vessel 1 is subjected
      to aqueous discharging. In order to form nanobubbles more
      efficiently, it is preferable that the concentration of the
      microbubbles within the vessel 1 have reached 50% or more of the
      saturated concentration. Furthermore, the voltage of the aqueous
      discharging is preferably in the range of 2000 V to 3000 V.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The shock wave stimulus (physical irritation) associated
      with the aqueous discharging reduces abruptly in size the
      microbubbles within the water, by which nano-level bubbles are
      formed. The ions existing around the bubble at this time are
      abruptly concentrated with the reduction in size of the bubble
      because the bubble reduction speed is high and there is no time
      for such ions to dissolve into the surrounding water. The
      concentrated ions produce a significantly high electric field
      around the bubble. Under the existence of this high electric
      field, hydrogen ions and hydroxide ions at the gas-liquid
      interface have a bonding relationship with electrolytic ions
      having a charge opposite thereto and located near the bubble,
      thereby forming an inorganic shell around the bubble. This shell
      inhibits spontaneous dissolution of the gas within the bubbles
      into the aqueous solution, so that the nanobubbles can be stably
      suspended in the aqueous solution. Furthermore, the nanobubble is
      a very tiny bubble having a diameter of not more than 200 nm, so
      that the nanobubble does not experience buoyant forces and rupture
      near the water surface, which is observed in normal bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] A method of forming nanobubbles by applying ultrasound as a
      physical irritation to microbubbles will be described below. The
      same description as above is not repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] FIG. 6 is a side view of an apparatus for forming
      nanobubbles using an ultrasonic generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Similar to the method of forming nanobubbles by means of
      discharging, microbubbles are formed at a microbubble generator 3,
      a water inlet 31 and a microbubble-contained-solution outlet 32
      and the microbubbles are fed into the vessel 1. The vessel 1 has
      an ultrasonic generator 4 mounted therein. The mounting position
      of the ultrasonic generator 4 is not particularly limited.
      However, in order to efficiently form nanobubbles, it is desirable
      to dispose the ultrasonic generator 4 between the water inlet 31
      and the microbubble-contained-solution outlet 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] First, using the microbubble generator 3, microbubbles are
      generated within the vessel 1 having therein water containing
      electrolytic ions. Then electrolytes, such as ferrite, manganese,
      calcium, or any other mineral is added thereto, such that the
      electrical conductivity in the aqueous solution becomes not less
      than 300 [mu]S/cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Then, using the ultrasonic generator 4, ultrasound is
      applied to the microbubbles-contained aqueous solution within the
      vessel 1. In order to form nanobubbles more efficiently, it is
      preferable that the concentration of the microbubbles within the
      vessel 1 have reached 50% or more of the saturated concentration.
      Preferably, the oscillating frequency of the ultrasonic waves
      should be 20 kHz to 1 MHz and the oscillation and intermission of
      the application of the ultrasonic are carried out alternately at
      intervals of 30 seconds. However, the ultrasonic waves may be
      applied continuously as required.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A method of forming nanobubbles by producing vortex flow as
      physical irritation will be described below. The same description
      as above is not repeated.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 7 is a side view of an apparatus using compression,
      expansion and vortex flow in order to form nanobubbles. Similar to
      the method of forming nanobubbles by means of discharging and
      ultrasonic application, microbubbles are formed at a microbubble
      generator 3, a water inlet 31 and a microbubble-contained-solution
      outlet 32 and the microbubbles are fed into the vessel 1. A
      circulating pump 5 for regionally circulating the
      microbubbles-contained aqueous solution within the vessel 1 is
      connected to the vessel 1. An orifice plate (perforated plate) 6
      having many holes is disposed within the piping (circulation
      piping) in which the circulating pump is provided. The orifice
      plate 6 is also connected with the vessel 1. The circulating pump
      5 causes the microbubble-contained aqueous solution within the
      vessel 1 to flow the circulation piping and pass through the
      orifice plate (perforated plate) 6, which causes compression,
      expansion and vortex flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] First, using the microbubble generator 3, microbubbles are
      generated within the vessel 1 having therein water containing
      electrolytic ions. Then, electrolytes such as ferrite, manganese,
      calcium, or any other mineral is added thereto such that the
      electrical conductivity in the aqueous solution becomes not less
      than 300 [mu]S/cm.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Then, the circulating pump 5 is operated to regionally
      circulate the microbubbles-contained aqueous solution. The
      circulating pump 5 forces out the microbubbles-contained aqueous
      solution, which causes compression, expansion and vortex flow
      within the piping before and after passing through the orifice
      plate (perforated plate) 6. By the fact that the microbubbles are
      compressed or expanded when they are passed through the orifice
      plate and the microbubbles electrically-charged by the vortex flow
      produced within the piping causes an eddy-current, the
      microbubbles are abruptly reduced in size and stabilized as
      nanobubbles. The circulating pump 5 and the orifice plate
      (perforated plate) 6 may be arranged in the inverse order in the
      passage.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] While a single orifice plate (perforated plate) 6 is
      provided in FIG. 6, a plurality of orifice plates may be provided.
      Furthermore, the circulating pump 5 may be omitted as appropriate.
      In his case, it is also possible to use a driving force of the
      microbubble generator 2 with respect to the aqueous solution or
      flowing of the aqueous solution due to a difference in elevation.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Furthermore, as shown in FIG. 8, nanobubbles may be formed
      by mounting in the vessel 1 a rotator 7 for producing vortex flow.
      Rotating the rotator 7 at 500 to 10000 rpm can efficiently produce
      vortex flow within the vessel 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] While a method of forming nanobubbles according to this
      invention has been described, the invention is not limited
      thereto. For illustrative convenience, descriptions were given for
      the case of an aqueous solution; other solutions, such as an
      alcoholic solution, may be used as well as an aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Furthermore, oxygen, ozone or the like may be adopted as
      the gas from which the microbubbles are formed, which would
      efficiently enhance the physiological activation effect on
      organisms; such as a killing or antiproliferative effect on
      microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The present invention will be described in detail in
      connection with an example, but the invention is not limited
      thereto.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0060] As shown in FIG. 7, 10 liters of water containing therein
      electrolytic ions was placed in a vessel 1 and microbubbles were
      formed by a microbubble generator 3 such that the water in the
      vessel 1 contains microbubbles. The electrical conductivity of the
      aqueous solution was not less than 300 [mu]S/cm. The microbubbles
      were continuously generated such that the concentration of the
      microbubbles within the vessel 1 reached 50% or more of the
      saturated concentration.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Then, the microbubble-contained aqueous solution within the
      vessel 1 was regionally circulated so that a part of the
      microbubble-contained aqueous solution was introduced into
      circulation piping in which a circulating pump 3 was located. The
      microbubble-contained aqueous solution was then introduced into
      the circulating pump 5 which supplied the aqueous solution to an
      orifice plate (perforated plate) 6 at a pressure of 0.3 MPa,
      wherein vortex flow was caused and the microbubbles were reduced
      in size to nanobubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] After the circulating pump 5 was operated for one hour such
      that a sufficient amount of nanobubbles were formed, the entire
      apparatus was stopped. After one week from the stop of the
      apparatus, the nanobubbles suspended within the vessel 1 were
      measured by a dynamic light scattering photometer. It was found
      that the nanobubbles having a medium particle diameter of about
      140 nm (standard deviation of about 30 nm) remained stable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0063] According to the method of forming nanobubbles of the
      present invention, it becomes possible to form nanobubbles having
      a bubble diameter of not more than 200 nm in a solution and causes
      the nanobubbles to remain in the solution for one or more months
      in a stable state. Furthermore, depending upon the nature of the
      gas within nanobubbles, the solution containing the nanobubbles
      therein can provide a physiological activation effect on
      organisms; a killing or antiproliferative effect on microorganisms
      such as bacteria and viruses; or a chemical reaction with an
      organic or inorganic substance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] As described above, nanobubbles provided according to the
      methods of forming nanobubbles of the present invention remain in
      a solution for one or more months. Depending upon the nature of
      the gas within the nanobubbles, the nanobubbles provide a
      physiological activation effect on organisms; a killing or
      antiproliferative effect on microorganisms such as bacteria and
      viruses, etc. Accordingly, such nanobubbles can be applied to the
      medial field or the like, where sterilization and hygienic
      environments are required.<br>
