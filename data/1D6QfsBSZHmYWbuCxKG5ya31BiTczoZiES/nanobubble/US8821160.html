      Abstract : Disclosed is a nano bubble generating nozzle including:
      a passage passing through an interior thereof to provide a flow
      path through which liquid flows; a nano bubble generating part
      corresponding to a part of the passage, and formed such that a
      cross-section of the nano bubble generating part becomes small and
      then large again along a flow path of liquid so that the nano
      bubble generating part has a pressure lower than an external
      pressure of the nozzle body; and a gas inlet formed in the nozzle
      body, and connected to the nano bubble generating part so that gas
      is introduced into the nano bubble generating part due to a
      difference between an external pressure of the nozzle body and a
      pressure in the nano bubble generating part.&nbsp; <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>Description </b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The present invention relates to a nano bubble generating
      nozzle and an oral cleaning device including the same, and more
      particularly to a nano bubble generating nozzle which mixes gas
      with flowing liquid so that the liquid can contain nano bubble and
      an oral cleaning device including the same.<br>
      <br>
      2. Description of the Prior Art<br>
      <br>
      Generally, a bubble generating device refers to a device for
      generating and providing bubbles having various sizes.<br>
      <br>
      The bubble generating device is used for various purposes
      according to a need of a user. For example, the bubble generating
      device may be used to provide bubbles into a washing tub to
      improve washing force, may be used for a cleaning operation for
      providing bubbles into a bath tub to improve a bathing effect, or
      may be used for a purpose of purifying water.<br>
      <br>
      The bubble generating device mixes liquid obtained by pressing gas
      so that the gas is solved therein with circulating liquid and then
      reduces the pressure of the liquid so that the liquid is ejected
      while bubbles are contained in the flowing liquid.<br>
      <br>
      However, the liquid in which the gas is pressed and solved needs
      to be mixed with the liquid circulating again, and after liquid in
      which the gas is pressed and solved is mixed with the circulating
      liquid, the pressure of the gas needs to be reduced again so that
      the mixed liquid is ejected.<br>
      <br>
      That is, a high-pressure pump for pressing gas needs to be used to
      press and solve the gas in liquid. However, since gas needs to be
      contained in liquid by using a high-performance high-pressure pump
      to decrease sizes of bubbles, a configuration of the device
      becomes complex and manufacturing costs increase.<br>
      <br>
      Further, in a device which uses a shear force of a rotary blade to
      generate bubbles after liquid obtained by pressing and solving gas
      and circulating liquid are mixed, the rotary blade as well as the
      high-pressure pump is necessary to generate cavitations.
      Accordingly, since a separate drive unit for driving the rotary
      blade is necessary, the configuration of the device becomes more
      complex.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, maintenance costs of the rotary blade increase due to
      rapid corrosion and severe vibrations of a blade accompanied when
      the cavitations are generated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the
      above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object
      of the present invention is to provide a nano bubble generating
      nozzle which can introduce gas into flowing liquid without using a
      separate unit for mixing bubbles to generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the present invention provide a nano bubble
      generating nozzle by which noise and manufacturing costs generated
      when nano bubbles are mixed can be reduced, while realizing
      miniaturization.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention also provide a nano bubble generating nozzle
      by which a phenomenon where nano bubbles generated by growth and
      breaking of nano bubble nuclei disappear before a discharging
      operation can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the present invention provides an oral cleaning device
      which can discharge cleaning liquid containing nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the present invention also provides an oral cleaning
      device which can be simplified and miniaturized.<br>
      <br>
      In order to accomplish this object, there is provided a nano
      bubble generating nozzle including: a passage passing through an
      interior thereof to provide a flow path through which liquid
      flows; a nano bubble generating part corresponding to a part of
      the passage, and formed such that a cross-section of the nano
      bubble generating part becomes small and then large along a flow
      path of liquid so that the nano bubble generating part has a
      pressure lower than an external pressure of the nozzle body; and a
      gas inlet formed in the nozzle body, and connected to the nano
      bubble generating part so that gas is introduced into the nano
      bubble generating part due to a difference between an external
      pressure of the nozzle body and a pressure in the nano bubble
      generating part.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet corresponds to a communication hole formed in a
      radial direction of the nozzle body and connected to the nano
      bubble generating part, and the communication hole is formed such
      that a cross-section thereof is smaller than or equal to a minimum
      cross-section of the nano bubble generating part to prevent
      introduction of the liquid flowing through the nano bubble
      generating part.<br>
      <br>
      A ratio of a diameter of a portion of the nano bubble generating
      part corresponding to a minimum cross-section and a diameter of
      the passage formed in the nozzle body may be 1:2 to 1:4.<br>
      <br>
      The nano bubble generating nozzle further includes: a dispersing
      member mounted to the gas inlet to disperse the gas introduced
      into the gas inlet so that the gas introduced when the gas in the
      nano bubble generating part is mixed can be mixed with the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The dispersing member is formed of a porous material having a
      diameter smaller than 1 µm so that the penetrating gas can be made
      fine.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet includes: an installation recess formed on a side
      surface of the nozzle body such that the dispersing member is
      installed therein; a cover member coupled to the installation
      recess, and including a gas inlet hole through which gas is
      introduced; and a communication hole extending from the
      installation recess to communicate the nano bubble generating part
      with the installation recess.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance another aspect of the present invention, there is
      provided an oral cleaning device including: a cleaning device body
      including a cleaning liquid inlet through which cleaning liquid is
      introduced, a cleaning liquid ejection hole from which liquid
      containing nano bubbles is discharged, and a cleaning liquid
      passage connecting the cleaning liquid inlet and the cleaning
      liquid ejection hole; and a nano bubble generating nozzle
      connected to the cleaning liquid passage such that nano bubbles
      are contained in the flowing cleaning liquid by introducing gas
      due to a difference from an external pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The nano bubble generating nozzle includes: a nozzle body
      including a passage passing through an interior thereof to provide
      a flow path through which liquid flows; a nano bubble generating
      part corresponding to a part of the passage, and formed such that
      a cross-section of the nano bubble generating part becomes small
      and then large along a flow path of liquid so that the nano bubble
      generating part has a pressure lower than an external pressure of
      the nozzle body; and a gas inlet connected to the nano bubble
      generating part so that gas is introduced into the nano bubble
      generating part due to a difference between an external pressure
      of the nozzle body and a pressure in the nano bubble generating
      part.<br>
      <br>
      The nano bubble generating nozzle further includes: a dispersing
      member mounted to the gas inlet to disperse the gas introduced
      into the gas inlet so that the gas introduced can be mixed with
      the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The dispersing member is formed of a porous material having a
      diameter smaller than 1 µm so that the penetrating gas can be made
      fine.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet includes: an installation recess formed on a side
      surface of the cleaning device body; a gas inlet member coupled to
      the installation recess, and including a gas flow passage through
      which gas is introduced, and a mounting recess where the
      dispersing member is installed; and a communication hole extending
      from the installation recess to communicate the nano bubble
      generating part with the installation recess.<br>
      <br>
      The communication hole is formed such that a cross-section thereof
      is smaller than or equal to a minimum cross-section of the nano
      bubble generating part to prevent introduction of the liquid
      flowing through the nano bubble generating part.<br>
      <br>
      A ratio of a diameter of a portion of the nano bubble generating
      part corresponding to a minimum cross-section and a diameter of
      the passage formed in the nozzle body may be 1:2 to 1:4.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet further includes an air filter installed at an end
      of the gas flow passage to purify introduced air.<br>
      <br>
      The oral cleaning device further includes: an opening/closing unit
      mounted to the mounting part provided in the cleaning device body
      to be connected to the cleaning liquid passage so as to open and
      close the cleaning liquid passage.<br>
      <br>
      The opening/closing unit includes: an opening/closing member
      slidably coupled to the cleaning device body along a guide part
      provided in the cleaning device body to open and close the
      cleaning liquid passage; a support member fixedly coupled to the
      cleaning device body to be disposed at an upper portion of the
      opening/closing member; a resilient member mounted between the
      opening/closing member and the support member to provide a
      resilient force to the opening/closing member; and a sealing
      member mounted to a lower end of the opening/closing member to
      prevent the cleaning liquid from being discharged through the
      guide part.<br>
      <br>
      According to the nano bubble generating nozzle of the present
      invention, since gas may be introduced into liquid flowing along
      the nano bubble generating part through the gas inlet due to a
      pressure difference between the nano bubble generating part and
      the outside of the nozzle body, the gas can be introduced into the
      flowing liquid without using a separate unit for mixing bubbles to
      generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the gas can be introduced into the flowing liquid without
      using a separate device, such as a compression pump for
      compressing the gas, for mixing bubbles, vibrations generated by a
      separate unit can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the gas introduced into the gas inlet is made fine
      through the dispersing member to be introduced into the liquid,
      thereby improving a generation rate of the nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing liquid
      without using a separate unit for mixing bubbles to generate nano
      bubbles, noise generated by a separate unit for introducing the
      gas can be reduced, and manufacturing costs can be reduced and the
      nano bubble generating nozzle can be miniaturized.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing
      liquid without using a separate device, such as a compression pump
      for compressing the gas, for mixing bubbles, vibrations generated
      by a separate unit can be reduced, and accordingly, a phenomenon
      where the generated nano bubbles disappear before a discharging
      operation can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since a distance by which nano bubbles are moved can be
      reduced by simplifying the structure of the nano bubble generating
      nozzle, a phenomenon where nano bubbles generated by growth and
      breaking of nano bubble nuclei in the passage of the nozzle body
      disappear before a discharging operation can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      That is, since a distance by which the generated nano bubbles are
      moved can be reduced by simplifying the structure, a phenomenon
      where the nano bubbles disappear can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, according to the oral cleaning device of the present
      invention, the cleaning liquid containing nano bubbles can be
      discharged through the nano bubble generating nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since the structure of the nano bubble generating
      nozzle for generating nano bubbles is simple, the cleaning liquid
      containing nano bubbles can be discharged and the device can be
      miniaturized at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      Further, as the liquid containing nano bubbles can be discharged,
      an effect by which the liquid containing nano bubbles reaches a
      target object, such as teeth or gums, so that the nano bubbles
      disappear, that is, the vibration and negative ion effect can be
      realized.<br>

      </b><b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will
      be described in detail with reference to the accompanying
      drawings. Meanwhile, the spirit of the present invention is not
      limited to the suggested embodiments, but those skilled in the art
      to which the present invention pertains can suggest another
      retrogressive invention or another embodiment which falls within
      the spirit of the present invention through addition,
      modification, and deletion of another component without departing
      from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      A detailed description of known functions and configurations of
      the present invention will be omitted when it may make the subject
      of the present invention unclear.<br>
      <br>
      Hereinafter, a nano bubble generating nozzle according to an
      embodiment of the present invention will be described with
      reference to the drawings.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 1 is a cutaway perspective view illustrating a nano bubble
      generating nozzle according to an embodiment of the present
      invention. FIG. 2 is a sectional view illustrating the nano bubble
      generating nozzle according to the embodiment of the present
      invention;<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the nano bubble generating nozzle 10
      according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a
      nozzle body 20, a nano bubble generating part 40, and a gas inlet
      60.<br>
      <br>
      The nozzle body 20 includes a passage 22 passing through an
      interior thereof to provide a flow path through which liquid
      flows. That is, the nozzle body 20 includes the passage 22 having
      a liquid inlet 22a through which liquid is introduced and a liquid
      outlet 22b from which liquid containing nano bubbles is
      discharged.<br>
      <br>
      The nano bubble generating part 40 is a part of the passage 22,
      and is formed such that a cross-section of the nano bubble
      generating part 40 becomes small and then large again along a flow
      path of liquid so that the nano bubble generating part 40 has a
      pressure lower than an external pressure of the nozzle body 20.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the nano bubble generating part 40 is formed such that a
      pressure in the nano bubble generating part 40 is lower than an
      external pressure due to a change in a diameter thereof. As an
      example, the nano bubble generating part 40 may have a venturi
      tube. Accordingly, a pressure in the nano bubble generating part
      40 may be lower than an external pressure of the nozzle body 20.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, when an external pressure of the nozzle body 20 is
      1 atm (i.e. 1.033227 kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;), a pressure in the nano
      bubble generating part 40 may be 0.3 to 0.5 kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;. That
      is, when liquid flows through the nano bubble generating part 40
      at a predetermined ejection speed or higher, a pressure in the
      nano bubble generating part 40 becomes lower than an external
      pressure of the nozzle body 20, in which case a pressure in the
      nano bubble generating part 40 may be preferably 0.3 to 0.5
      kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      That is, a pressure in the nano bubble generating part may be
      changed according to a pressure of fluid introduced through the
      passage of the nozzle body 20, that is, a pressure by which the
      fluid can be ejected at a predetermined ejection speed or higher,
      and may be a pressure lower than an external pressure of the
      nozzle body 20, that is, 1 atm.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in order to generate nano bubbles, a ratio of a
      diameter of a portion of the nano bubble generating part 40
      corresponding to a minimum cross-section and a diameter of the
      passage 22 formed in the nozzle body 20 may be 1:2 to 1:4.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, when a diameter of the passage 22 formed in the
      nozzle body 20 is 2 mm, a diameter of the nano bubble generating
      part 40 corresponding to a minimum cross-section needs to be 1 mm
      or less. If a diameter of the nano bubble generating part 40
      corresponding to a minimum cross-section is 1 mm or more, a nano
      bubble generating rate in the nano bubble generating part 40 is
      significantly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      As another example, when a diameter of the passage 22 formed in
      the nozzle body 20 is 2 mm, a diameter of the nano bubble
      generating part 40 may be preferably 0.5 mm. In this case, an
      optimum nano bubble generating rate may be realized.<br>
      <br>
      More preferably, a portion of the nano bubble generating part 40
      corresponding to a minimum cross-section may have a diameter by
      which a pressure in the nano bubble generating part 40 may become
      lower than 1 atm, for example, a diameter by which a pressure in
      the nano bubble generating part 40 may become 0.3 to 0.5
      kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, a flow rate of the liquid flowing through a region
      where a cross-section of the nano bubble generating part 40 is
      reduced becomes higher than a flow rate in the liquid inlet 22a.
      Accordingly, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating
      part 40 may become fine so that a large amount of nano bubbles can
      be generated.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating part
      40 may become finer due to the liquid flowing faster. Thus, a
      larger amount of nano bubbles can be generated at the same flow
      amount due to an increase in flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet 60 is formed in the nozzle body 20, and is connected
      to the nano bubble generating part 40 so that gas is introduced
      into the nano bubble generating part 40 due to a difference
      between an external pressure of the nozzle body 20 and a pressure
      in the nano bubble generating part 40.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet 60 may be a communication hole formed in a radial
      direction of the nozzle body 20 and connected to the nano bubble
      generating part 40. That is, gas is introduced into the nano
      bubble generating part 40 through the gas inlet 60 corresponding
      to a communication hole due to a difference between an external
      pressure of the nozzle body 20 and a pressure in the nano bubble
      generating part 40.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in definition of directions, a lengthwise direction of
      the nozzle body 20 is a direction where the passage 22 is formed,
      that is, a direction of the liquid outlet 22b with respect to the
      liquid inlet 22a with reference to FIG. 2, a radial direction of
      the nozzle body 20 is an upward/downward direction of the nozzle
      body 20 with respect to the passage 22 with reference to FIG. 2,
      and a circumferential direction of the nozzle body 20 is a
      rotation direction along an outer peripheral surface of the nozzle
      body 20.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet 60 is formed such that a cross-section thereof is
      smaller than or equal to a minimum cross-section of the nano
      bubble generating part 40 to prevent the liquid flowing through
      the nano bubble generating part 40 from being introduced into the
      gas inlet 60.<br>
      <br>
      That is, as a cross-section of the nano bubble generating part 40
      decreases, a flow rate of the liquid flowing through the nano
      bubble generating part 40 increases but an internal resistance due
      to the nano bubble generating part 40 also increases. Accordingly,
      the fluid flowing along the nano bubble generating part 40 tends
      to flow to a part where an internal resistance is low.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when a diameter of the gas inlet 60 is larger than a
      diameter of the nano bubble generating part 40 at a portion having
      a minimum cross-section, the fluid flowing along the nano bubble
      generating part 40 may flow toward the gas inlet 60.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, in order to prevent liquid from flowing toward the
      gas inlet 60, a diameter of the gas inlet 60 is the same as or
      smaller than a diameter of the nano bubble generating part 40 at a
      portion having a minimum cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, it has been exemplified in the embodiment that one gas
      inlet 60 is formed in the nozzle body 20, but the embodiment is
      not limited thereto but a plurality of gas inlets 60 may be formed
      in the nozzle body 20 along a circumferential direction of the
      nozzle body 20.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, sizes of the bubbles contained in the liquid ejected
      through the liquid outlet 22b of the nozzle body 20 may correspond
      to nano sizes or several µm to 50 µm.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in a mechanism for generating bubbles having nano
      sizes, bubbles in micrometers units contained in the liquid
      ejected to the liquid outlet 22b are generally contracted by a
      surface tension and a pressure in the liquid and then are
      contracted into bubbles having nano sizes, and are finally broken.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, large micro bubbles (e.g. micrometer bubbles having a
      diameter of 50 µm) are broken without being contracted as the
      micro bubbles are moved fast to a surface of the shape of the
      liquid (e.g. the shape of the liquid discharged to have a funnel
      shape) ejected in the liquid, but the micro bubbles having a
      predetermined size or smaller are contracted into nano bubbles as
      the micro bubbles flows slowly to a surface in the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the bubbles contained in the liquid discharged to the liquid
      outlet 22b may be changed into nano bubbles before contacting a
      target object.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, the liquid containing nano bubbles can reach the
      target object. Accordingly, the vibration and negative ion effect
      can be realized while the nano bubbles reach the target object and
      then disappear.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, since bubbles may be generated through a
      small-sized nano bubble generating nozzle 10 having a passage 22 a
      diameter of which is around 2 mm, nano bubbles having sizes in
      nano units can be generated.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since gas may be introduced into liquid flowing along
      the nano bubble generating part 40 through the gas inlet 60 due to
      a pressure difference between the nano bubble generating part 40
      and the outside of the nozzle body 20, the gas can be introduced
      into the flowing liquid without using a separate unit for mixing
      bubbles to generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing liquid
      without using a separate unit for mixing bubbles to generate nano
      bubbles, noise generated by a separate unit for introducing the
      gas can be reduced and manufacturing costs can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing
      liquid without using a separate device, such as a compression pump
      for compressing the gas, for mixing bubbles, vibrations generated
      by a separate unit can be reduced, and accordingly, a phenomenon
      where the generated nano bubbles disappear can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the nano bubble generating nozzle 10 can be
      miniaturized.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since a distance by which nano bubbles are moved can be
      reduced by miniaturizing the nano bubble generating nozzle 10, a
      phenomenon where nano bubbles generated by growth and breaking of
      nano bubble nuclei in the passage 22 of the nozzle body 20
      disappear before a discharging operation can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      That is, since a distance by which the generated nano bubbles are
      moved can be reduced by simplifying the structure, a phenomenon
      where the nano bubbles disappear can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Hereinafter, a nano bubble generating nozzle according to another
      embodiment of the present invention will be described with
      reference to the accompanying drawings. Meanwhile, a description
      of the same components as those of the above embodiment will be
      substituted and will not be described in detail.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is a cutaway perspective view illustrating a nano bubble
      generating nozzle according to another embodiment of the present
      invention. FIG. 4 is a sectional view illustrating the nano bubble
      generating nozzle according to the another embodiment of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 3 and 4, the nano bubble generating nozzle 100
      according to the another embodiment of the present invention
      includes a nozzle body 120, a nano bubble generating part 140, a
      gas inlet 160, and a dispersing member 180.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the nozzle body 120 and the nano bubble generating part
      140 correspond to the same configurations of the nozzle body 20
      and the nano bubble generating part 40 of the nano bubble
      generating nozzle 10 of the first embodiment of the present
      invention, and a detailed description thereof will be omitted
      here.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet 160 is formed in the nozzle body 120, and is
      connected to the nano bubble generating part 140 so that gas is
      introduced into the nano bubble generating part 140 due to a
      difference between an external pressure of the nozzle body 120 and
      a pressure of the nano bubble generating part 140.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, as in the first embodiment, an external pressure of the
      nozzle body 120 may be 1 atm (i.e. (i.e. 1.033227
      kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;), a pressure in the nano bubble generating part 40
      may be 0.3 to 0.5 kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the gas inlet 160 may include an installation recess
      162, a cover member 164, and a communication hole 166.<br>
      <br>
      The installation recess 162 is formed on a side surface of the
      nozzle body 120 such that the dispersing member 180 can be
      installed therein. That is, the installation recess 162 is formed
      on a side surface of the nozzle body 120 to have a shape
      corresponding to the shape of the dispersing member 180.<br>
      <br>
      The cover member 164 is coupled to the installation recess 162,
      and includes a gas inlet hole 164a through which gas is
      introduced. That is, the cover member 164 serves to prevent
      separation of the dispersing member 180 installed in the
      installation recess 162, and includes at least one gas inlet hole
      164a so that gas can be introduced into the installation recess
      162.<br>
      <br>
      That is, although one gas inlet hole 164a is illustrated, the
      embodiment is not limited thereto but a plurality of gas inlet
      holes 164a may be provided.<br>
      <br>
      The communication hole 166 extends from the installation recess
      162 to communicate the nano bubble generating part 140 with the
      installation recess 162.<br>
      <br>
      The communication hole 166 is formed such that a cross-section
      thereof is smaller than or equal to a minimum cross-section of the
      nano bubble generating part 140 to prevent introduction of the
      liquid flowing through the nano bubble generating part 140.<br>
      <br>
      That is, as a cross-section of the nano bubble generating part 40
      decreases, a flow rate of the liquid flowing through the nano
      bubble generating part 40 increases but an internal resistance due
      to the nano bubble generating part 40 also increases. Accordingly,
      the fluid flowing along the nano bubble generating part 40 tends
      to flow to a part where an internal resistance is low.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when a diameter of the communication hole 166 is larger than
      a diameter of the nano bubble generating part 40 at a portion
      having a minimum cross-section, the fluid flowing along the nano
      bubble generating part 40 may flow toward the communication hole
      166.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, in order to prevent liquid from flowing toward the
      communication hole 166, a diameter of the communication hole 166
      is the same as or smaller than a diameter of the nano bubble
      generating part 40 at a portion having a minimum cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      The dispersing member 180 is mounted to the gas inlet 160, and
      disperses the gas introduced into the gas inlet 160 so that the
      gas introduced when the gas in the nano bubble generating part 140
      is mixed can be mixed with the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      In more detail, the dispersing member 180 is installed in the
      installation recess 162 of the gas inlet 160, and disperses the
      gas introduced through the gas inlet hole 164a of the cover member
      164 to make the gas fine primarily.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the gas having passed through the dispersing member
      180 and having been made fine primarily is introduced into the
      nano bubble generating part 140 through the communication hole
      166. Then, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating part
      140 is made fine secondarily by the liquid flowing along the nano
      bubble generating part 140 to be mixed with the flowing liquid.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the gas having been made fine primarily and exiting from
      the communication hole 166 is made fine secondarily as if the gas
      is divided by the liquid of a relatively high speed flowing
      through the nano bubble generating part 140 to be mixed with the
      flowing liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the dispersing member 180 may be formed of a porous
      material having a diameter smaller than 1 µm so that the
      penetrating gas can be made fine.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, as the gas introduced into the nano bubble
      generating part 140 through the dispersing member 180 can be made
      fine and be introduced into the nano bubble generating part 140, a
      generation rate of the nano bubbles can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, an image acquired through a fluorescent microscope to
      identify sizes of nano bubbles generated through the nano bubble
      generating nozzle 100 according to the another embodiment of the
      present invention is disclosed in FIG. 5. FIG. 5A illustrates an
      image of a 150 µm sample captured through a fluorescent
      microscope, and FIG. 5B illustrates an image of nano bubbles
      generated by the nano bubble generating nozzle according to the
      another embodiment of the present invention, which has been
      captured through a fluorescent microscope.<br>
      <br>
      In comparison of FIGS. 5A and 5B, the nano bubbles generated
      through the nano bubble generating nozzle take the form of black
      spots in FIGS. 5B, and it can be seen that sizes thereof is
      several µm to 50 µm as compared with a size of a 150 µm sample
      disclosed in FIG. 5A.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, since gas is introduced into the nano bubble
      generating part 140 through the gas inlet 160 connected to the
      nano bubble generating part 140 due to a difference between an
      external pressure of the nozzle body 120 and a pressure of the
      nano bubble generating part 140, the gas can be introduced into
      the flowing liquid without using a separate unit for mixing of the
      bubbles to generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      That is, gas can be introduced into liquid without using a
      separate unit, such as a compression pump for compressing the gas,
      for mixing the bubbles to generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the gas introduced into the gas inlet 160 is made
      fine primarily through the dispersing member 180 to be introduced
      into the liquid, thereby improving a generation rate of the nano
      bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing liquid
      without using a separate unit for mixing bubbles to generate nano
      bubbles, noise generated by a separate unit for introducing the
      gas can be reduced, and manufacturing costs can be reduced and the
      nano bubble generating nozzle can be miniaturized.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing
      liquid without using a separate device, such as a compression pump
      for compressing the gas, for mixing bubbles, vibrations generated
      by a separate unit can be reduced, and accordingly, a phenomenon
      where the generated nano bubbles disappear before a discharging
      operation can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since a distance by which nano bubbles are moved can be
      reduced by simplifying the structure of the nano bubble generating
      nozzle, a phenomenon where nano bubbles generated by growth and
      breaking of nano bubble nuclei in the passage 122 of the nozzle
      body 120 disappear before a discharging operation can be
      mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      That is, since a distance by which the generated nano bubbles are
      moved can be reduced by simplifying the structure, a phenomenon
      where the nano bubbles disappear can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, as the liquid containing nano bubbles can be
      discharged, an effect by which the liquid containing nano bubbles
      reaches a target object so that the nano bubbles disappear, that
      is, the vibration and negative ion effect can be realized.<br>
      <br>
      Hereinafter, an oral cleaning device according to an embodiment of
      the present invention will be described with reference to the
      accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 is a perspective view illustrating an oral cleaning device
      according to an embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 7 is
      a sectional view illustrating the oral cleaning device according
      to the embodiment of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 6 and 7, the oral cleaning device 200 according
      to the embodiment of the present invention includes a cleaning
      device body 220, an opening/closing unit 240, and a nano bubble
      generating nozzle 300.<br>
      <br>
      The cleaning device body 220 includes a cleaning liquid inlet 222
      through which cleaning liquid is introduced, a cleaning liquid
      ejection hole 224 from which liquid containing nano bubbles is
      discharged, and a cleaning liquid passage 226 connecting the
      cleaning liquid inlet 222 and the cleaning liquid ejection hole
      224.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the cleaning liquid is introduced into the cleaning
      device body 220 through a cleaning liquid supply pipe (not
      illustrated) connected to the washing liquid inlet 222. Then, the
      cleaning liquid may be supplied by a supply pump (not
      illustrated).<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the cleaning device body 220 may include a mounting
      part 228 where the opening/closing unit 240 is installed.<br>
      <br>
      The opening/closing unit 240 is mounted to the mounting part 228
      provided in the cleaning device body 220 to be connected to the
      cleaning liquid passage 226 so as to open and close the cleaning
      liquid passage 226.<br>
      <br>
      To this end, as an example, the opening/closing unit 240 may
      include an opening/closing member 242, a support member 244, a
      resilient member 246, and a sealing member 248.<br>
      <br>
      The opening/closing member 242 is slidably coupled to the cleaning
      device body 220 along a guide part 230 provided in the cleaning
      device body 220 to open and close the cleaning liquid passage.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the opening/closing member 242 may have a groove 242a
      by which one end of the resilient member 246 is supported on an
      upper surface thereof, and the opening/closing member 242 may be
      returned to an original position by the resilient member 246 one
      end of which is supported by the groove 242a to close the cleaning
      liquid passage 226.<br>
      <br>
      The opening/closing member 242 may include an opening/closing part
      242b having a shape corresponding to an inclined surface 228a
      provided in the mounting part 228 so that supply of the cleaning
      liquid can be started or interrupted by a slide movement thereof.
      That is, when the opening/closing part 242b contacts the inclined
      surface 228a, supply of the cleaning liquid is interrupted,
      whereas when the opening/closing part 242b is extracted from the
      inclined surface 228a, supply of the cleaning liquid is started.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the opening/closing member 242 may include a concave part
      242c disposed at a lower end of the opening/closing part 242b so
      that a sealing member 248 can be mounted thereto. Meanwhile, the
      concave part 242c can be moved in the guide part 230 to prevent
      cleaning liquid from being discharged to the outside of the
      cleaning device body 220.<br>
      <br>
      The support member 244 is fixedly coupled to the cleaning device
      body 220 to be disposed at an upper portion of the opening/closing
      member 242. Further, the support member 244 may have a groove 244a
      formed at a location corresponding to the groove 242a of the
      opening/closing member 242 to support an opposite end of the
      resilient member 246.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, as described above, the resilient member 246 is mounted
      to support opposite ends of the grooves 242a and 244a provided in
      the opening member 242 and the support member 244 to return the
      opening/closing member 242 to an original position while providing
      a resilient force.<br>
      <br>
      That is, if the opening/closing member 242 is pressed by a user,
      the resilient member 246 is compressed, in which case the
      opening/closing part 242b of the opening/closing member 242 is
      extracted from the guide member 228a so that the cleaning liquid
      can be supplied to a rear side.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, if the pressing of the opening/closing member 242 is
      stopped by the user, the resilient member 246 is extended by the
      resilient force of the resilient member 246, and accordingly, the
      opening/closing part 242b of the opening/closing member 242 is
      introduced into the guide member 228a to interrupt supply of the
      washing liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The sealing member 248 is mounted to a lower end of the
      opening/closing member 242 to prevent the cleaning liquid from
      being discharged through the guide part 230. As an example, the
      sealing member 248 may be an O-ring.<br>
      <br>
      The nano bubble generating nozzle 300 is connected to the cleaning
      liquid passage 226, and nano bubbles are contained in the flowing
      cleaning liquid by introducing gas due to a difference from an
      external pressure.<br>
      <br>
      To this end, as an example, the nano bubble generating nozzle 300
      includes a nozzle body 320, a nano bubble generating part 340, a
      gas inlet 360, and a dispersing member 380.<br>
      <br>
      The nano bubble generating part 340 is a part of the passage 322,
      and a cross-section thereof is reduced and expanded along a flow
      passage of the liquid to have a pressure lower than an external
      pressure of the cleaning device body 220.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the nozzle body 320 and the nano bubble generating part
      340 may be integrally formed with the cleaning liquid passage 226,
      and the nozzle body 320 having a passage 322 where the nano bubble
      generating part 340 is formed may be mounted to the cleaning
      device body 220.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the nano bubble generating part 340 is formed such that
      a pressure in the nano bubble generating part 340 is lower than an
      external pressure of the cleaning device body 220 due to a change
      in a diameter thereof. As an example, the nano bubble generating
      part 340 may have a venturi tube. Accordingly, a pressure in the
      nano bubble generating part 340 may be lower than an external
      pressure of the nozzle body 320.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, when an external pressure of the nozzle body 220 is
      1 atm (i.e. 1.033227 kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;), a pressure in the nano
      bubble generating part 240 may be 0.3 to 0.5 kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;. That
      is, when liquid flows through the nano bubble generating part 240
      at a predetermined ejection speed or higher, a pressure in the
      nano bubble generating part 240 becomes lower than an external
      pressure of the nozzle body 220, in which case a pressure in the
      nano bubble generating part 240 may be preferably 0.3 to 0.5
      kgf/cm&lt;2&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, in order to generate nano bubbles, a ratio of a
      diameter of a portion of the nano bubble generating part 340
      corresponding to a minimum cross-section and a diameter of the
      passage 322 formed in the nozzle body 320 may be 1:2 to 1:4.<br>
      <br>
      As an example, when a diameter of the passage 322 formed in the
      nozzle body 320 is 2 mm, a diameter of the nano bubble generating
      part 340 corresponding to a minimum cross-section needs to be 1 mm
      or less. If a diameter of the nano bubble generating part 340
      corresponding to a minimum cross-section is 1 mm or more, a nano
      bubble generating rate in the nano bubble generating part 340 is
      significantly reduced.<br>
      <br>
      As another example, a diameter of the passage 322 formed in the
      nozzle body 320 is 2 mm, a diameter of the nano bubble generating
      part 340 may be preferably 0.5 mm. In this case, an optimum nano
      buble generating rate may be realized.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, a flow rate of the liquid flowing through a region
      where a cross-section of the nano bubble generating part 340 is
      reduced becomes higher than a flow rate in the passage 322.
      Accordingly, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating
      part 340 may become fine so that a large amount of nano bubbles
      can be generated.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating part
      340 may become finer due to the liquid flowing faster. Thus, a
      larger amount of nano bubbles can be generated at the same flow
      amount due to an increase in flow rate.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet 360 is formed in the nozzle body 320, and is
      connected to the nano bubble generating part 340 so that gas is
      introduced into the nano bubble generating part 340 due to a
      difference between an external pressure of the nozzle body 320 and
      a pressure in the nano bubble generating part 340.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the gas inlet 360 may include an installation recess
      362, a gas inlet member 364, and a communication hole 366.<br>
      <br>
      The installation recess 362 is formed on a side surface of the
      cleaning device body 220. A female screw portion 362a to be
      screw-coupled to the gas inlet member 364 may be formed on an
      inner surface of the installation recess 362.<br>
      <br>
      The gas inlet member 364 may be coupled to the installation recess
      362, and may include a gas flow passage 364a through which gas is
      introduced, and a mounting recess 364a where the dispersing member
      380 is installed. A male screw portion 364c corresponding to the
      female screw portion 362a formed in the installation recess 362
      may be formed at one end of the gas inlet member 364.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the communication hole 366 extends from the
      installation recess 362, and communicates the nano bubble
      generating part 340 and the installation recess 362. The
      communication hole 366 is formed such that a cross-section thereof
      is smaller than or equal to a minimum cross-section of the nano
      bubble generating part 340 to prevent the liquid flowing through
      the nano bubble generating part 340 from being introduced.<br>
      <br>
      That is, as a cross-section of the nano bubble generating part 340
      decreases, a flow rate of the liquid flowing through the nano
      bubble generating part 340 increases but an internal resistance
      due to the nano bubble generating part 340 also increases.
      Accordingly, the fluid flowing along the nano bubble generating
      part 340 tends to flow to a part where an internal resistance is
      low.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, when a diameter of the communication hole 366 is larger than
      a diameter of the nano bubble generating part 340 at a portion
      having a minimum cross-section, the fluid flowing along the nano
      bubble generating part 340 may flow toward the communication hole
      366.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, in order to prevent liquid from flowing toward the
      communication hole 366, a diameter of the communication hole 366
      is the same as or smaller than a diameter of the nano bubble
      generating part 340 at a portion having a minimum cross-section.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the gas inlet 360 may further include an air filter 368
      installed at an end of the gas flow passage 363a to purify
      introduced air. That is, the gas inlet 360 may further include the
      air filter 368 for purifying foreign substances such as dust from
      the air introduced into the gas inlet member, and accordingly, the
      communication hole 366 is blocked to prevent gas from being
      introduced into the nano bubble generating part 340.<br>
      <br>
      The dispersing member 30 is mounted to the gas inlet 360, and
      disperses the gas introduced into the gas inlet 360 so that the
      gas introduced when the gas in the nano bubble generating part 340
      is mixed can be mixed with the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      In more detail, the dispersing member 380 is installed in the
      mounting recess 364a of the gas inlet member 364, and disperses
      the gas to make the gas fine primarily.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the gas having passed through the dispersing member
      380 and having been made fine primarily is introduced into the
      nano bubble generating part 340 through the communication hole
      366. Then, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating part
      340 is made fine secondarily by the liquid flowing along the nano
      bubble generating part 340 to be mixed with the flowing liquid.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the gas having been made fine primarily and exiting from
      the communication hole 266 is made fine secondarily as if the gas
      is divided by the liquid of a relatively high speed flowing
      through the nano bubble generating part 340 to be mixed with the
      flowing liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the dispersing member 380 may be formed of a porous
      material having a diameter smaller than 1 µm so that the
      penetrating gas can be made fine.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, as the gas introduced into the nano bubble
      generating part 340 through the dispersing member 380 can be made
      fine and be introduced into the nano bubble generating part 340, a
      generation rate of the nano bubbles can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, although not illustrated, a nozzle tip (not
      illustrated) may be mounted to the cleaning liquid ejection hole
      224 of the cleaning device 220, and accordingly, the ejected
      cleaning liquid is dispersed to be discharged from the cleaning
      device body 220.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, since gas may be introduced into liquid
      flowing along the nano bubble generating part 340 through the gas
      inlet 360 due to a pressure difference between the nano bubble
      generating part 340 and the outside of the nozzle body 320 to
      generate nano bubbles, the gas can be introduced into the flowing
      liquid without using a separate unit for mixing bubbles to
      generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      That is, gas can be introduced into flowing liquid without using a
      separate unit, such as a compression pump for compressing gas, for
      mixing of bubbles to generate nano bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing liquid
      without using a separate unit for mixing bubbles to generate nano
      bubbles, noise generated by a separate unit for introducing the
      gas can be reduced, and manufacturing costs can be reduced and the
      nano bubble generating nozzle can be miniaturized.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since the gas can be introduced into the flowing
      liquid without using a separate device, such as a compression pump
      for compressing the gas, for mixing bubbles, vibrations generated
      by a separate unit can be reduced, and accordingly, a phenomenon
      where the generated nano bubbles disappear can be mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since a distance by which nano bubbles are moved can be
      reduced by simplifying the structure of the nano bubble generating
      nozzle, a phenomenon where nano bubbles generated by growth and
      breaking of nano bubble nuclei in the passage 122 of the nozzle
      body 120 disappear before a discharging operation can be
      mitigated.<br>
      <br>
      As the gas introduced into the gas inlet 360 through the
      dispersing member 380 can be made fine and be introduced into the
      liquid, a generation rate of the nano bubbles can be improved.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the cleaning liquid containing nano bubbles can be
      discharged through the nano bubble generating nozzle 300.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, since a structure of the nano bubble generating
      nozzle 300 for generating nano nozzles is simple, the cleaning
      liquid containing nano bubbles can be discharged and the device
      can be miniaturized at the same time. That is, the oral cleaning
      device 200 can be miniaturized.<br>
      <br>
      Further, since the cleaning liquid containing nano bubbles can be
      discharged, an effect by which the liquid containing nano bubbles
      reaches a target object so that the nano bubbles disappear, that
      is, the vibration and negative ion effect can be realized.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, as the liquid containing nano bubbles can be
      discharged, an effect by which the liquid containing nano bubbles
      reaches a target object, such as teeth or gums, so that the nano
      bubbles disappear, that is, the vibration and negative ion effect
      can be realized.<br>
      <br>
      Hereinafter, an operation of the oral cleaning device according to
      the embodiment of the present invention will be described with
      reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 8 and 9 are views illustrating an operation of the oral
      cleaning device according to the embodiment of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      That is, FIG. 8 is a view describing a state where cleaning liquid
      is not introduced into the oral cleaning device according to the
      embodiment of the present invention, and FIG. 9 is a view
      describing a state where cleaning liquid is introduced into the
      oral cleaning device according to the embodiment of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      First, referring to FIG. 8, when a user does not press the
      opening/closing member 242, the opening/closing member 242 is
      disposed at an original position by the resilient member 246.
      Then, the opening/closing part 242b of the opening/closing member
      242 is disposed to contact the inclined surface 228a. Accordingly,
      the cleaning liquid introduced into the cleaning liquid inlet 222
      cannot flow further.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the opening/closing member 242 is pressed by the user
      as illustrated in FIG. 9, the opening/closing member 242 is moved
      along the guide part 230 while compressing the resilient member
      246, in which case the opening/closing part 242b of the
      opening/closing member 242 is disposed to be spaced apart from the
      inclined surface 228a.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the cleaning liquid introduced into the cleaning
      liquid inlet 222 flows through the mounting part 228 to be
      introduced into the cleaning liquid passage 226. Thereafter, the
      cleaning liquid is introduced into the passage 322 of the nozzle
      body 320 connected to the cleaning liquid passage 226, and then
      flows along the nano bubble generating part 340.<br>
      <br>
      If the cleaning liquid flows along the nano bubble generating part
      340 in this way, an external pressure of the cleaning device body
      220 and a pressure in the nano bubble generating part 340 become
      different, whereby gas is introduced toward the nano bubble
      generating part 340 a pressure of which is relatively low through
      the gas inlet 360.<br>
      <br>
      Then, the gas passes through the air filter 368 and is introduced
      into the gas flow passage 364a of the gas inlet member 364.
      Accordingly, gas from which foreign substances, such as dust, from
      the introduced air can be introduced.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the gas introduced into the gas flow passage 364a
      passes through the dispersing member 380, and accordingly the gas
      is made fine primarily.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the gas having passed through the dispersing member
      380 flows along the communication hole 366 to be finally
      introduced into the nano bubble generating part 340. Then, the gas
      is made fine secondarily as if the gas is divided by the liquid of
      a relatively high speed.<br>
      <br>
      Consequently, the gas introduced into the nano bubble generating
      part 340 is changed into nano bubbles and is contained in the
      cleaning liquid.<br>
      <br>
      Thereafter, the cleaning liquid containing nano bubbles is ejected
      from the cleaning device body 220 through the cleaning liquid
      ejection hole 224.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, since the cleaning liquid flowing through the
      cleaning liquid passage 226 via the nano bubble generating nozzle
      300 can contain nano bubbles, the cleaning liquid containing nano
      bubbles can be discharged.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the oral cleaning device 200 can be miniaturized by
      employing a simple structured nano bubble generating nozzle 300.<br>
      <br>
      Further, manufacturing costs of the oral cleaning device 200 can
      be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, as the liquid containing nano bubbles can be
      discharged, an effect by which the liquid containing nano bubbles
      reaches a target object, such as teeth or gums, so that the nano
      bubbles disappear, that is, the vibration and negative ion effect
      can be realized. <br>
