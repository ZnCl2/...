      </b><b>4.1 Oxygen nanobubbles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Oxygen nanobubbles can be generated by the production of oxygen
      microbubbles in water containing nearly 1% NaCl followed by
      jetting the water towards a punching plate so that it passes
      through small holes in it.[8] "Oxygen nanobubbles have a
      mysterious function that can invigorate living organisms. We have
      been clarifying the mechanism behind such a phenomenon occurring
      between nanobubbles and living organisms but still need more time
      to clarify the mechanism." said Dr. Takahashi. Let us now focus on
      the enigmatic findings obtained from his experiments.<br>
      <br>
      <b>(1) Coexistence of freshwater and seawater fishes in one
        aquarium</b><br>
      <br>
      It is possible to breed koi carp and sea bream together for
      several months in the same water tank containing 1% salt with
      oxygen nanobubbles (Fig.14). Neither fish could survive without
      the nanobubbles, even though the salt concentration of 1% is
      almost equal to the electrolyte concentration of their body fluid.
      In general, red sea bream is vulnerable to changes in salt
      concentration, and koi carp also has difficulty in surviving in
      water containing 1% salt. Goldfish, however, are not vulnerable to
      changes in salt concentration.<br>

      <br>
      "The fish in this tank would die from oxygen deficiency if we
      stopped regularly bubbling air through the water. This suggested
      to us that oxygen nanobubbles act not directly on respiratory and
      metabolic systems but through a different mechanism. <br>
      <br>
      <b>4.2 Ozone nanobubbles</b><br>
      <br>
      Ozone nanobubbles are generated by collapsing, for example, ozone
      microbubbles in underground water sampled from coastal areas
      (containing about 1% electrolytes such as NaCl)[4]. The
      bactericidal power of conventional ozonated water is effective
      only for a few hours, whereas water containing ozone nanobubbles
      retains its power for months without significant deterioration if
      it is preserved under UV-blocked conditions. The excellent
      bactericidal power is shown using the example of an oyster. The
      surface of an oyster was sterilized using conventional ozonated
      water and hypochlorous acid, but the bacteria inside its body were
      not sterilized. For an oyster left for 8 h in water containing
      ozone nanobubbles, on the other hand, bacteria such as norovirus
      were eliminated from the oyster's body while the oyster was alive
      (Fig.16). This sterilizing technology has already been adopted by
      some seafood companies, and has markedly reduced the number of
      complaints about their products.<br>

      ...Kaneo Chiba of Reo Lab. Co. demonstrated production and
      application of nanobubbles in various processes, including bulk
      waste treatment, food sterilization and preservation with ozone
      nanobubbles, in addition to health enhancement of most aquatic and
      terrestrial organisms exposed to oxygen nanobubbles. Initial
      processes for nanobubble production involved cavitation with
      ultrasound, yet simple carbon-based ceramic nozzles developed by
      Satoshi Anzai of Anzai Kantetsu Co. presented an extremely cost
      effective production method in 2014:<br>
      <br>
      As the main component of this class of carbon-ceramics, amorphous
      carbon particles (SEM above) contribute micron-sized pores to the
      composite material that allow passage of gas under low pressure
      through the nozzles to generate micron-sized bubbles from
      submerged nozzle surfaces. In still water, microbubbles rapidly
      coalesce to form larger bubbles that cannot remain suspended in
      the liquid medium but escape to the water's surface.<br>
      <br>
      However, investigation of the behavior of microbubbles produced
      from the carbon-based ceramic surfaces into a narrow jet of
      fast-flowing water revealed several surprising phenomena (below).
      The rapid motion of microbubbles torn away from nozzle surfaces
      begins a process known as adiabatic compression leading to
      collapse by isothermal evolution, whereby reducing in size during
      the course of several minutes to form nanobubbles (Ohgaki et al.,
      2010).<br>
      <br>
      During the microbubbles' decrease in size due to surface tension
      effects driving the dissolution of interior gases into the
      surrounding liquid, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are generated
      that decompose organic chemicals and contribute to the beneficial
      breakdown of toxins within biological systems and the natural
      environment. Stabilization as long-lived nanobubbles occurs when
      ions bind to the gas/liquid interface, yet display full collapse
      and complete dissolution after several minutes in the absence of
      bound ions.<br>
      <br>
      Longterm studies of the longevity of gas nanobubbles stabilized at
      &lt;200nm in size in bottled water samples have shown their
      presence in significant quantity several months after the infusion
      and bottling process (Takahashi, 2005). Nanobubble stabilization
      is also influenced by repulsive electrostatic forces due to
      surface charging, and may be maintained over long periods in
      colloidal suspensions of silver nanoparticles. Studies of
      nanoscale forces and fluid/gas dynamics reveal many surprising
      properties that contribute significantly to our understanding of
      basic metabolic processes that determine the cellular health of
      living organisms and entire ecosystems.<br>
      <br>
      Use of carbon-based ceramic nozzles with Geyser Reactor
      transmutation systems confirms nanobubble technology to represent
      a cost-effective solution for the efficient bulk delivery of
      carbon dioxide gas for binding with silver nanoparticles and rapid
      absorption under ambient pressures. Bulk binding of gas
      nanobubbles with metal nanoparticles replicates the metabolic
      activity of hemoglobin in red blood cells, enabling high gas
      absorption and bulk transmutation rates that far exceed those
      associated with resonant transmutation in healthy organisms, even
      under bioelectrification conditions that increase absorption of
      gases by metals within the body's tissues.<br>
      <br>
      A compact device for producing gas nanobubbles remains the only
      component of the Geyser Reactor system not readily available,
      requiring fabrication from special gas permeable materials. While
      the carbon-ceramic nozzles developed and demonstrated by Anzai
      Kantetsu represent cost-effective alternatives to high-pressure,
      high-temperature cavitation machines for nanobubble production,
      their new nozzles are not yet available for order.<br>
      <br>
      Carbon-ceramics are manufactured by wet packing 60% carbon, 40%
      clay powder mixtures into nozzle molds before drying and firing @
      &gt;1000°C in a reducing or inert gas atmosphere. Viable
      carbon-ceramics that allow the passage of gas through micropores
      are commonly used for high-temperature glass and metal casting
      applications, and can be easily fabricated into a nozzle by
      reshaping carbon-ceramic mold materials into the desired form.<br>
      <br>
      However, an even simpler nanobubble device has been integrated
      into the design of the Geyser Reactor system, consisting of a
      pyrolyzed segment of hardwood tree branch that maintains the
      natural nanoarchitecture of living wood, generally referred to as
      'biological charcoal'. The natural nanopiping of tree wood employs
      surface wetting effects for pumping water up to the leaves,
      sometimes hundreds of feet into the sky, yet also facilitates
      production of nanobubbles. Electron microscopy reveals the complex
      nanostructures of biocharcoal, presenting networks of carbon
      nanotubes arranged lengthwise in concentric rings with
      interconnecting nanopores (SEM above).<br>
      <br>
      Biocharcoal nozzles offer the same basic nanobubble
      characteristics demonstrated by the carbon-ceramics of Anzai
      Kantetsu --at a much lower cost of just 25¢ per nozzle--
      reflecting the simple natural solutions of Ayurveda. By carefully
      selecting and tooling the surfaces of a pyrolyzed hardwood branch
      segment that has no large pores or cracks, and sealing the central
      channel which tends to be much larger than the nanotubes arranged
      in concentric rings, an extremely cheap alternative can be
      produced with minimal cost and effort, in any part of the world.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      Acceptance of and interest in the special properties of
      nanobubbles (also termed as ultrafine bubbles) is growing rapidly,
      and their formation and characteristics are the subject of an
      increasing amount of study, particularly in Europe and Japan.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the theoretically very high pressure within nanobubbles of
      such small size and radius of curvature and thus high surface
      tension, conventional calculations show that gas should be
      ‘pressed out’ of the nanobubble within microseconds. However, it
      is now clear that, under the right conditions, nanobubbles can
      form freely and remain stable for extended periods of time,
      sometimes for many months.<br>
      <br>
      Applications for solutions containing nanobubbles include facility
      cleaning, solar cell manufacturing and plant growth. Many more
      applications are emerging rapidly.<br>
      <br>
      Malvern’s NanoSight range of instruments features prominently in
      nanobubble research publications. Similarly, the Zetasizer Nano
      range of instruments can also be used for the characterization of
      nanobubbles. All of these instruments provide fast, reliable,
      accurate and reproducible information about your product.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, Archimedes provides information previously
      unavailable to nanobubble researchers: clear differentiation
      between gas bubbles in solution and contaminants that may be
      present. Resonant mass measurement is therefore able to supply a
      clear, reproducible analysis of the concentration and purity of
      your nanobubble product.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b> : In recent years, microbubble and nanobubble
      technologies have drawn great attention due to their wide
      applications in many fields of science and technology, such as
      water treatment, biomedical engineering, and nanomaterials. In
      this paper, we discuss the physics, methods of generation of
      microbubbles (MBs) and nanobubbles (NBs), while production of free
      radicals from MBs and NBs are reviewed with the focuses on
      degradation of toxic compounds, water disinfection, and
      cleaning/defouling of solid surfaces including membrane. Due to
      their ability to produce free radicals, it can be expected that
      the future prospects of MBs and NBs will be immense and yet more
      to be explored.<br>
