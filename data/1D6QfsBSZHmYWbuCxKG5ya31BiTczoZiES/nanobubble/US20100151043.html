      <b> Abstract:</b> The present invention relates to a preparation
      for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue which has an excellent
      tissue sterilizing or disinfecting ability and is suitable for
      therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of various diseases caused
      by a microorganism such as a bacterium or a virus and a method for
      sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue. The present invention
      relates to a preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue
      and an agent for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of a
      periodontal disease, characterized by containing a gas in a
      nanobubble state. Furthermore, the present invention relates to
      the above-mentioned preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue, characterized in that the above-mentioned gas in a
      nanobubble state is ozone. Furthermore, the present invention
      relates to a liquid preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue, characterized by comprising ozone-nanobubble water.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a preparation for
      sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue which is suitable for
      therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of various diseases caused
      by a microorganism such as bacteria or viruses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Infection of a tissue with a pathogenic or harmful
      microorganism such as a bacterium or a virus causes various
      diseases. It is considered that a drug which can effectively
      sterilize or disinfect these tissues infected with microorganisms
      would be very suitable for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment
      of these various diseases caused by infection with microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] For example, periodontal disease is a generic name for
      diseases which occur in periodontal tissues. It is said that
      various periodontopathic bacteria which exist in plaques: biofilm
      (for example, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter
      actinomycetecomitans, Tannerella forsythia, and the like) are
      pathogens. Periodontal diseases are classified into gingivitis,
      which is characterized by hemorrhage and swelling due to gingival
      inflammation, and periodontitis, which is characterized by
      destruction of the alveolar bone supporting a tooth.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Since periodontal diseases are caused by the
      above-mentioned periodontopathic bacteria in plaques, the
      importance of plaque control by daily brushing and the like
      (prevention of formation of plaques or removal thereof) has been
      advocated for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of periodontal
      diseases. In actual situations, however, many patients suffer from
      periodontal diseases because of failure of proper plaque control.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Meanwhile, in recent years, water containing a large
      quantity of oxygen in a nanobubble state has drawn attention
      because of various bioactive actions thereof on living organisms,
      such as improving adaptability of fish and shellfish to
      environmental changes and rapidly recovering debilitated
      individuals. Nanobubbles are gas bubbles having a nanosize
      diameter (1 nm or greater and smaller than 1000 nm, for example,
      smaller than 100 nm), which are even smaller than microbubbles,
      bubbles having a micro-size diameter (1 µm or greater and smaller
      than 1000 µm). Nanobubbles are usually generated during the
      process where microbubbles having a diameter of approx. 50 µm or
      smaller are reduced in size and have been thought to have a short
      life generally since they are self-pressurized by the action of
      surface tension and rapidly dissolved completely. However, it has
      been reported that even nanosize bubbles can exist for a certain
      length of time when they are covered with surfactant shells or
      subject to electrostatic repulsion due to surface charging. A
      method for producing an aqueous solution which stably contains
      oxygen or ozone in a nanobubble state for a long period has also
      been established. In particular, nanobubbles stabilized by the
      charging effect retain characteristics of gas bubbles, and
      potentials for application in many fields, such as direct action
      on an organism at the cellular level, are expected (for example,
      refer to Patent Document 1).<br>

      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Technical Problem</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] An object of the present invention is to provide a
      preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue which solves
      the above-described various problems in the prior art, has an
      excellent tissue sterilizing or disinfecting ability, and is
      suitable for therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of various
      diseases caused by a microorganism such as bacteria or viruses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solution to Problem</b><br>
      <br>
      [0008] To achieve the foregoing object, the inventors of the
      present invention conducted researches eagerly. As a result, they
      found that nanobubble water containing a gas in a nanobubble state
      exhibited excellent effects of improving clinical symptoms of
      periodontal diseases (gingivitis, periodontitis) and could be
      suitably used as an excellent preparation for sterilizing or
      disinfecting a tissue in the field of health care, medical
      experiments, and the like. This is a novel finding by the
      inventors of the present invention which has not been known so
      far.<br>

      <br>
      <b> ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0010] According to the present invention, there can be provided a
      preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue and a method
      for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue, which can solve various
      problems in the prior art, has an excellent tissue sterilizing or
      disinfecting ability, and is suitable for therapeutic or
      prophylactic treatment of various diseases caused by a
      microorganism such as a bacterium or virus. Particularly in the
      application to periodontal diseases, the preparation for
      sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue of the present invention has
      been found to have not only an effect of killing periodontopathic
      bacteria but also an effect of regenerating periodontal tissues.
      Therefore, the present invention is very suitable for prophylactic
      and therapeutic treatment of these diseases.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Furthermore, when carp with infectious dermatitis and the
      like were kept in oxygen-nanobubble water, the infectious
      dermatitis was completely cured. Therefore, it was found that not
      only ozone-nanobubble water, but also oxygen-nanobubble water had
      effects of disinfecting, repairing, and regenerating tissues.
      Furthermore, these facts support a finding that the effects of
      nanobubble water are not simply dependent on the property of a
      gas, but are attributed to the characteristic of minute gas
      bubbles existing as “a gas in a nanobubble state.”<br>
      <br>
      <b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Preparation for Sterilizing or Disinfecting Tissue</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0012] The preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue of
      the present invention is characterized by containing a gas in a
      nanobubble state.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Nanobubbles&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0013] In the present invention, “nanobubble” means gas bubbles
      having a bubble size (diameter) of nanosize (1 nm or greater and
      smaller than 1000 nm). In the present invention, the “gas in a
      nanobubble state” is not particularly limited and can be suitably
      selected depending on the purpose. Examples thereof include
      oxygen, ozone, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, natural gases
      (for example, methane), and so forth. Of these, ozone is preferred
      as the above-mentioned “gas in a nanobubble state” in view of the
      tissue disinfecting ability. Furthermore, in the present
      invention, two or more types of gases can be used as the “gas in a
      nanobubble state.” When two or more types of gases are used, for
      example, a mixture of nanobubbles consisting of gas A alone and
      nanobubbles consisting of gas B alone may be used, or nanobubbles
      containing a mixture of gases A and B may be used. However, gas
      mixtures are not limited to these examples. For example, a mixture
      of nanobubbles may be used in which some nanobubbles contain gas A
      alone, some nanobubbles contain gas B alone, and some nanobubbles
      contain gases A and B.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The bubble size of nanobubbles can be suitably selected
      depending on the purpose, but 200 nm or smaller is preferred, and
      100 nm or smaller is particularly preferred. In general, the
      bubble size of 100 nm or smaller is advantageous in view of
      stability of nanobubbles. It appears that the smaller the bubble
      size is, the more stable bubbles are in the long-term storage in
      general.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The bubble size of nanobubbles can be adjusted to a desired
      size by, for example, utilizing a reverse osmosis membrane or the
      like. Furthermore, the bubble size of nanobubbles can be assessed
      by, for example, measurement using a dynamic light scattering
      photometer or measurement of free radicals. However, when the “gas
      in a nanobubble state” is ozone, it may damage a reverse osmosis
      membrane. Therefore, use of the membrane is not necessarily
      suitable. However, even if the nanobubbles are not passed through
      a reverse osmosis membrane, it is known that, for example,
      ozone-nanobubble water in which bubbles having a diameter of 100
      nm or smaller account for 95% or more of the gas bubble
      distribution can be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] It is sufficient that at least some of gas bubbles
      contained in the preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue of the present invention exist as nanobubbles, and gas
      bubbles having a larger size (for example, gas bubbles having a
      bubble size (diameter) of micro size (1 µm or greater and smaller
      than 1000 µm)) may be contained in addition to the nanobubbles. It
      is particularly preferred that the concentration of the “gas in a
      nanobubble state” in preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue is a saturated concentration. Furthermore, it is
      particularly preferred that the “gas in a nanobubble state” exists
      stably in a solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] When the preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue is a liquid preparation, the solution constituting the
      preparation is preferably an aqueous solution, but is not
      particularly limited and other liquids can be suitably selected
      depending on the purpose. In the present invention, an aqueous
      solution containing the “gas in a nanobubble state” is called
      “nanobubble water.” Furthermore, nanobubble water in which the
      “gas in a nanobubble state” is substantially oxygen alone is
      suitably called “oxygen-nanobubble water.” Nanobubble water in
      which the “gas in a nanobubble state” is substantially ozone alone
      is suitably called “ozone-nanobubble water.”<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Although the nanobubble water of the present invention
      contains a gas as an internal gas, the bubble size thereof is very
      minute (for example, smaller than 100 nm). Therefore, the overall
      amount of the dissolved gas is not particularly increased by
      containing a certain number of bubbles. In this view, the
      nanobubble water of the present invention is different from water
      in which the amount of a dissolved gas is increased. For example,
      in one embodiment of the present invention, the concentration of
      dissolved oxygen in oxygen-nanobubble water is maintained at the
      level similar to that in normal water. Therefore, this
      oxygen-nanobubble water is different from the prior art which is
      said to contain several tens or hundreds of times more oxygen (for
      example, high-concentration oxygen water which may be available
      with a name of “nanobubble water” and the like). Furthermore, when
      radicals are measured by the electron spin resonance method using
      DMPO as a spin-trapping agent, a high peak of hydroxyl radicals
      can usually be observed in oxygen-nanobubble water, one embodiment
      of the present invention, if DMPO is added together with
      hydrochloric acid. On the other hand, in the case of the
      high-concentration oxygen water, only a weak peak originating in
      impurities of DMPO can be detected. Thus, nanobubble water can be
      distinguished from the prior art in view of the dissolved gas
      concentration and generation of hydroxyl radicals after addition
      of hydrochloric acid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Other Components&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0019] If necessary, the nanobubble water can suitably contain
      other components in addition to the “gas in a nanobubble state.”
      The other components are not particularly limited and can be
      suitably selected depending on the purpose, and examples thereof
      include iron, manganese, salinity, and so forth. Furthermore,
      salinity concentration, pH, hardness, and the like of the
      nanobubble water are not particularly limited and can be suitably
      selected depending on the purpose. These can be adjusted to each
      desired level, for example, during the production process of
      nanobubble water described later or after nanobubble water is once
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Production&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0020] Methods for producing the nanobubble water are not
      particularly limited and can be suitably selected depending on the
      purpose. For example, the nanobubble water can be produced
      according to the methods described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open
      Nos. 2005-245817, 2005-246294, and 2005-246293 (corresponding to
      WO2005/084718, WO2005/084786, and WO2005/085141, respectively),
      and the like. The production methods described in the
      above-mentioned publications are preferred because nanobubble
      water in which a “gas in a nanobubble state” exists stably over a
      long period of several months or longer and is not eliminated from
      an aqueous solution can be produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Furthermore, during the production process of the
      nanobubble water, it is preferable to add iron, manganese,
      salinity, and the like to an aqueous solution to be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In the production process of the nanobubble water, the
      salinity concentration in an aqueous solution to be used is
      preferably 0.2 to 3.0% by mass, more preferably 0.8 to 1.2% by
      mass. In general, when the salinity concentration is in the range
      of 0.8 to 1.2% by mass, a gas nucleus of a nanobubble can be
      easily generated, resulting in an excellent production efficiency
      of nanobubble water. The above-mentioned salinity concentration
      can be measured by, for example, using known salinity
      concentration measuring instruments.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In the production process of the nanobubble water, it is
      generally thought that pH, hardness, and the like of an aqueous
      solution to be used do not affect the production efficiency of
      nanobubbles as greatly as the salinity concentration, but usually
      pH is preferably 7 to 8, and hardness is preferably 20 to 30. The
      above-mentioned pH, hardness, and the like can be measured by, for
      example, using known pH meters, known hardness testing machines,
      and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] More specifically, the nanobubble water can be produced by,
      for example, producing microbubbles of 50 µm or smaller using hard
      water (groundwater) having a salinity concentration of 1.0% by
      mass as a raw material and then rapidly crushing the bubbles by
      applying pressure. By further passing this nanobubble water twice
      through a 10-Å reverse osmosis membrane, nanobubble water having a
      salinity concentration of 0% by mass can be produced
      (oxygen-nanobubble water having a salinity concentration of 0% by
      mass is known as “Naga no Shizuku” [NAGA Co., Ltd.] approved by
      the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare as drinking water).
      Meanwhile, nanobubble water before being passed through a 10-Å
      reverse osmosis membrane can be used as nanobubble water having a
      salinity concentration of 1.0% by mass. Nanobubble water having a
      salinity concentration of 0 to 1.0% by mass can be provided by
      changing the mixing ratio of these two nanobubble waters. When
      ozone-nanobubble water is passed through a reverse osmosis
      membrane, the device may be melted and broken, and use of a
      reverse osmosis membrane is not preferable.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Nanobubble water obtained as described above may be used,
      for example, as the preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue as it is, or as the preparation for sterilizing or
      disinfecting a tissue by using other components in combination.
      For example, it is expected that the tissue sterilizing or
      disinfecting ability can be further improved by adding a
      preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue having a
      conventional composition to the above-mentioned nanobubble water
      or using the above-mentioned nanobubble water to produce a
      preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue having a
      conventional composition. Furthermore, the nanobubble water can be
      used in combination with a conventional drug which can be used for
      sterilization or disinfection of tissues or the like. Accordingly,
      such preparations for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue using
      the nanobubble water as a part thereof are also encompassed in the
      scope of the preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue
      of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Tissues&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0026] Target “tissues” for which the preparation for sterilizing
      or disinfecting a tissue of the present invention is used are not
      particularly limited and can be suitably selected depending on the
      purpose. Examples thereof include epithelial tissues, connective
      tissues, muscle tissues, nerve tissues, and so forth. Furthermore,
      in the present specification, the “tissue” is a concept that also
      includes “cells” constituting the tissue and an “organ”
      constituted by the tissue. Examples of the “cells” include
      epidermal cells, pancreatic parenchymal cells, pancreatic duct
      cells, hepatocytes, blood cells, cardiac muscle cells, skeletal
      muscle cells, osteoblasts, skeletal myoblasts, nerve cells,
      vascular endothelial cells, pigment cells, smooth muscle cells,
      fat cells, bone cells, cartilage cells, and so forth. Furthermore,
      examples of the above-mentioned “organ” include skin, blood
      vessels, cornea, kidneys, heart, liver, umbilical cord,
      intestines, nerves, lungs, placenta, pancreas, brain, distal
      portions of the extremities, retina, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The tissue may be derived from any organism, and the
      organism can be suitably selected depending on the purpose. Above
      all, the tissue can be derived from mammals, particularly from
      humans.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The tissue may exist in the body or outside the body (for
      example, a cultured tissue, etc.).<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Sterilization and Disinfection&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0029] In the present invention, both “sterilization” and
      “disinfection” of a tissue mean to kill or reduce a pathogenic or
      harmful microorganism such as a bacterium or a virus, or suppress
      activities of the microorganism in the tissue. Furthermore, in the
      present specification, the “sterilization” and “disinfection” are
      concepts also including, for example, killing and removal of all
      microbes, removal of microbes, microbial reduction, antibacterial
      treatment, microbiostasis, prevention of molds, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Applications&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0030] Methods of using the preparation for sterilizing or
      disinfecting a tissue of the present invention are not
      particularly limited and can be suitably selected depending on the
      purpose. For example, the preparation can be used by bringing the
      preparation into contact with the tissue infected with a
      pathogenic or harmful microorganism such as a bacterium or virus
      by an arbitrary method. In the tissue sterilizing or disinfecting
      method of the present invention, methods of applying a “gas in a
      nanobubble state” are not particularly limited and can be suitably
      selected depending on the purpose. For example, the gas can be
      applied by bringing an effective amount of nanobubble water into
      contact with the above-mentioned tissue infected with a pathogenic
      or harmful microorganism such as a bacterium or a virus by an
      arbitrary method.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Methods for storing the preparation for sterilizing or
      disinfecting a tissue are not particularly limited and can be
      suitably selected depending on the purpose. When ozone is used as
      the “gas in a nanobubble state,” it is recommended to avoid an
      ultraviolet ray and store the preparation in the dark refrigerator
      to prevent deterioration.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Since the preparation for sterilizing or disinfecting a
      tissue has an excellent tissue sterilizing or disinfecting
      ability, it can be suitably used for, for example, therapeutic or
      prophylactic treatment of various diseases and conditions caused
      by infection with a pathogenic or harmful microorganism such as a
      bacterium or a virus (for example, therapeutic or prophylactic
      treatment of periodontal diseases or the like). In the method for
      therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of periodontal disease of
      the present invention, methods of applying a “gas in a nanobubble
      state” are not particularly limited and can be suitably selected
      depending on the purpose. For example, the gas can be applied by
      bringing an effective amount of nanobubble water into contact with
      an affected area by an arbitrary method. The above-mentioned
      periodontal diseases are not particularly limited, and examples
      thereof include gingivitis, periodontitis, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0033] Hereafter, examples of the present invention will be
      explained. However, the scope of the present invention is not
      limited to these examples.<br>

      </b><b> Evaluation of Tissue Sterilizing or Disinfecting Effects
        of Ozone-Nanobubble Water</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0034] Ozone-nanobubble water, one embodiment of the preparation
      for sterilizing or disinfecting a tissue of the present invention,
      was prepared with reference to the production method described in
      Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2005-246293 (corresponding to
      WO2005/085141). Specifically, hard water (groundwater) having a
      salinity concentration of 1.0% by mass was used as a raw material
      and microbubbles of 50 µm or smaller were prepared and then
      rapidly crushed by applying pressure to prepare the
      ozone-nanobubble water. The tissue sterilizing or disinfecting
      effects of the obtained ozone-nanobubble water were clinically
      examined in patients suffering from periodontal diseases
      (gingivitis and periodontitis) as subjects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Method&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0035] The subjects included four patients suffering from
      periodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis). These
      patients were allowed to rinse out their mouth with 20 mL of the
      above-mentioned ozone-nanobubble water for 20 seconds each time
      twice daily, in the morning and evening, for two weeks. Changes in
      clinical symptoms (depth of the periodontal pocket and hemorrhage
      upon probing—i.e., measurement of depth of the periodontal pocket)
      were observed. In this example, to purely evaluate the effects of
      the above-mentioned ozone-nanobubble water, brushing was not
      instructed deliberately, and whether clinical symptoms would be
      improved by rinsing with the ozone-nanobubble water alone was
      examined.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Results&gt;</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0036] The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows
      changes over time in the proportion (%) of sites of hemorrhage
      upon probing. Table 2 shows the percentage of periodontal pockets
      where the depths were reduced by 1 mm or more among the pockets
      having an original depth of 3 mm or greater, and the number of
      these pockets.<br>

      <br>
      [0037] The results in Table 1 demonstrate that the proportions of
      hemorrhage sites were clearly reduced, showing that the mean
      proportion of hemorrhage sites in the upper and lower jaws (whole
      jaws) changed from approx. 34.4% on the rinse start day (0) to
      approx. 10.2 and 9.3% at one week (I) and two weeks (II),
      respectively. Further, the results in Table 2 demonstrate that the
      depth of the periodontal pocket was clearly improved, showing that
      the mean proportion of periodontal pockets with reduction of the
      depth by 1 mm or more among the periodontal pockets having an
      original depth of 3 mm or greater (percentage of reductions by 1
      mm or more) was approx. 70.0%.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The above results demonstrated that clinical symptoms of
      periodontal diseases (gingivitis and periodontitis) were
      dramatically improved by rinsing out the mouth with nanobubble
      water. This suggests that periodontal disease-causing bacteria
      existing in plaques were eliminated by sterilization or
      disinfection, and periodontal tissues were regenerated by the
      action of nanobubble water. Therefore, these results suggested
      that nanobubble water had excellent tissue sterilizing or
      disinfecting effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Furthermore, the above-mentioned results are very
      surprising taking into account that the plaque control records
      (percentage of dental plaques attached in a quarter of one tooth)
      of the patients were 80% or higher at the initial visit (before
      the start of rinsing), and brushing after the visit was not
      instructed. Generally in treatment of periodontal diseases, the
      plaque control record needs to be reduced to 20% or lower first.
      In this experiment, clinical symptoms were dramatically improved
      by rinsing with nanobubble water alone without instructing
      brushing. This result suggests that nanobubble water is very
      promising as an agent effective for therapeutic or prophylactic
      treatment of periodontal diseases and can be widely applied for
      therapeutic or prophylactic treatment of various diseases caused
      by infection with microorganisms by utilizing the excellent tissue
      sterilizing or disinfecting ability thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</b><b><br>
