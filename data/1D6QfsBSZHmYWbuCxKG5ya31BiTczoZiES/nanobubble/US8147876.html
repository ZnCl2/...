      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a medical agent for preventing or
      treating diseases resulting from inflammation or remodeling,
      particularly diseases such as arteriosclerosis, heart failure,
      cerebrovascular disorder, and hypertensive kidney disease; and to
      a method for preventing or treating the diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Related Art</b><br>
      <br>
      In recent years, with the aging of the population and Westernized
      eating habits, prevalence of high blood pressure, hyperlipemia,
      and diabetes has increased. As a result, arteriosclerotic diseases
      are increasing year by year. Arteriosclerotic diseases include
      diseases such as stroke, an ischemic heart disease, hypertensive
      nephropathy, ophthalmopathy, heart failure, aortic aneurysm,
      arteriosclerosis obliterans, hypertensive emergency, and
      cerebrovascular disorder. More than half of the elderly people
      aged 75 or more has some sort of disease and reduced quality of
      life (QOL). It is known that these diseases are caused by common
      pathologic conditions, arteriolar and aortic damages.<br>
      <br>
      Chronic injury in endothelial cells triggers the onset of
      arteriosclerosis. Endothelial cells line the artery, forming a
      layer, and play an important role such as regulation of vascular
      permeability, production and/or secretion of antithrombotic
      substances, smooth muscle cell-growth inhibition, and production
      of vasoactive substances. In the injured vascular endothelium,
      these functions are impaired. In addition, on the surface of
      activated or injured endothelial cells, adhesion molecules such as
      intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell
      adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) are expressed. Monocyte recognizes
      adhesion molecules, adheres to the surface of endothelial cells,
      is recruited under the layer of endothelial cells, and then
      matures into a macrophage. The macrophage beneath endothelial
      cells is eventually converted into a foam cell, forming
      atherosclerotic plaque. Inflammatory cytokine is involved in the
      expression of adhesion molecules and migration of monocyte.<br>
      <br>
      It is also known that in the pathologic condition such as high
      blood pressure that is involved in the development of
      arteriosclerosis, responding to various load applied on the blood
      vessel, the cytoarchitecture of blood vessel wall changes, causing
      remodeling of blood vessel. Remodeling of blood vessel refers to
      the change of the structure of vascular tissue as a result of the
      injury or abnormal proliferation of vascular tissue due to
      mechanical load or change of humoral factor. Originally,
      remodeling is a mechanism for responding to change in pathologic
      condition; it is known that remodeling has an adverse effect on
      blood vessel such as hardening of blood vessel wall and decrease
      of inner diameter during the process. It is known that in the
      remodeling of blood vessel, smooth muscle cells from medial layer
      in blood vessel, become hypertrophied. Growth factors such as
      angiotensin II and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) are
      involved in this hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, the mechanism of onset and/or development of
      arteriosclerosis is complicated. Besides, many of the mechanisms
      are yet to be elucidated. There is a need for efficient methods
      for preventing and/or treating arteriosclerosis. Moreover, there
      is a need for efficient methods for preventing and/or treating
      diseases resulting from one of inflammation and remodeling
      including arteriosclerosis.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, attention has been paid to various bioactive
      effects of water that contains nanobubbles of oxygen in large
      amount (oxygen-nanobubble water) on living organisms. For example,
      oxygen-nanobubble water improves adaptability of fish and
      shellfish to environmental change, or restores a debilitated
      individual quickly. Nanobubbles are ultrafine bubbles with a
      nano-order diameter and are typically generated in the process
      where microbubbles (minute bubble with a diameter of 50 Âµm or
      less) shrink. Since nanobubbles are self-pressurized by the action
      of surface tension, they are completely dissolved rapidly. Thus,
      the lifetime was considered to be short in general. However, it is
      reported that in the case where nanobubbles are coated with shell
      by a surfactant, or in the case where they are subjected to
      electrostatic repulsion due to surface charging, even bubbles in
      nano-order can exist for a certain period. Especially, nanobubbles
      stabilized due to charging effect retain properties as bubble;
      thus various applications, such as direct action to organisms at
      cellular level, are expected (See, for example, Japanese Patent
      Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 2005-245817).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An object of the present invention is to solve the conventional
      problems and to achieve the following objects. Specifically, an
      object of the present invention is to provide a medical agent that
      has an excellent preventive or therapeutic effect on the diseases
      resulting from one of inflammation and remodeling and that can
      prevent or treat them in response to various mechanisms of onset
      and development of the diseases.<br>
      <br>
      As a result of dedicated investigations conducted by the present
      inventors to settle the above-mentioned problems, they have made
      the following findings. Specifically, they have found that
      nanobubble water which contains bubbles with a nano-order diameter
      can exhibit an excellent preventive or therapeutic effect on the
      diseases resulting from one of inflammation and remodeling.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, it has been known that oxygen-nanobubble water
      which contains bubbles of oxygen with a nano-order diameter has
      various bioactive effects on living organisms. For example, it
      improves adaptability of fish and shellfish to environmental
      change, or restores a debilitated individual quickly. Thus, the
      oxygen-nanobubble water is attracting attention. In addition,
      recently a method for producing nanobubble water has been
      established that can maintain nanobubbles of oxygen or ozone
      stably for a long time (See, for example, JP-A No. 2005-245817).<br>
      <br>

      water can exhibit an excellent preventive or therapeutic effect on
      the diseases resulting from one of inflammation and remodeling,
      which was newly found by the present inventors.<br>
      <br>

      disease is at least one selected from arteriosclerosis, heart
      failure, cerebrovascular disorder, and hypertensive kidney
      disease.<br>

      administering the medical agent of &lt;1&gt; to a patient.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention can solve the conventional problems and
      provide a medical agent that has an excellent effect on the
      diseases resulting from one of inflammation and remodeling and
      that can prevent or treat them. Nanobubble water affects various
      in vivo mechanisms associated with the diseases. Thus, the present

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Medical Agent for Prevention or Treatment</b><br>
      <br>
      The medical agent of the present invention comprises nanobubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Nanobubble&gt;</b><br>
      <br>
      In the present invention, the ânanobubbleâ refers to a bubble
      which has a nano-order diameter. The type of gas as the nanobubble
      is not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected
      according to the purpose. Examples thereof include oxygen, ozone,
      hydrogen, nitrogen, natural gas (e.g. methane), and the like.
      Among these, oxygen is preferable as the gas in that it has a
      better ability to treat diseases resulting from one of
      inflammation and remodeling in blood vessel. In the present
      invention, nanobubble composed of oxygen is particularly referred
      to as âoxygen nanobubbleâ, and an aqueous solution that comprises
      the oxygen, part of which is in the form of the oxygen nanobubble,
      is particularly referred to as âoxygen nanobubble waterâ.<br>
      <br>
      The diameter of the nanobubble can be appropriately selected
      according to the purpose. The bubble diameter is preferably 200 nm
      or less, more preferably 100 nm or less and most preferably less
      than 10 nm. Nanobubbles with a diameter of 100 nm or less are
      advantageous in that there is less possibility for incorporation
      of electrolytes or foreign substances. It is considered that the
      smaller the diameter is, the more stable in long-term storage the
      nanobubbles are, and the less impurity the nanobubbles contain.
      Nanobubbles with a diameter less than 10 nm are further
      advantageous in that incorporation of many foreign substances
      including viruses can be prevented.<br>
      <br>
      The bubble diameter of the nanobubble can be adjusted to a desired
      size using, for example, a reverse osmosis membrane (for ozone
      nanobubble, use of reverse osmosis membrane is not appropriate).
      The bubble diameter of the nanobubble can be measured with, for
      example, a dynamic light scattering equipment.<br>
      <br>
      As long as at least part of bubble contained in the medical agent
      exists as the nanobubble, the medical agent may comprise, in
      addition to the nanobubble, bubble with a larger diameter (for
      example, bubble which has a micro-order diameter (more than 1 Âµm,
      and 1 mm or less)). The concentration of the nanobubble in the
      tissue repair and/or regeneration solution is particularly
      preferably saturated one. It is important that nanobubble be
      dissolved in the solution sufficiently.<br>
      <br>
      The solution that makes up the medical agent is preferably an
      aqueous solution, but other liquids can be appropriately selected
      according to the purpose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>âOther Componentâ</b><br>
      <br>
      The nanobubble water may comprise other components than the
      nanobubbles as necessary. The other component is not particularly
      limited and can be appropriately selected according to the
      purpose, including, for example, iron, manganese, and salts.<br>
      <br>
      The salt concentration, pH, and hardness of the nanobubble water
      are not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected
      according to the purpose. For example, each of them can be
      adjusted to a desired degree during the production process of
      nanobubble water described below or after the production of
      nanobubble water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>âProductionâ</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The nanobubble water can be produced by any method without
      limitation and the method can be appropriately selected depending
      on the application. For example, the nanobubble water can be
      produced by the production method disclosed in JP-A Nos.
      2005-245817, 2005-246294, etc. The production method disclosed in
      the gazette is preferable since it can produce nanobubble water in
      which nanobubbles exist stably and do not disappear from the
      aqueous solution over a long period of several months or more.<br>
      <br>
      In the production process of the nanobubble water, iron,
      manganese, and/or salts can be preferably added.<br>
      <br>
      The salt concentration of the aqueous solution used in the
      production process of the nanobubble water is preferably 0.2% by
      mass to 3.0% by mass, and more preferably 0.8% by mass to 1.2% by
      mass. When the salt concentration is within the range of from 0.8%
      by mass to 1.2% by mass, nanobubbles (core of gas) can be produced
      easily; thus it is advantageous in that production efficiency of
      the nanobubble water is excellent. The salt concentration can be
      measured using, for example, a known instrument for measuring salt
      concentration.<br>
      <br>
      It is considered that the pH and hardness of the aqueous solution
      used in the production process of the nanobubble water does not
      affect the production efficiency of nanobubbles as greatly as does
      the salt concentration. Typically, the pH is preferably 7 to 8,
      and the hardness is preferably 20 to 30. The pH and hardness can
      be measured using, for example, a known instrument for measuring
      pH and a known instrument for measuring hardness, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, microbubbles of 50 Âµm or less are produced
      using hard water (groundwater) with a salt concentration of 1.0%
      by mass as a raw material. Then, by rapidly collapsing or crushing
      the microbubbles, nanobubble water can be produced. Further,
      nanobubble water with a salt concentration of 0% by mass can be
      prepared by passing the resulting nanobubble water through a
      reverse osmosis membrane of 10 angstrom twice (oxygen-nanobubble
      water with a salt concentration of 0% by mass is âNaga no shizukuâ
      (drips of Naga) (manufactured by NAGA Co., Ltd.), which is
      drinking water approved by the Ministry of Health, Labour and
      Welfare.). Meanwhile, nanobubble water with a salt concentration
      of 1.0% by mass is nanobubble water that is not passed through a
      reverse osmosis membrane of 10 angstrom. Varying the mixing ratio
      of both of the nanobubble waters can provide nanobubble waters
      with a salt concentration of from 0% by mass to 1.0% by mass. As
      mentioned above, in the case of ozone nanobubble, use of reverse
      osmosis membrane is not preferable because when ozone nanobubble
      water is passed through a reverse osmosis membrane, device may
      melt and get damaged.<br>
      <br>
      The nanobubble water, prepared as described above, may be used
      itself as the medical agent, or may be used as the medical agent
      by combining with other components. For example, it is expected
      that the ability to prevent or treat diseases resulting from one
      of inflammation and remodeling in blood vessel can be further
      improved by adding to the nanobubble water an existing medical
      agent, etc. that can be used for the purpose of prevention or
      treatment of diseases resulting from one of inflammation and
      remodeling in blood vessel, or by using the nanobubble water for
      preparing an existing medical agent, etc. that can be used for the
      purpose of prevention or treatment of diseases resulting from one
      of inflammation and remodeling in blood vessel. Thus, such medical
      agents that utilize the nanobubble water in part are also included
      within the scope of the medical agent of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Aspect of Medical Agent&gt;</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Since the medical agent has excellent capability of prevention or
      treatment of diseases resulting from one of inflammation and
      remodeling in blood vessel, it is suitable for animals, tissues,
      and the prevention or treatment of diseases.<br>
      <br>
      <b>âTarget Animalâ</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The animal, to which the medical agent is applied, is not
      particularly limited, including those from mammals, birds,
      reptiles, amphibian, and the like. Among these, mammals are
      preferable. The mammal is not particularly limited, and examples
      thereof include human, monkey, cattle, horses, pigs, mice, rats,
      and the like. Among these, human is preferable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>âTarget Tissueâ</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      The tissue, to which the medical agent is applied, is not
      particularly limited and can be appropriately selected according

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Hereinafter, Examples of the present invention will be described,
      which however shall not be construed as limiting the present
      invention thereto.<br>
      <br>
      In Examples, OXNB means oxygen nanobubble, and OZNB means ozone
      nanobubble. Both are available from REO Institute.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Objective:<br>
      <br>
      To investigate the effect of nano-bubbles on inflammatory
      responses in the cultured endothelial cells induced by cytokines.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Medium preparation: Although accurate assay for OXNB density
      is not established, the activity of OXNB is increased with
      increasing the concentration of NaCl in the solution. REO
      Institute provided us OXNB solution including 1.0% by mass of
      NaCl. We prepared NaCl-free MCDB medium powder and dissolved the
      powder by using OXNB solution as vehicle. Because ordinary MCDB
      media contains 0.64% by mass of NaCl, we diluted the nano-bubble
      solution by distilled water to make OXNB with 0.64% by mass of
      NaCl. Then we dissolved the sodium free-MCDB medium powder with
      0.64% by mass of NaCl OXNB solution to adjust NaCl concentration
      to ordinary MCDB media and defined the media 100%-OXNB MCDB. To
      examine the dose-response relationship between inflammatory
      response and concentration of OXNB, we diluted 100%-OXNB MCDB by
      ordinary MCDB media. The â50%-OXNBâ and â75%-OXNBâ described below
      mean those prepared by diluting 100%-OXNB MCDB by ordinary MCDB
      media (based on mass).<br>
      <br>
      (2) Cell culture: Rat aortic endothelial cells (RAOECs, passage 7
      to 10) were incubated in the MCDB culture media (containing fetal
      bovine serum, endothelial cell growth factor and antibiotics) with
      or without OXNB for 24 hours and were stimulated with inflammatory
      cytokines (10 ng/mL of IL-1Ã or 20 ng/mL of TNFa). Expression of
      intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion
      molecule-1 (VCAM-1), endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and a-tubulin
      was examined by Western blotting.<br>
      <br>
      (3) Analysis of mRNA expression: Northern blot analysis was
      performed to examine mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 induced
      by inflammatory cytokines 6 hours after the stimulation.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Functional analysis: RAOECs were incubated either with or
      without OXNB. Rat alveolar macrophage cells (NR8383) were
      stimulated with 0.1 ÂµM of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Then RAOECs
      and NR8383 were co-cultured for 1 hour and adhesion of NR8383 to
      RAOECs was evaluated.<br>
      <br>
      (5) Signal transduction experiments: RAOECs were incubated in the
      culture media with or without OXNB for 24 hours and were
      stimulated with 20 ng/mL of TNFa. Intracellular signal
      transduction was evaluated by Western blot analysis. Activation of
      NFkB was measured by NFKB p50/65 transcription factor assay kit
      (Chemicon International Inc.) (DiDonato J A, Mercurio F, Karin M.:
      Phosphorylation of IKBa precedes but is not sufficient for its
      dissociation from NF-kB. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1302-1311;

      the amino-terminal nuclear export signal of IKBa. Mol. Cell. Biol.
      2001; 21: 4737-1311).<br>
      <br>
      (6) Histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity: HAT activity was
      measured by commercially available kit (Upstate Biotechnologies
      Inc.) (Dignam J D, Lebovits R M, Roeder R G.: Accurate
      transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II in a soluble extract
      from isolated mammalian nuclei. Nucleic Acid Res. 1983; 11:
      1475-1489; Nakatani F, Tanaka K, Sakimura R et al.: Identification
      of p21WAF/CIP1 as a direct target of EWS-Fli1 oncogenic fusion
      protein. J Biol Chem. 2003; 278: 15105-15115).<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      IL-1Ã and TNFa induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in RAOECs with
      a peak at 24 hours after stimulation. Incubation of RAOECs with
      culture media containing OXNB inhibited induction of ICAM-1 by
      TNFa (FIG. 1). ICAM-1 expression was perfectly abolished over
      50%-OXNB media and VCAM-1 expression was perfectly abolished over
      75%-OXNB media (FIG. 2). In contrast, expression of eNOS or
      a-tublin was not changed. Northern blot analysis revealed that
      OXNB inhibited induction of mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1
      by TNFa (FIG. 3). When RAOECs were treated with OXNB, adhesion of
      NR8383 to RAOECs was significantly decreased (FIG. 4). Similar
      results were obtained in the experiments using IL-1Ã instead of
      TNFa. As shown in FIG. 5, OXNB did not inhibit activation of c-Jun
      NH2 terminal kinase (JNK). OXNB did not affect degradation of IKBa
      that is an internal inhibitor for NFkB (FIG. 6A). Consequently,
      activation of NFkB was not decreased by treatment of OXNB (FIG.
      6B). These results suggest that intracellular signal transduction
      was not changed by OXNB. These results indicate that OXNB might
      affect transcriptional regulation of VCAM-1 by TNFa. Curcumin, a
      specific HAT inhibitor is reported to inhibit TNFa-induced VCAM-1
      expression (Lee C W, Lin W N, Lin C C, Luo S F, Wang J S,
      Pouyssegur J, Yang C M: Transcriptional regulation of VCAM-1
      expression by tumor necrosis factor-a in human tracheal smooth
      muscle cells: Involvement of MAPKs, NF-kB, p300 and histone
      acetylation. J Cell Physiol. 2006; 207: 174-186). Thus it is
      possible that OXNB attenuates VCAM-1 expression via an inhibition
      of HAT in endothelial cells. We investigated the effect of OXNB on
      HAT activity in RAOECs. We observed that OXNB inhibited the
      acetylation of histone H3 (FIG. 7). Acetylation of histone H4 was
      not changed by OXNB. Similar results were obtained when ozone
      nano-bubbles are used instead of OXNB.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      These results indicate that nano-bubbles (OXNB and OZNB) could be
      a novel therapeutic measure to attenuate atherosclerosis via a
      selective inhibition of histone H3 acetylation of in vitro
      cultured endothelial cells.<br>

      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Objective:<br>
      <br>
      To investigate the effect of nano-bubbles on hypertrophic response
      of vascular smooth muscle cells.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Medium preparation: DMEM media for vascular smooth muscle
      cells were prepared with the same procedure of MCDB media in
      Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      (2) Cell culture: Rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMCs,
      passage 7 to 10) were used. RASMCs were incubated in the serum
      free DMEM media with or without OXNB (75%) for 48 hours and were
      stimulated with A II (A II, 10&lt;-8 &gt;M), epidermal growth
      factor (EGF, 100 ng/mL) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF,
      50 ng/mL).<br>
      <br>
      (3) Signal transduction analysis: Activation of extracellular
      signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was evaluated by Western blotting
      analysis. Tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor was analyzed by
      immunoprecipitation (IP) of EGF receptor with immunoblotting with
      anti-phosphotyrosine (clone 4G10).<br>
      <br>
      (4) Protein content and the viable cell number: Protein content of
      cell lysate from RASMCs was measured by chromomeric assay using
      bicinchoninic acid solution. Cell viability was measured by
      dehydrogenase enzyme activity found in metabolically active cells
      using
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium,

      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows the time course of ERK activation by A II. DMEM
      containing 100%-OXNB inhibited ERK activation by A II over 10
      minutes. As shown in FIG. 9A, A II and EGF activated ERK in RASMCs
      5 minutes after the stimulation. Treatment of RASMCs with OXNB
      inhibited ERK activation by A II, however ERK activation by EGF
      was not changed suggesting the specific inhibition of A
      II-mediated ERK activation. It has been reported that
      transactivation of EGF receptor has an important role in ERK
      activation by A II (H Daub, C Wallasch, A Lankenau, A Herrlich, A
      Ullrich: Signal characteristics of G protein-transactivated EGF
      receptor. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7032-7044). We checked the effect of
      OXNB on transactivation of EGF receptor by A II. As shown in FIG.
      9B, OXNB inhibited transactivation of EGF receptor, suggesting
      that decreased ERK activation is at least, partially mediated by
      an inhibition of EGF receptor transactivation. As we found the
      inhibitory effect of OXNB on ERK activation, we have investigated
      the effect of OXNB on protein synthesis of RASMCs. As shown in
      FIG. 10A, A II increased protein content of RASMCs under
      inhibition of A II type-2 receptor (10&lt;-6 &gt;M of PD123319).
      No significant change was observed in cell viability by A II,
      suggesting that A II promotes hypertrophy of RASMCs. OXNB
      inhibited this hypertrophic response of RASMCs by A II. Similarly
      PDGF increased protein content of RASMCs without changing the
      viable cell number. OXNB significantly inhibited the increases in
      protein content in RASMCs without affecting the viable cell number
      (FIG. 10B). Similar results were obtained in the experiments using
      OZNB instead of OXNB.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      These results suggest that nano-bubbles inhibit hypertrophy of
      vascular smooth muscle cells. It is possible that nano-bubbles
      attenuate vascular remodeling induced by atherogenic stimuli.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      Objective:<br>
      <br>
      To investigate the in vivo effect of OXNB using the animal model
      of genetic hypertension.<br>
      <br>
      Methods:<br>
      <br>
      Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at 4 week-old were used. SHR
      were divided into control (n=4) and OXNB group (n=4). They were
      kept in the separated cages and allowed to drink either water with
      0.1% by mass of NaCl or water with 10-fold diluted OXNB with 1% by
      mass of NaCl (final concentration of 0.1% by mass of NaCl). The
      amount of water intake, body weight, systolic blood pressure (SBP)
      and pulse rate (PR) were checked once a week. They were sacrificed
      at 40 week-old to examine histological changes in
      hypertension-target organs (heart and kidney).<br>
      <br>
      Results:<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 11, the amount of water did not differ between
      two groups. Body weight in OXNB group was higher than that in
      control group (FIG. 12). Blood pressure and pulse rate were not
      significantly different between two groups (FIG. 13). The organ
      weight ratio of heart and kidney did not differ between two groups
      (Table 1). As shown in FIG. 14, hematoxylin-eosin staining of
      glomerular apparatus in SHR kidney showed marked hyaline
      degeneration. In contrast, OXNB group did not show any
      degenerative changes in the kidney. The quantitative analysis of
      histological specimen revealed that the administration of OXNB to
      SHR decreased the degeneration rate of glomerular apparatus
      significantly (control: 92.1+/-0.49%, OXNB: 24.4+/-5.8%,
      p&lt;0.001).<br>
      <br>
      We also did the same experiments using OZNB and found protective
      effect of OZNB in SHR kidney. No significant histological changes
      were found in the heart.<br>

      0.53&nbsp; 0.53&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      We checked the effect of OXNB on the redox state in SHR because
      the excess administration of oxygen might results in the increase
      in oxidative stress. We have measured the plasma levels of low
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol), a marker of
      oxidative stress, in SHR. We did not find significant changes in
      plasma LDL cholesterol levels in the two groups (control:
      59.8+/-9.6 mg/dL, OXNB: 71.0+/-2.1 mg/dL, p=0.30).<br>
      <br>
      Conclusion:<br>
      <br>
      These results suggest that OXNB prevented glomerular injury in the
      hypertension model animals. This protective effect of glomerular
      apparatus is exerted without reducing blood pressure, suggesting
      that nano-bubbles can protect kidneys even the blood pressure is
      elevated. The anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative property of
      nano-bubbles is supposed to be involved in this unique biological
      activity such HAT inhibition.<br>
      <br>
      (Conclusions)<br>
      <br>
      OXNB and OZNB prevented glomerular injury in the animal models of
      hypertension. The renal protective effect might be exerted by
      attenuation of inflammation and remodeling of blood vessels.
      Inhibition of HAT is at least, partially involved in the
      mechanism. Precise mechanism how nano-bubbles inhibit HAT is still
      not clear, however this property of nano-bubbles might be applied
      to other diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart failure and
      cerebrovascular diseases. Application of nano-bubbles could be a
      novel treatment for renal diseases caused by hypertension. This
      technology might be applied in immunological, diabetic and
      drug-induced glomerular injury that shares common pathogenic
      features with hypertensive renal disease.<br>
