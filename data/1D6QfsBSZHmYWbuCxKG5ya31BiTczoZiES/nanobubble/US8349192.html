      <b> </b><b>Abstract:</b> A method for collapsing a microbubble
      includes applying stimulation to the microbubble during the
      gradual decrease of the its size. As a result, the microbubble
      floating in a solution that decreases in size due to the natural
      dissolution of a gas contained in the microbubble and disappears
      after a while, has the speed of its size decrease enhanced and
      causes the microbubble to disappear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method of collapsing
      microbubble (microbubbles) that is useful in all technical fields,
      particularly in the technical field of water processing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0002] Bubbles having a diameter of 50 [mu]m or less
      (microbubbles) are known to have properties different form those
      of normal bubbles, but the properties of the microbubbles are yet
      to be understood. For that reason, various microbubble generators
      under development recently only generate microbubble of a gas in
      aqueous solution, and there is almost no invention that makes the
      most of the potential properties of microbubbles. An example of
      the traditional technology using microbubbles is the method
      described in JP-A-2002-143885 of accelerating the biological
      activity, metabolism, and consequently growth of organisms.
      However, although the invention has significant advantageous in
      the field of cultivation of fish and shellfish, it does not
      disclose or suggest anything about collapsing microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] An example of the technology using the collapsing
      phenomenon of bubbles is a method of irradiating ultrasonic wave
      on bubbles. However, the method is extremely lower in efficiency
      because the bubbles for collapsing are generated by cavitational
      action of the ultrasonic wave itself, and has a problem of
      difficulty in commercialization because of its restricted
      functions. Most of the cavitation bubbles generated then contain
      steam therein and the bubbles are present only for an extremely
      limited period of microseconds, and thus, the method had a problem
      that it was not possible to use the effects of the gas present in
      bubbles and the electric charge formed at the gas-liquid interface
      collapsing bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0004] An object of the present invention, which was made in view
      of the circumstances described above, is to provide a method for
      collapsing microbubbles, physical and chemical actions obtained by
      collapsing microbubbles, a method for collapsing the microbubbles
      by discharge, a method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      ultrasonic wave, a method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      swirling current, a method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      using positive or negative pressure, and a method for collapsing
      the microbubbles by using the catalytic reaction of an oxidizer,
      as well as a method of decomposing microbes, viruses and the like,
      which were considered to be impossible by traditional technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The object of the present invention is accomplished by a
      method for collapsing microbubbles, characterized in that, in the
      step of the microbubbles having a diameter of 50 [mu]m or less
      floated in a solution decreasing gradually by natural dissolution
      of the gas contained in the microbubbles and disappearing finally,
      the microbubbles are disappeared by accelerating the speed of the
      microbubble size decrease by applying a stimulation to the
      microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The object of the present invention is also accomplished
      more effectively by forming an ultrahigh-pressure
      ultrahigh-temperature region inside in an adiabatic
      compression-like change of the microbubbles caused by decrease of
      the microbubbles size; the electric charge density at the
      interface of the microbubbles increases rapidly and a great amount
      of free radical species are released from the gas-liquid
      interface; free radical species such as active oxygen species for
      decomposition of the substances present inside the microbubbles or
      in the area surrounding the microbubbles are generated by
      collapsing the microbubbles; the method gives rise to a
      compositional change of the chemical substances dissolved or
      floated in the solution; or the method sterilizes microorganisms
      such as microbes, viruses, and others present in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Further, the object of the present invention is also
      accomplished more effectively by applying the stimulation is
      electric discharge in a container containing a
      microbubble-containing solution generated by using a discharger;
      the stimulation is ultrasonic wave irradiated into a container
      containing a microbubble-containing solution by an ultrasonicator;
      or the ultrasonicator is connected to the container between a
      microbubble-containing solution outlet port of a microbubble
      generator connected to container and an intake of the microbubble
      generator and the stimulation is given by continuous irradiation
      of ultrasonic wave into the container by the ultrasonicator.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] When a circulation pipe is connected to a container
      containing a microbubble-containing solution, the object of the
      present invention is also accomplished more effectively by
      applying the stimulation is compression, expansion and swirling
      current generated by circulating part of the
      microbubble-containing solution in the container by the
      circulation pump and making the solution path through an orifice
      or porous plate having a single or multiple holes installed in the
      circulation pipe; the circulation pump gives a positive pressure
      of 0.1 MPa or more to the discharge side; the circulation pump
      gives a negative pressure lower than the environmental pressure to
      the intake side; or when a circulation pipe is connected to the
      container containing a microbubble-containing solution, the
      stimulation is compression, expansion and swirling current
      generated by feeding the microbubble-containing solution in the
      container into the circulation pipe and making the solution path
      through an orifice or porous plate having a single or multiple
      holes installed in the circulation pipe.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The object of the present invention is achieved more
      effectively by applying the the stimulation is forcibly internal
      circulation, in the pipe for feeding the microbubble-containing
      solution generated by a microbubble generator to a container, of
      making the microbubble-containing solution discharged from the
      microbubble generator pass through a punching plate installed in
      the pipe, taken in part of the microbubble-containing solution
      from an intake installed between the punching plate and the
      container and feeding it into a pump, feeding the
      microbubble-containing solution into the pump, discharging it form
      an outlet port installed between the microbubble generator and the
      punching plate, and making it pass through the punching plate once
      again; or the pump gives a positive pressure of 0.1 MPa or more to
      the discharge side; the pump gives a negative pressure lower than
      the environmental pressure in the upstream pipe; the stimulation
      is a catalytic reaction generated by allowing an oxidant to react
      in the presence of a catalyst; the catalyst is copper and the
      oxidizer is ozone or hydrogen peroxide.<br>

      <b>BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0037] As shown in FIG. 1, as a physical property of microbubbles,
      microbubbles in distilled water have an electric potential of
      approximately -30 to -50 mV independently of the diameter of
      bubbles. Thus, for example in water, as shown in FIG. 2, a
      microbubble has a structure in which the bubble surface is
      surrounded by negative ions such as of OH&lt;-&gt; , which in turn
      are surrounded additionally by cations such as of H&lt;+&gt;
      (H3O&lt;+&gt; ).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In addition, a microbubble has a greater specific surface
      and a higher internal pressure than a normal bubble, because the
      surface tension acts more effectively. It is generally accepted
      academically that the internal pressure of a microbubble reaches
      as high as thousands of atmospheric pressures when it disappears.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Microbubbles are known to be normally lower rate of climb
      than normal bubbles and superior in gas dissolving capacity
      (natural dissolution). Thus, normal bubbles, when generated in
      water, rising toward the liquid surface direction and burst at the
      liquid surface, while microbubbles rising more slowly than normal
      bubbles and have a superior dissolving capacity, thus resulting in
      gradual decrease in the bubble diameter and finally disappearance
      of the bubbles. FIG. 3 shows the results of measuring the time
      until the microbubble decreases of its size and finally
      disappears. The microbubble having a smaller bubble diameter shows
      a shorter time of decrease of microbubble size and disappearance
      of the microbubble by natural dissolution. The maximum driving
      force for dissolving the gas in microbubbles is the
      self-compression effect by surface tension. The pressure buildup
      inside the microbubble with respect to environmental pressure can
      be estimated by the Young-Laplace's Formula.<br>
      [Delta]P=4[sigma]/D (Formula 1)<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In the Formula, [Delta]P represents the degree of pressure
      buildup; [sigma], surface tension, and D, bubble diameter. In
      distilled water at room temperature, the pressure buildup is
      approximately 0.3 atmospheric pressure in a microbubble having a
      diameter of 10 [mu]m and approximately 3 atmospheric pressures in
      the bubble having a diameter of 1 [mu]m. The gas in a
      self-compressed bubble, which behaves in water according to the
      Henry's law in gas phase, dissolves efficiently in ambient water.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] On the other hand, the speed of the microbubble size
      decrease by natural dissolution rises by application of a physical
      stimulation such as discharge, ultrasonic wave, or swirling
      current to the microbubble, and thus, the microbubble is adiabatic
      compression and disappears (collapsing). Adiabatic compression of
      the microbubble then gives rise to an extreme reaction field at
      ultrahigh temperature and ultrahigh pressure when the microbubble
      disappears.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As described above, an bubble present in water is charged
      negatively, but there are saturated electric charges formed at the
      gas-liquid interface according to environmental conditions such as
      pH, which can be observed by the zeta potential of the
      microbubble. The electric charges not due to electrolytic ions and
      others in water, but are based on the structural factor of water
      itself. That is, the electric charges are generated by interfacial
      adsorption of OH&lt;-&gt; and H&lt;+&gt; ions, based on the
      difference between the hydrogen-bonded network structure at the
      gas-liquid interface and the structure of bulk. The structure
      formed also has an action to suppress thermal molecular movement,
      and thus, it takes time of about several seconds to go back to the
      equilibrium condition after the electric charge density fluctuates<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Decrease of the bubble size by natural dissolution of the
      microbubble is accompanied with decrease in the surface area of
      gas-liquid interface. The surface area of the gas-liquid interface
      decreases more rapidly as the bubble becomes smaller, as shown in
      FIG. 3. When the speed of the decrease in the surface area of
      gas-liquid interface is lower, the electric charge density at the
      gas-liquid interface remains in the condition almost in
      equilibrium. However, as shown in FIG. 4, when the bubble diameter
      decreases to 10 [mu]m or less, dissipation of electric charge
      cannot catch up the speed of the size decrease, which is observed
      as an increase in zeta potential associated with deviation from
      equilibrium. However, the decrease in the surface area of
      gas-liquid interface by natural dissolution is not so rapid, and
      the value of electric charge density remains up to several times
      larger than that in equilibrium, even at the point immediately
      before disappearance.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In contrast, during the collapsing microbubbles according
      to the present invention, the speed of the decrease in the surface
      area of gas-liquid interface is very high, and the electric charge
      remains as it is without dissipation and deviates from
      equilibrium, resulting in generation of a region extremely higher
      in electric charge density. When the bubble having a diameter of
      20 [mu]m decreases into the microbubble of 0.5 [mu]m or less by
      collapsing, the electric charge density rises to a value as high
      as 1,000 times larger than that in equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The extremely high-density electric charge formed by
      collapsing is in a non-equilibrium condition and extremely
      instable, and the system returns back to a stable state in a
      phenomenon different from simple dissipation. Thus, an extremely
      large potential gradient is formed between the bubble interface
      and its surrounding area in the collapsing process, and the
      equilibrium of the electric charge condition is reestablished by
      electron transfer, for example, by discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] It means generation of an extremely high-density energy
      field, and when the collapsing is performed in water, it is
      accompanied with generation of free radical species by
      decomposition of ambient water molecules. In addition, because the
      electric charge carriers are OH&lt;-&gt; and H&lt;+&gt; , free
      radical species such as .OH and .H are formed by neutralization of
      electric charges by discharge.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The free radical species, which are very highly reactive,
      react with various compounds dissolved or suspended in solution,
      changing composition or decomposing the compounds in solution.
      Because an extreme reaction field at ultrahigh temperature and
      ultrahigh pressure is formed during collapsing, it becomes
      possible to sterilize microorganisms such as microbes and viruses
      and decompose aromatic compounds such as phenol, although it was
      hitherto regarded as impossible. Examples of the substances
      decomposed by collapsing include almost all organic compounds,
      inorganic compounds such as FeSO4, CuNO3, AgNO3, and MnO2;
      dioxins, PCBs, chlorofluorocarbons, microbes, viruses, and the
      like.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Hereinafter, the method for collapsing the microbubbles
      will be described.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 5 is a side view illustrating an apparatus for
      collapsing the microbubbles by discharge. The microbubble
      generator 3 takes in the solution in a container 1 though an
      intake 31; a gas is injected into the microbubble generator 3
      through an injection port (not shown in the Figure) for injecting
      a gas for generating microbubble and mixed with the solution taken
      in through the intake 31; and the microbubbles generated in the
      microbubble generator 3 are fed back into the container 1 through
      a microbubble-containing solution outlet 32. In this way,
      microbubbles are generated in the container 1. An anode 21 and a
      cathode 22 are placed in the container 1, and the anode 21 and the
      cathode 22 are connected to a discharger 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] First, microbubbles are generated in the container 1
      containing a solution by using the microbubble generator 3. The
      solution in the container 1 used for generation of microbubbles is
      preferably water (distilled water, tap water, or the like),
      seawater, or the like; but an organic solvent such as oil,
      alcohol, acetone, toluene, or petroleum oil may also be used. In
      the present specification, water is used as the solution for
      convenience in description, but the present invention is not
      limited thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The solution is discharged in the container 1 by using the
      discharger 2. A saturation bubble concentration of microbubbles in
      the container 1 is preferably 50% or more, for more effective
      collapsing during the underwater discharge. In addition, the
      voltage of the underwater discharge is preferably 2,000 to 3,000
      V. The stimulation of underwater discharge raises the speed of
      microbubble size decrease by natural dissolution of the
      microbubbles in water and results in collapsing (disappearance)
      the bubbles. Extreme reaction fields are formed and free radicals
      such as .OH and .H are formed by decomposition of water,
      simultaneously with disappearance of microbubbles, and the
      substances and others present in water are decomposed.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The gas used for generation of microbubbles in the
      microbubble generator 3 is not particularly limited, and may be;
      or alternatively, the microbubbles may be generated with ozone or
      oxygen. Microbubbles generated with oxygen or ozone higher in
      oxidative potential results in generation of a greater number of
      free radical species during collapsing, and give an action to
      decompose hazardous substances and others superior both in the
      quantitative and qualitative points as well as a sterilizing
      action. Alternatively, the microbubbles may be generated after
      oxygen or ozone is previously contained in the solution in the
      container.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Hereinafter, a method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      ultrasonication will be described. Description on the devices the
      same as those described in the method for collapsing the
      microbubbles by discharge will be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 6 is a side view illustrating an apparatus for
      collapsing the microbubbles by ultrasonic wave. A microbubble
      generator 3 takes in the solution in a container 1 though an
      intake 31; a gas injected into the microbubble generator 3 through
      an injection port (not shown in the Figure) for injecting a gas
      for generating microbubble and mixed with the solution taken in
      through the intake 31; and the microbubbles generated in the
      microbubble generator 3 are fed back into the container 1 through
      a microbubble-containing solution outlet 32. In this way,
      microbubbles are generated in the container 1. An ultrasonicator 4
      is installed on the container 1. The installation site of the
      ultrasonicator 4 is not particularly limited, but preferably
      between the intake 31 and the microbubble-containing solution
      outlet 32, for more efficient collapsing the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Microbubbles are generated in the container 1 containing
      water by using the microbubble generator 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Then, ultrasonic wave is irradiated on the
      microbubble-containing water in the container 1 by using the
      ultrasonicator 4. During collapsing the microbubbles by ultrasonic
      wave irradiation, the saturation bubble concentration of
      microbubbles in the container 1 is preferably 50%. or more, for
      more effective collapsing the microbubbles. Ultrasonic wave
      irradiation at a saturation bubble concentration of 50% or more
      leads to more efficient collapsing. The irradiation frequency of
      the ultrasonic wave is preferably 20 kHz to 1 MHz; and the
      exposure time of ultrasonic wave is preferably 30 seconds or less,
      but the irradiation may be continued for an extended period of
      time.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In the conventional methods of destructing hazardous
      substances and others by ultrasonic wave, which were simple
      irradiation of ultrasonic wave on normal water, lower in the
      efficiency of generating free radicals by collapsing, and thus had
      an insufficient action, it was not possible to decompose aromatic
      compounds such as phenol; but it became possible to destruct
      microbes,viruses, and aromatic compounds such as phenol, which
      were not possible hitherto, by collapsing the microbubbles by
      irradiating ultrasonic wave on the microbubbles as in the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Hereinafter, a method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      swirling current will be described. Description on the devices the
      same as those in the method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      discharge pressure and the method for collapsing the microbubbles
      by ultrasonication will be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 7 is a side view illustrating an apparatus for
      collapsing the microbubbles by swirling current. A microbubble
      generator 3 takes in the solution in a container 1 though an
      intake 31; a gas injected into the microbubble generator 3 through
      an injection port (not shown in the Figure) for injecting a gas
      for generating microbubble and mixed with the solution taken in
      through the intake 31; and the microbubbles generated in the
      microbubble generator 3 are fed back into the container 1 through
      a microbubble-containing solution outlet 32. In this way,
      microbubbles are generated in the container 1. A circulation pump
      5 is connected to the container 1 for partial circulation of the
      microbubble-containing solution in the container 1, and an orifice
      having multiple holes (porous plate) 6 is placed in the pipe
      (circulation pipe) which is connected to the circulation pump 5 at
      one end and to the container 1 at the other end. Part of the
      microbubble-containing solution poured out of the circulation pipe
      is re-circulated by the circulation pump and an swirling current
      is formed during passage through the orifice (porous plate) 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] First, microbubbles are generated in the container 1
      containing water by using the microbubble generator 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The microbubble-containing water is then fed into the
      circulation pump 5 for partial circulation. The
      microbubble-containing water is further fed by the circulation
      pump 5 to the orifice (porous plate) 6, and an swirling current is
      formed in the pipe downstream thereof. The microbubbles are
      crushed by expansion or compression of the microbubbles during
      passage and by the electric swirling current generated by the
      swirl of electrically charged microbubbles due to the swirling
      current generated in the pipe. The positions of the circulation
      pump 5 and the orifice (porous plate) 6 on the channel may be
      altered.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Although only one orifice (porous plate) 6 is shown in FIG.
      7, multiple orifices maybe installed, and the circulation pump 5
      may be eliminated as needed. Alternatively, the orifice 6 may be
      replaced with a punching plate. When a circulation pump 5 is
      installed, the pressure (positive pressure) of compressing the
      solution toward the orifice (porous plate) 6 is preferably 0.1 MPa
      or more. A positive pressure of less than 0.1 MPa may lead to
      insufficient eddy current generation. In addition, the pump 5
      gives a negative pressure lower than the environmental pressure in
      the upstream pipe.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 8 is a side view illustrating a method for collapsing
      by using positive or negative pressure; and FIG. 9 is a partially
      magnified drawing of the area of a punching plate 10 and a pump 9
      (the arrow in FIG. 9 indicates the direction of the flow of
      microbubble-containing solution). Description on the devices the
      same as those described above will be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] As shown in FIG. 8, it is an apparatus for collapsing of
      microbubbles by draining the microbubble-containing water
      discharged from a microbubble generator 3 through a punching plate
      10. The punching plate 10 is placed between two
      microbubble-containing solution outlets 32 (between the container
      1 and the microbubble generator 3). An intake 11 for compressing
      the microbubble-containing solution to a pump 9 is formed between
      the punching plate 10 and the container 1 in the
      microbubble-containing solution outlet 32. Part of the
      microbubble-containing solution taken in into the intake 11 is fed
      to the pump 9 and then further forward by the pressure of the pump
      9. The microbubble-containing solution is fed by the pump 9 via an
      outlet port 12 formed between the microbubble generator 3 and the
      punching plate 10 into the microbubble-containing solution outlet
      32, and passes through the punching plate 10 once again. Thus, it
      is possible to crush the microbubbles by performing internal
      circulation forcibly by the pump 9 and increasing the swirling
      current drastically during passage through the punching plate 10.
      The positive pressure of the pump 9 is preferably adjusted to 0.1
      MPa or more for forcibly internal circulation of the
      microbubble-containing solution in the microbubble-containing
      solution outlet 32. A positive pressure of pump 9 of less than 0.1
      MPa results in inefficient internal circulation. The pump 9 also
      give a negative pressure lower than the environmental pressure in
      the intake side (intake 11). The positive pressure is a pressure
      higher than the environmental pressure, i.e., a pressure of the
      pump 9 feeding the solution, while the negative pressure is a
      pressure lower than the environmental pressure, i.e., a pressure
      generated when the pump 9 takes in the solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Multiple punching plates 10 may be installed according to
      application, and multiple pumps 9 may be installed as needed in
      the method for collapsing the microbubbles shown in FIGS. 8 and 9.
      In addition, for example, a check valve may be installed in the
      microbubble-containing solution outlet 32 as needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Hereinafter, a method for collapsing the microbubbles by
      using the catalytic action of an oxidizer during its reaction.
      Description on the devices the same as those described above will
      be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 10 is a side view illustrating an apparatus for
      collapsing the microbubbles by using the catalytic action of an
      oxidizer during its reaction. A microbubble generator 3 takes in
      the solution in a container 1 though an intake 31; a gas injected
      into the microbubble generator 3 through an injection port (not
      shown in the Figure) for injecting a gas for generating
      microbubble and mixed with the solution taken in through the
      intake 31; and the microbubbles generated in the microbubble
      generator 3 are fed back into the container 1 through a
      microbubble-containing solution outlet 32. In this way,
      microbubbles are generated in the container 1. An
      oxidizer-supplying unit 7 is connected to the container 1, and an
      oxidizer is supplied therefrom into the container 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Microbubbles are generated in the container 1 containing
      water by using the microbubble generator 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Then, a catalyst is added to the container 1. Favorable
      examples of the catalysts include various catalysts known in the
      art, including metal catalysts such as copper, palladium, iron,
      vanadium, tin, titanium, zirconium, platinum, manganese, cobalt,
      nickel, rubidium, rhodium, and zinc; these catalysts may be used
      alone or in combination of two or more; and copper is more
      preferable. The microbubbles may be generated after addition of
      the catalyst into the container 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] An oxidizer is supplied from the oxidizer-supplying unit 7.
      The oxidizer is not particularly limited, and any one of various
      known oxidizers such as ozone, hydrogen peroxide, sodium
      hypochlorite, manganese dioxide, sulfuric acid, nitric acid,
      potassium permanganate, copper chloride, and silver oxide may be
      used favorably; these oxidizers may be used alone or in
      combination of two or more; and in particular, ozone and hydrogen
      peroxide are more preferable.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Supply of an oxidizer into the container 1 results in
      generation of very high oxidative radicals in the reaction between
      the oxidizer and the catalyst. The radicals accelerate collapsing
      the microbubbles by their collision to the microbubbles. Although
      it is possible to decompose hazardous substances contained in
      water in the reaction between the oxidizer and the catalyst, it
      became possible to decompose hazardous substances more efficiently
      and also to decompose and sterilize microorganisms such as
      microbes and viruses, by the collapsing the microbubbles by using
      the catalytic action associated with the reaction between the
      oxidizer and the catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Hereinafter, the methods for collapsing the microbubbles
      will be described with reference to Examples, but it should be
      understood that the present invention is not restricted thereby.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      <b> </b><b> Example 1</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0073] 10 L of phenol-containing water was placed in the container
      1 shown in FIG. 5. Microbubbles are generated in the microbubble
      generator 3 by using ozone as the gas for preparation of
      microbubbles and supplied into the water in the container 1, to
      give microbubble-containing water. The microbubbles were formed
      continuously, while the saturation bubble concentration of
      microbubbles in the container is controlled to 1 to 50% or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Then, the water was electrically discharged at a voltage of
      2,400 V ten times per 10 minutes by the discharger 2, for
      collapsing the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Analysis of the water during collapsing by ESR gave the
      spectrum shown in FIG. 11, confirming the presence of free radical
      species therein. The ESR spectrum shown in FIG. 11 is determined,
      as a spin-trapping agent 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO)
      is added to the sample. The results demonstrated generation of
      free radicals.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] After the collapsing the microbubbles, phenol had been
      decomposed completely.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0077] 10 L of phenol-containing water was placed in the container
      1 shown in FIG. 6. Microbubbles are generated in the microbubble
      generator 3 by using ozone as the gas for preparation of
      microbubbles and supplied into the water in the container 1, to
      give microbubble-containing water. Microbubbles were formed
      continuously, while the saturation bubble concentration of
      microbubbles in the container was controlled to 1 to 50% or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Then, the microbubbles are crushed by irradiation of an
      ultrasonic wave at an irradiation frequency of 200 kHz by the
      ultrasonicator 4 for 10 minutes. ESR spectral analysis of the
      water during collapsing similar to that in Example 1 gave an ESR
      spectrum similar to that shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Phenol had been decomposed completely after the collapsing
      the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0080] 10 L of phenol-containing water was placed in the container
      1 shown in FIG. 7. Microbubbles are generated in the microbubble
      generator 3 by using ozone as the gas for preparation of
      microbubbles and supplied into the water in the container 1, to
      give microbubble-containing water. Microbubbles were formed
      continuously, while the saturation bubble concentration of
      microbubbles in the container was controlled to 1 to 50% or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Then, the microbubble-containing water in the container 1
      was circulated partially, and part of the microbubble-containing
      water was introduced into the circulation pipe connected to the
      circulation pump 5. The microbubble-containing water introduced
      into the circulation pump 5 was fed to the orifice (porous plate)
      6 at a positive pressure of 0.3 MPa, allowing the microbubbles
      crushed by the swirling current generated there.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] ESR spectral analysis of the water during collapsing
      similar to that in Example 1 gave an ESR spectrum similar to that
      shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Phenol had been decomposed completely after the collapsing
      the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0084] 10 L of phenol-containing water was placed in the container
      1 shown in FIG. 8. Microbubbles are generated in the microbubble
      generator 3 by using ozone as the gas for preparation of
      microbubbles and supplied into the water in the container 1, to
      give microbubble-containing water. Microbubbles were formed
      continuously, while the saturation bubble concentration of
      microbubbles in the container was controlled to 1 to 50% or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Then, part of the microbubble-containing water discharged
      from the microbubble generator 3 and passing out of the punching
      plate 10 was taken in through the intake 11 by operation of the
      pump 9 and fed by the pump 9 to the discharge side, for forcibly
      internal circulation thereof in the microbubble-containing
      solution outlet 32. The positive pressure of the pump 9 then was
      0.5 MPa. The microbubble-containing water fed by the pump 9 was
      made to pass through the punching plate 10 once again via the
      outlet port 12. Such an internal circulation raised the
      swirling-current efficiency drastically and was effective in
      collapsing the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] ESR spectrum analysis of the water during collapsing
      similar to that in Example 1 gave an ESR spectrum similar to that
      shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Phenol had been decomposed completely after the collapsing
      the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0088] 10 L of phenol-containing water was placed in the container
      1 shown in FIG. 10. Microbubbles are generated in the microbubble

      microbubbles and supplied into the water in the container 1, to
      give microbubble-containing water. Microbubbles were formed
      continuously, while the saturation bubble concentration of
      microbubbles in the container was controlled to 1 to 50% or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Then, 5 g of a powdery copper catalyst was placed in the
      container 1, and an ozone gas was supplied from the
      oxidizer-supplying unit 7 into the container 1. The amount of the
      ozone gas supplied was 1 g. The microbubbles were crushed by the
      catalytic reaction associated with the reaction between the ozone
      gas and the copper catalyst when the ozone gas was supplied.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] ESR spectrum analysis of the water during collapsing
      similar to that in Example 1 gave an ESR spectrum similar to that
      shown in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Phenol had been decomposed completely after the collapsing
      the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>ADVANTAGEOUS EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><b> </b><br>
      [0092] Collapsing the microbubbles by the method according to the
      present invention lead to increase in the speed of microbubbles
      size decrease due to utilization of a stimulation (discharge,
      ultrasonic wave, swirling current, positive and negative pressure,
      or the catalytic reaction associated with the reaction of
      oxidizer, or the like), disappearance of microbubbles and
      generation of active oxygen species and free radical species for
      decomposition of substances present inside the microbubbles or in
      the area surrounding the microbubbles, and compositional change
      thereby of the chemical substances dissolved or floated in water;
      and thus, it became possible to sterilize microorganisms such as
      microbes, viruses, and others present in solution and decompose
      aromatic compounds such as phenol, which was difficult in the
      past, and thus, to decompose almost all hazardous substances and
      others.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</b><br>
