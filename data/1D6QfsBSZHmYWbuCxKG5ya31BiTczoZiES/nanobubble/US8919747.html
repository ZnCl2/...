      Inventors: Satoshi Anzai, Susumu Nishi<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an art of a super-micro bubble
      generation device which can generate super-micro bubbles in
      liquid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In recent years, the art of utilizing super-micro bubbles of
      several hundred nm to several dozen µm in size (diameter) has been
      attracting attention. The super-micro bubbles are used in liquid
      such as tap water, the water of lakes and marshes or rivers, or
      marine water or the like. The said super-micro bubbles have the
      property that the surface areas thereof are very large. The said
      super-micro bubbles also have physiochemical property such as
      self-pressure effect. Technology of utilizing the characteristics
      of such micro bubbles in effluent purification, purification,
      physical care in the bathtub, and the like has been developing.<br>
      <br>
      One method for generating the super-micro bubbles having the said
      properties has become public knowledge. That method has steps of,
      spinning around motor in liquid; raising the flow rate by pump
      pressure; inhaling the air; and stirring. As such, bubbles are
      generated. The generated bubbles are then torn into super-micro
      bubbles by a rotating wing or a cutting tool. Moreover, another
      method for generating the super-micro bubbles has also become
      public knowledge. In that method, a liquid jetting nozzle is
      disposed around an air jetting nozzle, and bubbles jetted from the
      air jetting nozzle are torn into super-micro bubbles by the force
      of jet flow of the liquid jetting nozzle. Furthermore, another
      method for generating the super-micro bubbles has also become
      public knowledge. In that method, bubbles are generated by
      stirring, and the generated bubbles go through the eyes of a mesh
      membrane so as to fine down to super-micro bubbles (for example,
      see Patent Literature 1).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      <b>Problems to be Solved by the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      By using the conventional method of spinning around motor in
      liquid; raising the flow rate by pump pressure; inhaling the air;
      stirring; and tearing into super-micro bubbles by the rotating
      wing or the cutting tool, it is able to generate large amount of
      super-micro bubbles. However, fast rotation of the rotating wing
      or the cutting tool will cause corrosion due to cavitation or
      abrasion of devices. These will lead to significant damage, and
      thus, durability will become a problem. When the process liquid,
      discharged water, or the lakes and marshes or rivers, or marine
      water or the like with very poor quality is used, deterioration
      will proceed because the liquid directly contact to the device.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, when the method of which the generated bubbles go
      through the eyes of the mesh membrane so as to fine down to
      super-micro bubbles is applied, the mesh membrane will become
      depleted in the long run since the mesh membrane is made of
      organic substance. Moreover, when the mesh membrane is provided at
      right angle with liquid surface, the generated super-micro bubbles
      will overlap with other super-micro bubbles and will coalesce in a
      mass bubble. To avoid this, the mesh membrane should be provided
      parallel to the liquid surface, that is, installation method is
      limited.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, when the method of which the liquid jetting nozzle is
      disposed around the air jetting nozzle and bubbles jetted from the
      air jetting nozzle are torn into super-micro bubbles by the force
      of jet flow of the liquid jetting nozzle is applied, it is
      difficult to stabilize the particle size because there is
      limitation in pore size of the nozzle.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, considering the above-mentioned problems, the object of
      the present invention is to provide a super-micro bubble
      generation device which can generate super-micro bubbles using a
      simple method and can be installed by a method which provides a
      higher degree of freedom of installation to enable the device to
      be designed so as to be suitable for a place where the device is
      to be installed and to meet functional requirements.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Means for Solving the Problems</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The above-mentioned problems are solved by the following means.<br>
      <br>
      Briefly stated, a super-micro bubble generation device of the
      present invention comprises: a compressor for delivering gas under
      pressure, and a bubble generation medium for discharging the gas,
      which has been delivered under pressure, as super-micro bubbles
      into liquid, wherein the said bubble generation medium consists of
      a high-density compound which is an electrically conductive
      substance. The said super-micro bubble generation device further
      comprises a liquid jetting device for jetting liquid in the
      direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in which
      the bubble generation medium discharges the super-micro bubbles,
      said liquid being the same kind of liquid as the liquid into which
      the super-micro bubbles are discharged.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the super-micro bubble generation device of the
      present invention, the said bubble generation medium is formed
      into a conical shape. The gas from the said compressor passes
      through the said bubble generation medium from a bottom face of
      the cone toward a vertex, wherein the said liquid being the same
      kind of liquid as the liquid into which the super-micro bubbles
      are discharged is jetted toward the vertex of the cone of the said
      bubble generation medium by the said liquid jetting device.<br>
      <br>
      With regard to the super-micro bubble generation device of the
      present invention, an outer periphery of the said bubble
      generation medium is covered with a covering material, wherein the
      said covering material has the property of lowering the contact
      angle at which the liquid meets the surface of the said covering
      material.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Effect of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention constructed as the above brings the
      following effects.<br>
      <br>
      According to the super-micro bubble generation device of the
      present invention, the bubble generation medium consisting of the
      high-density compound would not deteriorate due to expansion and
      contraction since the high-density compound is a solid substance
      which does not have flexibility. Also, the high-density compound
      would not become eroded due to temporal change since it is made of
      inorganic material. Thus, the super-micro bubble generation device
      is prevented from damage and degradation. Also, because the
      generated super-micro bubbles separates from the bubble generation
      medium as soon as they are generated, they would not coalesce in a
      mass bubble. Thus, the super-micro bubbles can be generated by
      using a simple method. Also, the super-micro bubble generation
      device can be installed by a method which provides a higher degree
      of freedom of installation to enable the device to be designed so
      as to be suitable for a place where the device is to be installed
      and to meet functional requirements. Moreover, since the said
      high-density compound is an electrically conductive substance,
      negatively charged ions tend to range on the surface of the
      high-density compound. The bubbles generated from the said bubble
      generation medium become negatively charged by receiving the
      negatively charged ions from the surface of the high-density
      compound. The bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble since
      each bubble act repulsively due to this negative electric charge.<br>
      <br>
      According to the super-micro bubble generation device of the
      present invention, the liquid is jetted toward the vertex of the
      cone. Then, the liquid will flow along the curved surface of the
      cone. In this way, it is able to make the size of the injection
      hole smaller, and thus, lower pressure is needed for jetting the
      liquid. The generated super-micro bubbles separate from the bubble
      generation medium as soon as they are generated, and thus, the
      super-micro bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble. As just
      described, the super-micro bubbles can be generated by using a
      simple method. Also, the super-micro bubble generation device can
      be installed by a method which provides a higher degree of freedom
      of installation to enable the device to be designed so as to be
      suitable for a place where the device is to be installed and to
      meet functional requirements. Also, since the said high-density
      compound is an electrically conductive substance, bubbles
      generated from the bubble generation medium are negatively
      charged. The bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble since
      each bubble act repulsively due to this negative electric charge.<br>
      <br>
      According to the super-micro bubble generation device of the
      present invention, the covering material has the property that
      contact angle at which the liquid meets the surface of the
      covering material is low. Accordingly, the surrounding liquid is
      attracted to the covering material. Thus, a thin liquid film is
      formed between the super-micro bubbles and the covering material.
      This makes it easy to separate the super-micro bubbles from the
      bubble generation medium. Thus, the super-micro bubbles would not
      coalesce in a mass bubble. Moreover, there is an effect of
      separating the super-micro bubbles by liquid flow by jetting
      liquid toward the bubble generation medium coated with the
      covering material from the liquid jetting device. There is also an
      effect of separating the super-micro bubbles by making the contact
      angle, at which the liquid interface meets the surface of the
      covering material, smaller. Combination of these effects makes it
      easy to separate super-micro bubbles.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>THE MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Next, explanation will be given on the mode for carrying out the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIGS. 1(a) and (b), a super-micro bubble generation
      device 1 is provided with a compressor 2 as a compression machine
      for delivering gas under pressure, and also with a bubble
      generation medium 3 for discharging the gas, which has been
      delivered under pressure, as super-micro bubbles into liquid. The
      super-micro bubble generation device 1 is also provided with a
      liquid jetting device 4 for jetting liquid being the same kind of
      liquid as the liquid into which the super-micro bubbles are
      discharged.<br>
      <br>
      The compressor 2 is a device for delivering gas under pressure
      into an internal space 3a of the bubble generation medium 3
      through the intermediary of a gas supply line 11. The gas
      delivered under pressure by the compressor 2 is not limited to
      air. For example, the gas may be ozone gas or nitrogen gas. And
      the said liquid may be such as fresh water or sea water of rivers
      or lakes, water, or industrial wastewater. Furthermore, the said
      liquid also may be solvent such as pharmaceutical products. In
      that case, the pharmaceutical products are stirred or mixed by
      using the said super-micro bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      The gas delivered under pressure by the compressor 2 passes
      through the gas supply line 11, and then the gas will be delivered
      under pressure into the internal space 3a of the bubble generation
      medium 3. The bubble generation medium 3 consists of a
      high-density compound whose solid texture is made of molecular
      structure consisting of ionic bonds. Moreover, the said
      high-density compound is an electrically conductive substance, and
      thus, bubbles generated from the bubble generation medium 3 are
      negatively charged. In other words, the super-micro bubbles are
      negatively charged by addition of free electrons on passing
      through the bubble generation medium 3, which is the electrically
      conductive substance. The bubbles would not coalesce in a mass
      bubble since each bubble act repulsively due to this negative
      electric charge. For instance, the said electrically conductive
      substance is made of carbon-based material.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 1(b), the bubble generation medium 3 is
      porous having a lot of tiny pores 3b of several µm to several
      dozen µm in diameter. Because of this constitution, the gas
      delivered under pressure by the compressor 2 passes through the
      said pores 3b. In other words, the super-micro bubbles are
      discharged from the pores 3b into liquid by gas tension of the gas
      delivered under pressure from compressor 2. Because of this
      constitution, the bubble generation medium 3 consisting of the
      high-density compound would not deteriorate due to expansion and
      contraction since the high-density compound is a solid substance
      which does not have flexibility. Also, the high-density compound
      would not become eroded due to temporal change since it is made of
      inorganic material. Thus, the super-micro bubble generation device
      1 is prevented from damage and degradation.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the bubble generation medium 3 consisting of the
      high-density compound would not become worn even though liquid
      flow injected from the liquid jetting device 4 hits the
      high-density compound because it is activated. Thus, durability of
      the bubble generation medium 3 has been improved.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid jetting device 4 is a device for separating super-micro
      bubbles generated from a surface site 3c of the bubble generation
      medium 3 by the liquid flow. The liquid jetting device 4 jets
      liquid being the same kind of liquid as the liquid into which the
      super-micro bubbles are discharged. Because of this constitution,
      the super-micro bubbles can be separated by the liquid flow
      without influencing fluid composition. Moreover, it is able to
      prevent different kind of liquid being mixed into the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2(a), the said super-micro bubbles are discharged
      from the tiny pores 3b. In that split second, as shown in FIG.
      2(b), the liquid delivered under pressure by the liquid jetting
      device 4 rapidly passes through the surface site 3c, from where
      the super-micro bubbles are discharged, so as to separate the
      super-micro bubbles from the surface site 3c.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, as shown in FIG. 2(c), the super-micro bubbles discharged
      from the surface site 3c separately move around in the liquid
      without coalescing with subsequently generated super-micro bubbles
      or other super-micro bubbles discharged from surrounding pores 3b.
      Because of this constitution, super-micro bubbles can be generated
      by using a simple method. Moreover, the super-micro bubble
      generation device 1 can be installed by a method which provides a
      higher degree of freedom of installation to enable the device to
      be designed so as to be suitable for a place where the device is
      to be installed and to meet functional requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the bubble generation medium 3 may be coated with a coating
      material 5 which is a covering material. The coating material 5 is
      an inorganic material which has the property that contact angle at
      which the liquid interface meets the surface of the coating
      material 5 is low (for example, if the liquid is water, the
      coating material 5 may be made of superhydrophilic material). In
      this embodiment, the coating material 5 is made of silica glass.
      The contact angle signifies wetting force of materials. The value
      of wetting force will rise as contact angle becomes lower.
      However, the coating material 5 is not limited to material which
      is made of silica glass.<br>
      <br>
      The coating material 5 is applied to the surface site 3c of the
      bubble generation medium 3 so as to cover its surface. The silica
      glass that makes up the coating material 5 has the property of
      lowering the contact angle at which the liquid interface meets the
      surface of the coating material 5, and thus the coating material 5
      attracts surrounding liquid instead of shedding. In other words,
      the liquid spreads on the surface of the coating material 5 as
      thin film rather than forming droplets. Also, the coating material
      5 is porous having a lot of tiny pores 5a of several µm to several
      dozen µm in diameter. The pores 5a are communicated with the pores
      3b of the bubble generation medium 3.<br>
      <br>
      As a result, as shown in FIG. 3, the said super-micro bubbles are
      discharged from the pores 5a of the coating material 5 into liquid
      after passing through the pores 3b of the bubble generation medium
      3. Here, the coating material 5 has the property that contact
      angle at which the liquid interface meets the surface of the
      coating material 5 is low. Because of this, the wetting force of
      the coating material 5 is high. The surrounding liquid is
      attracted to the coating material 5. Thus, a thin liquid film is
      formed between the super-micro bubbles and the coating material 5.
      This makes it easy to separate the super-micro bubbles from the
      bubble generation medium 3. Thus, the super-micro bubbles would
      not coalesce in a mass bubble.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, there is an effect of separating the super-micro bubbles
      by liquid flow by jetting liquid toward the bubble generation
      medium 3 coated with the coating material 5 from the liquid
      jetting device 4. There is also an effect of separating the
      super-micro bubbles by making the contact angle, at which the
      liquid interface meets the surface of the coating material 5,
      smaller. Combination of these effects makes it easy to separate
      super-micro bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 4(a), the super-micro bubbles are generated from
      the pores 5a after passing through the pores 3b. The super-micro
      bubbles are easily separated from the surface of the coating
      material 5 because the thin liquid film is formed on the surface
      of the coating material 5 whereby the super-micro bubbles are
      generated. In other words, the super-micro bubbles can be easily
      separated because the liquid film lies between the super-micro
      bubbles and the coating material 5.<br>
      <br>
      Also, as shown in FIG. 4(b), the super-micro bubbles are generated
      from the pores 5a. In that split second, the liquid delivered
      under pressure by the liquid jetting device 4 rapidly passes
      through the surface of the coating material 5. Thus, the
      super-micro bubbles are separated from the surface site 3c of the
      bubble generation medium 3.<br>
      <br>
      For this reason, as shown in FIG. 4(c), the super-micro bubbles
      which dwell on the surface of the coating material 5 will
      separately move around in the liquid without coalescing with
      subsequently generated super-micro bubbles or other super-micro
      bubbles discharged from surrounding pores 5a. Because of this
      constitution, the super-micro bubbles can be generated by using a
      simple method. Also, the super-micro bubble generation device 1
      can be installed by a method which provides a higher degree of
      freedom of installation to enable the device to be designed so as
      to be suitable for a place where the device is to be installed and
      to meet functional requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Next, explanation will be given on the configuration of the bubble
      generation medium 3.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 5(a), the bubble generation medium 3 is formed
      into a tabular shape. The super-micro bubbles are generated from
      the surface site 3c, whose plate area is wider than any other
      plate face of the bubble generation medium 3. Because the bubble
      generation medium 3 is formed into a tabular shape with wide
      surface area, the super-micro bubbles can be generated
      effectively. Also, because the super-micro bubbles separates from
      the bubble generation medium 3 as soon as they are generated, they
      would not coalesce in a mass bubble.<br>
      <br>
      Also, the liquid jetting device 4 is a device for jetting liquid
      in the direction substantially perpendicular to the direction in
      which the bubble generation medium 3 discharges the super-micro
      bubbles, that is, jetting liquid in the direction parallel to the
      surface site 3c, which is the widest of all of plate faces of the
      generation medium 3. The direction of jetting liquid is sufficient
      if the said direction is substantially perpendicular to the
      direction in which the super-micro bubbles are discharged, that
      is, the said direction may be any direction shown in FIG. 5(a) as
      arrow a, arrow b, arrow c, or arrow d. For example, the liquid
      jetting device 4 has an injection hole 4a for jetting liquid flow
      toward the surface site 3c of the plate face of the bubble
      generation medium 3. The said liquid flow, whose width is as same
      as that of the surface site 3c of the plate face of the bubble
      generation medium 3, is jetted in the direction parallel to the
      plate face.<br>
      <br>
      Because of this constitution, as shown in FIG. 2, the generated
      super-micro bubbles separate from the bubble generation medium 3
      as soon as they are generated, and thus, the super-micro bubbles
      would not coalesce in a mass bubble. As just described, the
      super-micro bubbles can be generated by using a simple method.
      Also, the super-micro bubble generation device 1 can be installed
      by a method which provides a higher degree of freedom of
      installation to enable the device to be designed so as to be
      suitable for a place where the device is to be installed and to
      meet functional requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 5(b), the super-micro bubble generation
      device 1 in accordance with another embodiment is formed into a
      hollow polygonal shape. In this embodiment, the bubble generation
      medium 3 is formed into a hollow square pillar shape. Because of
      this constitution, gas is discharged from each surface site 3c of
      the square pillar equivalently. The surface sites 3c corresponds
      to longitudinally side walls of the square pillar shape. Thus, the
      super-micro bubbles can be generated effectively.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 5(b), the liquid is jetted in the same
      direction parallel to two side walls, which comprise opposing side
      walls of the square pillar shaped bubble generation medium 3, that
      is, along the surface of the two side walls in the same direction
      (direction of arrow A and arrow B). The liquid is also jetted in
      the same direction parallel to the other two side walls, that is,
      in the direction opposite to arrow A and arrow B (direction of
      arrow C and arrow D).<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the liquid jetting direction is not limited to such
      directions shown in this embodiment. For example, the liquid may
      be jetted in the same direction parallel to all of the side walls.
      Alternatively, the liquid may be jetted in the same direction
      parallel to three of the side walls and in the opposite direction
      parallel to the other side wall.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 6(a), the super-micro bubble generation
      device 1 in accordance with another embodiment includes the bubble
      generation medium 3 which is formed into a hollow columnar shape.
      The gas which has been delivered under pressure passes through the
      gas supply line 11, and then the gas will be delivered in the
      columnar shaped internal space 3a which is provided in the central
      part of the bubble generation medium 3. Because of this
      constitution, the gas is discharged from the surface site 3c,
      which is the side wall of the column, equivalently in every
      direction. Thus, the super-micro bubbles can be generated
      effectively.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 6(a), the liquid jetting device 4 is
      provided on the periphery of the gas supply line 11. An injection
      hole 4a of the liquid jetting device 4 is formed into a circular
      shape having a diameter slightly larger than that of the periphery
      of the bubble generation medium 3. The liquid jetting device 4
      jets zonal liquid flow along the surface site 3c in the direction
      same as gas supplying direction. The surface site 3c corresponds
      to longitudinally side wall of the bubble generation medium 3. In
      this way, the generated super-micro bubbles separate from the
      bubble generation medium 3 as soon as they are generated, and
      thus, the super-micro bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble.
      As just described, the super-micro bubble generation device 1 can
      be installed by a method which provides a higher degree of freedom
      of installation to enable the device to be designed so as to be
      suitable for a place where the device is to be installed and to
      meet functional requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the liquid jetting direction is not limited to such
      directions shown in this embodiment. For example, the liquid may
      be jetted in a direction opposite to the gas supplying direction.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, as shown in FIG. 6(b), the super-micro bubble generation
      device 1 in accordance with another embodiment includes the bubble
      generation medium 3 which is formed into a conical shape. The
      internal space 3a is provided on the principal axis part of
      section of the said conical shape. The gas delivered under
      pressure by compressor 2 passes through the gas supply line 11,
      and then the gas will be delivered under pressure into the
      internal space 3a of the bubble generation medium 3. Because of
      this constitution, the gas is discharged from the surface site 3c,
      which is the side wall of the cone, equivalently in every
      direction. Thus, the super-micro bubbles can be generated
      effectively.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the liquid jetting device 4 is facing the bubble
      generation medium 3. In other words, as shown in FIG. 6(b), the
      injection hole 4a of the liquid jetting device 4 is disposed on
      the extension line that extends from a vertex 3d of the cone of
      the bubble generation medium 3. The liquid jetting device 4 is a
      device for jetting liquid toward the vertex 3d of the cone. As
      just described, since the liquid is jetted toward the vertex 3d of
      the cone, the liquid will flow radially along the surface site 3c,
      which is the side wall of the bubble generation medium 3. In other
      words, the liquid is jetted in the direction substantially
      perpendicular to the direction in which the bubble generation
      medium 3 discharges the super-micro bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, it is able to make the size of the injection hole 4a
      smaller, and thus, lower pressure is needed for jetting the
      liquid. The generated super-micro bubbles separate from the bubble
      generation medium 3 as soon as they are generated, and thus, the
      super-micro bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble. As just
      described, the super-micro bubbles can be generated by using a
      simple method. Also, the super-micro bubble generation device 1
      can be installed by a method which provides a higher degree of
      freedom of installation to enable the device to be designed so as
      to be suitable for a place where the device is to be installed and
      to meet functional requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Also, as shown in FIG. 6(c), a gas supplying inlet port of the gas
      supply line 11 may be provided in the direction perpendicular to
      the height direction of the cone of the bubble generation medium
      3. Because of this constitution, it is able to make an effective
      use of space downstream of the liquid flow. Although the gas
      supplying inlet port of the gas supply line 11 in this embodiment
      is provided upside of the bubble generation medium 3, the position
      of the gas supplying inlet port is not limited to this. For
      example, the gas supplying inlet port may be provided in the
      horizontal direction.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, a bubble guide groove 55, which is formed around the
      bubble generation medium 3, is provided downstream of the liquid
      flow jetted from the liquid jetting device 4. As shown in FIG. 7,
      the bubble guide groove 55 is formed into an arc-like shape in the
      cross section view, located downstream of the liquid flow. The
      bubble guide grove 55 guides the direction of super-micro bubbles
      movement. The micro bubbles move from the surface site 3c of the
      bubble generation medium 3 by the liquid flow jetted from the
      liquid jetting device 4. Because of existence the bubble guide
      groove 55, the super-micro bubbles which are separated from the
      bubble generation medium 3 will impinge on the bubble guide groove
      55. After impingement, the super-micro bubbles will move along the
      bubble guide groove 55. Thus, it is able to preserve a distance
      between each super-micro bubble. Accordingly, the super-micro
      bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the bubble generation medium 3 and the liquid jetting
      device 4, which comprise the super-micro bubble generation device
      1, may be configured in a unified manner. If constituted in this
      manner, positional relationship between the generation medium 3
      and the injection hole 4a of the liquid jetting device 4 is
      maintained constant consistently. Accordingly, it is able to save
      many steps for adjusting position thereof. Moreover, a wall
      surface facing the liquid jetting device 4 may be inclined in an
      arc-like shape when seen from a side. Because of this
      constitution, the direction of super-micro bubbles movement can be
      guided. The super-micro bubbles move along the surface site 3c of
      the plate face of the bubble generation medium 3 by the jetted
      liquid flow from the liquid jetting device 4. In this way, it is
      able to preserve a distance between each super-micro bubble. As
      such, the super-micro bubbles would not coalesce in a mass bubble.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the bubble generation medium 3 may be formed into a
      tabular shape, wherein several gas supply lines 11 are provided in
      parallel inside the bubble generation medium 3. In this case, the
      gas passes through the gas supply lines 11, and is delivered under
      pressure into the internal space 3a of the bubble generation
      medium 3. The gas supply lines 11 are branched inside the bubble
      generation medium 3. The said branched gas supply lines 11 are
      arranged in parallel. The super-micro bubbles are generated from
      the surface site 3c of the bubble generation medium 3 by gas
      pressure from the gas supply lines 11. Keeping wide interval
      between each gas supply line 11 which is arranged in parallel
      respectively makes it harder for super-micro bubbles to coalesce
      in a mass bubble.<br>
      <br>
      However, the numbers or shape of the liquid jetting device is not
      limited to the state described in this embodiment. For example,
      more than three liquid jetting devices may be provided.
      Furthermore, the shape or material of the gas supply line 11 is
      not limited to the state described in this embodiment. For
      example, the gas supply line 11 may be a metallic pipe or a
      plastic pipe.<br>
      <br>
