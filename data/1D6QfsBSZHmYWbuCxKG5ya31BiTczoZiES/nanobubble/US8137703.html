      <b> Abstract:</b> The present invention relates to an ozone water
      that has the potential to find useful applications in a wide
      variety of technical fields and is capable of maintaining the
      effects of wiping out microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and
      the like and inhibiting the growth thereof over long periods. The
      present invention provides ozone nano-bubbles capable of staying
      in a solution for an extended period of time and a method for
      producing the ozone nano-bubbles by instantaneously shrinking the
      diameters of ozone microbubbles contained in an aqueous solution
      by the application of a physical irritation to the ozone
      microbubbles in an aqueous solution. <br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to an ozone water that has
      the potential to find useful applications in every technical field
      and is capable of maintaining the effects of wiping out
      microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and the like and
      inhibiting the growth of the microorganisms over a long period of
      time.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Ozone is known to have a strong oxidizing power and
      therefore has found extensive applications in various fields,
      e.g., sterilization, removal of odors, preservation of the
      freshness and the like. In particular, such a method is employed
      for disinfection of aqueous solutions, where an ozone-containing
      water prepared by placing ozone in gas bubbles contained in an
      aqueous solution is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] For example, Japanese Patent Unexamined Publication (JP
      Kokai) 2004-60010 proposes an apparatus for efficiently dissolving
      ozone in an aqueous solution, that is, an apparatus for producing
      ozone-containing water where ozone is steadily dissolved in the
      aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The ozone-containing water as mentioned above shows high
      ozone contents when just produced. However, when the
      ozone-containing water is kept under normal temperature and
      pressure, ozone dissolved in the aqueous solution will mostly
      dissipate out in approximately one or two hours after the
      production of the ozone-containing water, for example, by
      diffusion from the surface of the aqueous solution. This means
      considerable decrease in the sterilizing effect. There has been
      the problem that long-term storage of the ozone-containing water
      is impossible.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] In light of the above-mentioned circumstances, an object of
      the present invention is to provide an ozone water in which ozone
      is retained in an aqueous solution to exhibit an activating effect
      on biological materials, a sterilizing effect and the like over an
      extended period of time, and a method for producing the
      above-mentioned ozone water.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] To discriminate between the conventional ozone-containing
      water and the one according to the present invention, the former
      will be referred to as ozone-containing water, and the latter, as
      ozone water.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] An object of the present invention is to provide an ozone
      water where ozone is retained in an aqueous solution over long
      periods, and the above-mentioned object of the present invention
      can be achieved by an ozone water comprising an aqueous solution
      containing nano-bubbles in which ozone is held, the nano-bubbles
      having diameters of 200 nm or less.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Also, the above-mentioned object of the present invention
      can be effectively attained when the ozone concentration in the
      aqueous solution is 0.1 mg/L or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another object of the present invention is to provide a
      method for producing an ozone water where ozone is retained in an
      aqueous solution over long periods. This object can be achieved by
      a method comprising the step of instantaneously shrinking ozone
      microbubbles in an aqueous solution to generate ozone nano-bubbles
      by the application of a physical irritation to the ozone
      microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The above-mentioned object of the present invention can be
      advantageously achieved when the microbubbles are stopped from
      shrinking in such a manner that the charge density on the surface
      of each of the microbubbles is increased to evolve the
      electrostatic repulsive force when the bubble diameter is
      decreased to 200 nm or less in the step of instantaneously
      shrinking the microbubbles. Alternatively, the object of the
      present invention can be effectively achieved when the
      above-mentioned ozone nano-bubbles may be stabilized in such a
      manner that in the step of instantaneously shrinking the
      microbubbles, positively and negatively charged ions are
      electrostatically attracted to the ions adsorbed by the gas-liquid
      interface and drawn to a part adjacent to the above-mentioned
      interface in the aqueous solution, and therefore accumulated in
      high concentrations within a minute volume to form a shell
      surrounding each of the microbubbles, thereby inhibiting the ozone
      in the microbubbles from diffusing through the aqueous solution.
      Alternatively, the above-mentioned ozone nano-bubbles may be
      stabilized in such a manner that the above-mentioned ions adsorbed
      by the gas-liquid interface include hydrogen ion and hydroxide
      ion, and electrolytic ions in the aqueous solution are used as the
      ions to be drawn to the part adjacent to the interface.
      Alternatively, the object of the present invention can be
      advantageously achieved when the above-mentioned ozone
      nano-bubbles may be stabilized in such a manner that adiabatic
      compression that occurs in the step of instantaneously shrinking
      the microbubbles abruptly increases the temperature within each of
      the microbubbles, which leads to physicochemical changes involving
      an ultrahigh temperature around the microbubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Furthermore, the above-mentioned object of the present
      invention can be effectively achieved when the physical irritation
      is caused by electrically discharging the microbubbles using a
      discharger; irradiating the microbubbles with ultrasonic waves
      using an ultrasonic generator; or creating a flow in the aqueous
      solution by actuating a rotor installed in a vessel where the
      aqueous solution is held, thereby taking advantage of compression,
      expansion and vortexes which occur when the flow is created.
      Alternatively, the object can be effectively achieved when the
      physical irritation is caused by compression, expansion and
      vortexes, in the case where a circulating circuit is provided in
      the above-mentioned vessel, in such a manner that the aqueous
      solution containing the microbubbles is introduced into the
      circulating circuit and then caused to pass through an orifice
      having a single opening or a plurality of openings or a porous
      plate which is provided in the circulating circuit.<br>

      BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The ozone water of the present invention is characterized
      by comprising an aqueous solution containing ozone nano-bubbles
      which hold ozone therein, the bubbles having diameters of 200 nm
      or less. In the ozone water of the present invention, ozone can
      stay in the aqueous solution over an extended time period of one
      month or more to exhibit a variety of its effects. The ozone water
      according to the present invention will now be explained in
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In the ozone water of the present invention, ozone is
      retained in the form of nano-bubbles. The nano-bubble refers to a
      gas bubble with a diameter of 200 nm or less as shown in the
      particle size distribution in FIG. 1. The ozone nano-bubbles are
      characterized by being kept dissolved in the aqueous solution over
      an extended time period of one month or more. A preservation
      method for the ozone water according to the present invention is
      not particularly limited. Even though the ozone water is preserved
      in a container in common use, ozone will be retained in the
      aqueous solution without dissipation for one month or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] FIG. 2 shows the mechanism where ozone in the form of a
      nano-bubble is stabilized in an ozone water of the present
      invention. When ozone stays in the form of a microbubble, the
      smaller the size of bubble, the more the dissolution efficiency of
      the inner ozone is increased and the more unstable the bubble
      becomes, and then the bubble instantaneously disappears. In
      contrast to this, when ozone is in the form of a nano-bubble,
      electric charges are accumulated in extremely high concentrations
      on the gas-liquid interface and the electrostatic repulsive forces
      are generated between the charges present on the opposite sides of
      the bubble, thereby inhibiting the spherical bubble from
      shrinking. Also, by the action of a strong electric field formed
      by the concentrated ions, an inorganic shell consisting
      predominantly of electrolytic ions of iron or the like contained
      in the aqueous solution is formed around the bubble, which can
      prevent the inner ozone from dissipating. As distinct from shells
      made of surfactants and organic substances, the above-mentioned
      shell itself will readily collapse by dissipation of electric
      charges surrounding the nano-bubble when the ozone nano-bubble
      comes in contact with other substances such as bacteria and the
      like. When the shell is collapsed, ozone in the nano-bubble will
      easily be released into the aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As mentioned above, by the action of the concentrated
      electric field, an inorganic shell consisting predominantly of
      electrolytic ions of iron or the like is formed around the bubble,
      which can prevent the inner ozone from dissipating. The shell thus
      formed, which is different from shells made of surfactants and
      organic substances tends to readily collapse by itself because of
      dissipation of the electric charges surrounding the bubble when
      the ozone nano-bubble comes in contact with other substances such
      as bacteria and the like. The ozone is released and
      instantaneously decomposed to generate active oxygen and free
      radicals, which can be used to cause various chemical reactions,
      to wipe out microorganisms, to kill bacteria, and so on.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] According to the method for producing the ozone water of
      the present invention, a physical irritation is applied to
      ozonemicrobubbles with diameters of 10 to 50 [mu]m to
      instantaneously shrink the bubbles. When electrolytes such as ions
      of iron, manganese, calcium, sodium, magnesium and other minerals
      are present in the aqueous solution containing ozone microbubbles
      so that the electric conductivity of the aqueous solution will
      reach 300 [mu]S/cm or more, the electrostatic repulsive forces
      generated among those ions will inhibit the bubbles from
      shrinking. The above-mentioned electrostatic repulsive force
      refers to an electrostatic force acting on ions which are present
      on the opposite sides of the bubble and have the same polarity
      when the curvature of the bubble is increased in the process of
      shrinking the spherical microbubble. The ozone microbubble is
      pressurized in the shrinking process, so that the tendency of the
      microbubble to shrink becomes stronger as the shrinking of the
      microbubble proceeds. However, when the bubble diameter becomes
      smaller than 200 nm, the electrostatic repulsive force mentioned
      above appears and therefore the shrinking of the bubble is
      stopped.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] When the electrolytes such as ions of iron, manganese,
      calcium, sodium, magnesium and ions of other minerals are mixed
      into the aqueous solution so that the electric conductivity of the
      aqueous solution will reach 300 [mu]S/cm or more, the
      above-mentioned electrostatic repulsive force will act
      sufficiently, so that the tendency of the bubble to shrink and the
      repulsive force are balanced to stabilize the bubble. The diameter
      of the stabilized bubble (i.e., the diameter of the resultant
      nano-bubble), which varies depending upon the concentration and
      the kind of electrolytic ions is 200 nm or less as shown in FIG.
      1.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In addition to the properties that ozone is retained in the
      nano-bubble under the application of pressure thereto, the ozone
      nano-bubble has the properties that an extremely strong electric
      field is formed by concentrated surface charges. The strong
      electric field mentioned above has the ability to significantly
      affect the ozone in the bubble and the aqueous solution around the
      bubble, which will lead to the effects of physiological activation
      and sterilization, and chemical reactivities and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 3 is a side view showing an apparatus for producing an
      ozone water using a discharger.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] An aqueous solution is brought into a microbubble generator
      3 through an intake 31 from a vessel 1. The aqueous solution
      introduced through the intake 31 is mixed with ozone which is
      injected through an inlet (not shown) into the microbubble
      generator 3 to produce ozone microbubbles. Then, ozone
      microbubbles produced in the microbubble generator 3 are sent to
      the vessel 1 through an outlet for ozone nano-bubble containing
      aqueous solution 32. This cycle allows the ozone microbubbles to
      exist in the vessel 1. The vessel 1 is provided with a positive
      electrode 21 and a negative electrode 22, both of which are
      connected to a discharger 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] First, ozone microbubbles are generated in the aqueous
      solution held in the vessel 1 using the microbubble generator 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Then, electrolytes such as iron, manganese, calcium and
      other minerals are added to the aqueous solution so that the
      electric conductivity of the aqueous solution will reach 300
      [mu]S/cm or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Using the discharger 2, electric discharge is carried out
      in the aqueous solution containing the ozone microbubbles in the
      vessel 1. In order to more efficiently produce ozone nano-bubbles,
      it is preferable that the concentration of the ozone microbubbles
      in the vessel 1 reach 50% or more of the saturated concentration.
      In addition, the electric discharge may preferably be carried out
      in water with the application of a voltage of 2,000 to 3,000 V.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] By the application of impulse wave (physical irritation)
      induced by electric discharge in water, the ozone microbubbles in
      water are instantaneously shrunk to nano-level bubbles. At that
      time, the shrinking rate is too fast for the ions surrounding each
      bubble to flee into water, and consequently, the ions are
      instantaneously concentrated there in line with the progress of
      shrinking. The ions thus concentrated form an extremely strong
      electric field around the bubble. Under the application of such a
      strong electric field, hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion present on
      the gas-liquid interface establish a binding relationship with the
      electrolytic ions which are respectively charged oppositely to
      hydrogen ion and hydroxide ion and exist around the bubble,
      thereby forming an inorganic shell around the bubble. The shell
      can inhibit the ozone in the bubble from spontaneously dissolving
      into the aqueous solution, which can stabilize the ozone
      nano-bubbles in the aqueous solution without dissolution. The
      produced ozone nano-bubbles are extremely minute bubbles with
      diameters of about 200 nm or less, so that the bubbles are
      scarcely influenced by buoyancy in water. Therefore, the incidence
      of explosion on the water surface, which would be recognized for
      the ordinary bubbles is virtually zero with respect to the
      nano-bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The method for producing an ozone water by irradiating the
      microbubbles with ultrasonic waves as the physical irritation will
      now be explained. Explanations about the contents overlapping
      those mentioned above will be omitted.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] FIG. 4 is a side view showing an apparatus for producing an
      ozone water using an ultrasonic generator.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Similar to the production method of ozone water by means of
      electric discharging, ozone microbubbles are generated using a
      microbubble generator 3, an intake 31 and an outlet for ozone
      nano-bubble containing aqueous solution 32, and the ozone
      microbubbles thus generated are sent to a vessel 1. An ultrasonic
      generator 4 is set in the vessel 1. The position of the ultrasonic
      generator 4 is not particularly limited, but preferably the
      ultrasonic generator 4 may be disposed between the intake 31 and
      the outlet for ozone nano-bubble containing aqueous solution 32 in
      order to efficiently generate the ozone nano-bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] First, ozone microbubbles are generated in water containing
      electrolytic ions held in the vessel 1 using the microbubble
      generator 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Using the ultrasonic generator 4, ultrasonic wave is then
      applied to the aqueous solution containing the ozone microbubbles
      in the vessel 1. In order to efficiently produce ozone water, it
      is preferable that the concentration of the ozone microbubbles in
      the vessel 1 reach 50% or more of the saturated concentration.
      Preferably, the ultrasonic wave used may have frequencies of 20
      kHz to 1 MHz. With respect to the ultrasonic irradiation, it is
      preferable that oscillation and suspension be repeated alternately
      at intervals of 30 seconds. Alternatively, continuous irradiation
      may be possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The production method of ozone water by creating a vortex
      flow as the physical irritation will now be explained. The
      contents overlapping those mentioned above will not be explained.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 5 is a side view showing an apparatus for producing an
      ozone water by using compression, expansion, and vortex flow.
      Similar to the production methods of ozone water by means of
      electric discharging and ultrasonic irradiation, ozone
      microbubbles are generated using a microbubble generator 3, an
      intake 31 and an outlet for ozone nano-bubble containing aqueous
      solution 32, and the ozone microbubbles are sent to a vessel 1. A
      circulating pump 5 for partially circulating the aqueous solution
      containing ozone microbubbles in the vessel 1 is connected to the
      vessel 1. Within the piping (circulating piping) including the
      circulating pump 5, an orifice (porous plate) 6 having a plurality
      of openings is provided and connected to the vessel 1. The aqueous
      solution containing ozone microbubbles in the vessel 1 is caused
      to travel through the circulating piping by the action of the
      circulating pump 5 and pass through the orifice (porous plate) 6,
      whereby compression, expansion and vortexes are generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] First, ozone microbubbles are generated in water containing
      electrolytic ions held in the vessel 1 using the microbubble
      generator 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Then, the circulating pump 5 is actuated to partially
      circulate the aqueous solution containing ozone microbubbles. By
      the action of the circulating pump 5, the aqueous solution
      containing ozone microbubbles is pushed out. Within the piping,
      compression, expansion and vortexes are generated before and after
      the solution is caused to pass through the orifice (porous plate)
      6. The ozone microbubbles are electrically charged by the
      compression and expansion of the microbubbles when passing across
      the orifice and by the vortexes generated within the piping, to
      generate the eddy current. Thus, the ozone microbubbles are
      instantaneously shrunk and finally stabilized into ozone
      nano-bubbles. The order of the circulating pump 5 and the orifice
      (porous plate) 6 in the flow path may be reversed.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A single orifice (porous plate) 6 is provided in FIG. 6,
      but a plurality of plates may be installed. The circulating pump 5
      may be omitted as occasion arises. In such a case, the force of
      the microbubble generator 2 to drive the aqueous solution or a
      difference of altitude may be utilized for creating a flow in the
      aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] As shown in FIG. 6, the ozone nano-bubbles can also be
      produced by installing a rotor 7 in a vessel 1 to generate a
      vortex flow therein. Preferably, the rotor 7 may be operated at
      500 to 10,000 rpm to efficiently generate a vortex flow in the
      vessel 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The present invention will now be explained in detail with
      reference to the examples demonstrating the features and the
      effects of the ozone water according to the present invention,
      which examples are not intended to limit the present invention
      thereto.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE<br>
      <br>
      [0054] An ozone water according to the present invention having an
      ozone concentration of 1.5 mg/L immediately after the production
      was placed in a glass bottle, and stored in a cool, dark place
      with the bottle being covered with a lid.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] One week after the production of ozone water, the ozone
      nano-bubbles in the ozone water of the present invention were
      observed using a dynamic light-scattering photometer. The
      nano-bubbles with a mean diameter of about 140 nm (with a standard
      deviation of about 30 nm) were found to be stable in water.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Six months later, the ozone concentration in the ozone
      water read 1.0 mg/L when measured by the ultraviolet absorption
      mode. It was confirmed that the amount of ozone contained in the
      ozone water was good enough for sterilization and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The action of electrolytic ions plays an important role in
      stabilizing the ozone nano-bubbles in the ozone water of the
      present invention. The qualities of the ozone water according to
      the present invention were investigated. The results were as
      follows. pH: 8.06, electric conductivity: 22.3 mS/cm, iron: 0.01
      mg/L, potassium: 130 mg/L, sodium: 3700 mg/L, magnesium: 350 mg/L.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In comparison with the above, the change in ozone
      concentration of an ozone-containing water prepared by bubbling of
      ozone was monitored. The ozone concentration was found to be 1.5
      mg/L immediately after the production, but dropped to 0.1 mg/L or
      less two hours later. It was found that the degree of decrease in
      the ozone concentration of the above-mentioned ozone-containing
      water was not significantly changed even when other methods than
      the bubbling were employed to supply ozone into water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><br>
      <br>
      [0059] To investigate the sterilizing effect of the ozone water
      according to the present invention, 1000 mL of hot spring water
      taken from a hot spring source was mixed with the same amount of
      an ozone water of the present invention and the change in the
      number of bacteria was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In the hot spring water the number of general bacteria was
      96/1 ml; the number of colon bacilli was 20 MPN/100 ml; and the
      number of Legionella bacteria was 60 CFU/100 ml. The hot spring
      water was then mixed with 1000 mL of the ozone water of the
      present invention which had been produced one week before. As a
      result, the number of general bacteria was decreased to 0/1 ml;
      the number of colon bacilli, 0 MPN/100 ml; and the number of
      Legionella bacteria, less than 10 CFU/100 ml, which demonstrated a
      sufficient sterilizing effect.<br>
      <br>
      EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
      <br>
      [0061] According to the ozone water of the present invention and
      the production method therefor, ozone water contains ozone therein
      in the form of nano-bubbles with bubble diameters of 200 nm or
      less, which makes it possible to keep ozone dissolved in an
      aqueous solution over an extended time period of one month or
      more. Consequently, the effects obtainable from ozone can last
      with stability, so that sterilization and the like by use of ozone
      can be carried out in the field of medical care, the working site
      where food materials are handled, in the cultivation field of fish
      and shellfish and the livestock industry of land-dwelling
      creature, and so on. In addition, since ozone is retained in the
      form of nano-bubbles with bubble diameters of 200 nm or less,
      ozone can be taken in the body through the process of predation
      and breathing for fish and fishery, or through the process of
      drinking for land-dwelling creature. This makes it possible to
      wipe out harmful microorganism present in the body, such as
      bacteria, viruses and the like and inhibit the growth of the
      harmful microorganism.<br>
      <br>
      INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
      <br>
      [0062] According to the ozone water of the present invention and
      the production method therefor, ozone can be kept dissolved in the
      aqueous solution over an extended time period of one month or
      more. Consequently, the effects obtainable from ozone can last
      with stability, so that the present invention can be used in
      various fields where sterilization is needed, such as medical
      care, food-related industry, cultivation of fish and shellfish,
      the livestock industry of land-dwelling creature, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In addition, since ozone is retained in the form of
      nano-bubbles with bubble diameters of 200 nm or less, ozone can be
      taken in the body through the process of predation and breathing
      for fish and fishery or through the process of drinking for
      land-dwelling creature, which makes it possible to wipe out
      harmful microorganism present in the body, such as bacteria,
      viruses and the like and inhibit the growth of the harmful
      microorganism. The applicability is therefore expanded to the
      fields of medical care, cultivation of fish and shellfish and the
      like.<br>
