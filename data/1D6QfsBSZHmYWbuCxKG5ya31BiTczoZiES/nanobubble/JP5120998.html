      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> 1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>The present invention relates to a tissue preservation
      solution that is useful in the field of medicine, medical
      experiment, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b> 2. Description of the Related Art</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>In the medicine that is making rapid advances in recent
      years, the importance of tissue (as well as organ and cell,
      hereinafter the same shall apply) transplant increases, and the
      advances are supported by the progress, for example, in
      immunosuppressive agents and tissue preservation technology. In
      the tissue transplant, it is ideal that the tissue removed from a
      donor be transplanted immediately to a recipient, but it is not
      always transplanted immediately. Thus, it is extremely important
      how the removed tissue is to be preserved, and currently a better
      tissue preservation solution has been desired.<br>
      <br>
      In recent years, attention has been paid to various bioactive
      effects of water that contains nanobubbles of oxygen in large
      amount (oxygen-nanobubble water) on living organisms. For example,
      oxygen-nanobubble water improves adaptability of fish and
      shellfish to environmental change, or restores a debilitated
      individual quickly (See, for example, Japanese Patent Application
      Laid-Open UP-A) No. 2005-246294). Nanobubbles are ultrafine
      bubbles with a diameter of 1 µm or less, and are typically
      generated in the process where microbubbles (minute bubble with a
      diameter of 50 µm or less) shrink. Since nanobubbles are
      self-pressurized by the action of surface tension, they are
      completely dissolved rapidly. Thus, the lifetime was considered to
      be short in general. However, it is reported that in the case
      where nanobubbles are coated with shell by a surfactant, or in the
      case where they are subjected to electrostatic repulsion due to
      surface charging, even bubbles in nano-order can exist for a
      certain period. Especially, nanobubbles stabilized due to charging
      effect retain properties as bubble; thus various applications,
      such as direct action to organisms at cellular level, are expected
      (See, for example, JP-A No. 2005-246294).<br>
      <br>
      <b> BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>An object of the invention is to solve the conventional
      problems and to achieve the following objects. Specifically, an
      object of the invention is to provide a tissue preservation
      solution that has excellent tissue-preserving ability and is
      useful in the field of medicine, medical experiment, etc.<br>
      <br>
      In order to solve the problems, inventors of the present invention
      have investigated vigorously and have found the following
      experiences or discoveries. Specifically, they have found that
      oxygen-nanobubble water can exhibit tissue-preserving effect
      similar to, or more than the conventional tissue culture mediums
      such as Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and neuron culture
      medium (NCM).<br>
      <br>
      As described above, it has been known that oxygen-nanobubble water
      has various bioactive effects on living organisms. For example, it
      improves adaptability of fish and shellfish to environmental
      change, or restores a debilitated individual quickly. Thus, the
      oxygen-nanobubble water is attracting attention. In addition,
      recently a method for producing oxygen-nanobubble water has been
      established that can maintain nanobubbles stably for a long time
      (See, for example, JP-A No. 2005-246294).<br>
      <br>
      Previously, however, it has not been known that the
      oxygen-nanobubble water can exhibit tissue-preserving effect
      similar to, or more than the conventional tissue culture mediums,
      and that therefore, the oxygen-nanobubble water can be suitably
      utilized as an excellent tissue preservation solution in the field
      of medicine, medical experiment, etc., which was newly found by
      the inventors of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the invention is based on the above-mentioned
      findings by the inventors of the present invention. The means for
      solving the problems is a tissue preservation solution including
      oxygen nanobubbles.<br>
      <br>
      The invention can solve the conventional problems and can provide
      a tissue preservation solution that has excellent
      tissue-preserving ability and is useful in the field of medicine,
      medical experiment, etc.<br>

      <b> DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> (Tissue Preservation Solution)</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>The tissue preservation solution of the invention
      comprises oxygen nanobubbles.<br>
      <br>
      <b> &lt;Oxygen-Nanobubble Water&gt;</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>In the invention, “oxygen nanobubble” refers to a bubble
      which comprises oxygen and which has a nano-order diameter (1 µm
      or less). “Oxygen-nanobubble water” refers to an aqueous solution
      that comprises oxygen wherein the oxygen exists as the oxygen
      nanobubble. Specifically, the oxygen-nanobubble water is a
      preferable aspect of the tissue preservation solution of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      Oxygen nanobubbles present in oxygen-nanobubble water for use in
      the tissue preservation solution of the invention may have a
      variety of bubble diameters. Among them, the bubble diameter is
      preferably 200 nm or less, more preferably 100 nm or less and most
      preferably less than 10 nm. Oxygen nanobubbles with a diameter of
      100 nm or less are advantageous in that there is less possibility
      for incorporation of electrolytes or foreign substances. Oxygen
      nanobubbles with a diameter less than 10 nm are further
      advantageous in that incorporation of many foreign substances
      including viruses can be prevented.<br>
      <br>
      The bubble diameter of the oxygen nanobubble can be adjusted to a
      desired size using, for example, a reverse osmosis membrane. The
      bubble diameter of the oxygen nanobubble can be measured with, for
      example, a dynamic light scattering equipment.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen concentration of the oxygen-nanobubble water is
      preferably saturated level. It is important that the oxygen
      nanobubbles be dissolved in an aqueous solution sufficiently.<br>
      <br>
      The salt concentration, pH, and hardness of the oxygen-nanobubble
      water are not particularly limited and can be appropriately
      selected depending on the application. For example, each of them
      can be adjusted to a desired degree during the production process
      of oxygen-nanobubble water described below or after the production
      of oxygen-nanobubble water.<br>
      <br>
      <b> —Other Element—</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>The oxygen-nanobubble water may comprise other elements
      than the oxygen nanobubbles as necessary. Specific examples of the
      other element are not particularly limited and can be
      appropriately selected depending on the application, including,
      for example, iron, manganese, and salts.<br>
      <br>
      <b> —Production—</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>The oxygen-nanobubble water can be produced by any method
      without limitation and the method can be appropriately selected
      depending on the application. For example, the oxygen-nanobubble
      water can be produced by the production method disclosed in JP-A
      No. 2005-246294. The production method disclosed in the gazette is
      preferable since it can produce oxygen-nanobubble water in which
      oxygen nanobubbles exist stably and do not disappear from the
      aqueous solution over a long period of several months or more.<br>
      <br>
      The salt concentration of the aqueous solution used in the
      production process of the oxygen-nanobubble water is preferably
      0.2% by mass to 3.0% by mass, and more preferably 0.8% by mass to
      1.2% by mass. When the salt concentration is within the range of
      from 0.8% by mass to 1.2% by mass, nanobubbles (core of gas) can
      be produced easily; thus it is advantageous in that production
      efficiency of the oxygen-nanobubble water is excellent. The salt
      concentration can be measured using, for example, a known
      instrument for measuring salt concentration.<br>
      <br>
      It is considered that the pH and hardness of the aqueous solution
      used in the production process of the oxygen-nanobubble water does
      not affect the production efficiency of oxygen nanobubbles as
      greatly as does the salt concentration. Typically, the pH is
      preferably 7 to 8, and the hardness is preferably 20 to 30. The pH
      and hardness can be measured using, for example, a known
      instrument for measuring pH and a known instrument for measuring
      hardness, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      In the production process of the oxygen-nanobubble water, iron,
      manganese, and/or salts can be preferably added.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, oxygen microbubbles of 50 µm or less are produced
      using hard water (groundwater) with a salt concentration of 1.0%
      by mass as a raw material. Then, by rapidly collapsing or crushing
      the oxygen microbubbles, oxygen-nanobubble water can be produced.
      Further, purified oxygen-nanobubble water (salt content: 0% by
      mass), “Naga no shizuku” (drips of Naga) (manufactured by NAGA
      Co., Ltd.), can be prepared by passing the resulting
      oxygen-nanobubble water through a reverse osmosis membrane of 10
      nm. “Naga no shizuku” is drinking water approved by the Ministry
      of Health, Labour and Welfare. Meanwhile, oxygen-nanobubble water
      with a salt concentration of 1.0% by mass is oxygen-nanobubble
      water that is not passed through a reverse osmosis membrane of 10
      nm. Varying the mixing ratio of both of the oxygen-nanobubble
      waters can provide oxygen-nanobubble waters with a salt
      concentration of from 0% by mass to 1.0% by mass.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen-nanobubble water prepared as mentioned above may be
      used as the tissue preservation solution itself, however, for
      example, the oxygen-nanobubble water may be added to an existing
      tissue preservation solution, or a tissue preservation solution
      that includes the oxygen-nanobubble water as an ingredient and has
      a conventional composition may be prepared. This will further
      enhance capability to preserve tissues. Since oxygen-nanobubble
      water is aseptic water and has a high disinfecting ability, it is
      suitably used for preparing tissue preservation solution by means
      of such methods. Thus, such tissue preservation solutions as
      mentioned above that utilize oxygen-nanobubble water in part are
      also included within the scope of the tissue preservation solution
      of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b> &lt;Tissue&gt;</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>The object to be preserved in the tissue preservation
      solution not particularly limited and can be appropriately
      selected depending on the application. The tissue preservation
      solution of the invention is also suitable for the preservation of
      “cell” or “organ”.<br>
      <br>
      The “tissue” is not particularly limited and can be appropriately
      selected depending on the application; examples thereof include
      epithelial tissues, connective tissues, muscular tissues, and
      nerve tissues.<br>
      <br>
      The “cell” is not particularly limited and can be appropriately
      selected depending on the application; examples thereof include
      epidermal cells, pancreatic parenchymal cells, pancreatic ductal
      cells, hepatic cells, blood cells, cardiac muscle cells, skeletal
      muscle cells, osteoblasts, skeletal myoblasts, nerve cells,
      endothelial cells, pigment cells, smooth muscle cells, fat cells,
      bone cells, and cartilage cells.<br>
      <br>
      The “organ” is not particularly limited and can be appropriately
      selected depending on the application; examples thereof include
      skin, blood vessel, cornea, kidney, heart, liver, umbilical cord,
      intestine, nerve, lung, placenta, pancreas, brain, peripheral
      extremities, and retina.<br>
      <br>
      The organism from which the tissue, cell, and organ is derived is
      not particularly limited and can be appropriately selected
      depending on the application. The tissues, cells, and organs
      derived from a mammal are preferable, and tissues, cells, and
      organs derived from a human are more preferable.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Use&gt;</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>The tissue preservation solution may be used without
      limitation. The tissue preservation solution can be used in the
      same manner as a conventional tissue preservation solution. For
      example, the tissue, cell, organ, or the like is removed from a
      living body, and then it is immersed in the tissue preservation
      solution for a desired period.<br>
      <br>
      The tissue preservation solution itself can be stored by any
      method without limitation and the method can be appropriately
      selected depending on the application.<br>
      <br>
      Since the tissue preservation solution has excellent
      tissue-preserving ability, it can be suitably utilized, for
      example, as a tissue preservation solution in the field of
      medicine, medical experiment, etc.<br>
      <br>
      <b> EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>Examples of the invention are illustrated below, but
      these are not to be construed as limiting the invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <b> Evaluation of Effect of Oxygen-Nanobubble Water on Tissue
        Preservation</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>Oxygen-nanobubble water (REO Laboratory Co., Ltd.), one
      aspect of the tissue preservation solution of the invention, was
      prepared with reference to the production method disclosed in JP-A
      No. 2005-246294. Specifically, oxygen microbubbles of 50 µm or
      less was produced using hard water (groundwater) with a salt
      concentration of 1.0% by mass as a raw material. Then, by rapidly
      collapsing or crushing the oxygen microbubbles, oxygen-nanobubble
      water was produced.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of the prepared oxygen-nanobubble water on tissue
      preservation was histologically investigated using rat vagus nerve
      as a material. Physiological saline and conventional tissue
      culture medium were used as a control.<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Method&gt;</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> —Storage/Fixation of Tissue—</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>Four rats (rats 1 to 4) (Std: Wistar/ST, 10 weeks of age,
      male, 300 g) were anesthetized with Nembutal, and vagus nerves on
      both sides (total 8 nerves) were removed using an operation
      microscope. Next, of the removed vagus nerves, vagus nerves (total
      two nerves) removed from one rat (rat 1) were used for the
      following experimental operations without cutting. The vagus
      nerves (total six nerves), removed from the remaining three rats
      (rats 2 to 4), were each cut into five pieces.<br>
      <br>
      Immediately after the cutting or removal, the part very near to
      the central nerve, (L2 to L4, R2 to R4), of each vagus nerve
      removed from three rats (rats 2 to 4) and the entire vagus nerve
      removed from the remaining one rat (rat 1), as a normal control
      vagus nerve tissue, were fixed with Zamboni's fixative (15% picric
      acid, 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.4 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at 4°
      C. for one week. Also, the rest of each vagus nerve tissue removed
      from three rats (rats 2 to 4) was divided and each part of the
      tissue was stored, starting from the part near to the central
      nerve, in physiological saline (C), oxygen-nanobubble water (NB),
      Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM), and neuron culture medium
      (NCM), respectively, at 4° C. (FIG. 1, where left side and right
      side are represented by A and B, respectively). After 1, 3, or 7
      days, each part of the tissue was placed in Zamboni's fixative and
      fixed at 4° C. for one week. Further, each fixed vagus nerve
      tissue was embedded using a low melting point-paraffin (52° C.).<br>
      <br>
      Each part of the rat vagus nerve tissue shown in FIG. 1
      corresponds to each storage method as follows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[Storage Method]</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>L1 to L4, R1 to R4: fixed immediately after the cutting

      NB-A1, 3, 7, NB-B1, 3, 7: stored in oxygen-nanobubble water<br>
      DMEM-A1, 3, 7, DMEM-B1, 3, 7: stored in DMEM<br>

      A1, B1: stored for 1 day<br>
      A3, B3: stored for 3 days<br>
      A7, B7: stored for 7 days<br>
      —Hematoxylin-Eosin Staining (H. E. Staining)—<br>
      <br>
      Each paraffin-embedded vagus nerve tissue was sliced at 8 µm using
      a microtome, and then placed on MAS-coated glass slide. Sections
      were deparaffinized through a xylene series and an alcohol series,
      and alcohol was removed from deparaffinized sections by rinsing in
      distilled water for 5 minutes. Then, the nuclei were stained at
      room temperature for 30 minutes using Mayer's hematoxylin
      solution. Further, after washing in running water for 15 minutes
      to blue the nuclei, fiber, stroma, and the like were stained with
      10% eosin solution for 5 minutes. Sections were washed in running
      water for 1 minute, followed by distilled water. Then, excess
      eosin was removed and sections were dehydrated with an alcohol
      series, cleared through a xylene series, and then mounted with
      Entellan neu to prepare H. E. stained tissue specimens (See, for
      example, Reference Literatures (1) and (2) below).<br>
      <br>
      Next, the prepared H. E. stained tissue specimens were examined
      using an optical microscope, and the state of the tissue after the
      storage was evaluated histologically by examining microscopic
      morphological changes of each vagus nerve tissue (See, for
      example, Reference Literatures (3) to (8)).<br>
      <br>
      <b>&lt;Results&gt;</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>Results are shown in FIGS. 2 to 4 and Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      For the microscopic morphology of the normal control vagus nerve
      tissue, histological differences were not observed between central
      side, center, and peripheral side (FIG. 2). Also, histological
      differences were not observed between left side and right side,
      and between individuals.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of storage in physiological saline (C), there was a
      significant thinning due to the cytoplasmic loss in the vagus
      nerve tissue stored for 3 days or later. In the case of storage in
      DMEM, a certain degree of cytoplasmic loss was observed in the
      vagus nerve tissue stored for 3 days, and there was a significant
      thinning due to the cytoplasmic loss in the vagus nerve tissue
      stored for 7 days. In contrast, in the case of storage in
      oxygen-nanobubble water (NB) or NCM, the tissue were preserved
      relatively well, and only a mild degree of cytoplasmic loss was
      observed in the vagus nerve tissue stored for 7 days (FIGS. 3 and
      4).<br>
      <br>
      For each vagus nerve tissue, the state of tissue after storage was
      evaluated histologically according to the following evaluation
      standards. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      <b> [Evaluation Standards]</b><br>
      <b> </b><br>
      <b> </b>3+: Maintenance of good microscopic morphology<br>
      2+: Mild degree of cytoplasmic loss<br>
      +: Significant thinning due to the cytoplasmic loss<br>

      As shown in results of Table 1, in the case of the vagus nerve
      tissue stored in oxygen-nanobubble water, there was less thinning
      due to the cytoplasmic loss in the vagus nerve tissue and the
      microscopic morphology of the vagus nerve tissue was maintained
      better, compared to those stored in physiological saline and in
      DMEM. In addition, the vagus nerve tissue stored in oxygen
      nanobubble was preserved as well as that stored in NCM. The
      tissue-preserving ability of each preservation solution used in
      this Example 1 was in the order of oxygen-nanobubble
      water?NCM&gt;DMEM&gt;physiological saline.<br>
      <br>
      The above-mentioned results indicate that the tissue preservation
      solution of the invention, which comprises oxygen nanobubbles, has
      excellent tissue-preserving ability, suggesting that it can be
      applied as a tissue preservation solution in the field of
      medicine, medical experiment, etc.<br>
