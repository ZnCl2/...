      <br>
      When Michigan Technological University's Jiann-Yang (Jim) Hwang
      (pronounced "wong") wanted to try out a new idea for making steel,
      the first place he went was Wal-Mart. Hwang, an associate
      professor of materials science and engineering and director of
      MTU's Institute of Materials Processing, picked up six microwave
      ovens at the local discount store and brought them back to his
      lab. With IMP's research scientist Xiaodi Huang, they took them
      apart, wired the magnetrons together into one super-heavy-duty
      microwave, and added an electric arc furnace. Then he zapped a
      mixture of iron oxide and coal.<br>
      <br>
      When he was done, he had a nugget of pure steel.<br>
      <br>
      As gee-whiz as it is, Jim Hwang's and Xiaodi Huang's innovation is
      not just a high-end parlor trick. The microwave energy reduces the
      iron oxide to iron, and the electric arc furnace smelts the iron
      into steel, all in one device. The process may have the potential
      to revolutionize America's troubled steel industry, plagued as it
      is by high costs and foreign competition.<br>
      <br>
      The savings would come first in the form of lower energy costs.
      Just as a microwave oven use less electricity than a conventional
      oven because it heats only the food, microwave steelmaking uses
      less energy than a blast furnace because it heats only the ore and
      coal.<br>
      <br>
      "With a blast furnace, most of the heat escapes," Hwang says.
      "It's like the stove in your home, where most of the heat warms
      your kitchen. It's inefficient. Iron oxides can be heated to 1,000
      degrees Celsius in one minute, compared to hours for conventional
      heating." The electric arc furnace is currently used in
      state-of-the-art smelting processes and is more efficient than
      conventional oxygen furnaces used in most big plants to convert
      iron into steel.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the microwave steelmaking process is simple, with
      fewer than half the steps used in conventional steel
      manufacturing. And it uses coal, eliminating the need for
      high-cost coke.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave technology's energy savings and manufacturing efficiency
      could cut production costs by as much as 50 percent, Hwang says.
      Plus, it's friendlier to the environment, since the process
      releases half the greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) of
      conventional steelmaking, and much less of the pollutant sulfur
      dioxide.<br>
      <br>
      The new technology has the potential to breathe new life into U.S.
      heavy industry, particularly in the Great Lakes region, where the
      steel and auto industries are centered.<br>
      <br>
      More than 30 steel mills have gone bankrupt in the last four years
      even with tariff protection. The resulting high domestic steel
      prices have hit American automakers hard, since they are forced to
      pay more for steel--the main ingredient of all cars and
      trucks--than their foreign competitors.<br>
      <br>
      "A low-cost steelmaking technology would take advantage of U.S.
      iron and coal resources and could help keep manufacturing jobs in
      Michigan and throughout the Great Lakes," Hwang said.<br>
      <br>
      Hwang's research was funded by a grant from the U.S. Department of
      Energy.<br>

      The same couch-potato technology that pops your popcorn during a
      TV commercial can now be used to make steel.<br>
      <br>
      You shouldn't try it at home, however, since it involves heating
      the raw materials up to 1,000 degrees Celsius, about the same
      temperature as molten lava.<br>
      <br>
      The feat was accomplished by Michigan Tech researcher Jiann-Yang
      (Jim) Hwang, who wired together the magnetrons from six
      garden-variety microwaves into one super-heavy-duty oven and added
      an electric arc furnace. <br>
      <br>
      He then put iron oxide and coal inside. In a matter of minutes,
      the microwave energy reduced the iron ore to iron, and the
      electric arc furnace smelted the iron and coal into steel.<br>
      <br>
      The process could give the steel industry the same benefits that a
      microwave gives the typical family, says Hwang, an associate
      professor of materials science and engineering and director of
      Michigan Tech's Institute of Materials Processing.<br>
      <br>
      It's really cheap, and it's really fast.<br>
      <br>
      "With a blast furnace, most of the heat escapes," Hwang says.
      "It's like the stove in your home, where most of the heat warms
      your kitchen. It's inefficient. In our microwave, iron oxides can
      be heated to 1,000 degrees Celsius in one minute, compared to
      hours for conventional heating."<br>
      <br>
      Microwave technology could cut production costs by as much as 50
      percent, Hwang says. In addition to energy savings, it uses coal,
      eliminating the need for high-cost coke. And the manufacturing
      process is simple, cutting the number of steelmaking steps in
      half.<br>
      <br>
      It's also friendlier to the environment, with significant
      reductions in greenhouse gases and sulfur dioxide emissions.<br>
      <br>
      Industry officials aren't ready to throw their existing technology
      out the window just yet, but they are taking a close look at the
      Hwang's invention.<br>
      <br>
      "This could be a promising technology, particularly for helping us
      reuse byproducts that are currently being discarded," said Mark
      Conedera, a senior environmental engineer with US Steel
      Corporation. "We've been supportive of the concept for these
      value-added uses, and it has significant environmental benefits."<br>
      <br>
      Hwang believes his new technology has the potential to benefit
      U.S.<br>
      heavy industry, particularly in the Great Lakes region, where the
      steel and auto industries are centered.<br>

      A method and apparatus for reducing iron oxides using microwave
      heating in a furnace chamber which is sealed against the entrance
      of air reduces the energy required and produces a low temperature
      reduction and allows the recovery of combustible synthetic gas as
      a byproduct of the process. Avoidance of the reduction of sulfur,
      phorphorus and silica is also insured, as is the need to reduce
      the silica content of the feed material prior to reducing the ore.
      A continuous rotary hearth furnace, a rotary kiln, a linear
      conveyor and vertical shaft furnace chamber configurations are
      described. A secondary heating zone can also be included to
      process the reduced iron into iron nuggets or liquid metallic
      iron.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Currently steel is produced by two types of operations:
      integrated mills and minimills. In the integrated mill, sintered
      iron ore pellets, coke and lime are charged into a blast furnace
      (BF). Air is blown in at high speed to combust the coke to
      generate carbon monoxide and heat. Sintered iron ore pellets are
      reduced to hot metal by the carbon monoxide and melted to form
      liquid iron. The liquid iron is then sent to a basic oxygen
      furnace (BOF) where pure oxygen is blown into the liquid iron to
      remove excessive carbon and convert iron into steel. The
      fundamental problems associated with this production route are the
      needs for coke and intense high temperature combustion. Coke
      making is one of the most polluting of industrial processes and
      high temperature combustion generates a great amount of dust and
      wastes energy in the exhaust gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Minimills employ electric arc furnaces (EAF) to melt steel
      scrap with or without DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) and produce
      generally lower quality steel. Minimills traditionally enjoyed an
      abundant supply of steel scrap, however, the recent strong demand
      for scrap internationally has doubled the price. DRI prices have
      also significantly increased due to high cost of reformed natural
      gas, causing many DRI plant closings.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] A revolutionary steelmaking technology has been developed
      by the present inventors based on the use of microwave energy
      (U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,168). This technology can produce DRI, iron
      or steel from a mixture, consisting of iron oxide fines, powdered
      carbon and fluxing agents. This technology is projected to
      eliminate many current intermediate steelmaking steps, such as
      coking, sintering, BF ironmaking, and BOF steelmaking.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] This technology has the potential to save up to 50% of the
      energy consumed by conventional steelmaking; dramatically reduce
      the emission of CO2, SO2, NOx, VOCs, fine particulates, and air
      toxics; substantially reduce waste and emission control costs;
      greatly lower capital cost; and considerably reduce steel
      production costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Microwave heating technology has the advantage over blast
      ovens relying on combustion in being faster to heat the iron oxide
      feed materials since it does not rely on conducting heat into the
      material through air or other gases but rather it generates heat
      internally directly by absorbing the microwave radiation.
      Furthermore, microwave heating is selective, i.e., it only heats
      components of the material that needs to be heated, i.e., to
      reduce the hematite or magnetite and does not heat the silica,
      phosphorus, sulfur or other non ferrous components of the feed
      material directly, so that the energy is much more efficiently
      used and the maximum temperature reached can be much lower. The
      feed material does not need to be electrically conductive to be
      heated with microwave radiation in being reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Another problem with iron and steel making has been the
      retention of sulfur and phosphorus in the iron which may reduce
      the quality of the iron or steel produced. This problem results
      from the much higher temperatures typically reached in
      conventional reducing of iron oxide by combustion of natural gas
      or coal. These higher temperatures result since the outside of the
      pellets or green balls or other feed material is raised to a
      temperature much higher than needed to carry out reduction because
      of the need to achieve proper heating throughout the entire pellet
      or ball and to reduce the time required to raise the entire mass
      to the level required for reducing the iron oxide. At these higher
      temperatures, phosphorus and sulfur are also reduced and this
      results in elemental phosphorus and sulfur being retained in the
      iron or steel. This problem is exacerbated if coal is used to
      reduce the ore or other feedstock since coal sometimes contains
      sulfur, and this would further increase the level of sulfur in the
      iron.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A further problem resulting from the high temperatures
      required in conventional reduction processes is that expensive
      refractory material must be employed in the furnace increasing the
      capital costs. Also, any silica present may also be reduced, which
      will also contaminate the iron and have a deleterious effect on
      its quality in many cases.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another problem encountered concerns excess silica being
      present in the feed material either from the mining operations or
      in the ore deposits. Silica content varies in iron ore from
      different deposits. While silica will be eliminated by being part
      of the slag forming on molten metal, if excessive slag forms this
      will block attempts to inject a gas into the molten metal and thus
      interfere with the process. Thus, in instances where excessive
      silica is present in the ore or the pellets, the silica content
      must first be removed or at least minimized. This has heretofore
      required grinding of the ore into a very fine powder in order to
      mechanically separate the silica from the ore, a quite costly
      process representing a major expense item and energy consumer in
      processing such ore. In fact, too high levels of silica can render
      some ores commercially worthless.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Another disadvantage a rises from the air injection of
      conventional practice and blast heating to reduce iron ore as this
      generally results in combustion of all the carbon associated with
      the feed material into carbon dioxide. This represents a waste of
      potentially useful carbon combustibles and adds to the carbon
      "footprint" of the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It is the object of the present invention to provide
      apparatus and methods for the production of metals and in
      particular iron and steel which utilize microwave heating in such
      a way to realize the potential benefits of using microwave heating
      in iron and steel production.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] It is yet another object of the present invention to
      recover carbon combustibles involved in the reduction process in a
      useful form.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It is a further object of the present invention to avoid
      contamination of iron during production with phosphorus, sulfur or
      silica using a minimum energy and at a lower cost.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] It is still a further object of the invention to separate
      silica from the ore at a minimum consumption of energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0015] The above recited objects and other objects which will be
      understood upon a reading of the following specification and
      claims are accomplished by carrying out the reduction phase of
      iron oxide at a relatively moderate temperature by the use of
      microwave radiation while excluding air. The microwave radiation
      heats only the iron containing constituents of the feed material
      for maximum efficiency in the use of energy and the moderate
      temperatures avoid reduction of phosphorus, sulfur or silica
      present to minimize contamination of the iron with those elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Volatile gases from coal and carbon combustibles are
      produced and can be recovered for use as a fuel or as a reducing
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Continuous processing at moderate temperatures becomes
      practical due to the speed of microwave heating of the material to
      reach reduction temperatures. According, to the invention, feed
      materials may be reduced in a rotary hearth furnace , a linear
      conveyor furnace, a rotary kiln, or in vertical shaft furnaces
      which each enable multiple microwave wave guide mountings to
      readily achieve the necessary heating capacity for a given
      application. The DRI produced can be discharged into a collecting
      container or directly into an electric arc furnace for producing
      steel. The microwave heating reduction may be combined with a
      secondary heating of the reduced ore (DRI) to obtain iron nuggets.
      An induction melting furnace to produce liquid iron can also be
      used to receive the DRI.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The rotary kiln (and all of the other furnaces can utilize
      a combination of microwave and combustion heating to produce DRI
      or solely by multiple microwave sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A linear conveyor associated with a conveyor can produce
      either DRI or iron nuggets with secondary heating after the
      reduction phase which may also be accomplished with microwave
      heating or by burner heating, radio frequency radiation, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] A vertical shaft furnace can also be used in which the ore
      pellets or other feed material is introduced at the top of a
      refractory lined cylinder. Microwave heating is carried out as the
      material descends down the furnace. An induction heater may be
      provided at the bottom which receives DRI and produces melted iron
      discharged therefrom and is slag drawn off from the melted iron.
      Alternatively, injection of natural gas or other reducing gas can
      be done to produce DRI in the shaft furnace without carbon
      material in the feed.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The use of microwave energy to reduce the feed materials
      allows reduction to be carried out at lower a temperature since
      the entire mass is heated at once such that overheating of any
      portion is not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] If the phosphorus and sulfur remain as oxides in the feed
      material, they form part of the slag when the reduced feed
      material is melted and are thereby eliminated from the metal with
      the slag.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Continuous processing is rendered easier by using microwave
      energy to reduce the feedstock while avoiding any problem with
      retention of sulfur and or phosphorus.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] By microwave heating at lower temperatures, reduction of
      silica is minimized. However, the major benefit of the approach is
      that gas injection is not required such that a reduction of silica
      in the slag by a mechanical removal of the silica prior to
      processing is not required. Even relatively large quantities of
      silica can be removed in the slag and need not be removed by
      costly fine grinding and mechanical separation as practiced
      conventionally to reduce silica content prior to reduction of the
      ore.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0039] In the following detailed description, certain specific
      terminology will be employed for the sake of clarity and a
      particular embodiment described in accordance with the
      requirements of 35 USC 112, but it is to be understood that the
      same is not intended to be limiting and should not be so construed
      inasmuch as the invention is capable of taking many forms and
      variations within the scope of the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Referring to the drawings and particularly FIGS. 1-5, a
      rotary hearth furnace 10 according to the present invention is
      depicted. This comprises a stationary annular upper chamber 12
      having outer walls 14 of a refractory insulating material and an
      inner skin 16 of stainless steel attached to embedded anchors 17
      in the refractory walls 14. A rotating base assembly 18 supports a
      ring shaped hearth 20 which is rotated beneath the stationary
      annular chamber 12 by a motor-right angle drive 24 and chain 26. A
      series of main rollers 27 are mounted on a base plate 21 and
      beneath a support plate 23 rotatable about a pivot 25. A series of
      inside and outside secondary rollers 29 attached to brackets 29A
      transfer the weight of the upper chamber 12 onto bracket flanges
      31 on the base assembly 18.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] A refractory material hearth base 22 holds a hearth layer
      of such material such as silica, limestone etc. dispensed from a
      feed opening 28. Feedstock material is dispensed onto the hearth
      layer through a dispenser 30. Such feed material may include iron
      ore pellets admixed with ground coal or other carbonaceous
      material to supply carbon for reduction of the ore, and other
      components to form "green" balls in the well known manner,
      creating a bed of feed material on the hearth base 22. Flux,
      binders and other components are used to create such feed
      material. Cross pipes 15 can be included to reinforce the chamber
      22 particularly during shipping.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Refractory divider walls 32, 34 of refractory material
      define a furnace reduction subchamber 36 within the annular
      chamber 12 wherein the reduction of the iron oxide feed material
      takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A refractory rope air seal 38 resting on bracket flange 31
      encircles the rotating hearth structure 20 to prevent air from
      entering the chamber 12 and a metal rope microwave seal 40
      prevents the escape of microwaves during operation. Similar seals
      are provided at the material charge and discharge ports for air
      and microwave sealing.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Microwaves from a generator 46 are introduced into the
      annular chamber 12 through a pair of waveguides 42, 44 which are
      preferably oriented at 90[deg.] to each other to create
      homogeneous microwave distribution in chamber 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A microwave "stirrer" blade (not shown) can also be
      included for even greater homogeneousness of the microwave
      irradiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Additional waveguides 48 can be employed if greater power
      is required for a particular application.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] A viewing window 49 is also provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The power level is set to raise the temperatures to that at
      which reduction will occur i.e., approximately 600-1200[deg.] C.,
      which as discussed above is much lower than the temperatures in
      excess of 1600[deg.] C. reached in conventional combustion
      reducing processes.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] It will be understood by those skilled in the art that one
      or more pyrometers 45 and gas probes 47 will be used to monitor
      the process conditions for control and safety reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The speed of microwave heating is much greater than
      combustion heaters since the microwave radiation heats the
      material from the inside and only heats the iron bearing material
      (not the silica). Thus, a continuous process operated at
      relatively low temperatures is made practical.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The feed material is reduced to direct reduced iron (DRI)
      by this heating in the present of carbon and then moved to a
      discharge port and chute 50 (FIG. 5). A steel plow (or screw) 52
      causes the DRI to be discharged through the port so where it is
      collected in a container 54 for further processing.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] A refractory guide block 56 may be used to adjust the width
      and depth of feed material on the hearth 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] As shown in FIG. 6, the DRI may alternatively be directly
      discharged into an electric arc furnace 58 for the production of
      steel from the DRI.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] As another alternative shown in FIG. 7, the DRI may be
      discharged into an induction melting furnace 60 with discharge
      ports for liquid metal and slag (not shown). A liquid bath must
      first be formed using iron prior to initiating the process using
      DRI.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 8 shows an alternative embodiment in which a secondary
      heating source 64 is provided in order to increase the DRI
      temperature about 200[deg.] C. in a secondary heating zone 68
      within the chamber furnace. This temperature increase along with a
      proper recipe of the feed material and the hearth layer material
      can produce iron nuggets as the end product.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The secondary heating source could include microwave
      radiation but microwave absorbing material such as carbon must be
      added, as the DRI material does not absorb microwave energy. Other
      heating means could be employed. As discussed above, since the
      furnace chamber 12 is sealed, preventing air from entering,
      volatile components of coal (primarily methane) gassed off and the
      carbon monoxide generated from the carbon reducing the iron oxides
      by the lower temperature reduction process can be collected via a
      discharge duct 62 (FIG. 8) for use elsewhere. That gas can be used
      to fuel a burner (not shown) comprising the secondary heat source
      after removal of dust by a cleaning system such as a bag house 68.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The dust can contain byproducts such as zinc or zinc oxide
      which may be recovered as indicated.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 9 shows a rotary kiln 70 embodiment of the invention
      in which a cylindrical housing 72 is rotatably mounted and driven
      with its axis inclined shallowly from the horizontal.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The feed material (iron ore pellets with coal) is loaded
      via a charging port 74 into the furnace chamber 76 defined in the
      housing 72. Microwave radiation from a generator 78 is introduced
      via a longitudinally aligned waveguide 80. Mating flanges at 77,
      79 have interposed microwave and air seals 81, 83. Additional
      waveguides can be provided on the side via microwave transparent
      windows 82 (which can be constructed of a refractory material). A
      burner 84 can augment the heat of the microwaves to produce DRI
      discharged at discharge port 86.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] An auger device 77 may also be provided to assist movement
      of the feed material.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] FIG. 10 shows a linear conveyor furnace 88 in which a
      furnace chamber defining structure 90 has an endless conveyor 92
      (which can be comprised of a traveling grate) with an upper run 94
      extending beneath it supported on a support structure 96. Feed
      material is loaded at one end and carried into a furnace chamber
      98.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Furnace chamber 98 has a primary zone 98A irradiated by
      microwaves radiation from a generator 100 introduced via wave
      guides 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In a secondary zone 98B further heating of the reduced iron
      is carried out, as by radio frequency radiation, burners, etc.,
      which can optionally be provided to produce iron nuggets. The DRI
      or iron nuggets are off loaded at the other end of the conveyor
      92.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Microwave seals 104 are comprised of an array of steel bars
      or rods, spaced apart in a pattern which will block microwave
      leakage through the end openings by well known techniques.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Furnace gas can be collected through duct 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] A screw conveyor 105 may be employed to assist in advance
      of the feed material.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] FIG. 11 shows a vertical shaft embodiment of the invention,
      in which a tubular housing 108 defines a furnace chamber 110. The
      housing 108 can be constructed of a steel grille cover with a
      refractory shell, allowing penetration of microwaves from
      generators 112 directed through an outer enclosure 114.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Feed material such as pellets or a mixture as described is
      fed into a charging port 116.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] An induction heater 118 at the lower end of furnace chamber
      108 receives the DRI produced by the microwave heating in the
      upper region of the chamber 100 and heats it sufficiently to
      produce molten iron discharged at port 120. Slag is discharged at
      the top through port 122.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The synthetic gas produced is discharged at the top through
      port 124.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] FIG. 12 shows a variation in which DRI is discharged via a
      bottom opening 126.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The DRI can be produced without carbon in the feed material
      by injecting natural or other reducing gas into bottom ports 128.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] FIG. 13 illustrates an integrated apparatus for concurrent
      production of steel and syngas. Coal is used as both reducing
      agent and gasification material.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Ore from a source A is loaded into a first dispenser 130
      positioned over a conveyor 132, coal from a source B into a second
      dispenser 134, (via a pulverizer 135) additives such as flux from
      source C into a third dispenser 136 (via a pulverizer 137), and
      binder from source D in a fourth dispenser 138. The conveyor
      discharges all of these materials into a mixer which discharges
      the mixed ingredients into a pulverizer 142 which in turn charges
      a dispenser 144. Carbon particles are also deposited in a layer
      onto a conveyor 148 by a second dispenser 146.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] A rotary conveyor or traveling grate 148 is disposed in a
      sealed housing 150 (the conveyor perimeter shown in FIG. 13 is
      developed into a straight line).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The pellets are dispensed to form a bed 152 on top of a
      carbon particle bed 155 on the conveyor 148 via a charging port
      154. The carbon particles are deposited onto the conveyor 148 via
      a charging port 156.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] An organic binder is used to agglomerate iron ore
      concentrate, pulverized coal and fluxing agent into pellets. The
      feed material is dispensed onto the conveyor 148 in a layer
      leveled by the lower end of the dispenser 154 and is transported
      from the entrance to the exit of the furnace chamber 168.
      Microwave radiation from generators 160 is introduced into the
      furnace through waveguides 158 to heat the feed material to reduce
      the iron oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Iron oxides and many carbon bearing materials are excellent
      microwave absorbers and can be readily heated by microwave
      irradiation. Upon microwave heating, volatiles, primarily methane
      in the coal, are released into the off-gasses to form a portion of
      the syngas.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Continuous heating will cause the following reactions:<br>
      C+O2-CO2<br>
      CO2+C-2CO<br>
      3Fe2O3+CO-2Fe3O4+CO2<br>
      FeO+CO-Fe+CO2<br>
      H2O+C-CO+H2<br>
      CO2+CH4Fe-&gt;2CO+2H2<br>
      H2O+CH4Fe-&gt;CO+3H2<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Thus, iron ore is reduced into metallic iron or DRI in the
      reduction zone 168. At the elevated temperature and carbon rich
      environment which are required for fast and complete iron ore
      reduction, most of the water and carbon dioxide are reacted with
      carbon to form hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The process is a
      continuous operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The produced DRI also function as a catalyst to promote the
      transformation of methane into hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The
      off-gases eventually reach a steady composition, a mixture of
      volatiles and iron ore reduction spent gas. Due to no oxygen or
      air required for combustion as in a ordinary gasifier or a
      combustion furnace, the off-gas composition can be readily
      controlled and a high quality syngas can be produced and
      collected.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The coal volatile content and the equilibrium phase diagram
      or iron oxides, iron, CO, and CO2 vs. temperature can be used as
      references for controlling the off-gas composition. The exhaust
      port 166 can be located either near the feed material charging
      port or the product discharging port to form a countercurrent or
      concurrent flow. The countercurrent flow transfers gas heat better
      to the feed material and the concurrent flow generates a higher
      quality syngas.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] After DRI is formed, the feed material becomes a poor
      microwave absorber due to formation of networked metallic iron.
      Therefore, the underling carbon layer or coating, preferably made
      of pyrolyzed carbon particles such as coke, graphite, activated
      carbon, or fly ash carbon in dry or slurry form, is layered or
      applied before charging iron ore agglomerates into the furnace by
      the dispenser 156. The carbon layer 155 or coating becomes the
      major microwave receptor/susceptor to be heated by microwave and
      to transfer heat to the above disposed DRI in the smelting zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The smelting zone 170 is separated from the reduction zone
      by refractory dividers 152 to reduce interference between the two
      zones. As an alternative, such carbon microwave receptor material
      can be applied over the agglomerates/DRI at an appropriate
      location. The carbon material is heated by microwave and transfers
      heat to the underneath agglomerates/DRI. A powdered poor microwave
      absorbing material also can be used to cover the agglomerates/DRI
      to reduce convection and radiation heat loss. The DRI's
      temperature continues to rise and the DRI reacts with the
      remaining internal carbon and the underlying or covering carbon to
      form molten iron nuggets and associated slag. The eutectic iron
      and carbon composition (4.26% C) helps to lower the melting point
      of the iron to 1154[deg.] C. The associated slag has a composition
      suitable for desulphurization and dephosphorization with lower
      melting point, lower viscosity, proper plasticity, and easy
      separation of iron nuggets from slag after cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The remaining underlying carbon layer also functions as an
      isolator between the molten nuggets/slag and the refractory base
      to prevent erosion of the molten nuggets/slag to the refractory
      and facilitates discharging the produced nuggets/slag from the
      refractory base. If necessary, another refractory coating made of
      oxides, borides, carbides and/or nitrides can be applied between
      the carbon layer and the refractory base.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The produced iron nuggets can be used as a feed material
      for steelmaking by EAF or a feed material for ferrous foundries.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Because of no major combustion heating, the off-gas is of
      lower temperature and contains less particulate. The off-gas is
      passed through a cleaning system 164 to further cool down, remove
      and collect particulates in a container 172, recover and collect
      sulfur in a container 172, and separate H2O and CO2 if any and
      necessary, becoming a syngas. Because of no steam and combustion
      requirements, the syngas production has fewer problems of H2O
      separation and NOx formation. The syngas can be used as a fuel for
      ordinary heating, a raw material for production of chemicals and
      liquid fuels, a hydrogen source after separation, a fuel to drive
      a power plant, or a reducing gas for iron ore reduction. Various
      heat exchangers can be installed along the line to utilize waste

      <br>
      A method for the direct preparation of metal from metal-containing
      material comprising providing metal-containing material and a
      reducing agent, mixing the metal-containing material with the
      reducing agent to form a mixture charging the mixure by an
      appropriate method except flowing a stream of small particles into
      a container, heating the mixture with minimal contamination by
      applying microwave energy to the mixture until molten metal is
      released from the metal-containing material, accumulating the
      molten metal by gravity at the bottom of the container, and
      discharging the metal from the container. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a direct metal making method that
      utilizes microwave energy as the primary or secondary energy to
      reduce and melt metal-containing material, and separate molten
      metals from slag.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of the Related Art</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Current processes for the extraction of metals from their
      respective ores are characterized by extensive energy consumption
      and by the release of environmentally undesirable by-products,
      including large quantities of fine particulate, SO2, CO2, and NO2.<br>
      <br>
      Prior to the instant invention, steel making has been practiced
      using an indirect method whereby iron is first produced from ore
      or scrap metal. The iron so produced is then converted to steel.
      In a typical iron smelting process, iron ore is ground to 500 mesh
      to liberate iron oxides from other minerals. The resultant
      material then goes through a separation process such as magnetic
      separation and/or froth flotation to concentrate iron oxides. The
      resulting fine particles are normally pelletized with limestone
      and bentonite.<br>
      <br>
      The pellets are sintered to make them strong, and charged, along
      with coke, into a furnace in which the raw materials are subjected
      to a blast of very hot air. In the furnace, the iron oxide is
      reduced and melted. During the melting, the iron picks up carbon
      and sulfur from the coke charged into the furnace with the
      pellets.<br>
      <br>
      The carbon content of the iron must be reduced to make steel. This
      is commonly done in a basic oxygen furnace (BOF). Pure oxygen is
      blown, at supersonic velocity, into a molten mass, including
      liquid iron, contained in a bottle-shaped furnace. The oxygen
      reacts with the carbon in the molten iron to form CO and CO2.
      Sulphur, which is harmful to most steels, is removed by injecting
      a powdered material into the molten steel to form sulfides, which
      are collected as slag from the top of the molten mass.<br>
      <br>
      This production route is very energy and material inefficient and
      causes serious environmental problems. Iron ore pelletizing and
      sintering are necessary to provide the required permeability for
      blast air and strength to support the heavy load in a blast
      furnace. The whole process is very dusty and noisy which poses
      health and environmental problems for workers and others in the
      area. Coke must be used to generate a temperature high enough for
      melting iron. Adding coke to the mixture, however, causes the
      introduction of carbon and sulfur into the iron. These elements
      must then be removed in subsequent processing. Also, the
      production of coke is an environmentally unfriendly process, and
      recently a shortage of coke has been a serious problem as well.<br>
      <br>
      The production of other metals such as copper, nickel, lead, zinc
      and ferroalloys present similar problems. SO2 emission is an
      additional problem for ores containing sulfur.<br>
      <br>
      Various methods have been used to supply the heat necessary to
      melt the metal and the material in which it is borne so that they
      may be separated. These included the burning of fossil fuels such
      as coal, coke, and oil, and the use of electric heaters.<br>
      <br>
      Electric induction heating has been particularly useful because it
      introduces no additional contaminants into the metal being melted
      and produces no local emissions. One drawback of induction
      heating, however, is that it relies on the conduction of eddy
      currents within the material being heated. Induction heating is
      impossible if the material is not an electric conductor such as a
      metallic ore. Typically induction heating is only used where scrap
      metal is available in the initial charge to the furnace.<br>
      <br>
      Electric arc heating is a popular method to produce metals from
      scraps.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to the drawback of induction heating, the material to be
      heated must be an electric conductor. Metallic ores can't be
      heated directly by electric arc.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave heating, as disclosed herewithin, transmits energy to
      non-electric conducting materials or small agglomerations of
      metallic material more efficiently than induction heating or
      electric arc heating. It thus provides an alternative to the
      burning of fossil fuel, and can do the initial heating that makes
      later use of induction heating or electric arc heating feasible.<br>
      <br>
      Various processes have been developed utilizing microwave energy
      in the purification of metallic compounds. U. S. Patent No.
      4,321,089 discloses a process for the recovery of molybdenum and
      rhenium from their sulfide ores. In the disclosed process, the
      sulfide ores are subjected to microwave energy in the presence of
      oxygen or chlorine to form chlorides respectively. In neither case
      is the metal reduced. These oxides or chloride intermediates are
      then subjected to additional processing under reducing conditions
      to produce metal. Both of these processes differ from the direct
      reduction processing disclosed herewithin, inasmuch as the
      microwave processing results only in an oxidized intermediate.<br>
      <br>
      U. S. Patent No. 4,324,582 (the'582 patent), also to Kruesi et
      al., also discloses a process applying microwave energy to copper
      compounds to convert the compounds into other compounds, such as
      oxides and chlorides, from which copper is more readily
      recoverable. The claims of the'582 patent are restricted in scope
      to using microwave energy"to convert the sulfidic and oxidic
      compounds in the ores to compounds from which copper is more
      readily recoverable."<br>
      <br>
      The specification of the'582 patent specifically teaches away from
      the ferrous metal processing disclosed herein, asserting that"the
      oxides of iron and chromium, which are transition metals, do not
      absorb microwaves,"and"the gangue of the ore does not appreciably
      absorb microwave radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast to the application of microwaves to the preparation of
      an intermediate material as disclosed above, the process of the
      present invention results in the direct preparation of a purified
      metal by the chemical reduction of oxide, sulfide, and other ores,
      and metal sources through the application of microwaves and
      appropriate reducing agents in combination with induction heating
      or electric arc heating.<br>
      <br>
      U. S. Patent No. 5,131,941 to Lemelson issued July 21,1992,
      discloses a process for refining metal from ore, including flowing
      a stream of small particles of ore to a reaction zone.<br>
      <br>
      It is thus clear that the above-mentioned examples from the prior
      art do not possess the novel attributes of the present invention,
      namely the clean direct production of metals and efficient use of
      materials for the metal industry. This invention presents a
      revolutionary method to produce metals directly from ores by
      utilizing microwave energy as the primary heating source. This
      process is dramatically different from any of the current metal
      making techniques. The foreseeable advantages of this new metal
      making method over the traditional metal making methods include
      reductions in energy consumption and combustion emissions, the
      elimination, or reduction, of coke with its related environment
      problems, lower capital investment, and lower production cost, and
      minimal contamination of the metal product.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Brief Summary of the Invention</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention described herewithin includes a method for the
      direct preparation of metal from metal-containing material, such
      as metallic ore or scrap metal. To practice the invention one
      provides a metal-containing material and a reducing agent and
      mixes these either prior to or after introducing them into a
      container. The container should be of appropriate material to
      serve as, or use within, a microwave cavity, and should be able to
      tolerate high temperatures without substantial degradation, and
      could be able to apply induction or electric arc heating. Once the
      mixture of metal-containing material and reducing agent have been
      charged into the container in the form of pellets, cakes or other
      appropriate forms except flowing a stream of small particles,
      scattered microwaves are generated using a microwave source and
      applied to the contents of the container. It is preferable that
      the frequency of microwaves used selectively heats the metallic
      ores or metals of the metalcontaining material. The application of
      microwaves to the metal-containing material continues until the
      reducing agent breaks the bond between metal atom and other atoms
      in the metallic ore to release metal and the metal has absorbed
      enough energy to become molten.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, additional induction or electric arc energy could be
      directed into the system to assist heating after the mass of
      metal-containing material becomes an electric conductor, and allow
      time for the molten material to accumulate, under the action of
      gravity, at the bottom of the container.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Detailed Description of the
        Invention</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In the practice of the instant invention, ore is crushed, ground
      and concentrated by a separation process. The separation process
      can be a flotation, gravity, magnetic, electrostatic, or other
      physical separation processes. The concentrated fine particles of
      ore are mixed with a reducing agent, an internal combustion
      auxiliary fuel, and a fluxing agent, in a certain ratio. It is
      preferable that the reducing agent, the internal combustion
      auxiliary fuel and the fluxing agent are introduced as powdered
      solids or pellets or cakes. Gases or liquids may also be used,
      however. The preferred reducing agents include materials
      containing carbon, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, Al, Si Mn, Mg, Ti, Cr
      Na, Li, Ca Y and Zr. The preferred internal combustion auxiliary
      fuels include coal, coke, carbon, wood, oil, and hydrocarbon
      wastes. The preferred fluxing agents include lime, limestone,
      CaF2, and Na2O. The preferred ratio is determined according to the
      composition of the concentrated ore, the reducing agent, the
      internal combustion auxiliary fuel, and the fluxing agent, as well
      as the desired percentage of energy provided by the internal
      combustion auxiliary fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Generally the reducing agent, internal combustion auxiliary fuel
      and fluxing agent comprise 5-40%, 1-20%, and 1-15% by weight
      respectively of the contents of the container.<br>
      <br>
      By-products or metal-containing wastes such as smelter dust, roll
      scale and plating sludge also can be used as the metal-containing
      material. Consequently, the metals in these by-products or wastes
      can be partially or entirely recovered through the use of this
      invention. The by-products or wastes should preferably be powders
      or agglomerates of powders. Metal scraps and other recyclable
      metals also can be added into the concentrated ores, by-products,
      or wastes.<br>
      <br>
      In some cases a metal-containing material may be incapable of
      efficiently absorbing microwave radiation of an available
      frequency. In such cases a microwave absorber material may be
      blended with the ore or metal-containing material to increase its
      microwave absorption. The microwave absorber material can be
      selected from the group of materials containing anthracite,
      argentite, arsenopyrite, bismuth, bonite, braunite, chalcocite,
      chalcopyrite, chrysotile, cobaltite, covellite, enargite, galena,
      graphite, hematite, ilmenite, magnetite, manganite, marcasite,
      molybdenite, proustite, pyrargyrite, pyrite, pyrolusite,
      pyrrhotite, smaltite, tetrahedrite, zincite, and hydrocarbon. The
      microwave absorber materials are used in powder form or in a
      solution of 0.1-20% concentration. As an alternative, the
      metal-containing material may be preheated by a gas, oil, coal or
      electric furnace to a critical temperature, over which the
      metal-containing material becomes a good microwave absorber. The
      metal-containing material is then charged into a microwave furnace
      to continue metal making.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Figure 1C, after mixing, the raw material 101 is
      charged into a crucible 102 in the form of pellets, cakes or other
      appropriate forms except flowing a stream of small particles. It
      is preferred to use a crucible made of a material which absorbs
      relatively less microwave energy than the mixed raw material does.
      The crucible also should have a softening temperature higher than
      the melting point of the mixed raw material. Appropriate crucible
      materials include fireclay, mullite, Si02, Al203, SiC, MgO,
      zircon, and chromite.<br>
      <br>
      After charging, the crucible is moved into a special high power
      microwave furnace 103 with a single mode or multi-mode cavity
      103A. Scattered microwaves 104 are introduced into the cavity
      through a waveguide 105. The high power microwave furnace can
      deliver intensive microwave energy in a small space. For example,
      the microwave power can reach over lOW/cm3. The microwave
      frequency is 0.915 Ghz, 2.45 Ghz, or other frequency, or
      continuously adjustable. An inlet 106 and an outlet 107 with
      valves may be constructed on the microwave cavity to introduce a
      gas and to release exhaust gas for controlling the atmosphere of
      the microwave cavity.<br>
      <br>
      To produce a metal, microwave power is turned on and the mixed raw
      material starts to absorb microwave energy and increase in
      temperature. The ore reacts directly or indirectly with the
      reducing agent to become a metal. In the case of indirect
      reaction, the reducing agent reacts first with air to form a
      reducing gas. The ore subsequently reacts with the reducing gas to
      form a metal. Alternately, the ore decomposes first to form a
      compound and the compound thus formed reacts with the reducing
      agent to form a metal.<br>
      <br>
      When the mixture within the crucible reaches an appropriate
      temperature, the internal combustion auxiliary fuel ignites to
      generate heat 108 and to further increase temperature. The ore
      starts to melt and form molten metal droplets 109 and a molten
      slag 110. Due to the specific density differences between the
      metal and the slag, the molten metal droplets descend by gravity
      and form a molten pool 111 at the bottom of the crucible and the
      slag 110 floats on the top of the molten metal. The fluxing agent
      melts and reacts with the slag to reduce the viscosity of the
      slag. The result is better separation of the molten metal and the
      molten slag.<br>
      <br>
      After molten metal forms, the slag and the crucible material
      continue to absorb microwave energy and maintain an elevated
      temperature. After the separation of the molten metal and slag,
      the microwave generator is turned off, and the crucible is moved
      out of the microwave furnace and allowed to cool. This cooling
      results in the formation of a solid metal ingot. The solidified
      slag is broken from the ingot using a mechanical impact.
      Alternately, the slag may be stripped off while still molten after
      the crucible is moved out the microwave furnace. The molten metal
      can then be poured into molds to solidify and form ingots.<br>
      <br>
      If the ore contains a great amount of sulphur such as Cu2S, N2S3,
      PbS and ZnS, a sulphur condenser 112 or an SO2 scrubber should be
      connected to the outlet 107 of the furnace to condense the sulphur
      vapor and capture SO2 released from the mixture during heating.<br>
      <br>
      Some ores are poor microwave absorbers at ambient temperature but
      absorb microwaves much more efficiently at higher temperatures. To
      process these materials, the mixture of ore, reducing agent and
      fluxing agent may be preheated in a conventional electrical, gas
      or oil furnace to a certain temperature and then transferred into
      the microwave furnace, where the reduction and melting process are
      continued under the influence of applied microwave energy.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a gaseous reducing agent may be efficacious in some
      circumstances. In such a case a reducing gas may be continuously
      introduced into the cavity of the microwave furnace during
      microwave heating. The reducing gas reacts with the
      metalcontaining material therein to good effect. CO, H2 and
      hydrocarbon gases can be used as the reducing gas. If a reducing
      agent contains carbon, COZ emission, HZ or a hydrogen based
      reducing agent such as ammonia is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      Some ores can be reduced under vacuum at high temperature without
      a reducing agent. In such circumstances no reducing agent need be
      used and the general consequence is the elimination of unwanted
      C02 emissions. The ore and fluxing agent are blended together and
      pelletized. The pellets are charged into a crucible and placed
      into the cavity 103A as shown in Figure 1C. A vacuum pump 113 is
      connected with the outlet 107 and inlet 106 is closed. The pump
      evacuates the cavity 103A to less than about 200 um.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave energy heats the pellets under vacuum and the pellets
      reduce and melt to form molten metal and slag. A quartz window 114
      is installed to hermetically seal the waveguide 105 but permit
      passage of microwaves 104.<br>
      <br>
      In an alternative method, as shown in Figure 2, a high power
      microwave furnace can be constructed with a water cooled metal
      vessel 201 and a removable water cooled metal cover 202. Both the
      vessel and the cover are lined with a refractory material 203. An
      inlet 205 and an outlet 204 may be included in the cover 202.
      Gases may be introduced through the inlet 205 and exhaust gases
      may be released via the outlet 204, thus controlling the
      atmosphere within the furnace. To produce a metal, the cover 202
      is moved away and the mixed raw material containing ore and
      reducing agent in the form of pellets, cakes, or other appropriate
      forms except flowing a stream of small particle, is charged into
      the microwave cavity 206. The cover 202 is then moved back to
      close the vessel.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave is introduced through the waveguide port 207 into the
      cavity 206 and scattered in the entire cavity. Thereafter the
      mixed raw materials starts to absorb the microwave energy and
      increase in temperature. When the temperature is high enough, any
      auxiliary fuel introduced with the mixed raw material ignites to
      generate more heat 208 and further increase the temperature within
      the vessel. The reducing agent by direct contact with ore breaks
      the bond between metal atom and other atoms in the ore. The ore
      starts to melt and form molten metal droplets 209 and a molten
      slag 210. Due to the specific density differences, the molten
      metal droplets descend to form a molten pool 211 at the bottom of
      the vessel and the slag 210 floats on the top of the molten metal.
      The fluxing agent melts and reacts with the slag to form a lower
      viscosity slag for better separation of the molten meal and the
      molten slag. The slag are the refractory material continue to
      absorb microwave energy and maintain an elevated temperature while
      metal and slag separate. After the separation of the molten metal
      and slag, the microwave generator is turned off, and the molten
      mass is allowed to cool. This cooling results in the formation of
      a solid metal ingot and slag. The solidified slag is broken from
      the ingot using a mechanical impact. Alternately, the molten slag
      may be stripped off after the microwave power is turned off. The
      cover 202 is moved away. The vessel is tilted to pour the molten
      slag through a discharging port 212 into a slag container.
      Subsequently, the molten metal is poured into molds to form
      ingots, or into a caster to produce a continuous cast. The molten
      metal also can be poured into a ladle and transferred into another
      smelter for refining.<br>
      <br>
      As another alternative method, a furnace with both microwave
      heating and induction heating capabilities can be constructed as
      shown in Figure 3. The furnace comprises a water cooled metal
      vessel 301 and a removable water cooled metal cover 302, both
      lined with a refractory material 303. The refractory material may
      be selected from materials having poor microwave absorption
      characteristics, such as quartz. A portion of the metal vessel 301
      is a coil made of copper tubing which serves as an induction coil
      304. The apparatus is arranged to allow the flow of cold water
      inside the tubing to cool the coil. The gaps between the turns of
      the coil are small to prevent microwave leakage. The metal vessel
      301, the cover 302, and the induction coil 304 form the microwave
      cavity 305. An inlet 306 and an outlet 307 may be included in the
      cover 302 to allow introduction of process gases and the release
      of exhaust gases. Thus, the atmosphere within the furnace may be
      controlled.<br>
      <br>
      To produce a metal, the cover 302 is moved away and a mixture 307A
      of metal-containing material, reducing agent, and other
      process-enhancing chemicals as appropriate to the particular
      circumstances, is charged into the cavity 305 in the forms of
      pellets, cakes or other appropriate forms except flowing stream of
      small particles. The cover 302 is then moved back to close the
      vessel. Microwave energy is introduced through the waveguide 308
      and the mixture 307A of raw materials starts to absorb the
      microwaves, with a resulting increase in temperature. The ore
      reacts with the reducing agent in the mixture, or with the
      reducing gas introduced via the inlet 306, to release a metal.
      Once metal begins to appear and the mass of raw material becomes
      electrically conductive, the induction heating power is turned on.
      Current flows through the induction coil 304 and the metal is
      further heated by the action of induced current. This additional
      heat input further raises the temperature of the mixture within
      the vessel. As the temperature rises, droplets of molten metal 309
      accumulate and a molten slag 310 forms. Due to the difference in
      specific density between the molten metal and slag, the molten
      metal droplets descend to the bottom by gravity and form a molten
      pool 311 and the slag 310 floats to the top of the molten metal.<br>
      <br>
      The fluxing agent, which melts along with the rest of the mixture,
      lowers the viscosity of the slag and thus allows between
      separation of the molten metal and molten slag. The slag continues
      to absorb microwave energy and the molten metal continues to be
      heated by the induction current. After a short period of time for
      molten metal and slag to separate, the microwave and the induction
      heating powers are turned off. The vessel is tilted to pour the
      molten slag through a discharging port 312 into a slag container.
      The vessel is then tilted further to pour the molten metal into
      molds to form ingots, or into a caster to produce continuous
      casting. The molten metal also can be poured into a ladle and
      transferred into another smelter for refining.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to use the instant furnace for refining. After
      the slag is poured into a slag container, the vessel is restored
      to the upright position, and the cover 302 is replaced. The
      induction heating power is turned on again. Powdered materials
      such as CaO and NaC03 may be blown into the cavity 305 through a
      hole 313 at the bottom of the vessel 301, or a movable pipe 314
      which can be immersed into the molten metal to remove S and P.<br>
      <br>
      Scrap metals and alloys can be added into the molten metal to
      adjust the composition to meet particular specifications. During
      this portion of the process, induction heating is used to control
      the temperature.<br>
      <br>
      As another alternative method, a furnace with both microwave
      heating and electric arc heating capabilities can be constructed
      as shown in Figure 4. The furnace comprises a water cooled vessel
      401 and a removable water cooled metal cover 402, both lined with
      a refractory material 403. Three graphite electrodes of greater
      than 50 mm in diameter are introduced through the metal cover 402
      into the furnace chamber 404. A port 405 is opened on the cover
      402 to introduce microwave 406 into the chamber 404 through a
      connecting waveguide 407.<br>
      <br>
      To produce a metal, the cover 402 is moved, away and a mixture 408
      of metalcontaining material, reducing agent, and other
      process-enhancing chemicals as appropriate to the particular
      circumstances, is charged into the cavity 404. The cover 402 is
      then moved back to close the vessel. Microwave energy is
      introduced through the waveguide 407 and the mixture 408 of raw
      materials starts to absorb the microwaves, with a resulting
      increase in temperature. When the temperature is high enough, any
      auxiliary fuel introduced with the mixed raw material ignites to
      generate more heat 408 and further increase the temperature within
      the vessel. At an elevated temperature, the ore starts to react
      with the reducing agent in the mixture to become a directly
      reduced metal. Once metal begins to appear and the mass of raw
      material becomes electrically conductive, the powered electrodes
      410 descend to form electric arcs between the electrode tip-s and
      the metal, and the metal is further heated by the action of
      arcing. This additional heat input further raises the temperature
      of the mixture within the vessel. As the temperature rises,
      droplets of molten metal 411 accumulate and a molten slag 412
      forms. Due to the difference in specific density between the
      molten metal and slag, the molten metal droplets descend to the
      bottom by gravity and form a molten pool 413 and slag 412 floats
      to the top of the molten metal. The fluxing agent, which melts
      along with the rest of the mixture, lowers the viscosity of the
      slag and thus allows better separation of the molten meal and
      molten slag. After a short period of time for molten metal and
      slag to separate, the microwave and the electric arc powers are
      turned off. The vessel is tilted to pour the molten slag through a
      discharging port 414 into a slag container. The vessel is then
      tilted further to pour the molten metal into molds to form ingots,
      or into a caster to produce continuous casting. The molten metal
      also can be poured into a ladle and transferred into another
      smelter as refining.<br>
      <br>
      As an alternative method aiming at continuous production, a
      continuous microwave/induction heating furnace can be constructed
      as shown in Figure 5. It mainly comprises a water cooled metal
      shell 501, a water cooled induction heating coil 502, a raw
      materials charging port 503, a waveguide port 504, a slag
      discharge port 505 and a molten metal discharge port 506. The
      metal shell 501 and the induction coil 502 are lined with a
      refractory material 507 that absorbs microwaves poorly. To start
      the process, the mixed raw material 508 in the form of pellets,
      cakes or other appropriate forms except flowing a stream of small
      particles is charged through the charging port 503 into the
      furnace. The microwave power is turned on and microwave is
      introduced through the waveguide 504 into the furnace chamber 509
      and scattered in the chamber. The mixed raw material starts to
      absorb microwave energy and increase in temperature. As the
      temperature rises, the internal combustion auxiliary fuel ignites
      to generator heat 510 and further increase temperature. The ore
      reacts directly or indirectly with the reducing agent in the raw
      material to become a metal.<br>
      <br>
      After the mass of raw material becomes electrically conductive,
      the induction heating power is turned on to heat the metal. The
      metal starts to melt and form molten metal droplets 511 and a
      molten slag 512. Due to specific density differences, the molten
      metal droplets descend to the bottom by gravity and form a molten
      pool 513, and the slag 512 floats on the top of the molten metal.
      The fluxing agent also melts and reacts with the slag to form a
      lower viscosity slag for better separation of the molten metal and
      the molten slag. After the molten metal forms and sinks to the
      bottom, the induction heating power continues to heat and maintain
      the temperature of the molten metal. The slag continues to absorb
      microwave energy. After accumulating enough molten slag or molten
      metal, the slag and metal are separately discharged through
      discharge holes 505 and 506 respectively. Holes 505 and 506 were
      blocked with fireclay before they were broken using a steel rod.
      The molten metal can be cast into ingots or a continuous casting,
      or transferred into a refining furnace to remove impurities,
      adjust composition, and control temperature to produce high
      quality alloys. As the molten slag and metal are discharged, more
      raw material is charged into the furnace through the charging port
      503. The heating, ore reduction, melting, discharging and
      recharging continue to cycle.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1. A sample was prepared comprising an iron ore
      concentrate containing 65% Fe mixed with 15% carbon black as the
      reducing agent, 1% lime as the fluxing agent, and 5% pulverized
      coal as an auxiliary fuel. The mixture was charged into a fireclay
      crucible and inserted into a microwave processing system MCR 200,
      which was manufactured by Wavemat, Inc. This unit includes a 2.45
      Ghz microwave generator with 300 to 3,000 watts of power. This
      microwave system can be operated with a tunable, single mode or
      controlled multi-mode microwave cavity. The cavity can be
      evacuated or continuously purged with an inert gas or a reducing
      gas. The sample was heated to 1200 C in ten minutes using a single
      mode with 1 kw power. The temperature was measured using a
      pyrometer on the outer surface of the crucible. The crucible
      inside temperature was not measured but it is believed to have
      been higher than 1200 C. The pulverized coal burned and flame
      appeared during the heating. The sample temperature was maintained
      at about 1200 C for two minutes and then the power was shut off.
      The examination of this sample after is cooled to room temperature
      showed that metal and slag formed. The metal accumulated at the
      bottom and the slag at the top of the crucible. Chemical
      composition analyses shows that the metal contained 1.53% Si,
      97.72% Fe, 0., 42% Al, 0.13% S, and 0.2% C and the slag contained
      53.58% SiO2, 15.48%, FeO, 0,48% CaO, 1.56% MgO, 15.40% A1203,
      0.53% K2O, 0.39% MnO, and 12.59% TiO2.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2. A sample was prepared comprising Cu2S powder mixed with
      a stoichiometric amount of carbon black, i. e., 7.5% as a reducing
      agent. The mixture was charged into a fireclay crucible covered
      with a fireclay disk and placed into the microwave processing
      system MCR 200. The microwave cavity was continuously purged with
      N2 and the exhaust port of the cavity was connected to a scrubber.
      The scrubber consisted of a glass flask with a side tube and a
      rubber stopper to seal its mouth. The flask was half filled with
      an alkaline 10% NaOH solution. A tube passed through the rubber
      stopper and one end of the tube was submerged in the alkaline
      solution. The other end of the tube was connected to the exhaust
      port of the microwave cavity with a hose. During heating, a lot of
      smoke came out of the sample and was introduced into the NaOH
      solution. The sample was heated to 1100 C in 5 minutes using a
      single mode. The temperature was measured using a pyrometer on the
      outer surface of the crucible. The temperature was maintained at
      about 1100 C for two minutes and the power was then turned off. It
      was found that copper accumulated the bottom and a slag formed on
      the top of the crucible. An analysis indicted that the scrubber
      solution contained sulphur. <br>
