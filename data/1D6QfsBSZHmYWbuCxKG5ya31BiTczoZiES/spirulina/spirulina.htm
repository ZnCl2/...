          <br>
          Spirulina is a microscopic blue-green alga in the shape of a
          spiral coil, living both in sea and fresh water. Spirulina is
          the common name for human and animal food produced primarily
          from two species of cyanobacteria: Arthrospira platensis, and
          Arthrospira maxima. Though referred to as 'algae' because they
          are aquatic organisms capable of photosynthesis, cyanobacteria
          are not related to any of the various eukaryotic algae.[1]<br>
          <br>
          Arthrospira is cultivated around the world, and is used as a
          human dietary supplement, as well as a whole food, and is
          available in tablet, flake, and powder form. It is also used
          as a feed supplement in the aquaculture, aquarium, and poultry
          industries.[2]<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arthrospira</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Arthrospira are free-floating filamentous cyanobacteria
          characterized by cylindrical, multicellular trichomes in an
          open left-hand helix. They occur naturally in tropical and
          subtropical lakes with high pH and high concentrations of
          carbonate and bicarbonate. Arthrospira platensis occurs in
          Africa, Asia and South America, whereas Arthrospira maxima is
          confined to Central America.[2]<br>
          <br>
          These maxima and platensis species were once classified in the
          genus Spirulina. There is now agreement that they are in fact
          Arthrospira; nevertheless, and somewhat confusingly, the older
          term Spirulina remains in use for historical reasons.[2][3]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          An illustration from the Florentine Codex showing how the
          Aztecs harvested spirulina off lakes by skimming the surface
          with ropes (right) and then drying the algae into square cakes
          which would be eaten as a nourishing condiment (left).<br>
          <br>
          Spirulina was a food source for the Aztecs and other
          Mesoamericans until the 16th century; its harvesting from Lake
          Texcoco and subsequent sale as cakes is described by one of
          Cortés' soldiers.[4][5] The Aztecs called it Tecuitlatl,
          meaning stone's excrement.<br>
          <br>
          Spirulina was found in abundance at Lake Texcoco by French
          researchers in the 1960s, but there is no reference to its use
          there as a daily food source after the 16th century.[3] The
          first large-scale spirulina production plant, run by Sosa
          Texcoco, was established there in the early 1970s.[2]<br>
          <br>
          Leo Szilard postulated the development of algae-based food
          supplements (which he called "Amruss") in his 1961 short
          story, The Voice of the Dolphins.<br>
          <br>
          Spirulina may have an even longer history in Chad, as far back
          as the 9th century Kanem Empire.[citation needed] It is still
          in daily use today, dried into cakes called dihé, which are
          used to make broths for meals, and also sold in markets. The
          spirulina is harvested from small lakes and ponds around Lake
          Chad.[6]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cultivation</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Most cultivated spirulina is produced in open-channel raceway
          ponds, with paddle-wheels used to agitate the water. The
          largest commercial producers of spirulina are located in the
          United States, Thailand, India, Taiwan, China, Pakistan, Burma
          (a.k.a. Myanmar) and Chile .[2]<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Protein</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina contains an unusually high amount of protein with,
          between 55% and 77% by dry weight[7], depending upon the
          source. It is a complete protein,[8] containing all essential
          amino acids, though with reduced amounts of methionine,
          cysteine, and lysine when compared to the proteins of meat,
          eggs, and milk.[citation needed] It is, however, superior to
          typical plant protein, such as that from legumes.[3] [9]<br>
          [edit] Essential fatty acids<br>
          <br>
          Spirulina is rich in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), and also
          provides alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA),
          stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),
          docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).[9][10]<br>
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Vitamins</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina contains vitamin B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3
          (nicotinamide), B6 (pyridoxine), B9 (folic acid), vitamin C,
          vitamin D, vitamin A, and vitamin E.[9][10]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">B12</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The bioavailability of vitamin B12 in spirulina is in dispute.
          Several biological assays have been used to test for the
          presence of vitamin B12.[11] The most popular is the US
          Pharmacopeia method using the Lactobacillus leichmannii assay.
          Studies using this method have shown spirulina to be a minimal
          source of bioavailable vitamin B12.[12] However, this assay
          does not differentiate between true B12 (cobalamin) and
          similar compounds (corrinoids) that cannot be used in human
          metabolism. Cyanotech, a grower of spirulina, claims to have
          done a more recent assay, which has shown spirulina to be a
          significant source of cobalamin. However, the assay is not
          published for scientific review, so the validity of this assay
          is in doubt.[13] The American Dietetic Association and
          Dietitians of Canada in their position paper on vegetarian
          diets state that spirulina cannot be counted on as a reliable
          source of active vitamin B12.[14]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Minerals</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina is a rich source of potassium, and also contains
          calcium, chromium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese,
          phosphorus, selenium, sodium, and zinc.[9][10]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Photosynthetic pigments</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina contains many pigments, including chlorophyll-a,
          xanthophyll, beta-carotene, echinenone, myxoxanthophyll,
          zeaxanthin, canthaxanthin, diatoxanthin, 3'-hydroxyechinenone,
          beta-cryptoxanthin and oscillaxanthin, plus the
          phycobiliproteins c-phycocyanin and allophycocyanin.[2]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Considerations and Potential
            Dangers</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina contains phenylalanine, which should be avoided by
          people who have the metabolic disorder phenylketonuria, where
          the body cannot metabolize this amino acid, and it builds up
          in the brain, causing damage.[15] Because spirulina is a
          dietary supplement, the United States Food and Drug
          Administration does not regulate the production and quality of
          the product. Although rare, cyanobacteria like Spirulina may
          contain toxins called microcystins, which accumulate in the
          liver and can potentially cause cancer or other liver
          diseases. Currently, no standard exists to regulate the safety
          of spirulina.[16]<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina extract inhibits HIV replication in human T-cells,
          peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and Langerhans
          cells.[17]<br>
          <br>
          An in vitro study in 2008 concluded that Spirulina may possess
          iron chelating properties. Human neuroblastoma cells were
          treated with a toxic amount of iron, and then treated with
          Spirulina. When treated, the iron-induced oxidative stress was
          reduced.[18]<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina helps prevent heart damage caused by chemotherapy
          using Doxorubicin, without interfering with its antitumor
          activity.[19] Spirulina reduces the severity of strokes and
          improves recovery of motor control after a stroke;[20]
          reverses age-related declines in memory and learning;[21] and
          prevents and treats hay fever.[22]<br>
          <br>
          A study on the metabolism of mice indicates that it has little
          effect on their metabolism, and therefore probably that of
          humans, too.[23]<br>
          <br>
          A study with diabetic rats concluded that Spirulina maxima was
          effective in correcting the abnormal carbohydrate and lipid
          metabolisms caused by excess fructose within the body.[24]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Human Research</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Spirulina has been found to increase weight gain and correct
          anemia in both HIV-infected and HIV-negative undernourished
          children[25] because of its excellent nutritional quality.
          Spirulina is effective for the clinical improvement of
          melanosis and keratosis due to chronic arsenic poisoning.[26]<br>
          <br>
          A study in 2005 found that spirulina protects against hay
          fever.[27] A more recent double-blind, placebo-controlled
          study in 2008 concerning 150 allergic rhinitis patients found
          that Spirulina platensis significantly reduced the secretion
          of pro-inflammatory interleukin-4 by 32%, and the patients
          experienced symptomatic relief.[28] Furthermore, Spirulina was
          found to reduce the inflammation involved in arthritis in
          geriatric patients by stimulating the secretion of
          interleukin-2, which helps in regulating the inflammatory
          response.[29]<br>
          <br>
          A 2007 study[30] found that 36 volunteers taking 4.5 grams of
          spirulina per day, over a six week period, exhibited
          significant changes in cholesterol and blood pressure: (1)
          lowered total cholesterol; (2) increased HDL cholesterol; (3)
          lowered triglycerides; and (4) lowered systolic and diastolic
          blood pressure. This study, however, did not contain a control
          group; researchers cannot be confident that the changes
          observed are due totally, or even partially, to the effects of
          the Spirulina maxima, as opposed to other confounding
          variables (i.e., history effects, maturation effects or demand
          characteristics). A randomized, double-blind,
          placebo-controlled intervention study involving geriatric
          patients determined that spirulina helped to significantly
          reduce the LDL-to-HDL ratio after four months of
          supplementation.[29]<br>
          <br>
          A 2007 study concluded that spirulina improved the antioxidant
          potential of many geriatric patients who were administered it
          for 16 weeks. The plasma of these patients showed a measured
          increased level of total antioxidant status.[29] A
          double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 2006 found that
          spirulina supplementation decreased the amount of creatine
          kinase ( an indicator of muscular breakdown) in individuals
          after exercise. Furthermore, the experimental group's time to
          exhaustion during all out treadmill exercise increased by 52
          seconds. These effects were thought to be due to spirulina's
          antioxidant potential.[31]<br>

          was not well understood.<br>
          <br>
          There are no known side effects to spirulina, however the body
          may react to the consumption of it with symptoms including
          fever, dizziness, nausea, rashes or itchiness[32].<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Organic Certification</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Until recently, much spirulina was certified organic. In 2002,
          the USDA's National Organic Standards Board voted to disallow
          the use of Chilean nitrate. They granted a three-year window
          to spirulina producers, which expired in 2006. As a result,
          leading spirulina manufacturers have stopped labelling their
          spirulina as organic, citing safety concerns of nitrate
          alternatives.[33]<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Advocates</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The United Nations World Food Conference in 1974 lauded
          spirulina as the 'best food for the future'. Recognizing the
          inherent potential of spirulina in the sustainable development
          agenda, several Member States of the United Nations came
          together to form an intergovernmental organization named the
          Intergovernmental Institution for the use of Micro-algae
          Spirulina Against Malnutrition (IIMSAM).[34] IIMSAM aspires to
          build a consensus with the UN Member States, international
          community and other stakeholders to make spirulina a key
          driver to eradicate malnutrition, achieve food security and
          bridge the health divide throughout the world.<br>
          <br>
          Spirulina has been proposed by both NASA (CELSS)[35] and the
          European Space Agency (MELISSA)[36] as one of the primary
          foods to be cultivated during long-term space missions.<br>

          blue-green algae as a world food resource. Proteus was funded
          by a group of private California investors committed to the
          vision and hope spirulina represented. Joined by myself, this
          team began cultivation in the late 1970s....<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The invention
      relates to a method for promoting the polysaccharide accumulation
      of spirulina cells, which is characterized by standing cultured
      spirulina to make the spirulina float, irradiating the floating
      spirulina by strong light before processing and drying to make the
      cells to sink under high temperature, collecting and washing the
      sunken cells to obtain algae mud with high polysaccharide content
      or prepare a dry powder product or be used as the material for
      extracting spirulina polysaccharide. Therefore, enterprises can
      extract spirulina polysaccharide of more folds from the product on
      the basis of equivalent production capacity. With the method, the
      production cost of the spirulina polysaccharide can be greatly
      reduced, and the method provides a material basis for the wide
      application of the spirulina polysaccharide, thereby greatly
      improving the economic benefits of the enterprises and increasing
      the competition of the enterprises in markets. <br>

      spirulina is called fresh water spirulina or seawater spirulina,
      and the two culture modes both need a culture pool which is
      suitable for the growth of the spirulina. However, the domestic
      culture of the spirulina enjoys extensive development space. The
      invention provides the nutrient solution suitable for the domestic
      culture of the spirulina. The nutrient solution is prepared from
      fresh water, inorganic salt and trace elements. The invention is
      mainly used for the domestic culture of the spirulina, can
      regulate the growth rule of the spirulina aiming at the
      physiological characteristic of the spirulina, promotes the growth
      and the development of the spirulina, improves the product quality
