      <p>You hear about how a 69 year old guy is trying to set a world
        record by traveling from Hawaii to Japan in a ‘Wave Powered
        Boat’ and you feel that age is truly a number. I suppose you are
        only as old or in case of Horie, as young as you feel. This
        amazing ocean traveler is like the modern day Sindbad as he
        tries once again something that has been never tried before.
        This is the same guy that made a solo trip across the Pacific in
        1999 on a catamaran made from recycled beer barrels. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p>The Japanese sailor is planning a solo 4,350 mile trip from
        Hawaii to Japan using the most advanced wave powered boat on the
        planet. If successful, the trip would earn him a Guinness record
        while simultaneously proving the viability of wave powered
        propulsion. His boat, the Suntory Mermaid II, turns wave energy
        into thrust using two fins mounted beneath the bow. These fins
        move up and down with the waves and use them to generate ‘kicks’
        that propel the boat forward. Wave energy might not replace the
        conventional energy sources as of yet but it could be a very
        useful supplement. </p>
      <p>Wave energy can be used by those who just like to spend some
        time of the ocean and just go beyond the horizon for a lovely
        trip. If time is not an issue then this is probably a very good
        choice. But the trip Ken will be on is no fun ferry and it will
        be a dangerous endeavor as he will have no fuel at his
        possession. The problem is that the new fangled technology will
        only manage to scrape together a top speed of 5 knots.
        Therefore, it will take about three months to achieve what a
        diesel powered boat can achieve in only one. Plus, all of the
        radios and electrical equipment are solar powered. So if it is a
        bad weather day and a problem hits the boat, then it can get
        pretty tricky. One wishes him luck on his tough journey and
        hopefully we will report the trips success come 3 months time. </p>

        <p><b><i>A new propulsion system for boats ditches the diesel</i></b>
          <br>
          <b>by</b> <br>
          <b>John Geoghegan</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This month, 69-year-old Japanese sailor Ken-ichi Horie will
        attempt to captain the world’s most advanced wave-powered boat
        4,350 miles from Hawaii to Japan. If all goes as planned, he’ll
        set the first Guinness world record for the longest distance
        traveled by a wave-powered boat and, along the way, show off the
        greenest nautical propulsion system since the sail. </p>
      <p>A simple spring system enables twin fins beneath the bow of the
        Suntory to move up and down with the incoming waves and pull the
        boat forward. </p>
      <p>At the heart of the record-setting bid is the Suntory Mermaid
        II, a three-ton catamaran made of recycled aluminum alloy that
        turns wave energy into thrust. Two fins mounted side by side
        beneath the bow move up and down with the incoming waves and
        generate dolphin-like kicks that propel the boat forward. “Waves
        are a negative factor for a ship — they slow it down,” says
        Yutaka Terao, an engineering professor at Tokai University in
        Japan who designed the boat’s propulsion system. “But the
        Suntory can transform wave energy into propulsive power
        regardless of where the wave comes from.” </p>
      <p>Horie’s latest adventure builds on a storied career of
        eco-sailing. In 1993 he pedaled a boat 4,660 miles, from Hawaii
        to Okinawa, setting a world record for the longest distance
        traveled by a pedal-powered boat. </p>
      <p>In 1996 he set the world record for the fastest crossing of the
        Pacific Ocean in a solar-powered boat. And in 1999, he made a
        solo trip across the Pacific in a catamaran made from recycled
        beer barrels. </p>
      <p>With a maximum speed of five knots, the Suntory will take two
        to three months to complete a voyage that diesel-powered craft
        accomplish in just one. But speed is not the point. The voyage
        aims to prove that wave propulsion can work under real-world
        conditions, opening up the technology for commercial
        applications such as cargo shipping. “Oil is a limited power
        source,” Horie says, “but there is no limit to waves.” </p>
      <p><b>How to Ride Waves Across the Pacific</b> </p>
      <p><i>Electricity --&nbsp;</i> A set of eight solar panels
        produces 560 watts to run the navigation lights, ham radio,
        satellite phone and PC. </p>
      <p><i>Propulsion --&nbsp;</i> Dual fins set in a side-by-side
        configuration beneath the bow convert wave energy into a
        dolphin-like kick that can propel the three-ton boat at five
        knots. </p>
      <p><i>Stability --&nbsp;</i> The fins absorb energy from the
        rocking of the boat to help make the propulsion more efficient.

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using the power of the waves
          to drive a stationary power plant has been proposed before,
          but it remained for a Long Beach CA inventor to design a
          wave-operated mechanism to propel a boat. Models used to try
          out the odd principle are reported to have shown surprising
          speed in tests, one miniature 18-inch craft attaining a pace
          of 5 miles an hour. Similar gear, the inventor suggests, could
          be applied to any full-sized craft, and could be attached or
          removed at will. The equipment comprises three fins attached
          to flexible joints, which are set vibrating by the slightest
          motion of the water, and are interconnected in such a way that
          they transform the vertical movement of the waves into
          impulses that drive the boat forward.</font> </p>

        <p><b>Fishtail Drive PROPELS BOATS and MODEL PLANES</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>FOR ten years, Arthur D. Hill, Jr., a California commercial
        fisherman, has been observing and studying how the vibrating
        tails of fish enable them to dart through the water at great
        speeds. He also noted that birds, with their flapping wings,
        were still more efficient in flight than the most modern of
        airplanes with fixed wings. Puzzling out the principles
        involved, Hill determined to combine the methods of bird and
        fish, and he has finally developed an odd fishtail drive for
        Propelling model airplanes, and boats ranging from toy craft up
        to vessels thirty-five feet in length. On tiny boats having a
        single rudder, Hill’s fishtail mechanism is vibrated back and
        forth by means of an ordinary door-bell buzzer, powered by two
        dry-cell batteries. By reversing the rudder, the flutterings
        cause the craft to move backward. Dry-cell batteries also power
        the vibrating wings of Hill’s model airplane, shown in the
        photograph above. When suspended from the ceiling on a string,
        the little ship whirls around a circular course, its wings
        whirring so rapidly that they become invisible. For rowboat and
        canoe use, the inventor connects his fishtail propellers to
        handles, which the operator pumps up and down. This is said to
        drive the boat forward three feet for every foot the power
        device moves. On small toy boats and planes, such as shown in
        the accompanying illustrations, the fishtail drives are made of
        wood and silk, while for the larger craft airplane linen covered
        with creosote is used. </p>

      <b>Abstract</b> -- A wave energy propulsion device for converting
      wave energy into mechanical energy may be utilized for electricity
      generation, booster propulsion or seawater desalination. The wave
      energy propulsion device includes a float (1; 10; 1000), a lift
      connecting-rod mechanism (2) and a propeller (3; 30; 3000), the
      float (1; 10; 1000) and the propeller (3; 30; 3000) are provided
      respectively on the upper and lower ends of the lift
      connecting-rod mechanism (2), the propeller (3; 30; 3000) includes
      a boxlike main body which is composed of left and right side walls
      (31, 32; 301) and cross links (30; 302) between them, the
      horizontal projections of the left and right side walls (31, 32;
      301) are linear, the cross link (30; 302) is spanned fixedly
      between the left and right side walls (31, 32; 301), the main body
      has a forward opening (A), a rearward opening (B), an upward
      opening (C) and a downward opening (D), several tilting blades
      (33; 303) are pivotally installed on the main body, the tilting
      blades (33; 303) are composed of foils (331) and horizontal
      axes(332; 304), the axes (332; 304) are spanned between the left
      and right side walls (31, 32; 301), the foils (331) tilt up and
      down around the axes (332; 304), each blade (33; 303) is equipped
      with a limitation mechanism for limiting the upper and lower
      tilting amplitude (H1, H2) of the back end of the tilting blade
      (33; 303) to make the upper and lower tilting amplitude (H1, H2)
      less than the end tilting length (L1) of the tilting blade (33;
      303). Preferably the lift connecting-rod mechanism (2) includes
      two connecting rods (20; 2000) perpendicular to the horizontal
      plane and a transmission mechanism. Further preferably the
      transmission mechanism includes a front linkage (4000) and a rear
      linkage (5000), one end of the front linkage (4000) is fixed on
      the front end of the float (1000), the other end of that is fixed
      on the front end of the main body of the propeller (3000), whereas
      one end of the rear linkage (5000) is fixed on the rear end of the
      float (1000), the other end of that is fixed on the rear end of
      the main body of the propeller (3000).
