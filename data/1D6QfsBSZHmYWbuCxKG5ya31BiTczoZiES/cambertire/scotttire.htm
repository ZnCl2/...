      A US inventor claims he has patented a new product which will
      revolutionise the tyres industry.<br>
      <br>
      And the CamberTire, which includes a trapezoid profile and
      asymmetical sidewalls into the design of conventional tyres, is
      getting ready to hit the roads.<br>
      <br>
      Inventor John Robins Scott said: “This advancement will
      revolutionise the tyre industry and we are ready to bring it to
      market.<br>
      <br>
      “The benefits this design offers are significant to a
      traditionally slow changing industry – we have, literally,
      reinvented the wheel.”<br>
      <br>
      His US based company Optima Sports LLC has just released the
      patented CamberTire and he believes the benefit it delivers
      include better handling and braking performance, safety and fuel
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Camber designs can reportedly be utilised on virtually every tyre
      category currently available on the market, and a switch over to
      the production of tyres incorporating CamberTire developments is
      said to be achievable just by altering the tyre moulds and making
      adjustments to alignment settings.<br>
      <br>
      Optima Sports claims that: “Introducing camber into a tyre, and
      eliminating the need to have toe-in alignment settings, brings
      significant benefits including improved fuel efficiency, enhanced
      handling and performance and improved safety with decreased
      incidence of rollovers.<br>
      <br>
      “Environmental benefits are significant as well, with improved
      realised mileage due to a reduction in rolling resistance and wind
      profile, extended tyre life and less material usage allowing
      narrower tyre profiles to achieve desired handling characteristics
      with less weight.”<br>
      <br>
      The June 2010 issue of US publication ‘Automobile Magazine’ lists
      camber tyres as being one of the top ten most significant emerging
      technologies, and likens the importance of Scott’s invention <br>

      Cambertire technology is able to be applied to every day
      applications as well as sport and track use. Vehicles equipped
      with more camber from the factory often experience inner tire
      wear. Using a Cambertire on vehicles like this will increase tire
      life as well as handling.<br>
      <br>
      On the track, Cambertire technology really shows it brute. Using a
      3 or 4 degree tire allows for the suspension to have an aggressive
      camber stance which is normally done for cornering and handling
      stability, however, tires without camber built in lose much of
      their contact patch with this procedure. The Cambertire corrects
      for this! Racers can camber amounts safely up to 5 degrees without
      sacrificing tire life, the benefits on the track are nearly
      endless!<br>
      <br>
      Our innovation didn't stop with just adding camber, we looked
      deeper into cornering and discovered that tire "roll" also caused
      a loss of handling ability. To compensate for this, we added in
      what we call a "rocker" on both the inner and outer corners of the
      tire tread pattern. As a tire "rolls" side to side from cornering
      g-forces, the shelf offers extra contact on the rolling edge
      resulting in skid pad results exceeding 1G on a street legal tire!<br>
      <br>
      Such incredible claims can be difficult to believe, we encourage
      our guests to visit our "In the media" page to see what
      professionals around the world think of our tires through road
      tests! You'll never look at tires the same again.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OVERVIEW</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Cambertire is a revolutionary technology that changes the
      paradigm of conventional radial tires. Compared to conventional
      tires, Cambertire technology offers better wet and dry handling,
      better on-center feel and improved safety during emergency
      maneuvers. Cambertire technology improves tire wear and reduces
      rolling resistance improving fuel economy. Another benefit of
      Cambertire technology is the ability to prevent vehicle rollover,
      a very important design characteristic for SUVs and mini vans. It
      is a known fact that reducing un-sprung weight always improves
      handling and allows suspension systems to operate with improved
      efficiency. Reducing required tire weight, width, wind profile,
      and rolling resistance can contribute to increased acceleration
      and lessen the load on braking systems (reduced throw weight on
      spin-up and deceleration). Trailer tires are another significant
      future market for both the Cambertire and tread “rocker”
      technologies for safety as well as economical reasons. Economical
      that is for both the truckers who benefit mileage and the
      taxpayers because Cambertires spread the load more evenly which
      makes the roads last longer!<br>
      Intellectual Property<br>
      <br>
      Currently Cambertire has three pending utility patents that
      complement the existing Cambertire U.S. Utility Patent 5,975,176,
      as well as stand-alone. The three pending utility patents include
      "Methods and Processes for Manufacturing Asymmetrical Tires",
      "Active Morphing Variable Tread Depth", and "Tire having a
      Sidewall Extension for Corning Support" aka "tread rockers."<br>
      Tire having a constantly decreasing diameter<br>
      Abstract<br>
      <br>
      A tire having a decreasing profile diameter includes an outside
      sidewall with a greater height than the inside sidewall. The inner
      diameters of each sidewall are preferably identical. The outer
      diameter of the outside sidewall is greater than the outer
      diameter of the inside sidewall. The cross-section of the width of
      the tread has a substantially constant thickness from the inside
      tread diameter to the tread surface of the tire. The depth of the
      tread is preferably constant across the width of the tread
      surface. <br>

      In 1839, Charles Goodyear accidentally discovered how rubber could
      be 'vulcanized.' Since then, the most notable tire advancements
      can be counted on one hand. Scot Robert Thompson invented the
      pneumatic tire in 1846. (Forty-two years later, Dr. John Dunlop
      had to reinvent Thompson's discarded idea.) Michelin patented the
      steel-belted radial in 1946. Tubeless tires arrived in 1954
      followed by the first run-flat designs in 1958 and low-profile
      sidewalls in 1968.<br>

      <br>
      Add to this list of fearless pioneers John Scott who recently
      offered us what he calls a Camber Tire for testing and evaluation.
      In our June 2010 issue, Automobile Magazine selected this as one
      of the ten most significant emerging technologies. Now that we've
      enjoyed a few miles over the road on these tires and had the
      chance to conduct two preliminary performance tests, we're more
      convinced that the Camber Tire concept is worthy of our acclaim.<br>
      <br>
      Twelve years ago, Scott -- a successful Wisconsin car dealer and
      mortgage broker -- was inspired by the sight of a grossly
      overloaded Lexus sedan exhibiting excessive rear wheel and tire
      camber. Instead of running vertically, the tops of the rear tires
      were tipped sharply inward. While most of us would have moved on
      to the next item in our daily routines, Scott was convinced there
      was something to be gained by orienting tires in this braced
      sea-leg manner. With his father's backing he sketched his Camber
      Tire idea and hired an attorney to conduct a patent search. In
      1999, he was issued US Patent 5975176 for a "tire with a
      constantly decreasing diameter." Scott had invented the
      asymmetrical profile with an inner sidewall significantly shorter
      than the outer sidewall. While negative camber angles up to ten
      degrees might be beneficial, the first experimental tires Scott
      had made are molded with the tread angled two degrees.<br>
      <br>
      In conjunction with a suspension adjusted to suit this radically
      different cross-section, Scott's Camber Tire delivers a long list
      of claimed benefits:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Quieter running<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reduced tread wear<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More predictable response during emergency
      maneuvers<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Increased track width<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved handling, braking, and high-speed
      stability<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Improved straight-line steering<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Superior performance during oval track racing<br>
      <br>
      (See Scott's website, www.cambertire.com, for the patent
      disclosure and detailed list of performance claims.)<br>
      <br>
      This sounds like too much to be true. The skeptic in us wondered
      why the major tire makers weren't on to this trick if it really
      paid such handsome dividends. There had to be a hitch. Driving on
      Camber Tires at the ragged limits of performance was the only way
      to see if they lived up to Scott's promises. When he offered that
      opportunity with some experimental tires manufactured by his
      initial partner M&amp;H, we were the first independent
      organization to put Camber Tires to the test.<br>
      <br>
      Before adjourning to the track, this primer might be useful. The
      phenomenon called camber thrust is what a leaning motorcycle uses
      to assume a curved path. Tipping the tops of both tires towards
      the center of a bend develops lateral forces at the two points
      where the bike's tire treads contact the pavement. These lateral
      forces, in combination with small steering angles, are what allows
      motorcycles to follow a curved cornering path.<br>
      <br>
      Camber thrust is also useful in four-wheeled vehicles. The main
      benefit associated with tipping the tires off a perfectly vertical
      orientation is compensating for the body's outward lean in a
      corner. Ideally, the entire tire tread should stay firmly and
      evenly planted against the pavement. Unfortunately, that ideal
      situation is disturbed by body lean and by the typical suspension
      system's inability to fully compensate for the tipping body.<br>
      <br>
      Car and tire designers avoid significant camber angles because, if
      one front tire runs at a camber angle and the other doesn't, the
      car can feel twitchy and unpredictable on a straight path. Also,
      uneven tread wear occurs with tires rolling at steep camber
      angles.<br>
      <br>
      The beauty of the Camber Tire is that its tread runs flat. Scott
      claims that his prototype tire treads showed normal life in
      long-mileage tests. But the more important benefit is the camber
      thrust available to enhance cornering ability without waiting for
      body roll or suspension deflection.<br>
      <br>
      Forty years ago, racing driver-engineer Mark Donohue was so
      intrigued by the possible benefits of cambered tires that his crew
      constructed an experimental AMC Javelin for the Trans Am series
      combining cambered wheels with a live rear axle. Today, Goodyear
      is exploiting cambered tires in NASCAR. Since Sprint Cup cars only
      turn left on oval tracks, it's beneficial to have the outboard
      tires running at steep negative (top towards the car) camber
      angles while the inboard tires operate at steep positive (top away
      from the car) camber. In the middle of a high-speed corner, when
      the body rolls a few degrees, this setup provides the ideal
      upright orientation, allowing all four tires to generate maximum
      adhesion.<br>
      <br>
      The tests we conducted at the Bosch proving grounds in Flat Rock,
      Michigan, over south-eastern Michigan public roads, and at the
      Tire Rack's testing facilities near South Bend, Indiana, were
      rudimentary by design and intent. The goal was to determine if the
      Camber Tire could deliver Scott's phenomenal claims. We used two
      Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution test cars - one with standard Yokohama
      Advan A13 original equipment tires and factory camber settings
      (see results chart), one with front and rear suspensions reset
      with negative camber. Scott's Optima Sports enterprise supplied
      two sets of Camber Tires for evaluation -- one molded with a 140
      tread wear rating, the other with R compound tread rubber. (The
      reference Advans have a 180 tread-wear rating -- higher is better.
      R compound rubber is intended for gymkhana or race track use where
      traction is a much higher priority than tread wear. We owe a
      special thanks to Automobile Magazine reader Jermaine Holland who
      generously provided the reference Evo test car and OE tires.)<br>
      <br>
      Our results confirm that Camber Tires do provide measurable
      advantages over conventional rubber designs. Optima's
      standard-tread design (second on the results chart) is a fairly
      close performance match with the original equipment Yokohama
      Advans. (After 23,000 miles of use, one Tire Rack customer rated
      these tires "simply the best tire an Evo driver can get.") The
      R-compound Camber Tire delivered remarkable gains: versus the
      reference Advans, it shortened stopping distance by 11 feet and
      increased cornering grip by more than four percent (left and right
      lateral acceleration average).<br>
      <br>
      Tire engineers would kill for any one-percent gain. Trimming
      braking distance by six percent while increasing cornering grip by
      four percent constitutes a major breakthrough.<br>
      <br>
      We were also impressed at the subjective observations we noted
      with the Camber Tires. They turn in smartly with a purely linear
      and predictable response. The Evo's drift angle was significantly
      reduced over what was demonstrated by the Evo on Advans. At the
      limit of cornering grip, minor changes in steering or throttle
      position were enough to hold the car on the desired line. The
      feedback provided to the driver through the steering wheel and the
      car's minor movements were both clear and concise. The extra grip
      available here should be easy for any driver to use.<br>
      <br>
      Even more amazing is how these radical tires performed on tattered
      Michigan back roads. They showed an uncanny ability to traverse
      pavement imperfections and potholes with much less trauma
      transmitted through the car's chassis. Instead of reverberating
      through the suspension and body structure, each bump was of short
      duration. The Camber Tires ride as if they're filled with
      marshmallows instead of cement.<br>
      <br>
      Where from here? Scott is collaborating with M&amp;H to construct
      more molds so that experimental Camber Tires can be evaluated in
      additional sizes. He also hopes to produce what he calls 'square'
      tires -- radials with identical compounding and construction,
      minus the camber feature -- to facilitate more equitable
      comparison tests. Plans are afoot for Optima Sports to sell some
      Camber Tires in the size we tested here to early adopters such as
      SCCA Solo competitors, track day users, and fanatic street
      drivers. But Scott's ultimate intention is to license this
      technology to major manufacturers with the means to further
      develop his concept. If and when the Camber Tire idea takes hold,
      John Scott will have earned his place next to the true tire heroes
      -- Goodyear, Dunlop, and Michelin.<br>

      A tire having a decreasing profile diameter includes an outside
      sidewall with a greater height than the inside sidewall. The inner
      diameters of each sidewall are preferably identical. The outer
      diameter of the outside sidewall is greater than the outer
      diameter of the inside sidewall. The cross-section of the width of
      the tread has a substantially constant thickness from the inside
      tread diameter to the tread surface of the tire. The depth of the
      tread is preferably constant across the width of the tread
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates generally to tires and more
      specifically to a tire having a decreasing profile diameter which
      has an outside sidewall with a greater height than the inside
      sidewall to provide increased vehicle performance.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Discussion of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There have been numerous attempts at optimizing the handling and
      braking performance of tires through the variation of tread
      designs and profiles. One method of modifying the profile of a
      tire is to decrease the outer diameter of the tire from one
      sidewall to an opposite sidewall. Some examples of this tire
      profile modification can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,435,874 to
      Mirtain et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,210 to Kukimoto, and U.S. Pat.
      No. 4,848,429 to Mezzanotte. Each of these patents disclose a
      tapered or sloping tire profile. However, none of these patents
      disclose a tire profile which has a substantially constant
      cross-sectional thickness across the width of the tread surface.
      Some of these patents also disclose a thread depth which is
      non-constant.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, there is a clearly felt need in the art for a tire
      having a decreasing profile diameter which has a substantially
      constant cross-sectional thickness across the width of the tread
      surface, and a substantially constant tread depth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a
      tire having a decreasing profile diameter which has a
      substantially constant cross-sectional thickness across the width
      of the tread surface, and a substantially constant tread depth.<br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, a tire having a decreasing
      profile diameter includes an outside sidewall which has a greater
      height than the inside sidewall. The inner diameters of each
      sidewall are preferably identical. The outer diameter of the
      outside wall is greater than the outer diameter of the inside
      sidewall. The cross-section of the width of the tread has a
      substantially constant thickness from the inside tread diameter to
      the tread surface of the tire. The depth of the tread is
      preferably substantially constant across the width of the tread
      surface. The decreasing profile is preferably flat as opposed to a
      crown shape. Yet, a crown may still be formed at substantially the
      middle of the tread surface if warranted by a particular
      application.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      tire having a decreasing profile diameter which improves handling
      of a vehicle, because of the tire's increased contact patch with a
      road surface.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further object of the present invention to provide a tire
      having a decreasing profile diameter which improves braking of a
      vehicle, because of the tire's increased contact patch with a road
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a
      tire having a decreasing profile diameter which allows more
      extreme negative camber adjustments to be made to the wheel than
      that of normal tires.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a
      tire having a decreasing profile diameter which widens the track
      of vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a
      tire having a decreasing profile diameter which allows a wider
      tire to fit in a wheel well.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, it is another object of the present invention to provide
      a tire having a decreasing profile diameter which provides for
      more consistent temperatures across the width of the tread surface
      when the temperature of the tire increases.<br>
      <br>

      the present invention will become apparent from the following

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      With reference now to the drawings, and particularly to FIG. 2,
      there is shown a cross-sectional view of a tire having a
      decreasing profile diameter 1. FIG. 1 shows a standard tire
      design. Only a small amount of negative camber is allowed for
      optimal handling performance without prematurely wearing out the
      tread near the inside wall of the tire. The tire having a
      decreasing profile diameter 1 includes an outside sidewall 10
      which is greater in height than the inside diameter sidewall 12.
      The outside sidewall inner diameter "OI" is preferably equal to
      inside sidewall inner diameter "II." It would also be possible to
      fabricate the tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1 for a
      rim that has an outside sidewall inner diameter which is different
      than the inside sidewall inner diameter, while maintaining nearly
      the same performance characteristics. Preferably, the distance
      "OS" from the inner diameter "OI" to the outer diameter "OO" of
      the outside sidewall 10 is greater than the distance "IS" from the
      inner diameter "II" to the outer diameter "IO" of the inside
      sidewall 12. However, outer diameter "OO" is greater than outer
      diameter "OI" whether inner diameter "OI" is equal to inner
      diameter "II" or not. It is preferable that angle A between the
      outside sidewall 10 and the tread surface 14 be 90.1 degrees or
      greater.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows an enlarged cross-sectional view of a tire having a
      decreasing profile diameter 1. It is preferable that the
      cross-section of the tread have a substantially constant distance
      from the inside tread diameter 16 of the tire to the tread surface
      14. Dimensions A, B, and C are preferable equivalent to each
      other. Tread depth is also preferably substantially constant.
      Dimensions D, E, and F are preferable equivalent to each other.
      The decreasing profile of the tread surface 14 is preferably flat
      as opposed to a crown shape of many prior art tire designs. The
      flat shape will provide an improved contact patch with a road
      surface. It is preferable that the belts 20 are substantially
      parallel to the tread surface 14 to enhance the performance
      characteristics previously mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      The substantially constant distance from the inside tread diameter
      16 to the tread surface 14 would be alter if a crown were formed
      in substantially the middle of the tread surface 14. The distance
      between the inside tread diameter 16 and the tread surface 14
      would be least at the edges of the tread surface 14 and would be
      greatest at substantially the middle of the tread surface 14.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferable that the outside sidewall 10 be stiffer than the
      inside sidewall 12 of the tire having a decreasing profile
      diameter 1. The outside sidewall 10 can be made stiffer than the
      inside sidewall 12 by adding at least one extra belt or bias ply
      to the outside sidewall. The stiffer outside sidewall 10 can
      improve cornering performance.<br>
      <br>
      The belt and internal construction of the tire having a decreasing
      profile diameter 1 is preferably that of prior art tires, such as
      radial belt and bias ply constructions. Also, the material which
      the belts are constructed from should include steel, aramid,
      nylon, and kevlar. The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1
      may be fabricated from state of the art rubber compositions being
      presently used in tire construction such as natural rubber, and
      synthetic rubber. The tread pattern can also be that of prior art
      tires. The fabrication of the tire can utilize state of the art
      molding processes. The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1
      is preferably of a tubeless design, but could be of a tube, or
      nonpneumatic design.<br>
      <br>
      It is preferable that the suspension system of the vehicle be
      adjusted to add negative camber as shown in FIG. 2 such that the
      tread surface 14 is substantially parallel to the road surface 18.
      The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1 is intended only
      for a suspension system which may be adjusted to add negative
      camber. The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1 should not
      be used on solid axles, but can be used in front wheel
      applications as well as rear wheel independent suspensions where
      negative camber can be added or adjusted.<br>
      <br>
      The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1 has many secondary
      advantages which result from its unique design. Heat generated
      during extreme cornering is more evenly distributed across the
      tread surface because the tire deforms less than a normal tire
      during cornering. The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1
      will afford the vehicle better cornering performance, because it
      allows the vehicle suspension to be set at extreme angles of
      negative camber. Increased negative camber can improve cornering
      performance.<br>
      <br>
      The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1 increases the
      track width of the vehicle, because the tire protrudes further
      from the width of the vehicle than a normal tire. The tire having
      a decreasing profile diameter 1 allows a wider tire to be placed
      in a wheel well, because the top portion of the tire 1 leans into
      the wheel affording greater clearance or extra clearance for a
      wider tire. The tire having a decreasing profile diameter 1
      affords greater protection to rims than that of the prior art; the
      tire protrudes horizontally further from the rim to protect
      against getting too close to a curb and scraping the rim surface.<br>
      <br>
      The increased control which the tire having a decreasing profile
      diameter 1 provides, makes a vehicle safer to drive. The wide
      track helps prevent high center of gravity vehicles from tipping
      over. Improved cornering increases the chances of retaining
      control of a vehicle during a swerve maneuver. The improved
      braking increases the chances of stopping sooner to avoid hitting
      an object.<br>
      <br>
      While particular embodiments of the invention have been shown and
      described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that
      changes and modifications may be made without departing from the
      invention in its broader aspects, and therefore, the aim in the
      appended claims is to cover all such changes and modifications as
      fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention. The
      invention should not be limited to racing cars or high performance
      cars, but should include passenger cars, vans, sport utility
      vehicles, busses, and semi tractor trailers. <br>
