      Humanoid robots are a step closer after engineers developed
      synthetic muscle that can lift a thousand times its own weight.<br>
      <br>
      The 3D-printable synthetic soft muscle doesn't need an external
      compressor or high voltage equipment as previous models did.<br>
      <br>
      The artificial muscle can push, pull, bend and twist, as well as
      lift weight.<br>
      <br>
      A team of engineers at Columbia University says up until now no
      material has been capable of functioning as a soft muscle.<br>
      <br>
      This is due to an inability to show the desired properties of high
      stress and strain.<br>
      <br>
      Inspired by living organisms, team leader Professor Hod Lipson
      said soft material robotics hold 'great promise' for areas where
      robots need to contact and interact with humans, such as
      manufacturing and healthcare.<br>
      <br>
      He said that, unlike rigid robots, soft robots can replicate
      natural motion, grasping and manipulation, to provide medical and
      other types of assistance, perform delicate tasks, or pick up soft
      objects.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Lipson added: 'We've been making great strides toward
      making robot minds, but robot bodies are still primitive.<br>
      <br>
      'This is a big piece of the puzzle and, like biology, the new
      actuator can be shaped and reshaped a thousand ways.<br>
      <br>
      'We've overcome one of the final barriers to making lifelike
      robots.'<br>

      To achieve an actuator with high strain and high stress coupled
      with low density, study lead author Aslan Miriyev used a silicone
      rubber matrix with ethanol distributed throughout in

      <br>
      The solution combined the elastic properties and extreme volume
      change attributes of other material systems, while also being easy
      to fabricate, low cost, and made of environmentally safe
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      After being 3D-printed into the desired shape, the artificial
      muscle was electrically actuated using a thin resistive wire and
      eight volt low-power.<br>
      <br>
      It was tested in a range of robotic applications where it showed
      significant expansion-contraction ability.<br>
      <br>
      It was capable of expansion up to 900 per cent when electrically
      heated to 80°C (176°F).<br>
      <br>
      Via computer controls, the autonomous unit is capable of
      performing motion tasks in almost any design.<br>

      A self-contained soft actuator three times stronger than natural
      muscle, without the need of externals, signals a breakthrough in
      soft robotics. The artificial muscle in use as a bicep lifts a
      skeleton’s arm to a 90 degree position. Researchers at Columbia
      Engineering have solved a long-standing issue in the creation of
      untethered soft robots whose actions and movements can help mimic
      natural biological systems. Aslan Miriyev and Kenneth Stack, in
      the Creative Machines lab led by Hod Lipson, professor of
      mechanical engineering, have developed a 3D-printable synthetic
      soft muscle, a one-of-a-kind artificial active tissue with
      intrinsic expansion ability that does not require an external
      compressor or high voltage equipment as previous muscles required.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Inspired by natural muscle, a key challenge in soft robotics is to
      develop self-contained electrically driven soft actuators with
      high strain density. Various characteristics of existing
      technologies, such as the high voltages required to trigger
      electroactive polymers ( &gt; 1KV), low strain ( &lt; 10%) of
      shape memory alloys and the need for external compressors and
      pressure-regulating components for hydraulic or pneumatic
      fluidicelastomer actuators, limit their practicality for
      untethered applications. Here we show a single self-contained soft
      robust composite material that combines the elastic properties of
      a polymeric matrix and the extreme volume change accompanying
      liquid–vapor transition. The material combines a high strain (up
      to 900%) and correspondingly high stress (up to 1.3 MPa) with low
      density (0.84 g cm−3). Along with its extremely low cost (about 3
      cent per gram), simplicity of fabrication and
      environment-friendliness, these properties could enable new kinds
      of electrically driven entirely soft robots.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Inspired by biology, researchers aim to develop soft-bodied
      programmable motion in order to combine natural compliance with
      controllable actuation. One of the long standing challenges has
      been the lack of easily processed robust soft actuators with high
      strain density 1,2,3,4,5. Such actuators would be easy to produce
      and to mold, cut, and 3D print into a desired shape, yet would
      produce large macroscopic actuation at relatively low voltage and
      current. Today, soft actuation techniques are based on either
      electroactive polymers 6,7,8,9,10,11,12, shape memory alloys and
      shape memory polymers13,14,15, or compressed air and pressurized
      fluids actuators 16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24. However, the high
      voltages required to trigger electroactive polymers ( &gt; 1KV)
      and low strain ( &lt; 10%) of shape memory alloys, as well as the
      need for external compressors and pressure-regulating components
      for hydraulic16, 18, 21, 24 or pneumatic 16, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23
      fluidic elastomer actuators, limit their miniaturization2, 4, 16
      and practicality for untethered applications. Recent
      demonstrations of actuation based on combustion25 are ideal for
      impact delivery, but are less suitable for controllable
      kinematics.<br>
      <br>
      Phase change materials offer an attractive alternative to
      conventional electromechanical actuators. Such materials rely on
      the mechanical force produced by the rapid expansion that occurs
      at the phase transition temperature. One of the classic examples
      of phase change materials is paraffin, which thermomechanical
      properties were first utilized in early 1930s26 for
      self-regulating vents in greenhouses.While paraffin-based
      actuators can deliver large forces, their strain remains in the
      order of 10% volumetric change26,27,28, a strain that is on par
      with shape memory alloys and too small for most robotics
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      A significantly higher expansion strain may be achieved by
      utilizing reversible liquid–vapor phase transition, but such
      material systems have been traditionally difficult to contain and
      control. A number of recent devices use entrapped liquid inside
      balloons or between thin films, to form expanding
      cavities29,30,31,32. Electrically triggered deformation of soft
      elastomer membranes, utilizing liquid–gas transition of liquid,
      was reported to show large area expansion33. However, such devices
      are challenging to manufacture and to form into arbitrary shapes
      because of their intricate internal design. For example, it is
      difficult to directly cast or 3D-print any of these actuators.<br>
      <br>
      Here we propose a single easily prepared soft robust material that
      combines the elastic properties of a polymeric matrix and the
      extreme volume change of a fluid upon liquid–vapor transition. We
      show and characterize the soft composite material comprised of a
      silicone elastomer matrix with ethanol distributed throughout it
      in micro-bubbles, exhibiting strains up to 900%, and demonstrate
      its use as an actuator in a range of robotic applications.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Materials system and its principles of action</b><br>
      <br>
      Choosing a polymer matrix and a fluid for the composite
      meta-material system was guided by the desired mechanical
      properties of a polymer, boiling point and practical handling
      restrictions of a fluid, and chemical compatibility of the two. We
      aimed to synthesize a cheap, simple, user- and
      environment-friendly material comprised of food-safe and
      bio-compatible materials. We chose PDMS-based silicone elastomer,
      a non-hazardous elastomer widely used for soft robotic
      applications, as a matrix material, and ethanol, a widely used
      alcohol with boiling temperature 78.4 °C and matrix-compatibility,
      as the active fluid (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary
      Discussion for a discussion of the material components choice).<br>
      <br>
      Ethanol, included inside tiny micro-bubbles embedded in the
      elastic silicone rubber matrix, boils upon reaching the liquid–gas
      transition temperature, accompanied by tremendous increase in
      volume, leading to significant expansion of the whole soft
      composite material. This composite material may be quickly and
      easily prepared by mixing ethanol with silicone elastomer
      (Supplementary Movie 1, Supplementary Software 1). The mixed
      material is both castable and 3D-printable (Supplementary Movies
      2, 4), and after preparation will solidify in room-temperature
      curing. We successfully mixed various amounts of ethanol
      (0–33 vol%) in the two-part platinum-catalyzed silicone elastomer
      (Supplementary Fig. 2). In total 20 vol% ethanol was chosen as
      optimal composition.<br>
      <br>
      We show the material as an artificial muscle that can be
      electrically actuated using a thin resistive wire (Fig. 1a) and
      low power characteristics (8 V, 1 A) to exhibit significant
      expansion-contraction ability (Fig. 1b).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Materials</b><br>
      <br>
      We used platinum-catalyzed two-part silicone rubber Ecoflex 00-50
      (Smooth-On, PA, USA) as a matrix material and ethanol ≥ 99.5%
      (Sigma Aldrich, MO, USA) as an active phase change material.
      Properties of the silicone rubber are shown in Table 1 below.
      Material preparation involves thorough hand-mixing of 20 vol% of
      ethanol with silicone elastomer (first with part A for about
      2 min, then mixed with part B for about 2 min). The material is
      ready-to-cast and ready-to-print after the preparation. Room
      temperature curing of the cast or 3D-printed part takes up to 3 h.
      A commercially available 0.25 mm diamter Ni-chrome resistive wire
      was used for electrically driven heating of the artificial muscle
      (i.e., for the actuation). To comply with the expansion of the
      actuator material, a helical spiral shape was chosen for the Ni–Cr
      wire. The wire was hand-wound on an 8 mm screw driver shaft as
      shown in Supplementary Fig. 6.<br>

      Liquid ethanol evaporates with temperature, giving rise to
      internal pressure inside the bubbles, which results in slightly
      expanded silicone elastomer matrix. When ethanol passes the
      liquid–vapor phase transition, extreme volume change occurs and
      the silicone elastomer matrix significantly expands. With growth
      in local pressure, the boiling temperature increases and thus,
      continued heating to temperatures slightly higher than 78.4 °C is
      required for further expansion, until no liquid ethanol remains in
      the bubbles (Fig. 2b). Infrared radiation images of the material
      at room temperature and during expansion (using Ni–Cr spiral) are
      shown in Fig. 2d...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Mechanical properties</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A maximal volume expansion of about 915% was measured at the
      temperature of 90 °C during controlled heating in a wide water
      bath (unconstrained volumetric expansion). We used an Instron
      machine to measure the blocked directional force and actuation
      stress characteristics of the material during its electrical
      actuation using resistive spiral-shaped wire at low power (15 V, 1
      A). ..<br>
      <br>
      <b>Implementation in robotics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We demonstrate the implementation of our composite material as an
      actuator in a variety of robotic applications (Supplementary Movie
      2). First, we show a McKibben-type muscle. Our self-sufficient
      artificial muscle does not require any compressors or
      pressure-regulating equipment (Fig. 4a), and is capable of lifting
      weight much larger than its own (for example, a 13 g actuator
      lifts 1 kg in Fig. 4b). We demonstrate its use as a bicep, which
      contracts and pulls the lower arm up, causing it to bend at the
      elbow (Fig. 4c). The actuator is comprised of the composite
      material placed inside a braided mesh sleeving, fixed at the edges
      (Supplementary Fig. 3). The actuation is electrically driven using
      a spiral-shaped resistive wire (powered at 30 V, 1.5 A) passing
      inside the actuator. During the actuation, the composite material
      expands radially and contacts longitudinally, mimicking natural
      muscle behavior...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The proposed soft composite material demonstrates a combination of
      high strain (up to &gt; 900%) and correspondingly high stress (up
      to 1.3 MPa) at low density (0.84 g cm−3). Even at 100% strain the
      material develops stress of 0.4 MPa and is capable of lifting
      weight about 1700 times greater than its own. These
      characteristics place this material in previously inaccessible
      region of the actuator stress–strain charts (Fig. 5a). Our
      actuators are Pareto-undominated in specific actuation stress
      versus strain (Fig. 5b). We suggest that the strain limit of our
      material is the maximal strain of the silicone elastomer matrix
      (980%, according to the manufacturer). Along with its extremely
      low cost (laboratory cost of about 3 cent per gram), ease of
      fabrication, and environmental friendliness, these properties make
      this material an attractive solution where strain density is a
      critical factor...<br>

        2.4 compared with a single actuator</i><i><br>
      </i><br>
      To summarize, our work proposed a self-contained soft robust
      composite material, combining very high strain and reasonably high
      stress with low density, which is easily produced from
      bio-compatible components at a very low cost. This
      material-actuator may serve in a variety of applications, from
      traditional robotics to advanced bio-medical needs, and may enable
      a new kind of entirely soft robots...<br>

      Disclosed are devices, systems, apparatuses, methods, products,
      and other implementations of vapor pressure solids. In some
      embodiments, a vapor pressure solid may include a one- or
      multi-component matrix material. In some embodiments, the
      multi-components matrix material is a two-part PDMS comprising a
      first and second matrix material. The first matrix material is
      capable of being mixed with one or more vaporizable fluids that
      causes the first matrix material to swell. The second matrix
      material is capable of being mixed with the swelled first matrix
      material to produce an actuating material. When the actuating
      material is heated, the one or more vaporizable fluids expand,
      resulting in vapors. The increased pressure applied by the vapors
      causes the actuating material to expand.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      Actuating or 'smart' materials address the increasing needs of
      creating engineered material systems that provide diverse features
      relating to mechanical actuation, sensor abilities and artificial
      intelligence integration among others. Typically, these types of
      actuating materials are biologically inspired materials that
      integrate biological concepts and features in their structure and
      microstructure in order to create controllable and adaptive
      functionality of the material systems in which they are
      integrated. Furthermore, actuating materials rely on converting an
      input energy into a type of mechanical output such as force or
      displacement. As a result, they require the use of a prime mover
      (e.g., fluid, electromagnetic force etc.) and mechanisms to
      convert the functions of the prime mover to the desired effect.
      However, conventional actuating materials are inefficient. For
      example, the use of fluids in actuating materials requires
      hydraulic systems in order to provide adaptive control. Such
      hydraulic systems require the use of electric motors to power them
      and may also be prone to faults and defects. As a result, this may
      require several components that are not easily manufactured and
      that impair the ability to miniaturize the actuating system.
      Further, these components are not easily created with 3D printing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      In some embodiments, methods and articles of manufacture for vapor
      pressure solids are provided. Specifically, articles of
      manufacture for electrochemical actuating materials are provided
      along with techniques for using and making the same. The methods
      disclosed herein, allow for the creation of 'smart' materials that
      can be controlled to provide adaptive functionality by applying
      electrically controlled chemical reactions and/or chemomechanical
      reactions that result in a change of volume (e.g., displacement)
      and a conversion of input energy to mechanical energy. Actuating
      materials are increasingly used in areas where conventional
      actuators may not be suitable. Exemplary applications of such
      actuating materials can be found in microscopic and nano devices,
      robotic implementations (e.g., walkers, grippers, etc.),
      medical/biomedical devices, sensors, chemical equipment and
      architectural constructions.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] In some embodiments, actuating materials are formed by
      composite materials that include one or more materials that can
      have different physical and chemical properties, and which when
      combined, can produce characteristics that are different from the
      properties of the individual components. Moreover, such actuating
      composite materials further include sensing, actuation and
      computation features. Such composite materials include at least
      one constituent material identified as a matrix material. For
      example, the matrix material surrounds and supports other
      reinforcement materials that enhance the matrix properties. In
      some embodiments, the actuation composite materials can include
      matrix components such as silicone rubber, latex, polymers (e.g.,
      Polydimethysiloxane ("PDMS"), platinum-catalyzed PDMS,
      tin-catalyzed PDMS), resins etc. Accordingly, such materials do
      not require mechanical or hydraulic components for actuation
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In some embodiments, the matrix material is infused by one
      or more vaporizable fluids, which effectively creates a
      combination of the matrix material properties and those of the
      infused fluid into a single bulk material. For example, such
      vaporizable fluids can include water, ethanol, acetone, glycerine,
      etheric compounds and/or other suitable fluids. In some
      embodiments, the fluid-infused composite materials are exposed to
      heat, which initiates a phase transition process for the
      vaporizable fluid (e.g., liquid-vapor transition). Specifically,
      heating the fluid will produce vapors that can apply pressure and
      inflate the matrix material due to a phase change (e.g.,
      liquid-vapor) and/or due to a volume change, causing it to expand
      and stretch based on its physical properties. In addition, the
      heating of the vaporizable fluid can be achieved in a controlled
      manner such that the resulting expanded material can simulate the
      properties of biological tissue (e.g., muscle). In some
      embodiments, heating can be accomplished using various techniques.
      For example, heating can be accomplished by simple exposure of the
      bulk material to ambient temperature gradients, submersion of the
      bulk material in a water bath of increasing temperature,
      application of hot air using a heat gun, embedding of thermal
      elements (e.g., resistors) directly into the bulk material, mixing
      of conductive material (e.g., black carbon) during the
      manufacturing process of the bulk material and/or suitable
      combinations thereof. In some embodiments, controlled heating can
      be accomplished manually and/or automatically. Specifically,
      controlled heating may be employed using control feedback systems
      (e.g., proportional-integral-derivative ("PID") controllers,
      autonomous learning using machine learning, etc.) that can be
      external to or embedded within the actuating material measuring
      both external and/or internal temperature gradients. In addition,
      controlled heating can be performed in a uniform and/or
      non-uniform manner for one or more actuating materials, thus
      allowing for the actuation of complex structures. Such an
      actuation material can be used in biomimetic robotic
      implementations and/or as a sensor device. In some embodiments,
      the heating of the composite material can be performed in selected
      areas and/or on independent portions of the material. Furthermore,
      condensing the vapor by, for example, reducing the heating (or
      e.g., cooling) of the material can result in the contraction of
      the matrix material to its original state. In some embodiments,
      such functionality of the actuating material can be adaptively
      controlled to operate as a sensor (e.g., pressure, temperature
      sensor).<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In some embodiments, the actuating material can also
      include a seal to ensure that the vaporizable fluid is not able to
      escape the matrix material. Moreover, additional mechanical
      components can be used and/or embedded in the material (e.g.,
      pistons, springs, heating elements) to increase the energy output
      and/or force of the actuating material and allow for its use in
      different systems such as valve piping equipment, chemical
      equipment, etc. In some embodiments, reanimation of the actuating
      material can be performed by injecting, using infiltration,
      extraction and/or suitable procedures that reinfuses the matrix
      material with the vaporizable fluid to recover and/or configure
      the functionality of the matrix material.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In some embodiments, the actuating material can be used as
      an actuator in soft robotic applications. Specifically, the
      expansion and contraction of the actuating material can be used to
      facilitate the motion or manipulation of other robotic components.
      For example, a soft robot can include actuating material coupled
      to a front leg and a rear leg. Actuation and contraction of the
      actuating material will cause the front leg and/or rear leg to
      move, advancing the soft robot in a direction along the axis of
      contraction. In some embodiments, the soft robot can include a
      gripper having two fingers for manipulating an object. Actuation
      of the actuating material will cause the fingers to move inwards
      in a grasping motion and lock onto an object.<br>

        <br>
        DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0021] The disclosed subject matter relates to vapor pressure
      solid articles and methods for making and using the same. In some
      embodiments, vapor pressure solids refer to actuating (e.g.,
      'smart') materials that are capable of producing an output force
      and/or displacement as a result of a chemical reaction. For
      example, such materials include matrix materials that are infused
      with a vaporizable fluid that can expand and/or contract the
      matrix based on its temperature. Additionally, these types of
      materials do not require additional mechanical components to
      provide the actuation (e.g., hydraulics, motors etc.) and, as a
      result, they can be manufactured in bulk using smart geometric
      design (e.g., 3D printing) and allow for miniaturization, thus
      enabling uses in various bio-inspired applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In the following description, reference is made to the
      accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are
      shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the
      inventive principles may be practiced. It is to be understood that
      other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be
      made without departing from the scope of the disclosed subject
      matter.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary method 100 for actuating a
      vapor pressure solid material in accordance with embodiments of
      the disclosed subject matter. Initially, at 102, a composite
      material including at least one constituent material (e.g., a
      matrix material) is provided. Specifically, a matrix material is
      selected to provide support to other materials and can include
      matrix components such as silicone rubber, latex, polymers (e.g.,
      PDMS, platinum-catalyzed PDMS, tin- catalyzed PDMS), resins, or
      other suitable materials. In some embodiments, such a composite
      material can be constructed using a 3D printing technique or other
      suitable composition procedures. Matrix materials and vaporizable
      fluids can be chosen based on their chemical compatibility with
      each other, and other respective properties, such as the fluid's
      boiling point and handling restrictions, the matrix material's
      mechanical properties, or suitable properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] At 104, the matrix material can be infused with a
      vaporizable fluid. In some embodiments an infusion can be
      performed using injections, infiltration of the matrix material or
      by using mechanical apparatuses (e.g., a Soxhlet extractor) or
      using suitable combinations thereof. In some embodiments, an
      infusion can consist of combining the vaporizable fluid with the
      matrix material, captivating the vaporizable fluid and/or soaking
      the matrix material in the vaporizable fluid. Additionally, in
      some embodiments the vaporizable fluid can include water, ethanol,
      acetone, glycerine, etheric compounds and/or other suitable
      fluids. Moreover, in some embodiments, a combination and/or
      emulsion of fluids can be automatically selected based on
      thermodynamic properties and desired output force from the
      actuating material. In some embodiments, the matrix material can
      be infused in an adaptive manner and at different concentrations
      so as to create the desired output.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] At 106, the matrix material is sealed to create an
      insulation for the vaporizable fluid. In some embodiments, a
      sealing layer can be included in the matrix material using
      suitable materials or combinations thereof. Additionally, in some
      embodiments, the sealing layer can be a conductive material.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] At 108, the matrix material, sealing layer and vaporizable
      fluid are heated so as to cause the fluid to vaporize. In some
      embodiments, heating can be accomplished using a heating element
      (e.g., one or more resistors embedded in the material) or through
      conductive heating by applying an adaptively controlled electrical
      current through the actuating material. For example, in such cases
      the actuating material can be modified to include one or more
      conductive elements and can be used alone and/or in combination
      with a conductive heater. Additionally, in some embodiments, a
      heating exchanger can be used to control the heating and/or
      cooling rates of the vaporizable fluid and subsequent expansion
      and contraction rates of the actuating material. Faster heating
      can be achieved using higher current or additional distributed
      heating networks, resulting in quicker vaporization of the
      vaporizable fluid. Similarly, faster cooling rates can be achieved
      based on the actuator's form-factor, surface-to-volume ratio, and
      convection currents. [0027] At 110, heating of the vaporizable
      fluid results in the vaporization of the fluid, and the solid is
      inflated based on the pressure of the vapor. Specifically, such
      inflation of the bulk solid can be a result of the phase
      transition (e.g., liquid- vapor) and/or continuous expansion of
      the vapors. As a result, the actuating material can be dynamically
      stretched and/or contracted based on the vapor pressure infused in
      the matrix material. Moreover, the phase transition of the
      vaporizable fluid into vapor combined with the one or more matrix
      materials can cause large expansion of the matrix, which is not
      typically obtained through other actuating methods. In some
      embodiments, the actuating material can be used in a bimorph
      configuration to allow for mechanical structures that are
      independently controlled and can produce composite output forces.
      For example, such composite materials can be included in piston
      enclosures to provide pneumatic functionality. Additionally, the
      actuating material can also include mechanical components (e.g.,
      springs) in order to increase the output force and/or
      displacement.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIG. 2 shows an example of mixing process 200 of the
      composite material with the vaporizable fluid as discussed in
      connection with FIG. 1 (e.g., element 104). For example, in some
      embodiments, a first part of PDMS gel (PDMS Part-A) composite
      material 202 is mixed with various amounts of ethanol (0-33vol%)
      204. As a result, the mixed ethanol causes swelling of the PDMS
      Part-A gel as shown at 206. Subsequently, at 208, a second part of
      PDMS gel (PDMS Part-B) is added to the swelled gel and mixed
      thoroughly in order to obtain the bulk actuating material at 210.
      Specifically, such mixing process, allows for the introduction of
      air bubbles, occupied by the vaporizable fluid, in the cured
      actuating material providing a solid that contains isolated pores,
      which can be inflated upon the phase transition (e.g.,
      liquid-vapor) and/or continuous expansion of the vaporizable fluid
      (e.g., ethanol). In some embodiments, the vaporizable fluid
      spreads in the inner walls of the bubbles while air and vapors
      remain in the inner part of the bubbles and causes expansion upon
      heating. In some embodiments, the mixed material is both castable
      and 3D-printable, and will solidfy in room-temperature curing.
      During the curing, the vaporizable fluid occupies the air bubbles,
      and creates new pores. The pores are expanded until equilibrium
      between the internal vapor pressure and external environment
      pressure is achieved. In some embodiments, the density of the
      mixed material including 20 vol.% ethanol is 0.84g/cm&lt;3&gt;.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows an example 300 of a vapor pressure solid actuating
      material in accordance with some embodiments of the disclosed
      subject matter. Specifically, vapor pressure solid 302 includes a
      PDMS elastometric matrix material as described in connection with
      FIG. 1 that is infused by a low-melting liquid such as ethanol.
      Specifically, the fluid is infused in the matrix material by
      mixing until the material exhibits swelling properties and the
      ethanol liquid is fully integrated with the PDMS matrix material.
      For example, in some embodiments, desired properties of the
      actuating material can be achieved by adding 0.5ml of liquid to
      each 1ml of PDMS. Upon mixing, the material is left for curing to
      ensure full integration of the vaporizable fluid in the matrix
      material. In some embodiments, curing times can be adaptively
      controlled to allow for different properties of the resulting
      actuating material. After curing, a soft solid material with
      entrapped fluid is obtained (e.g., 302). The actuating material is
      capable of significantly expanding upon heating (e.g., 100vol. %)
      and contracting to its initial dimensions upon cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] FIG. 4 shows an example 400 of a conductive heater that can
      be embedded in the actuating material in accordance with some
      embodiments of the disclosed subject matter. Specifically,
      conductive heater 402 can be produced using 3D printing techniques
      wherein the composite materials include carbon black and PDMS
      matrix material infused in ethanol or other suitable fluids. For
      example, in some embodiments, carbon black material can be added
      to the PDMS along with ethanol by a ratio of O. lg carbon black
      and 0.5ml ethanol to each 1ml of PDMS. The materials can be mixed
      and left to cure in order to provide the desired electrochemical
      properties. For example, such a conductive heater can exhibit a
      resistance of less than 100 Ohm, capable of conducting electrical
      current and allowing for rapid Joule heating while cooling down
      rapidly when the heating is terminated.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] FIG. 5 shows an example 500 of a vapor pressure solid
      actuating material deposited inside the conductive heater 502 as
      described in connection with FIG. 4. Deposition of the vapor
      pressure solid can be performed in various suitable manners. In
      some embodiments, contact between the conductive heater and the
      vapor pressure solid can result in adaptively controlling the
      actuation of the material using selective alteration of heating
      and cooling cycles by means of allowing and/or interrupting the
      passing of the electrical current through the conductive heater.
      Higher current or more evenly distributed heating can produce
      faster expansion. Similarly, better thermal conductivity can
      produce faster cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 6 shows an example 600 of the different phases of an
      actuating material<br>
      <br>
      (e.g., vapor pressure solid) during heating as described in
      connection with FIG. 1. Specifically, matrix material 602 (e.g.,
      silicon rubber matrix) is infused by vaporizable fluid 604 (e.g.,
      ethanol) by for example soaking and curing while at room
      temperature. Subsequently, upon heating the composite material 602
      using a heating element and/or a conductive heating technique,
      vaporizable fluid 604 commences to produce vapors 606. As a
      result, composite material 602 begins to expand and actuates a
      force and/or displacement of volume based on the pressure of the
      vapor.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 7 shows an example 700 of the different microscale
      phases of the preparation and actuation of the bulk actuating
      material (e.g., vapor pressure solid) as discussed above in
      connection with FIGS. 2 and 6. Specifically, at 702, swelled PDMS
      gel infused with ethanol 210 is casted and molded in order to cure
      and attain its final physical properties (e.g., harden, bond etc.)
      In some embodiments, molding and shaping can be performed
      automatically using 3D printing. At 704, the actuating material is
      at the early stages of curing whereby the infused vaporizable
      fluid (e.g., ethanol) has not yet reached its boiling temperature
      (e.g., 78.4 °C). Subsequently, as the actuating material is
      introduced to increasing temperatures at 704 the ethanol liquid is
      exposed to a rising vapor pressure, which leads to an initial
      volume expansion of the actuating bulk material as it approaches
      the fluid's phase transition boiling point (e.g., 78.4 °C) at 706.
      In some embodiments, such initial volume expansion can reach up to
      50% of the original volume. Importantly, once the temperature
      reaches the fluid's phase transition point (e.g., boiling point)
      at 708, the vaporizable fluid (e.g., ethanol) will commence to
      boil leading to an immediate increase of the pressure within the
      bulk material. As a result, at 710, the actuating material will
      start to expand due to the gas expansion in order to equalize the
      external and internal pressure. In some embodiments, such volume
      expansion can reach up to 900% of the original volume at a
      temperature of 95 °C.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows an example 800 of the different actuation phases of
      the bulk actuating material (e.g., vapor pressure solid) and the
      relationships between the local volume, boiling temperature and
      local pressure. For example, at 802 while the actuating material
      is at rest (e.g., room temperature, pressure) no volume expansion
      is observed. At 804, as the material is exposed to increasing
      temperatures reaching the boiling point of the vaporizable fluid,
      the local pressure of the material increases. As a result, the
      volume of the material exhibits an initial expansion, while the
      boiling point of the fluid also increases requiring the exposure
      of the material to constantly increasing temperatures in order to
      sustain the actuation. At 806, once the temperature has exceeded
      the boiling point of the vaporizable fluid, the volume expansion
      is maximized as is the local pressure. In some embodiments, such
      volume maximization allows for the actuating material to lift
      weight that is 6000 times that of its own. [0035] FIG 9 shows a
      graphical representation of results obtained for the disclosed
      vapor pressure solid actuating material compared to other
      actuating materials. Graphic 900 represents a stress-strain curve
      of the different materials whereby stress refers to an internal
      force within the material associated with the deformation of the
      material and strain refers to the relative change in shape and
      size (e.g., deformation) of the material. Graphic 900 shows that
      the vapor pressure solid actuating material exhibits the highest
      strain (e.g., deformation) while experiencing moderate stress to
      achieve the illustrated strain. As a result, such actuating
      material, which does not require the use of additional equipment
      to induce actuation can be used for low-cost, safe and
      controllable miniature soft actuation systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] FIG. 10 shows an example of a vapor pressure solid
      actuating material 302 as discussed previously in reference to
      FIG. 3. Specifically, actuating material 302 is depicted before
      (see FIG. 10A) and after (see FIG. 10B) the phase transition
      process (e.g., liquid-gas transition) of the vaporizable fluid
      (e.g., ethanol) that results to the expansion of the vapor
      pressure solid due to increased heating. The vapor pressure solid
      can be electrically-actuated with a thin-resistive wire operated
      at low power characteristics (e.g., 8V and 1 A).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] FIG. 11 shows a soft-robot using vapor pressure solid
      actuating material 302 (see<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 11A-11E) in accordance with some embodiments of the
      disclosed subject matter. In some embodiments, actuating material
      302 is formed onto a layer of passive PDMS material 1104 and is
      used with rigid component 1102 that is able to move as a result of
      the expansion of the vapor pressure solid actuating material (see
      FIGS. 11A -11B). The passive PDMS material 1104 is formed with a
      first end 1108 and a second end 1110. In some embodiments, the
      first end 1108 is formed with solid materials, and the second end
      is coupled to the rigid component 1102. A notch 1106 can be formed
      in the actuating material 302 to facilitate bending. During
      actuation, the actuating material 302 expands and pushes the first
      end 1108 inwards along the axis of contraction. The actuation
      motion causes the first end 1108 to push against the floor and
      causes the rigid component 1102 to move in the opposite direction,
      along the axis of contraction.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In some embodiments, the layer of passive PDMS material
      1104 includes a solid first end 1112 and a soft second end 1114
      (see FIG 11C). During actuation, the actuating material 302
      expands and bends due to the constricting force near the vicinity
      of the passive PDMS material 1104. As the actuating material 302
      bends, the soft second end 1114 is pulled inward advancing it
      along the axis of actuation. During contraction of the material,
      the solid first end 1112 advances along the same axis while the
      soft second end 1114 remains in place, causing the soft-robot to
      move.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In some embodiments, the layer of passive PDMS material
      1104 includes a gripper having a first finger 1116 and a second
      finger 1118 (see FIGS 1 1D and HE). During actuation, the
      actuating material 302 expands and bends causing fingers 1116 and
      1118 to move inwards in a grasping motion. The actuating material
      302 can remain actuated allowing the fingers 1116 and 1118 to
      grasp and lock onto an object. The force applied by fingers 1116
      and 1118 can be adaptively controlled to enable further
      manipulation of the object. The fingers 1116 and 1118 can be
      coupled to a moveable robotic arm 1120 enabling further
      manipulation and movement of the object. The fingers 1116 and 1118
      can be constructed of soft materials ensuring the safe
      manipulation of fragile items, such as for example, an egg.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 12 shows a soft-robot using a vapor pressure solid
      actuating material in accordance with some embodiments of the
      disclosed subject matter. Specifically the actuating material is
      enclosed in movable member 1202 and coupled to a resistive wire
      conveying electrical current. The movable member 1202 operates
      similarly to a piston and moves triangular base 1204 of a
      pyramidal structure upon heating and subsequent expansion of the
      enclosed actuating material. For example, when the actuating
      material is actuated, the movable member 1202 moves an upper part
      of bar 1206 in a forward direction. Upon contraction of the
      actuating material, the bar 1206 exerts a force against the floor
      moving the pyramidal structure in the forward direction. The
      actuating material can move the pyramidal structure by applying
      current (8V and 1A) through the resistive wire. In some
      embodiments, the actuating material can be embedded in a Teflon
      sleeve.<br>
      <br>

        <b>SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING OF
          ELECTROMECHANICAL ASSEMBLIES &nbsp;</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      A hybrid additive manufacturing approach that incorporates
      three-dimensional (3D) printing and placement of modules selected
      from a library of modules to fabricate an electromechanical
      assembly. By virtue of fabrication of the electromechanical
      assembly, mechanical properties and electrical properties of the
      assembly are created.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The invention relates generally to additive manufacturing.
      More specifically, the invention is directed to a hybrid approach
      that incorporates three-dimensional (3D) printing and placement of
      modules selected from a library of modules to fabricate an
      electromechanical assembly. By virtue of fabrication of the
      electromechanical assembly, mechanical properties and electrical
      properties of the assembly are created.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Additive manufacturing is increasingly becoming a
      significant fabrication technique, both in research and industrial
      settings, applicable to a broad range of applications. Some
      commercially important additive manufacturing examples include,
      for example, low-cost rapid tooling manufacturing, low-volume
      prototype and production runs, medium-volume automotive and
      aerospace applications, dental restoration, orthopedic implants,
      custom orthotics, and user-specific artificial limbs. Furthermore,
      additive manufacturing methods have been used in biomedical
      research settings to create heterogeneous tissues from individual
      precursor cell types and to create functional replacements for
      missing or damaged body parts.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Despite a great deal of effort and the diversity of
      additive manufacturing techniques, no additive manufacturing
      process can fabricate high quality electrical interconnections,
      computational circuits, sensors or actuators in combination with
      mechanical elements in an integrated component, i.e.,
      electromechanical component.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] With Direct-Write electronics (“DW”), or the similar Direct
      Print (“DP”) technique, it has been demonstrated that inkjet
      printers are capable of fabricating transistors, and have used a
      combination of inkjet or digital printing and Fused Deposition
      Modeling (“FDM”) or Stereolithography (“SLA”) to create electrical
      circuits within a 3D printed part. One interesting alternative
      approach uses conventional semiconductor fabrication to create
      very small semiconductor devices that are subsequently blended
      with an ink binder. Although electromagnetic actuators fabricated
      in one process via FDM and DP has been recently demonstrated, it
      is rudimentary at best.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Despite this progress, enormous challenges must be
      overcome. Synthesizing electrically conductive materials with
      volume resistivity similar to bulk metals that can be extruded or
      deposited in a low-temperature environment (so that is it
      process-compatible with other materials in the assembly) remains
      an elusive challenge. The current state of the art, available from
      various vendors, employs powdered metal inks that are
      solvent-borne and achieve volume resistivity that is four times
      (4×) to ten times (10×) larger than bulk metal in the case of
      silver, and 10× to 50× for copper. These materials require a
      post-process sintering step, typically by heating to between 80
      and 150 degrees Celsius (° C.) in order to achieve the stated
      resistivity, which can be difficult to integrate with other
      heat-sensitive components within the assembly. The active devices
      such as transistors that have been fabricated thus far have lower
      carrier mobility and lower on-off ratios than similar devices
      fabricated in silicon.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Printed transistors using complementary logic (p-channel
      and n-channel devices) have been combined to produce
      ring-oscillators, inverters and NAND (“Not AND”) gates; however
      low fabrication-temperature organic transistors rely on
      semiconductor materials that offer dramatically lower charge
      carrier mobilities than are available via conventional
      semiconductor fabrication techniques. The large discrepancy
      between the highest reported electron and hole mobilities for
      printed polymers for organic transistors imposes additional design
      trade-offs when fabricating complementary transistor circuits, a
      key component of logic circuits.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In certain situations carrier mobility impacts the drain
      current and the transconductance in a field effect transistor.
      Larger drain currents are desirable for some applications;
      however, as a consequence of lower mobility and larger oxide
      thickness, printed organic transistors typically offer drain
      currents that are several orders of magnitude smaller than
      conventional devices. It has been found that wider channels can be
      used to increase drain current, though this is usually accompanied
      by increased leakage. Resolution limitations of current printable
      electronics techniques impose a feature-size penalty of nearly
      three orders of magnitude, relative to conventional semiconductor
      fabrication techniques, which limits the amount by which the
      channel length can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Larger transistor feature sizes lead to increased parasitic
      capacitances at each transistor, reducing their switching speed.
      Lower transconductance also limits switching speed; the
      propagation delay of recent fast organic transistors is at least
      three orders of magnitude slower than conventional transistors,
      limiting their use to relatively simple logic circuits since this
      delay accumulates with each cascaded logic cell. Printed organic
      semiconductors sacrifice endurance relative to conventionally
      fabricated circuits, with published shelf- and operating lifetimes
      ranging from several weeks to two years.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Conductor quality in printed electronics is impaired by
      incompatible material processing requirements. Low-resistivity
      base materials and narrow traces with high current-carrying
      capacity are desired In order to achieve favorable conductivity,
      electrically conductive materials are used. Electrically
      conductive materials including conductive materials that can be
      inkjet-printed or extruded are referred to as “inks”. These inks
      typically require a post-print curing or sintering step that
      entails heat-treating at temperatures ranging from 125 to 500° C.
      for an extended period of time. Since this range exceeds the
      glass-transition temperature of most common polymers used in
      additive manufacturing, the sintering step can cause other
      materials in the part to melt or degrade.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] To circumvent this problem, alternative sintering
      techniques have been developed based on chemical reactions,
      resistive heating, plasma, photonic energy, and radio-frequency
      heating. Recent results compatible with low-temperature polymer
      substrates demonstrate conductor resistivity of 2-10× bulk via
      pulsed Xenon lamps, and pulsed-laser, though integration of these
      methods with structural additive manufacturing materials has not
      been demonstrated. Reactive silver inks have been shown to yield
      traces with conductivity nearly equal to bulk silver after 15
      minutes of sintering at 90° C., though material costs may limit
      this approach.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] A commercially available method for creating electrical
      conductors on the surface of plastic parts, known as Laser Direct
      Structuring (“LDS”), uses a laser to ablate the thermoplastic
      substrate where conductive traces are desired; organic-metallic
      additives in the plastic are activated during this process,
      leaving behind a surface that can be plated during successive wet
      metallization steps. However, like the other methods mentioned
      above, LDS creates electrical traces only on the surface of a part
      and limitations in achievable trace thickness impose constraints
      on current-carrying capacity despite continuing improvements in
      material resistivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] An alternative fabrication approach, Shape Deposition
      Manufacturing (“SDM”), circumvents material and process
      compatibility issues by embedding prefabricated components into an
      assembly as it is being fabricated. This concept has been
      demonstrated by embedding complete assembled circuit boards as
      well as discrete components; these components are interconnected
      with embedded wires or printed conductors subject to the
      limitations discussed above. At a smaller scale, individual pieces
      of prefabricated semiconducting material referred to as
      “chiplets”, have been self-assembled to form functional arrays of
      devices over large scales, including roll-roll manufactured LED
      sheets, and flexible arrays of chip-scale solar cells. When
      fabricated with high-speed electrical interconnects on their
      edges, individual chiplets can be interconnected to form larger
      composite circuit “Quilts”. A related approach also decomposes the
      problem into separate high-temperature fabrication steps using
      conventional micro-fabrication tools, followed by a
      low-temperature assembly process based on transfer printing.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Existing manufacturing methods exist that embed components;
      however these methods rely on special-purpose embedding of
      particular components for specific designs. For example, U.S. Pat.
      No. 5,278,442 to Prinz et al. discloses electronic components
      formed in place by incremental material build-up of thin layers.
      At least one mask is used per layer to form electronic components
      made of conductors such as gold and copper, insulators such as
      ceramic materials and possibly semiconductors, all of which are
      applied by thermal deposition spray using a thermal deposition
      spray.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Another example of an existing manufacturing method that
      embeds components is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,301,415 to Prinz
      et al., which forms three-dimensional objects by applying segments
      of complementary material and deposition material so as to form
      layers of material. Selected segments of material are then shaped
      after one or more segment is formed. In this manner, layers of
      material form a block containing the object made of deposition
      material and surrounded by complementary material, which may
      subsequently be removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] As further described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,286,573 to Prinz et
      al., the support structure has a melting point lower than the
      melting point of the deposition material so that the support
      structure can be removed by a melting process.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] With all of the above described methods, embedded
      components are printed or shaped within a complementary material,
      which may ultimately be removed. These components are specific to
      the desired application of the assembly. Though multiple additive
      material deposition techniques have been developed to address
      diverse users, existing techniques fail to address three critical
      requirements that electromechanical printers must satisfy. First,
      existing methods produce components with electrical performance
      that is inferior to conventionally produced electrical components
      by several orders of magnitude. Second, existing methods are
      incapable of combining the diverse materials required for complex,
      integrated electromechanical systems. Thus, there is a need for
      general-purpose, scalable manufacturing methods that employ a
      library of pre-fabricated modular components that are universal in
      manufacturing a variety of assemblies. Third, existing techniques
      that embed components do not contemplate or demonstrate a modular,
      general-purpose system. Instead they embed specific pre-fabricated
      components that are unique to each intended end-use or
      printed/assembled design. This limitation makes existing methods
      incapable of addressing the need for a general-purpose
      electromechanical 3D printer. The invention satisfies these needs.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0019] The invention overcomes the material and process
      limitations of current printable electronics approaches, enabling
      complete, complex electromechanical assemblies to be fabricated.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The few available tools that integrate electrical and
      mechanical design into an electromechanical design environment do
      so by relying on the printed circuit board as a natural interface
      between the electrical and mechanical functions of the assembly.
      In making this choice, the traditional separations between
      electrical and mechanical design are entrenched: the circuit board
      has no mechanical functionality apart from the space that it
      occupies, and the mechanical components merely provide a physical
      substrate for the electronics. High-performance 3D-printable
      electrical components cannot be fabricated by existing additive
      manufacturing tools.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The invention is directed to finished parts with complex
      electromechanical properties that can be simulated, designed and
      fabricated. Specifically, the invention relates to an additive
      manufacturing process that fabricates high quality electrical
      interconnections, computational circuits, sensors or actuators in
      combination with mechanical elements in an integrated
      electromechanical assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The invention is directed to a hybrid approach that
      incorporates three-dimensional (3D) printing and placement of
      modules selected from a library of modules to fabricate an
      electromechanical assembly with mechanical and electrical
      functionality comparable to conventionally produced planar printed
      circuit boards. 3D printing processes includes a variety of
      methods including, for example, Inkjet, Fused Deposition Modeling
      (“FDM”), Stereolithography (“SLA”), Drop-On-Demand/Inkjet, or
      Powder-bed/Binder-jetting, to name a few. Additive processes are
      used in 3D printing in which successive regions of material are
      laid down under computer control creating an object of any shape
      or geometry, and may be produced from a 3D model or other
      electronic data source. A component placement system is used to
      position one or module components within the object during
      printing.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] According to one embodiment of the invention, module
      components used in fabrication include both electrical
      properties—also referred to as “electrical functionality”—and
      mechanical properties—also referred to as “mechanical
      functionality”—with each module component treated as an inherently
      electromechanical object. This becomes increasingly true as the
      module size decreases and the percent volume occupied by modules
      within the assembly increases. Modules with unique physical
      properties expand the variety available to designers.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The invention goes beyond previous system and methods that
      employ either a single module type, or are not modular at all,
      requiring components specific to the desired assembly design to be
      loaded into a printer. In contrast, the invention relies on a
      modular design philosophy: a small set of modules with generic
      electrical and/or mechanical functionality can be combined, in
      large numbers if required, to yield the desired performance.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Specifically, the invention incorporates different module
      types—such as a microcontroller module, resistor module, capacitor
      module, diode module, transistor module—that may be mechanically
      similar, but have distinct electrical functionality, into a
      3D-printed assembly as it is being fabricated. Each module may
      include electrical functionality, mechanical functionality, or
      both. In one embodiment, the invention employs continuous material
      deposition via inkjet to create the portions of the assembly that
      require mechanical functionality, and pick-and-place manipulators
      to deposit modules wherever electromechanical functionality is
      required.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The system and methods of the invention may be used to
      fabricate any type of assembly, for example one that is activated
      when a button is depressed on the surface of the assembly. The
      system and methods of the invention may also be used to fabricate
      assemblies that exploit the programmability provided by a
      particular module.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Design tools such as 3D Computer Aided Design (“CAD”)
      systems are used to create an assembly. The assembly is created to
      incorporate modules by using volumes of space, or voids. A printer
      creates regions from conventional inkjet material and modules are
      positioned within the voids of the region portion created by the
      printer. If necessary, heating is applied to fuse modules on
      adjacent regions together or to fuse modules to the regions
      themselves. This process continues until the assembly is complete.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] According to the invention, the number of unique
      combinations of module components positioned within a material is
      endless. The combination and position of module components
      determine the mechanical and electrical properties of the
      electromechanical assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In a specific embodiment, the invention incorporates a
      limited repertoire of prefabricated modules with inkjet-deposited
      photopolymers to create assemblies that incorporate complex
      mixed-signal circuits with state of the art performance. This
      modular technique is scalable, allowing a single machine to
      produce finished parts with diverse functionality without being
      reconfigured and immediately commercialized using available
      technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] One advantage of the invention, in contrast to related work
      that embeds special-purpose circuit boards within a printed
      assembly, the invention utilizes a small library of
      general-purpose modules with atomic functionality. By controlling
      the position and orientation of these parts within an assembly,
      new electrical circuits can be fabricated without re-designing
      individual circuit boards.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Electrical components are commercially available in
      thousands of distinct physical packages. This heterogeneity, while
      offering design flexibility, presents a challenge to methods that
      directly embed commercially-available electronic packages, as it
      requires package-specific descriptor libraries for each device
      envelope and footprint to be developed.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Another advantage of the invention is that it reduces
      designer workload by intentionally restricting the availability of
      components to a predetermined set that have been fully specified,
      facilitating circuit modeling via existing tools and eliminating
      the need to develop new electrical package descriptions.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Component heterogeneity also presents challenges for
      pick-place apparatus. Though conventional automated placement
      tools are flexible enough to accommodate a variety of component
      packages, these tools must be manually configured before each
      production run, with operators loading in the particular
      collection of components that will be used for the design. This
      overhead currently limits low-volume printed circuit board
      assembly; most commercial assembly providers employ manual
      assembly at very low production volumes to circumvent the setup
      cost. Since single-unit or ultra-low-volume production runs are a
      key motivation for using additive manufacturing, setup costs must
      be minimized, which argues for restricting the allowable
      components to a small set that can be permanently maintained
      within the printer.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In one embodiment of the invention, the allowable module
      components are restricted to a small set that can be permanently
      maintained within the printer through a library of modules. The
      library houses prefabricated modules with the same configuration
      in terms of size and shape, but differ with respect to electrical
      functionality and/or mechanical functionality. The modules in the
      library can support a variety of electrical functionality, such as
      currents to at least 1 Amp (A), several orders of magnitude larger
      than known comparable printed-electronics methods, and leverage
      decades of progress in semiconductor fabrication. Complementary
      metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) processing steps for integrated
      circuits may be used to allow digital logic to be embedded within
      each module.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Methods that interconnect embedded commercial components
      with printed conductors are limited by conductivity (limited by
      conductor geometry and material volume resistivity), and process
      temperature, while those that employ printed semiconductors
      sacrifice drain current, on/off ratio, and switching speed. In
      contrast, electrical connectivity according to the invention is
      achieved through direct connections between adjacent modules,
      yielding composite conductors that are nearly identical to
      conventional copper traces.<br>
      <br>

      further understood and appreciated with reference to the
      accompanying drawings.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0043] The invention demonstrates a capability that is impossible
      with contemporary electronics printing methods, and would require
      a costly electrical and mechanical design cycle, along with
      special-purpose tooling if it were produced following conventional
      electromechanical fabrication practice.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The invention is directed to a hybrid approach that
      incorporates three-dimensional (3D) printing and placement of
      modules selected from a library of modules to fabricate an
      electromechanical assembly with both mechanical functionality and
      electrical functionality comparable to conventionally produced
      planar printed circuit boards.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary system
      100 for fabricating an electromechanical assembly according to the
      invention. The system 100 facilitates a hybrid approach that
      incorporates devices such as a printing apparatus 120 and a
      component placement apparatus 140 to fabricate an
      electromechanical assembly 200. The printing apparatus 120 may
      include any type of printing functionality such as a 3D printing
      machine. The component placement apparatus 140 may include any
      type of selection and placement of components such as a high speed
      pick-and-place machine including with parallel pick-and-place
      techniques, or other similar techniques. Parallel fabrication
      methods may be used to exploit the mechanical regularity of the
      modules to manipulate entire regions simultaneously.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The printing apparatus 120 may access a material library
      110 to obtain the material for printing. The material library 110
      may include one or more different types of materials that may be
      printed, for example, photopolymers or thermoplastics, although
      any type of material may be used that is capable of being
      deposited by a 3D printing machine, including for example an
      inkjet process. The component placement apparatus 140 may access a
      module library 130 for selection of module components for
      positioning within the material printed by the printing apparatus
      120. The module library may include different generic,
      prefabricated module components that vary in electrical
      functionality and/or mechanical functionality. Representative
      module components are more fully described in reference to FIG. 2
      and FIG. 3 below.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] In certain embodiments, a fusion device 160 such as a laser
      sintering machine may fuse the module components to one another in
      order to form an electrical connection in order to realize
      electrical properties. It is also contemplated the fusion device
      160 may be used to fuse the module components to the material
      printed by the printing apparatus 120.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In addition to the module components including mechanical
      properties and/or electrical properties, the combination of
      material printed from the printing apparatus 120 and module
      components selected and placed by the component placement
      apparatus 140 create the electromechanical assembly 200 with both
      mechanical properties and electrical properties. Mechanical
      properties include, for example, stiffness, strength, stress, and
      strain. Electrical properties include any control of electrical
      energy such as circuits including, for example, resistivity and
      conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 2 illustrates a perspective view of a module component
      200 according to the invention. Each module component 200
      comprises a tile element 202 comprising a plurality of surfaces.
      As illustrated, the tile element 202 is generally square in shape,
      but any shape is contemplated. For example, the tile element may
      be circular, spherical, or rectangular parallelepiped, to name a
      few examples. In one specific embodiment, the tile element 202 is
      a 3 millimeter (mm) square shape with a thickness of 0.9
      millimeters (mm) in order to allow easy scaling to higher levels
      of additive manufacturing. However, the invention is applicable to
      module components of any size that are amenable to manipulation
      using a component placement apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The tile element 202 includes one or more pads 205 that may
      be used for connections. The pads 205 are shown on a top surface
      of the module component 202, but pads may also be located on the
      surface opposing the top surface. As an example, pad on the top
      surface may be connected to pads on the bottom surface by a via in
      each pad. It is also contemplated that the pads may provide
      programming signals, enabling the printing apparatus 120 (FIG. 1)
      to individually program each module.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] An electrical element 204 and/or a mechanical element 206
      may be either positioned on a surface of the tile element 202 or
      within a surface of the tile element 202 in order to create
      functionality/properties—electrical/mechanical—for the
      prefabricated module component 200 for entry into the module
      library 130 (FIG. 1). The surface opposing the surface that
      includes the electrical element 204 and/or a mechanical element
      206 is generally planar. Electrical elements 204 control
      electrical energy and may include, for example, 2-way connect,
      4-way connect, crossover connect, resistor, capacitor, inductor,
      diode, transistor, switch, and microcontroller, as seen
      schematically in FIG. 3. Mechanical elements 206 control
      mechanical energy and may include any working or moveable
      function, such as a gripper or robot effector.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 3 illustrates schematic diagrams of select module
      components 204 according to the invention. As shown more
      specifically in FIG. 3, a blank module component 210 does not
      include an electrical element or mechanical element. Module
      component 212 illustrates a 2-way connect. Module component 214
      illustrates a 4-way connect. Module component 216 illustrates a
      crossover connect. Module component 218 illustrates a resistor.
      Module component 220 illustrates a capacitor. Module component 222
      illustrates an inductor. Module component 224 illustrates a diode,
      specifically a Light Emitting Diode (“LED”). Module component 226
      illustrates a switch. Module component 228 and module component
      230 illustrate transistors, specifically a p-channel field-effect
      transistor (“P-FET”) and a n-channel field-effect transistor
      (“N-FET”), respectively. Module component 227 illustrates a
      microcontroller.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The system and methods according to the invention were used
      to fabricate a 2.5-D interconnection in which neighboring modules
      on the same region rely on offset modules above or below for
      electrical connections. Electrical circuits are formed by creating
      chains of modules on 2 or more regions. This approach allows new
      modules to be added to an assembly at any vacant location,
      avoiding interference fits that would otherwise require
      high-precision placement or large mating forces. This 2.5-D
      interconnection strategy is one of several contemplated
      topologies; other strategies compatible with this invention
      include full 3D interconnections (in-plane connections between
      modules).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] It is contemplated that all modules may share the same
      mechanical interface, for example 3 mm square, 0.9 mm thick, with
      four square pads on the top and bottom. These dimensions are
      incidental, as they are driven by the printed circuit board
      fabrication methods employed to produce the modules. The invention
      is equally applicable to smaller modules produced via
      micro-fabrication, with the added capability of embedding the
      electronic functionality within, rather than on top of, each
      module.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] With the exception of the blank module 210 of FIG. 3), the
      topside pads of each module are connected to their corresponding
      bottom side pads by a via in each pad. Eight of the module types
      implement carrier boards for commercially available electronic
      components, breaking out disparate package connections into a
      common format. While some modules support electrical elements 204
      (FIG. 2) positioned on or within their top side, certain modules
      may not have components on or within their bottom side in order to
      facilitate automated manipulation. In alternate embodiments, the
      electrical elements 204 and/or mechanical elements 206 may be
      positioned on or within one or more surfaces of the module
      component 200.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In particular embodiments, the FET modules 228, 230 support
      drain currents in excess of 3 A and can be used with signals as
      fast as 10 Megahertz (MHz). The microcontroller module 232 employs
      an Atmel ATtiny10 that contains 1 kB of code space, 32 bytes of
      RAM, an analog to digital converter, internal oscillators, and
      timer circuitry. This module's pads may also provide programming
      signals, enabling the printer to individually program each
      microcontroller module as it is placed.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] FIG. 4 and FIG. 5 illustrate exemplary methods for
      fabricating an electromechanical assembly according to the
      invention. Specifically, FIG. 4 is a flow chart and FIG. 5 is a
      graphic representation.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] As shown in FIG. 4 at step 402, material is selected and
      deposited into a plurality of stacked regions, each successive
      region positioned on top of the previous region. At step 404,
      module components are are selected from a library of modules. The
      module components are positioned into the material at step 406. In
      certain embodiments, the module components may be fused together
      or fused to the material as shown in step 408. At step 410,
      mechanical properties and electrical properties are created by
      virtue of fabrication of the electromechanical assembly.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIG. 5 illustrates a graphic representation for fabricating
      an electromechanical assembly. As shown in FIG. 5, step “A” is
      directed to a first device 120 depositing material 122, for
      example using an inkjet process, into a plurality of stacked
      regions 502a with each successive region positioned on top of the
      previous region. The plurality of stacked regions 502a forms a
      base region portion 510a including one or more void elements 520
      as constructed by the material 122 such as a photopolymer
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] As shown by step “B”, a second device 140 such as a high
      speed pick-and-place machine, selects a module component 240 from
      the library of module components and positions the module
      component 240 in one of void elements 522, 524.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Step “C” illustrates both module components 240, 242
      positioned within the base region portion 510a. Step “D”
      illustrates a second plurality of stacked regions 502b forming a
      top region portion 510b deposited by the inkjet 3D printing
      machine 120. The top region portion 510b encapsulates all or a
      portion of the module components 240, 242 while forming void
      element 526.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] As shown by step “E”, the high speed pick-and-place machine
      140 selects module component 244 and positions it in void element
      526.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] In certain embodiments, a fusion device 160 as shown in
      step “F”, such as a laser sintering machine, applies heat in the
      form of a laser beam 162 in order to fuse the module components
      240, 242, 244 to one another. The laser sintering machine 160 may
      also apply heat to fuse the module components 240, 242, 244 to a
      region portion 510a, 510b.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] As shown in step “G”, material is deposited into a third
      plurality of stacked regions 502c with each successive region
      positioned on top of the previous region. The plurality of stacked
      regions 502c forms a second top region portion 502c that
      encapsulates all of the module components 240, 242, 244 forming an
      electromechanical assembly 550. By virtue of fabrication of the
      electromechanical assembly 550, mechanical properties and
      electrical properties of the assembly are created.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The system and methods of the invention may be used to
      fabricate any type of assembly, for example an LED keychain light,
      activated when a button is depressed on the surface. The system
      and methods of the invention may be used to fabricate assemblies
      that exploit the programmability provided by a microcontroller
      module.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] For example, a microcontroller module may be programmed to
      create specific pulse-trains such as those that correspond to the
      on and on-off pulses in a particular infra-red (IR) remote control
      protocol. These pulses can be used to turn an IR LED on and off,
      controlling a remote device. Another example includes the
      play/pause, jog forward, jog backward, volume up and volume down
      functions, creating a 5-channel IR remote control. Each of the
      assemblies employ the inkjet-printed material as a supportive
      structure, and the remote utilizes a flexible material around the
      buttons that allows motion during button-press events.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Another example of an assembly incorporates a LED into a
      structure that has full electromechanical functionality.
      Inkjet-produced areas can incorporate components such as
      rack-and-pinion connections, captive hinges, and springs. When one
      component is activated, one or more other components may be
      activated. For example, when a component on a gripper is
      activated, the gripper arms open and an internal switch closes,
      activating an illumination component.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] While the disclosure is susceptible to various
      modifications and alternative forms, specific exemplary

        <b>SYSTEM AND METHODS FOR ACTUATION USING ELECTRO-OSMOSIS</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates generally to micro-fluidics and more
      specifically to a system and methods for creating very low energy
      micro-scale and macro-scale mechanical actuators through use of
      one or more electro-osmotic pumps.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Most conventional mechanical pumps have issues with reliability
      due, in part, to the moving components. However, pumps that do not
      require moving components such as electro-osmotic pumps (EOPs)
      make them suitable for a variety of applications, including for
      example “lab-on-a-chip” devices, diagnostic devices, micro total
      analysis systems (μMTAS), drug delivery systems, and separation
      and mixing processes, as well as micro-processor cooling systems,
      to name a few.<br>
      <br>
      Electro-osmosis is used to pump fluids that contain some quantity
      of charged species, such as positive and negative ions. An
      electric double layer is a structure that appears on the surface
      of an object when it is exposed to a fluid. The object might be a
      solid particle, a gas bubble, a liquid droplet, or a porous body.
      The electric double layer refers to two parallel layers of charge
      surrounding the object. The first layer comprises ions adsorbed
      onto the object due to chemical interactions. The second layer is
      composed of ions attracted to the surface charge. This second
      layer is loosely associated with the object. It is made of free
      ions that move in the fluid under the influence of electric
      attraction.<br>
      <br>
      Most solid surfaces acquire a surface electric charge when brought
      into contact with a liquid. When an electric field is applied
      across the liquid, the ions in the double-layer migrate in the
      field, which results in viscous drag to create bulk fluid flow and
      generation of a net pressure. This effect is referred to as
      electro-osmosic pumping, or EOP pumping. Specifically, EOPs
      provide fluid flow due to movement of an electric double layer
      that forms at the solid-liquid interface. Not only do EOPs
      eliminate moving components, but EOPs also move fluid using the
      electric field. EOPs can move low conductivity fluids and have a
      greater pressure and flow rate change when compared to
      conventional pumps.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, there is a need for low energy mechanical actuators that are
      of a simple design and construction. The invention satisfies this
      need.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention exploits a widely used device in micro-fluidics, the
      electro-osmotic pump (EOP), to create very low energy micro-scale
      and macro-scale mechanical actuators. The EOP uses electrical
      fields to move naturally occurring charged particles (ions)
      through a fluid medium. As the ions move in response to the
      applied field, they drag the (non-charged) fluid along,
      establishing bulk flow. When confined to a narrow chamber, a
      pressure gradient can be established. The combination of pressure
      gradient and bulk flow performs mechanical work, for example,
      fluid flow control (i.e. actuators, valves), linear actuators
      (e.g. for artificial muscles), micro-electro-mechanical system
      (MEMS) devices (e.g. micro-pistons in bulk silicon), and
      quasi-sealed actuators that expand and contract to realize both
      linear and bending motion.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relies on individual micro-scale actuators that can
      be combined in any number including to produce a macro-scale
      actuator structure with better power density, increased
      reliability and lower production cost. With the use of
      electro-osmotic pumps, the invention enables actuators to be
      constructed in a variety of embodiments, including for example, a
      sheet structure, a piston structure, and a cellular structure, to
      name a few.<br>
      <br>
      When compared to the small number of other efforts that have
      applied electro-osmotic pumping to actuation, the invention
      improves on these efforts in two key areas: (1) production of
      linear strain that can be scaled down for micro-actuators and
      scaled up for macro-actuators, and (2) mass-production using
      commercially available processes that is also cost-effective.<br>
      <br>
      When compared to other types of hydraulic actuation, the invention
      yields high-force, high-strain linear and rotary actuators that
      are cheap to produce, and are at least an order of magnitude more
      efficient. These actuators are extremely valuable to the robotics
      community, since power generation and storage is one of the key
      limiting factors for the performance of mobile robots. However,
      these actuators are general purpose and can be applied to any area
      in which low cost and energy efficiency are priorities.<br>
      <br>
      Certain embodiments of the invention are particularly suited to
      cost-sensitive areas, since they are intended to be produced with
      a very high-volume reel-to-reel production technique that reduces
      the individual component cost. Certain other embodiments are
      intended to be the actuation building block for a new paradigm of
      modular micro-machines. One goal is to provide a small set of
      micro-fabricated modular building blocks that form the basis for
      larger, more complex machines. The key different building block
      types include computation, power storage and transmission,
      structure, and actuation. Large numbers of these standardized
      building blocks may be prefabricated to establish the building
      blocks in specific locations in order to build an actuator
      assembly.<br>
      <br>
      Certain other embodiments of the invention integrate a plurality
      of electro-osmotic pumps within a flexible material in order to
      provide an actuator with uniquely controllable states. For
      example, certain portions of the actuator can be curled up or
      curled down while maintaining a somewhat rigid state while other
      portions of the actuator can be soft and pliable. Therefore,
      actuators of this embodiment enable low or zero-power rigid
      portions.<br>
      <br>
      Certain other embodiments may be of a more complex structure by
      incorporating an inherently three-dimensional (3D) mechanism so
      that the electro-osmotic pumps can move fluid vertically.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the invention constructs micro-actuators that
      require very few moving parts, which is far more efficient than
      other hydraulic actuators, vastly simplifies the actuator design
      relative to other micro-actuators, offers large force output, and
      can be readily scaled to create macro-scale actuators that are
      composed of millions of individual actuators.<br>
      <br>
      Some advantages of the invention include, for example, the
      creation of high efficiency actuators with a very low energy
      requirement, actuators of simple design with very few moving
      parts, actuators that can exude a large force output, and
      actuators that are readily scalable from micro-scale to
      macro-scale actuators.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      All electro-osmotic pumps exploit the natural equilibrium-state
      distribution of ions at a fluid/solid interface. This
      distribution, known as the electrical double layer, results in a
      net charge on the solid and an equal, but opposite, net charge in
      the fluid near the surface of the solid. This charged fluid can be
      moved when an externally applied electric field is applied.<br>
      <br>
      For exemplary purposes, the invention is discussed with respect to
      three embodiments: a sheet structure, a piston structure, and a
      cellular structure. However, it should be noted that the invention
      is not limited to these three embodiments, but that
      electro-osmotic pumps can be used to construct actuators in a
      variety of embodiments.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the actuator is in the form of
      a sheet structure as shown in FIG. 1 through FIG. 3. FIG. 1
      illustrates an exploded view of one embodiment of an actuator in
      the form of a sheet structure 100 according to the invention. The
      sheet structure 100 comprises a plurality of sheets—three sheets
      120, 150, 170 as shown in FIG. 1 through FIG. 3; however, any
      number of sheets are contemplated. Each sheet 120, 150, 170 are
      constructed from a flexible, inelastic material such as a polymer.<br>
      <br>
      The first flexible sheet 120 includes a first top side 122 and a
      first bottom side 124. The first top side 122 and the first bottom
      side 124 are coated with a first conductive layer 130 and the
      first flexible sheet 120 comprises a plurality of first chambers
      128.<br>
      <br>
      The second flexible sheet 150 includes a second top side 152 and a
      second bottom side 154. The second top side 152 and the second
      bottom side 154 are coated with a second conductive layer 160.
      Like the first flexible sheet 120, the second flexible sheet 150
      comprises a plurality of second chambers 158.<br>
      <br>
      A third flexible sheet 170 includes a third top side 172 and a
      third bottom side 174, wherein the third flexible sheet 170
      comprises a plurality of third chambers 178 of a honey-comb
      arrangement 179.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the second top side 152 of the second flexible
      sheet 150 is fused to the third bottom side 174 of the third
      flexible sheet 170 at a plurality of regular intervals and the
      first bottom side 124 of the first flexible sheet 120 is fused to
      the third top side 172 of the third flexible sheet 170 at a
      plurality of regular intervals to obtain an assembled flexible
      sheet structure 200 including a plurality of assembled chambers
      220.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the sheets 120, 150, 170 as shown in FIG. 1 can be mass
      produced as a rolled sheet. The assembled flexible sheet structure
      200 is then formed using a reel to reel process that fuses the
      sheets 120, 150, 170 together at specific locations using heat and
      pressure in order to produce specific chambers 220.<br>
      <br>
      The assembled flexible sheet structure 200 is positioned inside an
      outer membrane 250 that includes a working fluid 252 to form an
      actuator 260.<br>
      <br>
      For purposes of this application, a working fluid is any gas or
      liquid that actuates the actuator. Examples of working fluids
      include for example, water, steam, pentane, toluene,
      chlorofluorocarbons, hydro-chlorofluorocarbons, fluorocarbons,
      propane, butane, isobutene, ammonia, sulfur dioxide, helium, etc.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2 and FIG. 3, the assembled flexible sheet
      structure 200 contracts and expands to form a linear actuator when
      a voltage is applied to pump the working fluid 252 across the
      assembled flexible sheet structure 200 and into the plurality of
      assembled chambers 220.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the conductive layer 130, 160 enables a charge
      to be externally applied. When opposite charges are applied to the
      assembled flexible sheet structure 200—specifically the conductive
      layers 130, 160—the working fluid 252 is forced through the
      assembled chambers 220 and swells the chambers 220 formed by the
      third flexible sheet 170 as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, it is contemplated that the chambers 220 range
      from 200 nanometers to several micrometers, depending on the
      design goals and the working fluid 252. In addition, it is
      contemplated that the chambers 220 may be approximately one
      millimeter in each planar dimension with the entire assembled
      flexible sheet structure 200 being several hundred micrometers
      thick. Again, these dimensions are not fixed and can be easily
      changed depending on the specific goals. In general however, a
      typical sheet structure actuator can employ hundreds of thousands
      to millions of individual chambers in a single sheet. For example,
      using the approximate chamber dimensions previously provided, a
      sheet structure actuator 10 centimeters long that employs a rolled
      sheet of chambers that is 10 centimeters long before being rolled
      would contain over 100,000 individual chambers.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 illustrates the actuator 260 in a relaxed state whereas
      FIG. 3 illustrates the actuator 260 in a contracted state
      according to the invention. As shown in FIG. 3, the swelling of
      chambers 220 stretches the flexible, inelastic sheets 120, 150,
      causing a contraction. This motion can be exploited to create low
      cost, batch-fabricated linear actuators such as artificial
      muscles.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment of the invention, the actuator is in the
      form of a piston structure as shown in FIG. 4. In the piston
      structure embodiment, the electro-osmotic pumps perform two
      distinct functions: (1) pumping and (2) sealing. The pumping
      function moves fluid from one side of the piston to the other,
      forcing the piston to move. The sealing function prevents fluid
      from slipping past the piston (between the piston and the chamber
      wall) without also forcing the piston to move.<br>
      <br>
      The piston structure according to the invention employs widely
      used micro-fabrication techniques to create micro-pistons in bulk
      silicon. This design yields high actuator force with low actuation
      power, and exploits the electro-osmotic pump to avoid complex
      seals at the pump/fluid boundaries.<br>
      <br>
      In this piston structure embodiment, the invention is intended to
      be implemented in traditional microelectromechanical systems
      (MEMS) setting using bulk silicon and various etch and plate
      stages.<br>
      <br>
      The piston structure actuator 400 comprises a piston 402
      positioned within an enclosed chamber 404. Specifically, the
      piston 402 includes a head 406 and a cylinder 408. The enclosed
      chamber 404 includes a plurality of outside surfaces 410 and a
      plurality of inside surfaces 411. The head 406 of the piston 402
      includes a plurality of perforations 412.<br>
      <br>
      The enclosed chamber 404 is filled with a working fluid 414,
      wherein the enclosed chamber 404 includes an aperture 416 through
      which the piston 402 is positioned within the enclosed chamber
      404.<br>
      <br>
      The piston structure actuator 400 includes one or more electrodes
      430. In one embodiment, the one or more electrodes 430 are
      positioned on either side of one or more perforations 412 of the
      head 406. In another embodiment, the one or more electrodes 430
      are positioned at two opposing outside surfaces 410 of the
      enclosed chamber 404. In another embodiment, the one or more
      electrodes 430 are positioned at the aperture 416 of the enclosed
      chamber 404. It is further contemplated that one or more
      conductors 432 can be used to connect the one or more electrodes
      430 to an outside surface 410 of the enclosed chamber 404.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment with one or more electrodes 430 positioned at
      two opposing outside surfaces 410 of the enclosed chamber 404, a
      weaker electric field for the same applied voltage is realized,
      but this embodiment avoids the need for conductors 432 that
      connect the electrodes 430 on the piston 402 to the outside
      surface 410 of the chamber 404.<br>
      <br>
      The one or more electrodes 430 are configured to be charged to
      create an electric field in order to move the working fluid 414
      and actuate the piston 402. Specifically, when the one or more
      electrodes 430 are charged, the resulting electric field causes
      the working fluid 414 to flow from one insides surface 411 to
      another inside surface 411 of the enclosed chamber 404 causing the
      piston 402 to move.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the pumping and sealing functions are both
      accomplished by the same electro-osmotic pump that uses the one or
      more electrodes 430 on the piston 402 itself, and is formed by the
      gap 440 between the cylinder 408 and an inside surface 411 of the
      chamber 404. When the electrodes 430 are energized, the working
      fluid 414 is forced to flow within the gap 440, causing a bulk
      flow of the working fluid 414 from one side of the piston 402 to
      the other. This approach avoids flexible seals which are difficult
      to fabricate and cause friction losses or stiction—the static
      friction that needs to be overcome to enable relative motion of
      stationary objects in contact.<br>
      <br>
      It is also contemplated that a second electro-osmotic pump may be
      implemented, separate and apart from the piston structure actuator
      400, that moves working fluid from one side of the piston to the
      other via microfluidic channels that lead to either side of the
      piston (these channels might lead to either end of the chamber,
      for example). This version is more complicated, but allows greater
      fluid pressures and flow rates.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 through FIG. 7 illustrate another embodiment of an actuator
      in the form of a cellular structure 500 according to the
      invention. In this embodiment, the invention uses an array of
      identical chambers that are separated by individually addressable
      permeable layers. Rather than pumping the working fluid from
      outside the assembly as described in the embodiment of FIG. 1
      through FIG. 3, it uses pumps that separate different cellular
      chambers to move the working fluid between chambers. This motion
      swells some chambers while shrinking others. Some of these
      chambers employ inelastic inner struts which bias the
      contraction/expansion due to fluid motion to cause non-isotropic
      expansion or contraction. This approach can yield actuators that
      are sealed, yet realize both linear and bending motion.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to the first embodiment described in FIG. 1 through FIG.
      3, the cellular structure 500 comprises a plurality of sheets 520,
      550 that are constructed from a flexible, inelastic material such
      as a polymer.<br>
      <br>
      The first flexible sheet 520 includes a first top side 522 and a
      first bottom side 524. The first top side 522 and the first bottom
      side 524 are coated with a first conductive layer 530 and the
      first flexible sheet 520 comprises a plurality of first chambers
      528.<br>
      <br>
      The second flexible sheet 550 includes a second top side 552 and a
      second bottom side 554. The second top side 552 and the second
      bottom side 554 are coated with a second conductive layer 560.
      Like the first flexible sheet 520, the second flexible sheet 550
      comprises a plurality of second chambers 558.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 5, the second top side 552 of the second flexible
      sheet 550 is fused to the first bottom side 524 of the first
      flexible sheet 520 at a plurality of regular intervals to obtain
      an assembled flexible cellular structure 500 including a plurality
      of assembled chambers 570.<br>
      <br>
      A working fluid 575 is positioned inside the flexible cellular
      structure 500 to create the mechanical actuator, wherein the
      plurality of assembled chambers 570 are separated by individually
      addressable permeable layers 530, 560 such that voltage applied to
      one or more individually addressable permeable layers 530, 560
      causes the working fluid 575 to flow from one assembled chamber
      570 into an adjacent assembled chamber 570 such that select
      assembled chambers 570 of the plurality are configured to contract
      and expand. Furthermore, an inelastic inner strut 580 may be
      positioned within each assembled chamber 570 to bias the
      contraction and expansion of the chamber 570.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 illustrates the actuator of FIG. 6 with a portion actuated
      to bend slightly according to the invention. Working fluid 575
      from four of the chambers 571 has been pumped into the four
      chambers 571 directly above them causing the chambers 571, 572 to
      swell or contract causing the entire assembled cellular structure
      500 to bend.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7 illustrates the actuator of FIG. 6 with a portion actuated
      to curl upward according to the invention. Working fluid 575
      pumped from chamber 591 into the chamber 592, causing chamber 591
      to contract and chamber 592 to swell, which causes the actuator in
      the form of a cellular structure 500 to curl upward. Specifically,
      the resulting tension draws the ends of the actuator together.<br>
      <br>
      Similar to the other embodiments of the invention, the actuator in
      the form of a cellular structure 500 can be built on a reel-reel
      process. As shown two sheets are stacked; however, multiple sheets
      may be stacked in order to create a many-layer stack-up.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The authors introduce a new class of electrically-actuated soft
      materials. Electro-active hydraulic solids (EAHSs) are comprised
      of numerous microscale phase change capsules embedded inside a
      conductive elastomer matrix which replicate traditional wax
      actuators in a massively parallel fashion. EAHS can generate
      forces and stress densities that exceed traditional electroactive
      actuators. For example, a 14 mm diameter 50 mm long cylinder can
      generate 4 500 N force and have over 3% strain. The authors
      describe a simple method for fabricating EAHS and demonstrate
      their compatibility with a wide range of manufacturing processes
      including additive manufacturing, subtractive manufacturing, and
      forming.<br>

      </b><b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      Dielectric elastomers are promising materials for actuators
      resembling human muscle. Among elastomers, acrylic rubbers (ACM)
      have shown good actuation performance but its use is limited by
      the high operating voltages required. The present work
      demonstrates that simultaneous incorporation of nanostructured
      carbon black and dielectric fillers offers an increase in a
      dielectric permittivity and a suitable modulus of the elastomers
      matrix, enabling an improved electro-mechanical actuation
      performance at low voltages. By the use of reinforcing carbon
      black and barium titanate in an acrylic elastomer matrix a sixfold
      increase in the dielectric permittivity was realized. A fine
      tuning of the actuation stress and, consequently, actuation strain
      can be done by a judicial selection of the different filler
      concentrations in the soft rubber matrix. Finally, a synergistic
      effect of the fillers was observed in the improved actuation
      performance of the developed materials. This work may pave the way
      to design dielectric elastomers for actuator fabrication. © 2016
