      <div align="center"><b>SEA-CROP</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      SEA-CROP is an extension of the life's work of pioneer scientist
      Dr. Maynard Murray.<br>
      <br>
      His ground-breaking book "Sea Energy Agriculture" is well known
      and loved by many.<br>
      <br>
      Over a century of well documented research has shown that seawater
      can have profound effects on both plant and animal life as long as
      sodium chloride is not over-applied.<br>
      <br>
      In the late nineteenth century <a href="../quinton/quinton.htm"
        "><b>Dr. Rene Quinton</b></a> did experiments
      showing that seawater could be used to replace blood in animals
      and he went on to develop a seawater extract that was used for
      transfusions in place of blood plasma during World War One.<br>
      <br>
      During the twentieth century Dr. Maynard Murray spent decades
      doing agricultural research with both plants and animals to
      demonstrate the many benefits that can be obtained by using both
      seawater and seawater concentrates.<br>
      <br>
      In the twenty-first century Ambrosia Technology, LLC has continued
      research based on the work of these pioneers and has developed the
      product Sea-Crop. Sea-Crop is a concentrate that contains all of
      the wonderful goodness of seawater in concentrated form but with
      the sodium chloride 95% reduced.<br>
      <br>
      It is believed that the 89 elements in seawater working together
      with its contained organic content are responsible for its well
      documented positive effects.<br>
      Leaves and raspberries from ordinary raspberry plant on left and
      the plant on the right was treated with SEA-CROP for 3 consecutive
      years. The 6 berries from the treated plant weighed 20.66 gm and
      the 6 berries from the control weighed 8.53 gm.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;SEA-CROP is a catalytic trigger that releases nature's
      energy to give the full benefit of soil microflora symbiosis.<br>
      <br>
      <b>General Observations:</b><br>
      <br>
      In all applications the root system of the treated plants was
      increased.<br>
      In all instances soil tilth and microbial populations were
      enhanced.<br>
      In all cases Sea-Crop improved the health and vigor of the treated
      plants.<br>
      Using Sea-Crop on transplants of crucifers, melons and peppers
      decreased the incidence of transplant loss by at least 50%.<br>
      In all applications the size, weight and shelf life of fruits and
      vegetables was increased.<br>

        <b>A METHOD OF PRODUCING USEFUL PRODUCTS FROM SEAWATER AND
          SIMILAR BRINES</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Inventor: ZEIGLER Arthur</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A process is provided for the recovery of useful products,
      including fertilizers and nutritional supplements, from the
      organic matter and minerals contained in seawater and other
      brines. The dissolved organic carbon-based chemicals and suspended
      particulate carbon-based organic matter are co-precipitated
      together with the contained magnesium and/or calcium, along with
      incidental trace minerals, entrained water and water of hydration.
      Caustic soda (NaOH) and other alkali base or alkaline earth bases
      and/or carbon dioxide (CO2) are added to the brine until pH of
      10.75 to 11.0 is achieved. The settled or non-dry filtered or
      centrifuged precipitate is utilized as a slurry and the
      supernatant brine is discarded.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0001 This invention relates generally to the fields of chemical
      extraction, fertilizers and nutritional supplements and more
      specifically to a METHOD OF PRODUCING USEFUL PRODUCTS FROM
      SEAWATER AND SIMILAR BRINES.<br>
      <br>
      0002 For thousands of years mankind has utilized the minerals and
      vegetable products of the oceans for both food and fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      0003 Even to this day sea salt is prized for its trace mineral
      content and kelp products are used as both food and fertilizer in
      many parts of the world.<br>
      <br>
      0004 The present invention bonds both dissolved carbon-based
      organic chemicals and suspended carbon-based organic particles to
      hydroxide precipitates of marine minerals. <br>
      0005 They are bonded ionically, mechanically, electrostatically or
      otherwise.<br>
      <br>
      0006 For the bulk of dissolved organic carbon in the ocean,
      chemical structure and basic biochemical parameters are largely
      unknown.<br>
      <br>
      0007 FuIvic acid which is ubiquitous at low concentrations in all
      parts of the ocean consists of many thousands of different organic
      substances of both marine derived and terragenous origin.<br>
      <br>
      0008 Not only are the compositions of these substances largely
      unknown, so are their physical properties.<br>
      <br>
      0009 It is known that some of these substances, especially
      exopolysaccharides, are capable of spontaneous polymerization with
      the production of jelly-like layers covering several square miles.<br>
      <br>
      0010 Dimethylsulfoniopropionate, a substance produced by
      phytoplankton for osmotic control, is generated in such quantities
      that some of its decomposition products are considered to have a
      major effect on planetary weather. It is known to have a
      kosmotropic effect on water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      0011 Other of the dissolved organic substances organize water
      molecules into liquid and solid phase clathrates and
      quasiclathrates.<br>
      <br>
      0012 A new class of highly abundant, nonliving organic marine
      particles has recently been recognized.<br>
      <br>
      0013 These colloidal particles consist primarily of exopolymers
      released as exudates by phytoplankton and bacteria.These
      exopolymer particles have been found to be present in seawater
      ranging up to 5,000 particles per ml and varying in size from 3 to
      100 nanometers.<br>
      <br>
      0014 They are characterized as containing large amounts of water
      which has been organized by the organic matter. It is postulated
      that this ability of dissolved and particulate organic matter in
      the oceans to organize and add structure to water molecules is, at
      least in part, responsible for the observable and measurable
      biological effects of the present invention on plant, animal and
      human life.<br>
      <br>
      0015 In the past, minerals have been extracted from seawater for
      fertilizer and nutritional supplementation or the organic
      chemicals have been extracted separately for the same purpose.<br>
      <br>
      0016 To the best of the inventors knowledge, no one has
      previously, intentionally extracted the two together for the
      synergistic effect which they have in combination when used as a
      slurry.<br>
      <br>
      0017 <b>U.S. Patent #3,374,081</b> is a method of separating
      minerals from seawater which are suitable for use as fertilizers
      and animal feeds. It employs added proteinaceous materials to
      precipitate minerals as chelated complexes.<br>
      <br>
      The methods employed and precipitates obtained are of very
      different nature than those of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      0018 <b>U.S. Patent #2,606,839</b> employs methods similar to the
      current invention for the purpose of producing a pure sodium
      chloride product.<br>
      <br>
      The patent shows no awareness of the valuable nature of the
      byproduct for the applications claimed by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      0019 <b>U.S. Patent #3,071,457</b> describes a method of
      evaporating seawater to dryness for application of the resultant
      solids as fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      This product very successfully increased crop yields but required
      application rates of 550 to 2,200 pounds of sea solids per acre.<br>
      <br>
      The first paragraph of this patent states that it relates only to
      the inorganic salts contained in seawater.<br>
      <br>
      0020 <b>U.S. Patent #2,404,550</b> uses methods similar to the
      current invention but uses them for the purpose of extraction and
      purification of mineral salts from the waters of the Great Salt
      Lake. One of its aims is the separation and exclusion of organic
      content from the final product. Testing of the present invention
      has demonstrated that purified minerals extracted from brines do
      not have the desired effects.<br>
      <br>
      0021 <b>U.S. Patent #2,934,419</b> uses methods similar to the
      current invention but differs in two very important respects. No
      mention is made of organic content and the mineral precipitates
      are dried. Testing of the current invention has shown that if the
      precipitates are dried they can no longer significantly stimulate
      plant growth.<br>
      <br>
      0022 <b>U.S. Patent #4,634,533</b> uses methods similar to the
      current invention to recover useful products such as fertilizer,
      animal feed supplements and mineral salts from brines. It differs
      in two important respects.<br>
      <br>
      It makes no mention of the organic chemical constituents of the
      brine.<br>
      <br>
      It requires the addition of a phosphorous source in order to have
      the claimed benefit as a fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      0023 <b>U.S. Patent #4,015,971</b> has the object of producing
      fertilizers from seawater containing "microelements and active
      organic substances".<br>
      <br>
      This is accomplished by adding bivalent iron ions to the seawater
      so that the organic substances are co-precipitated with the iron
      hydroxides. It does not utilize the contained magnesium and
      calcium brine constituents as does the present invention. The
      patent claims<br>
      <br>
      5% to 10% increased crop yields with application rates of .5 to 3
      kg of dried solids per hectare.<br>
      <br>
      On this basis it is both less effective and less economical than
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      0024 <b>U.S. Patent #5,074,901</b> is a method for producing a
      liquor from seawater by achieving a 90% reduction of the original
      volume through evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      Although the patent states that this Liquor, when diluted, will
      function as a fertilizer, its nature is very different from the
      liquor produced by the current invention.<br>
      <br>
      0025 <b>U.S. Patent #6,147,229</b> describes a method of
      producing magnesium fulvate from humus material.<br>
      <br>
      It involves digesting the humus in a solution of sodium hydroxide,
      then acidifying to precipitate humates followed by the addition of
      magnesium hydroxide to the supernatent in order to precipitate
      magnesium fulvate.<br>
      <br>
      The current invention extracts magnesium fulvate from seawater in
      a single step by the addition of sodium hydroxide, which
      precipitates the contained magnesium as hydroxide that in turn
      precipitates the contained fulvates as magnesium fulvate.<br>
      <br>
      0026 These prior usages have not recognized the benefits,
      economies and synergies that can be achieved by using the
      magnesium and/or calcium constituents of the sea water and similar
      brines to co-precipitate and recover in usable form, the organic
      chemical and particulate orgai j content of said brines.
      Furthermore, they did not recognize that the resultant
      precipitates are most bioactive in slurry form. That they did not
      do so indicates that such usage is unobvious.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Brief Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      0027 The primary object of the invention is to extract, from
      seawater and similar brines, its dissolved, carbon-based, organic
      chemicals and particulate carbon-based organic matter together
      with the contained bivalent minerals and incidental trace
      minerals, entrained water and water of hydration, so that these
      substances may be applied to beneficial use.<br>
      <br>
      0028 Another objective of the invention is to produce from
      seawater and similar brines an economical and efficacious
      fertilizer and plant growth stimulant which would contain
      microelements and active organic substances.<br>
      <br>
      0029 Another objective of the invention is to produce a
      nutritional supplement from seawater and similar brines that will
      promote health and growth in animals and humans.<br>
      <br>
      0030 An advantage of the invention is that it will produce
      magnesium fulvate from seawater and similar brines in a single
      chemical operation.<br>
      <br>
      0031 Other objects and advantages will become apparent from the
      following descriptions, taken in connection with the accompanying
      drawing, Figure 1, wherein by way of illustration and example, an
      embodiment of the present invention is disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      0032 In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention,
      there is disclosed a method of co-precipitating the carbon-based
      organic chemicals and carbon-based particulate matter contained in
      seawater and similar brines together with its constituent,
      bivalent magnesium and/or calcium and incidental trace minerals,
      entrained water and water of hydration.<br>
      <br>
      0033 In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention,
      there is disclosed a method for producing from seawater and
      similar brines, an economical and efficacious fertilizer and plant
      growth stimulant, which utilizes both the organic substances and
      constituent bivalent minerals which may be co-precipitated from
      said brines together with trace minerals, water of hydration and
      entrained waters.<br>
      <br>
      0034 In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention,
      there is disclosed a method for producing from seawater and
      similar brines, a health and growth promoting nutritional
      supplement, which utilizes both the organic substances and
      constituent bivalent minerals which may be co-precipitated from
      said brines along with trace minerals, water of hydration and
      entrained waters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments</b><br>
      <br>
      0035 Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are
      provided herein. It is to be understood, however, that the present
      invention may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific
      details enclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but
      rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for
      teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in
      virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or manner.<br>
      <br>
      0036 As illustrated in the drawing Figure 1, the seawater 10 is
      treated in a reaction vessel 11, with caustic soda (NaOH), or any
      other base or alkaline earth base that yields hydroxyl ions on
      hydrolysis. The caustic soda is indicated in the drawing as being
      fed through line 12, to the reaction vessel, 11. The concentration
      of the caustic soda is such that the number of hydroxyl ions added
      from line 12 is chemically equivalent to the total concentration
      of the magnesium ions present in the seawater from the source, 10.
      As a practical application, caustic soda is added until a pH of
      10.75 to 11.0 is achieved. Soda ash (Na2CO3) or any other alkali
      carbonate or alkaline earth carbonate is added to the seawater in
      reaction vessel 11, in such concentration that the carbonate ions
      are chemically equivalent to the calcium ions present in the
      seawater. The soda ash is schematically indicated on the drawing
      as being added to the reaction vessel 11, through line 14, and
      such addition may be simultaneously with, or at different times
      from, the addition of the caustic soda. Preferably, the seawater
      with the caustic soda and soda ash added thereto is agitated in
      the reaction vessel 11, to complete the dissolving and reaction of
      the chemicals.<br>
      <br>
      0037 A precipitation occurs within a few minutes after the
      addition of chemicals to the reaction vessel 11, from lines 12 and
      14 and such precipitate is for the most part, magnesium hydroxide
      and calcium carbonate. The surface area of such magnesium
      hydroxide precipitates is tremendous, largely due to the fact that
      it precipitates out in very small particles. The calcium carbonate
      precipitate also has a very large surface area. The magnesium
      hydroxide and calcium carbonate precipitates absorb trace elements
      in the seawater on their large surface areas and thereby trace
      elements are also separated from the seawater. Fulvates are
      precipitated as magnesium fulvate. Most importantly, substantially
      all of the dissolved organic carbon-based chemicals and
      particulate carbon-based organic matter are co-precipitated
      together with the magnesium hydroxide and calcium carbonate and
      bonded to their surface either mechanically, ionically or
      electrostatically. They can thus be separated from the seawater
      together with their waters of hydration.<br>
      <br>
      0038 Another preferred embodiment of the invention, which will
      achieve the same result as the preceding description, would be as
      illustrated in Figure 1, to treat the seawater 10, in reaction
      vessel 11, with caustic soda or any other base or alkaline earth
      base that yields hydroxyl ions on hydrolysis. The caustic soda
      (NaOH) is indicated in the drawing as being fed through line 12,
      to the reaction vessel 11. The concentration of the caustic soda
      is such that the number of hydroxyl ions added from line 12, is
      chemically equivalent to the total concentration of the magnesium
      ions present in the seawater from the source, 10. As a practical
      application, caustic soda is added until a pH of 10.75 to 11.0 is
      achieved. Next, the liquor in reaction vessel 11, is agitated and
      carbon dioxide gas is introduced through supply pipe 15, in an
      amount sufficient to precipitate all of the contained calcium as
      calcium carbonate.<br>
      <br>
      0039 Another preferred embodiment of the invention, which will
      extract and recover all of the organic carbon contained in the
      seawater, would be as illustrated in Figure 1, to treat the
      seawater 10, in reaction vessel 11, with caustic soda (NaOH) as
      indicated in the drawing as being supplied through line 12 to the
      reaction vessel 11. The concentration of the caustic soda is such
      that the number of hydroxyl ions added from line 12, is chemically
      equivalent to the total concentration of magnesium ions present in
      the seawater from the source, 10. Potassium hydroxide is also
      added, as indicated in Figure 1, through supply line 13. The KOH
      is supplied in sufficient quantity to convert all of the calcium
      contained in the liquor being treated in reaction vessel 11, into
      calcium hydroxide. As a practical application, but not limited to
      this example, the sodium hydroxide can be supplied, together with
      the potassium hydroxide, in a ratio of 95% sodium hydroxide to 5%
      potassium hydroxide. This blend is supplied to the reaction vessel
      11, until a pH of 10.75 to 11.0 is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      0040 All of the examples given as preferred embodiment will
      achieve substantially the same results, as far as co-precipitating
      together with the magnesium and calcium, substantially all of the
      dissolved carbon-based chemicals and carbon-based particulate
      organic matter contained in the seawater feed illustrated as 10,
      in Figure 1.<br>
      <br>
      0041 Once the precipitation is achieved in the reaction vessel 11
      by the chosen method, the liquor is allowed to stand quietly for a
      period of time so that the precipitates may settle. In a preferred
      embodiment of the invention as illustrated in Figure 1, the liquor
      is allowed to rest in settling tank 16, for 48 hours and the
      supernatant solution, 17, is then decanted and discarded. The
      settled precipitates are the valuable product illustrated in
      Figure 1, as 18, the slurry product.<br>
      <br>
      0042 Seed germination tests done by the inventor have shown that
      if the slurry is allowed to dry out, it losses its potency even if
      rehydrated. Other tests have shown that it is the presence of the
      organic content together with the bivalent marine minerals which
      make the slurry product effective. A slurry of pure magnesium
      and/or calcium hydroxide will not produce the beneficial effects
      on plant and animal life that the slurry produced by the present
      invention does.<br>
      <br>
      0043 If it is desired to alter the characteristics of the slurry
      product identified as 18 in Figure 1, minerals or other substances
      with the desired attributes may be added before and/or after
      precipitation. For example, bivalent iron could be added to feed
      10 and it would be precipitated along with the other minerals as
      hydroxide. For special applications, any number of minerals or
      other substances can be added before and/or after precipitation to
      give desired characteristics to the slurry product.<br>
      <br>
      0044 In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the precipitates
      will contain from 10 to 50 grams per liter of total suspended
      solids, although other proportions may be achieved if so desired.<br>
      <br>
      0045 The slurry is stored in opaque containers away from direct
      sunlight and strong electromagnetic fields, which may cause the
      loss of potency.<br>
      <br>
      0046 As a fertilizer and plant growth stimulant, in a preferred
      embodiment the slurry is added to the growth medium at the rate of
      one or more gallons per acre.<br>
      <br>
      0047 In another preferred embodiment of a fertilizer prepared
      under this invention, the slurry product illustrated in Figure 1,
      as 18, and containing 20 grams of total suspended solids per
      liter, would be diluted with 999 parts of water so that the final
      solution contains .1% of the slurry, illustrated as 18. To this
      solution, any soluble nitrate fertilizer may be added at its
      recommended rate. The resultant solution may be added directly to
      the growth medium or applied as a foliar spray.<br>
      <br>
      0048 Wheat treated in this manner has yielded 36% more grain by
      weight than the control, which received the nitrate fertilizer
      only, hi this test the slurry 18, was applied at the rate of one
      gallon per acre. Similar results have been achieved with a variety
      of row and orchard crops. Typical results with fruit include
      increased size, increased sugar content, increased overall yield
      and better keeping quality. 0049 If it is desired to alter the
      characteristics of the agricultural slurry product, minerals or
      other substances with the desired attributes may be added before
      and/or after precipitation. For example, bivalent iron could be
      added to feed 10 and it would be precipitated along with the other
      minerals as hydroxide. Ionic zinc is an example of a mineral that
      might be added after precipitation. For special applications, any
      number of minerals or other substances can be added before and/or
      after precipitation to give desired characteristics to the
      agricultural slurry product.<br>
      <br>
      0050 As a preferred embodiment of a nutritional supplement for
      animals prepared from the slurry product identified as 18 in
      Figure 1, the slurry product containing 20 grams of total
      suspended solids per liter is added to the drinking water or feed
      so that the daily dosage is one tenth to one half milliliter per
      kilogram of body weight.<br>
      <br>
      0051 The daily dose of this preparation is used to describe a
      daily dose for a primate having a body weight of 70 kgs, unless
      otherwise stated.<br>
      <br>
      0052 hi animal testing conducted by the inventor, the above
      formula was used at the rate of .4 milliliters per kg of body
      weight per day to supplement the diet of white mice for a period
      of thirty days, after which they were subjected to forced swim
      testing. During the test period of 30 days the control population,
      consisting of 10 mice that did not receive the supplement,
      experienced a 30% mortality while the test population, consisting
      of 30 mice that received the supplementation, experienced no
      mortalities.<br>
      <br>
      0053 When subjected to swim testing, the mice that had received
      the supplementation were able to endure for a period averaging
      3.23 times greater than the control population.<br>
      <br>
      The groups which had received the supplementation had a 3.8 %
      greater body weight at the termination of the test than did the
      control population.<br>
      <br>
      0054 In a preferred embodiment of this invention to prepare a
      nutritional supplement for humans, the seawater feed illustrated
      as 10 in Figure 1, would be filtered before being placed in the
      reaction vessel 11, in order to remove any extraneous material.
      The final slurry product 18 would undergo additional processing to
      become the food grade slurry product identified in Figure 1 as 19.
      The slurry would be rinsed by diluting to five times its volume
      with fresh water and allowed to settle. This is illustrated in
      Figure 1 with the fresh water shown as being supplied by line 20.<br>
      <br>
      0055 After 48 hours the supernatant would be discarded as shown in
      Figure 1 by line 21 and sodium chloride would be added at the rate
      of one gram per liter and this is illustrated in Figure 1 as being
      supplied by line 23. The resultant liquor may be further
      sterilized before bottling by boiling for 10 minutes and, after
      boiling and being allowed to cool, an addition of 35% hydrogen
      peroxide is made at the rate of 2 milliliters per gallon of
      liquor. The H2O2 is shown in Figure 1 as being supplied by line
      22. Total suspended solids in the food grade slurry will vary
      between 7 and 20 grams per liter and may be otherwise concentrated
      or diluted.<br>
      <br>
      0056 This liquor may be used as a beverage or added to food to
      promote health and vigor, hi a preferred embodiment of packaging,
      after bottling, the food grade slurry would be over-packed in
      metalized plastic film or anti-static protective bags such as is
      used for shipment of computer parts. Alternatively a metalized
      bottle could be used or metal foil could be utilized as an outer
      cover. These measures allow the product to be stored and shipped
      without loss of potency.<br>
      <br>
      0057 If it is desired to alter the characteristics of the food
      slurry product identified as 19 in Figure 1, minerals or other
      substances with the desired attributes may be added before and/or
      after precipitation. For example, bivalent iron could be added to
      feed 10 and it would be precipitated along with the other minerals
      as hydroxide. For special applications, any number of minerals or
      other substances can be added before and/or after precipitation to
      give desired characteristics to the slurry product. Ionic cobalt
      and iodine are examples of minerals that might be added after
      precipitation.<br>
      <br>
      0058 With respect to all methods disclosed herein, all steps,
      procedures or processes may be considered to be done without
      regard to the priority unless specified, or dictated by necessity
      or force of logic. The identification of steps or products in any
      priority is done only for the purpose of introducing them and
      distinguishing them from one another, unless otherwise dictated by
      necessity or force of logic.<br>
      <br>
      0059 The foregoing is offered primarily for purposes of
      illustration. It will be readily apparent to those skilled in the
      art that the proportions, material, formulation procedures,
      administration protocols and other parameters of this invention
      may be further modified or substituted in various ways without
      departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      0060 While the invention has been described in connection with a
      preferred embodiment, it is not intended to limit the scope of the
      invention to the particular form set forth, but on the contrary,
      it is intended to cover such alternative, modifications, and
      equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the
      invention as defined by the appended claims. Table 1 Experimental
      Proofs<br>
      <br>
      Our agricultural research has established the following data:<br>
      <br>
      1. Seeds treated with the invention and germinated in a closed
      container consumed 118% more oxygen in the first 24 hours than did
      the control. This test of aerobic cellular respiration shows that
      independent of all other factors, cellular respiration of the
      plant is increased.<br>
      <br>
      2. Yeast introduced to the invention in sugar water and placed in
      a sealed container generated one third more CO2 in the first 24
      hours than the untreated control. This test of anaerobic cellular
      respiration shows that independent of what is happening in the
      plant; increased cellular respiration will take place in
      microorganisms in treated soil.<br>
      <br>
      3. Treated soil in which wheat was germinated and grown out for 20
      days was analyzed by a soil laboratory. The test showed that the
      invention gave an increase of total bacterial biomass 32% greater
      than fertilizer alone did. The test also showed that the treated
      soil had an increase of total fungal biomass. The increase over
      baseline was 264% greater with the invention than fertilizer alone
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      4. Brix refractometer testing of the sap from all of the various
      species being trialed has shown at least a 30% greater content of
      dissolved solids, primarily sugars, in the sap of the treated
      plants when compared to the controls. This can only be achieved
      through increased photosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      Taken together the data indicate the following:<br>
      <br>
      A. All species of plants, when treated with the invention, will
      gain the benefit of more energy through increased cellular
      respiration and increased photosynthesis.<br>
      <br>
      B. Soil health and vitality of the treated soil will be greatly
      increased due to greater microorganism growth and content.<br>
      <br>
      C. As a consequence of points A. and B., those species of plants
      that have a symbiotic relationship with mycorrhizal fungi should
      experience increased yields in direct proportion to each species
      degree of dependence upon the mycorrhizal relationship.<br>
      <br>
      This hypothesis is validated by the following test data: Potato
      trials indicate Table 1 Experimental Proofs<br>
      <br>
      achievable yield increases in the vicinity of 100% over and above
      what fertilizer alone can produce. Wheat trials show increases of
      25% to 45%. Other species show a similar pattern.<br>
      <br>
      The fungi obtain carbohydrates and growth factors from the roots
      of the plants. As the invention increases these carbohydrates in
      the sap by over 30%, and at the same time increases the cellular
      respiration of the soil microorganisms, a previously unattainable
      synergy is achieved. This accounts for much of the enhanced yields
      and plant health that we have observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Animal Testing <br>
        The method:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Four week old white mice were obtained and split into two
      populations. The control population consisted often mice and the
      other group consisted of thirty mice.<br>
      <br>
      AU populations were given measured amounts of the same food and
      measured amounts of water daily. The mice in the test population
      were also each given five drops of the formula in their water
      every day for thirty days.<br>
      <br>
      During the first week of the test there was a 30% mortality for
      the control population but no deaths occurred in the group
      receiving supplemention with the invention.<br>
      <br>
      Termination:<br>
      <br>
      At the end of 30 days the mice were subjected to forced swim
      testing to the point of terminal exhaustion and death.<br>
      <br>
      The Results:<br>
      <br>
      1. The control group, that had not received supplementation,
      endured for an average of 257 minutes, or 4 hours and 17 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      2. The test population, that had received the invention endured
      for an average of 830 minutes, or 13 hours and 49 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      Observations:<br>
      <br>
      The test population, that received supplementation exhibited more
      stamina than the control group by enduring the forced swim testing
      for a much greater duration.<br>
      <br>
      Conclusions:<br>
      <br>
      Supplementation with the invention as performed in this study
      greatly enhances stamina.<br>

        <b>Method of producing fertilizers from sea-like waters&nbsp;
          &nbsp;</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the production of fertiizers for
      agriculture and, more specifically to fertilizers produced from
      sea-like waters. The term "sea-like waters" means any natural
      water featuring chlorine factors of individual components and
      elements of the water which are characteristic of ocean water. The
      chlorine factor is calculated from the formula: Kel = % el .times.
      100/% Cl, where % el is the percentage of a component, elements; %
      Cl is the percentage of chloride ions.<br>
      <br>
      Known in the art are fertilizers produced from sea water. These
      fertilizers may be exemplified by, for example, potassium salts.
      Potassium salts are prepared from sea water by addition of
      phosphate ions to water containing potassium and magnesium,
      increasing its pH to 7.5-9.5 by means of an ammonium-free base,
      and separation of a residue the water by filtration, decantation
      or centrifugation. Potassium salt is separated from the resulting
      residue of a double slt of potassium-magnesium according to the
      reaction:<br>
      MgKPO4 + NH4 A .fwdarw. MgNH4 PO4 + KA<br>
      <br>
      where A is an anion (cf. U.S. Pat. No. 3,195,978).<br>
      <br>
      Another process (U.S. Pat. No. 3,382,038) contemplates recovery of
      potassium from sea water by the addition of an alkali to increase
      its pH to 10.5-12 and elevation of the water temperature from 25
      DEG to 100 DEG C. Potassium along with other components is
      precipitated. Finally, potassium may be recovered from sea water
      by contact with a naturally-occurring zeolite, viz-glauconite,
      from which it is partially removed by treating with a solution of
      an ammonium salt the thus-regenerated zeolite or glauconite is
      again contacted with sea water, followed by treating with a
      solution of an ammonium salt to produce a potassium salt (U.S.
      Pat. No. 3,497,314). Potassium salts pertain to the class of
      microfertilizers and it is necessary to introduce into soil
      several hundred kilograms of said salts per one hectare. If
      potassium is recovered from sea water by the above-said processes,
      losses of such valuable components as ions of ammonium,
      phosphate-ions, caustic soda are possible as a result of
      increasing the pH of sea water. Moreover, said salts neither
      contain microelements and organic substances. Potassium salts
      recovered from sea water correspond to similar fertilizers, in
      their efficiency and purpose, produced in various countries from
      salt deposits on dry land. The only advantage of the
      above-mentioned fertilizers is that they may be produced by any
      conuntry with an access to sea water. The main disadvantage of
      potassium fertilizers produced from sea water resides in a
      relatively high loss of ammonium and phosphorus ions and a high
      alkali consumption, whereby production of potassium fertilizers
      from sea water is limited.<br>
      <br>
      It is an object of the present invention to produce fertilizers
      from sea water which would contain microelements and active
      organic substances.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to select such a
      composition of the fertilizers which would selectively stimulate
      the growth and evolution of agricultural plants.<br>
      <br>
      Still another object of the present invention is to provide such a
      composition of the fertilizers which could be used in combination
      with other type fertilizers.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the present invention is to provide such a
      method of producing fertilizers from sea water which would be
      easily reproduced on a commercial scale on the basis of cheap and
      readily-available raw materials.<br>
      <br>
      The method of producing fertilizers, according to the present
      invention comprises introduction, into the sea-like water, of ions
      of bivalent iron in an amount within the range of from 10 to 100
      mg of iron per liter of said water at a pH = 5 to 9; therewith,
      bivalent iron ions are oxidized and transformed into trivalent
      iron ions with the formation of iron hydroxide; sorption of
      microelements and organic substances being present in said water
      by iron hydroxide at said pH values without sorption of sodium
      chloride; separation of the resulting precipitate; drying of the
      separated precipitate to the air-dry state containing
      predominantly iron in an amount of from 23.4 to 31.5%, total
      carbon 2.3 to 3.0%, total amount of microelements 0.1 to 0.3%.<br>
      <br>
      As has been mentioned hereinbefore, concentration of hydrogen ions
      in sea water should be within the pH range of from 5 to 9. If the
      pH of water is below 5, then the rate of oxidation of Fe@2@+ ions
      into Fe@3@+ becomes strongly retarded and the fertilizer yield
      becomes substantially reduced, while at a pH of water above 9 the
      resulting product becomes diluted with potassium and magnesium
      hydroxides, wherefore its effectiveness, as a fertilizer, is
      substantially lowered.<br>
      <br>
      When iron is added to sea water in an amount of less than 10 mg
      Fe/1, it is necessary to separate too large amounts of water from
      the precipitate and the fertilizer production cost is
      substantially increased; if iron is introduced into sea water in
      an amount of more than 100 mg Fe/1, the resulting product has a
      small content of organic substances, wherefore its efficiency is
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      As a source of bivalent iron ions it is advisable to use ferrous
      salts both in a solid and liquid state. It is preferred, however,
      to spent solutions from etching ferrous metals with hydrochloride
      acid; these solutions are available in considerable amounts from
      plants of mechanical engineering and ship-building industries.
      Said solutions are toxic production wastes and great sums of money
      are allocated to eliminate them, wherefore the use of spent
      etching solutions for the production of fertilizers is
      economically efficient and, furthermore, large areas of land and
      sea are not polluted and, hence, environment pollution is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      Solutions from etching of ferrous metals usually contain 120-160 g
      of iron per liter of a solution and 30 to 60 g/1 of hydrochloric
      acid; occasionally in such solutions there may be present
      corrosion inhibitors in an amount of from 0.8 to 1.2% such as a
      product of copolymerization of urotropin and aniline. Our
      investigations in vegetation tests under field conditions have
      shown that corrosion inhibitors being present in the fertilizer do
      not exert any noticeable effect on the fertilizer efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      In the practice of the present invention, the method according
      thereto is effected as follows. Sea water is poured into a vessel
      and ferrous chloride is introduced thereinto in the form of a
      solid salt, aqueous solution, or spent etching solution at a rate
      of 10 to 100 mg Fe/1 of water. The pH of the water is maintained
      within the range of from 5 to 9. Ions of bivalent iron introduced
      into sea water are oxidized according to the following scheme:<br>
      4Fe@2@+ + O2 + 2H2 O .fwdarw. 4Fe@3@+ + 4OH@-<br>
      <br>
      the resulting ions are hydrolyzed:<br>
      Fe@3@+ + H2 O .fwdarw. Fe(OH)@2@+ + H@+<br>
      <br>
      with the formation of hydroxide Fe(OH)@2@+ = H2 O.fwdarw.[Fe(OH)2
      ]@+ + H@+, containing active positively charged centers capable of
      recovering, according to the ion-exchange mechanism, valuable
      metals such as copper, zinc, molybdenum as well as amine complexes
      and other components from sea water. The resulting precipitates of
      ferrous hydroxide possess a particular property, i.e. they result
      in no sorption of sodium ions. This phenomenon is favorable for
      the fertilizer quality as will be shown hereinbelow. Sorption time
      is 0.1 to 6.0 hours. Solid particles of iron hydroxide with
      co-precipitated thereon microelements and organic substances are
      separated from sea water by decantation with subsequent filtration
      of the precipitate. The filtered precipitate contains about 70% of
      water.<br>
      <br>
      This precipitate is dried to the air-dry state, i.e. such a state
      when the precipitate contains an equilibric amount of humidity
      under normal conditions. To this end, the precipitate is poured
      over the ground and dried under environmental conditions or in
      special drying chambers at a temperature of from 0 DEG to 50 DEG
      C. When dried at a temperature of above 50 DEG C, the fertilizer
      may have its activity lost, wherefore the use of such temperatures
      is not advisable. As a result of these operations, a fertilizer of
      the above-mentioned composition is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention has the following advantages: the process of
      its preparation is rather simple and commercially efficient
      sources of the starting material, i.e. sea-like waters, are
      practically unlimited and each country has vast resources of
      ferrous salts. Taking into account the fact of utilization, with
      equal success, of waste products containing ferrous salts,
      economic efficiency is substantially increased. In addition, the
      method of the present invention contributes to preventing
      pollution of the environment with poisonous production wastes. The
      fertilizer according to the present invention has an additional
      advantage residing in that it steadily increases the yield
      capacity of numerous agricultural plants by at least 5-10% at an
      insignificant rate of 0.5 to 3 kg of one hectare. Another feature
      of the present invention resides in its ability to stimulate the
      growth of grape vines and increasing the yield capacity of not
      only pulse plants but other type plants as well.<br>
      <br>
      For a better understanding of the present invention some specific
      Examples illustrating the method of producing fertilizers as well
      as the use of the thus-produced fertilizers in with respect to
      particular agricultural plants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Into a pool there was poured Black Sea water with a salinity of
      1.83% and composition (percentage of the salt mass): NaCl--77.29;
      KCl--2.11; MgCl2 -- 8.92; MgSO4 -- 6.33; MgBr2 -- 0.20; CaSO4 --
      3.64; Ca(HCO3)2 -- 1.52.<br>
      <br>
      the water also contained 3.5 mg/1 organic substances, 3.10@-@6 g
      Cu/1, 4.10@-@6 g Mo/1, 8.10@-@6 g Zn/1. It was added with a spent
      solution from etching of iron containing 120 g/1 of Fe, 30 g/1 of
      HCl, and 1% of an inhibitor. Concentration of hydrogen ions in the
      solution was adjusted to a predetermined value by means of a 36%
      hydrochloric acid or solid soda; the solution was mixed by means
      of air bubbling. After settling of the solution for 24 hours,
      water was decanted. The resulting precipitate was filtered through
      a dense tissue and dried in the air at a temperature within the
      range of from 20 DEG to 35 DEG C. <br>
      Conditions of the process and results obtained are given, for six
      texts in Table 1 hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Chemical characteristics of the products obtained in tests a, b,
      c, d, e are given in Table 2.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It may be seen from Table 2 that the fertilizers produced at a
      higher concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution contain
      greater amounts of organic substances, while at a lower
      concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution fertilizers with a
      greater content of microelements are produced.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that a pH within the range of from 6.9 to 7.2
      was the most advantageous for the process. This pH range was
      selected due to the fact that practically no hydrochloric acid or
      sodium carbonate need to be added to the sea water, whereby
      fertilizers with a minimal production cost could be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      Vegetation tests of the fertilizers for growth and development of
      various agricultural plants have shown a high efficiency thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Effect of the fertilizers produced from sea water in tests a and d
      was determined in vegetation field experiments according to the
      following scheme:<br>
      1. Control - seeds not treated with the fertilizers<br>
      2. Seeds treated with the fertilizes<br>
      3. Fertilizers were introduced into soil.<br>
      <br>
      The tests were performed on soils of Ucraine and Moldavia. In
      vegetation experiments the effect of a pre-seeding treatment of
      seeds as well as the soil dressing effect on the productivity of
      sugar beet and corn were studied. Seeds of sugar beet and corn
      were treated at the rate of 0.125 kg of the fertilizer per 100 kg
      of seeds of corn and 1.0 kg. of the fertilizer per 100 kg. of
      seeds of sugar beet. The solid was dressed, for sugar beet, at the
      rate of 1.5 kg of the fertilizers, and for corn at the rate of 0.5
      kg of the fertilizers per 10 kg of commercial fertilizer mixture
      based on nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (referred to
      hereinafter as NPK for the sake of brevity). Each experiment was
      repeated 5 times. Soil humidity in the experiments was 70% of the
      total moisture-absorbing capacity of the soil. The results of the
      vegetation tests of sugar beet and corn are given in Table 3
      hereinbelow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It follows from Table 3 that the use of the fertilizer according
      to the present invention increases the total mass of beet, its
      sugar content, reduces the content of harmful nitrogen. For corn
      there is an increase in total mass and grain. According to the
      visual observations, beets to which the fertilizers of the present
      invention were used in combination with pre-seeding enrichment of
      seeds and with its introducing into soil, showed a more developed
      leaf surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1972 under field conditions the influence of pre-seeding
      enrichment of seeds with the fertilizer of the present invention
      on yield and sugar content on podzolic soils was studied.
      Meteorological conditions of that year were unfavorable for sugar
      beet. In the beginning of the vegetation period there was an
      insufficient amount of humidity in the soil, poor precipitation,
      while at the end of the period there was an abundant precipitation
      which made the soil more dense thus imparing its aeration.<br>
      <br>
      According to the data provided by the meteorological station of
      the region where the experiments were performed, stock of humidity
      in a one-meter soil layer was 22 mm during the test period at the
      relative humidity of air of 62%. Only in July and August in a
      meter soil layer the stock of humidity increased to 104-176 mm at
      a relative humidity of air 70-75% while in September there was a
      drought again.<br>
      <br>
      Efficiency of the fertilizers under these conditions is shown in
      Table 4.<br>
      <br>
      Table 4 illustrates unquestionable improvement of said
      characteristics by using the fertilizer according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It should be noted that the fertilizer introduced into soil is
      located in places of root spreading. This phenomenon was noticed
      both in laboratory and nature; it probably exerts a favorable
      action on the plant growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLE 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The fertilizer of the present invention produced in test d was
      tested during a two years' period for soil dressing of two strains
      of grapes "Risling" "Rkatsiteli" and cabbage "Mozharskaja".
      Dressing was effected by means of a 1% aqueous solution of the
      fertilizer suspension simultaneously with nitrous fertilizers in
      the amount of 400 l of the suspension per one hectare. The soil
      for cabbage was dressed with a 0.5% aqueous solution of the
      fertilizer suspension in the amount of 400 l per one hectare. The
      test results are given in Table 5.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Table 5</b><b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;<br>
      As seen from the data of this Table, the use of the fertilizer of
      the present invention increases the yield of grapes and, to some
      extent, its sugar content; yield of cabbage is substantially
      increased.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to said plants, we have performed vegetation and field
      tests of the fertilizer of the present invention on such plants as
      pea and millet. These test also provide the efficiency of the
      fertilizers according to the present invention, since the results
      of four field tests on gray podzol soils and grassland chernozems
      showed an increased, by 21-62 c/ha, yield of sugar beet, improved
      sugar content by 0.4-0.8%; sugar output was increased by 4.7-5.0
      c/ha.<br>
      <br>
      Soil dressing with the fertilizer of the present invention along
      with NPK, as determined by the results of one experiment on gray
      polzol soils, increased the yield of sugar beet roots by 51 c/ha
      with simultaneous increase in the root sugar content by 1.1%.<br>
      <br>
      The yield of corn silage mass in one experiment on
      solonetz-chestnut soils was increased, as compared to the control
      value, by 40 c/ha and yield of corn grain - by 4.4 c/ha.<br>
      <br>
      The yield of corn silage mass in three experiments on
      calcareous-chestnut, solonetz-chestnut and grassland-chernozemic
      soils was increased by 20 to 40 c/ha.<br>
      <br>
      The yield of winter wheat in two experiments on gray podzol and
      calcareous-chestnut soils was increased by 3.0-3.6 c/ha; yield of
      corn grain under the same conditions as for wheat was increased by
      3.7 c/ha.<br>
      <br>
      The yield of millet, according to the data of a two-years' test

        <b>Method of converting brines to useful products&nbsp; &nbsp;</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      SOMERVILLE, R., et al.<br>
      <br>
      A process is provided for the recovery of one or more useful
      products including fertilizer, animal feed supplements, iron
      oxide, magnesia, salt, purified brine, and purified water from
      brines. The source of the brines can be oil and gas field wastes,
      seawater or effluent from a seawater desalination plant, or other
      inland brine sources. Iron and magnesium are initially
      precipitated from the brine. Then phosphoric acid is added to the
      brine followed by an alkaline agent to produce precipitates useful
      as fertilizer and animal feed supplements. The remaining salt in
      the brine may then be removed and recovered along with purified
      water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a process for converting brines into
      useful products, and more particularly to converting saline waters
      such as oil and gas field brine wastes, seawater or effluent from
      a seawater desalination plant, or other inland saline waters into
      animal feed supplements, fertilizer, salt, purified brine and
      purfied water.<br>
      <br>
      Oil and gas field operations generate waste products in the
      production and handling of crude oil and natural gas. These waste
      products include drilling mud pit waters and oil and gas field
      brines. The quantities of brines produced in oil and gas fields
      can be substantial, with brine fractions accounting for from 4 to
      96 percent of the total liquid volume produced. Brines from other
      inland or seawater sources also present disposal problems.<br>
      <br>
      Various method of disposal of these brines have been attempted
      including solar evaporation, thermal evaporation, controlled
      release of brines into surface water, and injection of brines into
      subterranean formations. However, in areas of high annual rainfall
      and/or high relative humidity, such as much of the midwestern and
      eastern portions of the United States, solar evaporation becomes
      impractical. Moreover, with increasing state and federal
      regulatory pressures, diversion of large volumes of brine into
      surface waters is not an environmentally acceptable solution.<br>
      <br>
      While evaporation as a means of recovering fresh water from these
      saline sources has been attempted, the presence in such brines of
      a large proportion of divalent metal chlorides such as calcium and
      magnesium chloride have greatly complicated recovery efforts.
      These metal chlorides are highly corrosive to process equipment
      surfaces and deposit hard to remove mineral scales. This scale
      deposition becomes an even greater problem when the brines are
      heated.<br>
      <br>
      Presently, brine treatment using dissolved air flotation methods
      to remove suspended oil, followed by deep well injection of the
      brine is regarded by the United States Environmental Protection
      Agency as the best practicable technology for disposal. However,
      deep well injectin is expensive, difficult to design to a given
      level of capacity, and requires careful conditioning of the brine
      prior to injection. Also, deep well injection of brines may
      present a contamination hazard to fresh water aquifers. Economies
      of scale favor deep well injection systems having capacities of
      millions of gallons of brines per month. However, in oil and gas
      fields in the midwestern and eastern United States where less
      brine wastes are produced than in western oil fields, and where
      the oil and gas fields themselves are smaller, deep well injection
      may not, in many instances, be an economically feasible disposal
      alternative.<br>
      <br>
      Some attempts have been made in the past to separate useful
      byproducts from brines or other industrial waste waters. For
      example, Miller, U.S. Pat. No. 3,374,081, teaches a method of
      precipitating minerals from saline waters using lignin compounds,
      proteinaceous compounds, and tannins. The saline waters are
      initially concentrated by evaporation and the resultant salt
      precipitate removed. Then an organic precipitating agent such as a
      lignin or tannin is added to form an organic fertilizer containing
      other inorganic minerals.<br>
      <br>
      Baldassari, U.S. Pat. No. 4,069,033, teaches the extraction of
      fertilizer salts and organic substances from a variety of
      industrial waste waters including sugar mill, distillery, and
      fermentation wastes. Baldassari teaches the use of strong acids or
      bases to form precipitates from such waste waters which
      precipitates are taught to be useful as fertilizers. However,
      neither of these particular procedures is believed to have gained
      widespread use.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the need exists for a cost effective and
      environmentally acceptable method for the disposal of oil and gas
      field waste brines and other saline water sources.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention provides for the recovery of valuable
      products such as animal feed supplements, fertilizers, magnesia,
      iron oxide, salt, purified brine, and purified water from saline
      water sources such as oil and gas field waste brines and seawater.
      These products are useful materials having economic value.<br>
      <br>
      According to one aspect of the present invention, a method is
      provided in which an oxidizing agent is initially added to the
      brine to remove iron from the brine as a precipitate. An alkaline
      agent is then added to the brine to adjust the pH of the brine to
      the range of 7.5 to 9.0 to cause magnesium ions present in the
      brine to precipitate and be removed. Sufficiently phosphoric acid
      is then added to the brine to provide a substantially
      stoicheometric ratio of phosphoric acid to divalent cations,
      principally calcium, in the brine. An alkaline agent is then added
      to the brine to form calcium phosphate precipitates which are
      useful as an animal feed supplements or fertilizers.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the remaining dissolved salts in the brine solution,
      which is now substantially free of divalent metal compounds, can
      be readily separated and recovered by the use of a vapor
      compression evaporator crystallizer of multiple effect evaporator
      crystallizer. The recovered salt is principally sodium chloride.
      This salt is a highly purified product which is useful for
      practically all commercial purposes. The water which is recovered
      from the separation process is substantially free of dissolved
      solids and deleterious metal cations and can be disposed of
      directly or can be sold as purified water to industrial and
      commercial concerns.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a
      process for the recovery of one or more useful products incuding
      animal feed supplements, fertilizer, iron oxides, magnesia, salt,
      purified brine, and purified water from brines. This and other
      objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the
      following detailed desription, the accompanying drawing, and the
      appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      The single drawing FIGURE illustrates, in the form of a schematic
      diagram, the process of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the practice of the present invention, and with
      reference to the drawing FIGURE, a saline water source such as an
      oil field waste brine, seawater, or other inland saline water is
      initially stored in a large pit, tank, or storage chamber 10. The
      pit, tank, or storage chamber 10 is preferably lined or otherwise
      formed to be substantially water tight. If an oil or gas field
      waste brine is used as the saline water source, it may be
      necessary to remove traces of oil which are present in the brine.
      Typically, there is approximately one-half pint of oil per barrel
      of brine as received from oil field operations. This oil removal
      is accomplished through the use of a surface skimmer 12 which
      collects oil floating on the surface of the brine and pumps it via
      line 14 and pump 16 to an oil storage tank 18.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, further oil may be removed from the brine in a
      separation device such as heater treater 20 after removal of the
      brine from pit 10 via line 22 and pump 24. Heater treater 20
      typically comprises a holding tank or the like which provides
      undisturbed residence time for separation of the oil and brine.
      Heat is supplied to heater treater 20 to accelerate the separation
      process, and, optionally, chemicals may be added to heater treater
      20 which further enhance separation.<br>
      <br>
      The brine is then filtered to remove suspended solids by pumping
      it via line 26 through filter 28. Filter 28 may be any suitable
      filtration device and is preferably a vacuum drum or plate and
      frame type filter. Such filtration devices are commercially
      available from a number of sources.<br>
      <br>
      After filtration, the brine is sent to tank 30 where an oxidizing
      agent is added to the brine to convert any ferrous ions present in
      the brine to the ferric state. Suitable oxidizing agents include
      hydrogen peroxide, or ozone. Preferably, this oxidizing reaction
      is carried out at an acidic pH. Depending on the pH of the brine
      entering tank 30, the pH of the solution may be adjusted by the
      addition of an acid or base to bring it within the optimum range.
      An additional advantage of the oxidation step of the process is
      that it will destroy any traces of organic materials which may be
      present in the brine.<br>
      <br>
      After oxidization, an alkaline agent is added to tank 30 to raise
      the pH of the brine to about 7.0 and cause all iron ions present
      therein to precipitate as iron oxides. The brine is then sent to a
      suitable filter 32 where the iron oxide precipitate is removed.
      The brine is then pumped via pump 34 to a further holding tank 36.<br>
      <br>
      At this point in the process, magnesium is removed from the brine.
      The presence of magnesium ions in the brine at a later point in
      the process will result in the production of products having a
      lower ecomonic value. Additionally, purified magnesium compounds
      have economic value. Magnesium is typically present in the brine
      as magnesium chloride which can be reacted with an alkaline
      material to form magnesium hydroxide as illustrated by equations I
      and II below:<br>
      MgCl2 +2NaOH.fwdarw.Mg(OH)2 +2NaCl (I)<br>
      <br>
      MgCl2 +Ca(OH)2 .fwdarw.Mg(OH)2 +CaCl2 (II)<br>
      <br>
      To remove magnesium, the brine is pumped via pump 38 to reactor
      40. A sufficient amount of an alkaline agent to adjust the pH of
      the brine to the range of 7.5 to 9.0 is added to reactor 40. A pH
      meter (not shown) may be used to monitor the pH of the brine
      solution. After reaction, the brine may be sent to a thickener or
      settling tank 42 where the precipitated magnesium hydroxide would
      be concentrated. The precipitate is then filtered in filter 44,
      washed free of soluble salts, and either dried or calcined in
      dryer 46. The magnesia product is useful in making refractory
      bricks and magnesium metal as well as an additive for cosmetics,
      pharmaceuticals, and insulation.<br>
      <br>
      As shown by equations I and II above, the alkaline agent may be
      either calcium hydroxide (hydrated lime), hydrated lime from
      burned dolomite, or sodium hydroxide. If burned dolomite is used,
      the magnesium content of the dolomite is recovered with the
      magnesium hydroxide precipitate. Sodium and/or calcium cations,
      which replace the magnesium ions in solution, are recovered later
      in the process as explained below.<br>
      <br>
      The clear brine solution from settling tank or thickener 42 and/or
      filtrated from filter 44 is then sent to a work tank 48 which
      serves as a holding tank for the brine prior to reaction with
      phosphoric acid. The brine in work tank 48 may be periodically
      sampled and analyzed at analysis station 50 to determine the
      concentration of divalent calcium and other metal cations
      contained therein. This analysis is then utilized to meter the
      proper amount of phosphoric acid into the brine from phosphoric
      acid source 52 and metering pump 54. Preferably, the amount of
      phosphoric acid added is in a substantially stoichiometric ratio
      to the concentration of divalent metal cations, principally
      calcium, in the brine, resulting in a chemical reaction which
      causes substantially all of the divalent metal cations in the
      brine to be removed as a precipitate as more fully explained
      below. The addition of a substantially stoichiometric amount of
      phosphoric acid to the brine will lower the pH of the brine to
      less than 2.0. The flow rate of the brine into reactor 56 may be
      controlled by pump 58 and flow rate valve 60, and is monitored
      periodically by flow rate indicator 62.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred source of phosphoric acid is agricultural grade
      phosphoric acid containing 75% orthophosphoric acid (54% when
      reported as phosphorous pentoxide). The brine and phosphoric acid
      are thoroughly agitated in reactor 56 to form a reaction mixture.
      Any suitable agitation device may be utilized including a stirred
      tank reactor or motionless mixing device.<br>
      <br>
      To the reaction mixture, an alkaline agent is added to adjust the
      pH of the mixture to the range of 1.8 to 2.9. A metering pump and
      pH meter may be used to control the addition of alkaline agent. As
      the alkaline agent, either soda ash (Na2 CO3), caustic soda
      (NaOH), potassium hydroxide, or potassium carbonate are preferred.
      The addition of an alkaline agent causes the precipitation of a
      mixture of fertilizer salts including principally dicalcium
      phosphate (CaHPO4.2H2 O). Additionally, most trace impurities in
      the brine such as strontium, iron, aluminum, flourine, and the
      like, will also be precipitated at this stage as complex mineral
      salts. This is because other ions will react with the phosphoric
      acid at pH's lower than that which calcium will react. This first
      stage of precipitation may not be necessary where impurity levels
      in the brine are sufficiently low.<br>
      <br>
      Such precipitated compounds are separated from the brine solution
      by filtration, such as by belt filter 64. The precipitate is then
      dried in dryer 66. The dried precipitate is a citrate soluble
      fertilizer material having an approximate NPK analysis of 0-40-0.<br>
      <br>
      The reaction mixture is then taken to a further agitated reactor
      68 where more alkaline reagent is added to bring the pH of the
      reaction mixture to the range of 3.5 to 6.0. This causes
      essentially complete precipitation of all remaining dicalcium
      phosphate from the brine solution. Because of the preliminary
      precipitation step, the dicalcium phosphate precipitated at this
      stage of the process is quite pure as is useful as a premium grade
      animal feed supplement. The precipitated dicalcium phosphate is
      removed via belt filter 70 and then dried in dryer 72.<br>
      <br>
      By controlling the pH of the brine solution after the addition of
      phosphoric acid, the ratio of calcium phosphates precipitated at
      each stage (reactors 56 and 68) may be controlled. If impurity
      levels are sufficient to warrant a two-stage precipitation then,
      preferably, a minimum amount of calcium phosphates is initally
      precipitated with the major portion being precipitated in reactor
      68. In practice, this ratio is about 10-30% in the first stage and
      70-90% in the second stage.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, the total amount of calcium phosphates produced by
      the process may be modified somewhat by the selection of alkaline
      agents at various stages of the process. The use of calcium
      hydroxide as an alkaline agent at earlier stages of the recovery
      process will place more calcium cations into solution for later
      precipitation. In this manner, the process of the present
      invention is flexible to market conditions for the need for more
      or less calcium phosphate products. Additionally, while the
      preferred process has been described above, it is within the scope
      of the invention to add phosphoric acid and alkaline agent to the
      brine to precipitate calcium phosphates in a single stage
      procedure or a procedure with two or more successive states.<br>
      <br>
      The remaining brine is now substantially free of all divalent
      metal cations. The brine is pumped from storage tank 74 by pump 76
      to an optional evaporation system 78. It may be desirable to
      adjust the pH of the brine in storage tank 75 to minimize
      corrosion problems in the evaporation equipment, and this may be
      accomplished by further addition of an alkaline agent such as
      sodium hydroxide to the brine. The brine itself is a useful
      product which can be used as a raw material for chlor-alkali
      plants. Optionally, it may be evaporated to recover crystallized
      salt.<br>
      <br>
      Evaporation system 78 is preferably a forced circulation
      evaporator-crystallizer with vapor recompression. Such systems are
      commercially available. The evaporation system provides both a
      pure crystallized salt and purified process water.<br>
      <br>
      The recovered salt is principally sodium chloride. Potassium,
      lithium, and any remaining calcium and magnesium cations are
      concentrated in the bitterns produced by the evaporation process
      and may be recycled back to the beginning of the process. The
      recovered salt is a highly purified product which can be marketed
      for practically all commercial uses.<br>
      <br>
      The recovered water from evaporation system 78 is itself highly
      pure and contains less than 1 mg/l of total solids and an absence
      of deleterious anions and divalent metal cations. The water can be
      used as process and wash water in the process of the present
      invention, can be discharged directly to rivers, lakes, and
      streams with no environmental harm, or alternatively may be sold
      to industries having large purified water requirements.<br>
      <br>
      While the methods herein described constitute preferred
      embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the
      invention is not limited to these precise methods and that changes
      may be made without departing from the scope of the invention,

      same, and its use as a herbicide and/or a plant micronutrient,
      depending on dilution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Sea solids useful as fertilizer are known from <b>U.S. Pat. No.
        3,071,457</b> to Murray. In addition, the use of nutrient sea
      solids in hydroponic farming is disclosed in Murray's U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,250,606. According to the teachings of these patents,
      precipitated sea solids are harvested and used as a plant nutrient
      or fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      On the other hand, <b>U.S. Pat. No. 3,770,410</b> discloses the
      production of potassium polyphosphates from a phosphoric acid
      sludge by heating the sludge to eliminate most of the water and
      then adding a salt mixture thereto to make a fertilizer.<br>
      <br>
      Soilless culture of plants using sea water which is chemically
      modified with non-natural substances to change its composition is
      disclosed in <b>U.S. Pat. No. 2,713,741. U.S. Pat. No. 3,640,695</b>
      and <b>U.S. Pat. No. 3,332,767</b> disclose processes for

      <br>
      <b>U.S. Pat. No. 2,934,419</b> deals with the conversion of sea

        4,450,001; 4,334,910; 4,382,013; 4,508,559; and 4,125,392</b>
      disclose similar compositions to regulate plant growth.<br>
      <br>
      All of these known methods and their products fall into one of two
      categories. Firstly, sea solids are precipitated, removed and used
      as such. Secondly, the water of the starting material is distilled
      and used as fresh water. In the first instance, the resultant
      product is nothing more than a mixture of chemicals derived from
      sea water; in the second instance, the resultant product is pure
      water.<br>
      <br>
      None of the prior art disclose the use of a LIQUOR containing
      water and salts, in which the ratios of the mineral salts to each
      other and to the remaining water are different from the ratios of
      such salts in the initial natural sea water. The resultant LIQUOR
      thus naturally altered from its initial state functions per se as
      a natural herbicide and also, in dilute aqueous concentrations, as
      a natural micronutrient. As used herein, the term "LIQUOR" defines
      the resultant product in which the ratios of salt are modified as
      disclosed and is to be distinguished from natural sea water as
      well as from a merely concentrated solution.<br>
      <br>
      As will be explained hereinafter, the undiluted LIQUOR of the
      present invention is a swift, highly effective natural herbicide
      even when used in small amounts and may be applied directly to
      offending and deleterious growths without affecting any
      surrounding desirable vegetation. On the other hand, when highly
      diluted with fresh water, the LIQUOR of the present invention
      provides a totally unexpected and unobviously effective nutrient,
      by means of which the growth of desirable vegetation is enhanced
      and increased with rapidity and substantive benefit to the size,
      taste, appearance and the like of the vegetation. A further
      unexpected and unobvious result lies in the fact that the LIQUOR
      acts as a preservative in that the fruit of such vegetation lasts
      for a longer time after being picked. Thus, having a longer shelf
      life and transport life.<br>
      <br>
      The noted benefits and advantages of the invention will be
      apparent from the following disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      According to the present invention, natural sea water is subjected
      to conditions suitable to evaporate a portion of the water
      therefrom and simultaneously to precipitate a portion of the
      mineral salts dissolved therein so that the amount of such mineral
      salts remaining in the resulting LIQUOR differs from the amount of
      mineral salts contained in the natural sea water in proportion
      both to itself and to the remaining water. Thus, after the
      precipitate is removed, the resultant LIQUOR is not a mere
      concentrate of the natural sea water, but an unexpected mixture of
      water and salt capable of being used per se as a natural herbicide
      or diluted sufficiently with fresh water as a natural
      micronutrient.<br>
      <br>
      More specifically, the present invention provides a method
      comprising the steps of subjecting a quantity of natural sea water
      to evaporation for a period of time sufficient to drive off a
      substantial portion of its water content and to precipitate a
      portion of the mineral salts dissolved in such natural sea water,
      thereby forming a LIQUOR containing dissolved mineral salts in
      ratios to each other and to the water different from those in the
      initial sea water; separating the remaining LIQUOR from the
      precipitated solid material (mineral salts); and recovering the
      LIQUOR.<br>
      <br>
      Still further, in accordance with the present invention,
      deleterious vegetation can be destroyed or eradicated by applying
      to the same the LIQUOR described above in an amount effective to
      accomplish such result. On the other hand, when the above
      described LIQUOR is diluted sufficiently with fresh water, it may
      be applied to vegetation as a natural plant micronutrient when
      utilized in an amount effective to enhance in a significant and
      unobvious manner, the growth, appearance, and the like of the
      plant to which it is applied.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In general, the production of LIQUOR according to the present
      invention can be simply performed by allowing natural sea water to
      rest in a shallow pan or the like until a quantity of the water
      evaporates and a layer of precipitate scum is produced on the
      surface of the remaining natural sea water. The precipitate is
      then removed, the remaining natural sea water decanted, and the
      resultant used as the LIQUOR.<br>
      <br>
      For example, shallow pans are filled to the brim with natural sea
      water and allowed to stand under conditions so that the dissolved
      mineral salts appear as a precipitate on the surface of the
      remaining natural sea water. Such precipitate is separated from
      the remaining natural sea water, which comprises the LIQUOR and
      can be decanted and bottled. The LIQUOR may first be filtered to
      remove any large particles and similar contaminants. In general, a
      quantity of about 5680 ml. of such initial natural sea water in
      two pans (e.g. shallow 3 quart, 13.times.9.times.2 inches) is
      reduced to about 230 ml. (an actual reduction of between 90% to
      95% of volume) to provide the LIQUOR. This LIQUOR contains
      approximately 26% by weight of dissolved mineral salts in
      comparison to about 3.5% of mineral salts dissolved in the natural
      sea water, and has a substantially neutral pH.<br>
      <br>
      The process may be enhanced by allowing the natural sea water to
      be moderately heated, with a gas or electric heater to elevate its
      temperature to induce evaporation, but not to boil the same. Also,
      the natural sea water may be placed in a vacuum environment to
      increase the rate of evaporation.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the relatively constant rate of evaporation induced by
      the low heat, or the ambient external heat and the different rates
      of precipitation of the mineral salts contained in the natural sea
      water, the remaining LIQUOR contains dissolved mineral salts in
      ratios to each other, different from those in the original natural
      sea water. Such LIQUOR comprises a natural herbicide per se and
      exerts a herbicidal effect on vegetation when applied thereto in
      an amount effective to eradicate undesired or unwanted specimens.<br>
      <br>
      While natural sea waters throughout the world vary somewhat in the
      amount of dissolved mineral salts, there is a relative similarity
      among them. New York sea water is generally typical of ocean
      waters. The analysis of sea water is well established, as
      evidenced by the data set forth on Pages 176 and 177 of "The
      Oceans" (1942) by Sverdrup, Johnson, and Fleming.<br>
      <br>
      A LIQUOR made from New York sea water in accordance with the
      present invention has the following analysis with respect to the
      mineral salts dissolved therein:<br>
      <br>
      ppm.(mg./l.)<br>
      Nitrate &lt;1.0<br>
      Sodium 2141.69<br>
      Aluminum 0.21<br>
      Cadium &lt;0.01<br>
      Chromium Total 0.02<br>
      Chromium Hexavalent&lt;0.01<br>
      Copper 0.31<br>
      Iron 0.37<br>
      Nickel 0.02<br>
      Lead 0.05<br>
      Silver 0.19<br>
      Zinc &lt;0.01<br>
      Manganese 0.05<br>
      Chloride 2373.2<br>
      Sulfate 4.11<br>
      Fluoride 0.26<br>
      Calcium 6.45<br>
      Barium 0.07<br>
      Magnesium 1.69<br>
      Ammonia 0.15<br>
      <br>
      and had a pH of 6.87.<br>
      <br>
      The present LIQUOR is effective, undiluted, as a natural
      herbicide, as already indicated. It has also been found that the
      addition of a slight amount of fresh water to the LIQUOR does not
      reduce its effectiveness as a herbicide. A small amount of a
      wetting agent may be used to enhance the spread of the same. This
      LIQUOR may be applied directly to the root system and/or to the
      leaf system of the plant or vegetation to be killed by spraying or
      other suitable means.<br>
      <br>
      As previously mentioned, the LIQUOR is also useful as a plant
      nutrient when it is highly diluted with fresh water. Broadly, the
      LIQUOR should be present in an aqueous diluent in an amount at
      least sufficient to have a micronutrient effect on plant life,
      i.e., up to about 3800 parts of fresh water to 1 part of LIQUOR by
      volume. In general, however, the LIQUOR is present in the aqueous
      diluent in a concentration of about 0.5 ml. to about 1.0 ml. per
      gallon to be useful as a plant nutrient. It has been found that
      for fruit plants the lower range of concentration is best, while
      for green leaf plants and the like, the upper range of
      concentration (i.e. 1.0 ml. per gallon) is generally preferred.
      Application of such diluted LIQUOR may be made to the root and/or
      the leaf systems by spraying or otherwise as desired.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>EXAMPLES OF USE</b><br>
      <br>
      In order to illustrate the present invention more fully, the
      following examples are set forth. In the examples all values with
      respect to amounts and ratios are the same as those set forth
      above, unless otherwise indicated.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example I</b><b><br>
      </b><b>As a Herbicide</b><br>
      <br>
      Dandelion plants in a New York suburb were treated by spraying the
      base of the plants with undiluted LIQUOR. The spray was made to
      wet the soil but not to saturate it. Within one day signs of
      morbidity were observed; and within three days the dandelions were
      dead.<br>
      <br>
      Such LIQUOR was similarly applied to weeds known as Nut Grass and
      "Torpedo grass" in Lake Worth, Florida, with similar results.<br>
      <br>
      The foregoing procedures were respectively repeated 5 to 10 times
      over a period of several days on similar patches of dandelions and
      Torpedo grass, nut grass, crab grass and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In each instance, the present LIQUOR herbicide was selective and
      attacked only those plants to which it was applied and did not
      spread or leach outwardly and cause harm to any surrounding
      desired vegetation.<br>
      <br>
      It must be noted that the LIQUOR is made from a product of nature
      and does not injure or affect the aquifer as previously known
      commercial herbicides or pesticides do. It is made from a natural
      product and does not have a carcinogenic background.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example II</b><b><br>
      </b><b>As A Nutrient</b><br>
      <br>
      The LIQUOR was diluted in a ratio of 1 ml. to 1 gallon of fresh
      tap water, the diluted solution being applied to tomato and
      strawberry plants on commercial farms in Lake Worth, Florida
      during the months of January through April. The plants were only a
      part of the entire field of plants and were located in a partially
      shaded area. The diluted LIQUOR was applied by spraying directly
      to the leaf portions of the plants and to the soil surrounding the
      plants.<br>
      <br>
      Within several days it became obvious that the plants exhibited
      improved color and strength. The plants grew more rapidly than
      plants not so treated. The treated crop was larger in size and
      weight and better resisted insect blight; and the fruit, when
      harvested, were sweeter and tasted better than those not so
      treated. This occurred notwithstanding the partial shade and the
      winter growth season. The results, i.e., fruit of this experiment
      were taste tested in comparison to non-treated fruit (control) by
      an impartial panel. Of the persons responding, about 70% liked the
      experimental tomato best, and only 25% liked the control tomato
      best, while the rest could not differentiate between the
      experimental fruit or the control.<br>
      <br>
      An unexpected and unanticipated result was observed during recent
      testswith strawberries. A large number of the control strawberries
      displayed extensive mold formation and softening and had to be
      discarded nine to eleven days after picking even when kept under
      refrigerated conditions. On the other hand, strawberries treated
      with the LIQUOR of the present invention lasted over 3 weeks and
      few if any, were lost to mold, etc. Therefore, a natural
      preservative feature is apparent from the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention presents many other advantages. For example,
      the LIQUOR is made from readily available natural starting
      materials; and the method for making the same is simple and
      straightforward, requiring no special expensive equipment or the
      use of non-material chemical components. Moreover, the LIQUOR so
      prepared can be readily made useful as a plant nutrient by simple
      dilution with water or the like; and whether used as a herbicide
      or a plant nutrient, the LIQUOR may be applied in any convenient
      manner. Numerous other advantages of the invention will be readily
      apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be understood that numerous modifications and variations
      of this invention may be made without departing from the spirit
      and scope of the invention, and consequently this invention should
      not be limited to the described embodiments except as defined in
      the appended claims.<br>
