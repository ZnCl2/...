      A looped energy system for the generation of excess energy
      available to do work is disclosed. The system comprises an
      electrolysis cell unit (150) receiving a supply&nbsp; of water to
      liberate separated hydrogen gas (154) and oxygen (156) by
      electrolysis driven by a DC voltage (152) applied across
      respective anodes and cathodes of the cell unit (150). A hydrogen
      gas receiver (158) receives and stores hydrogen gas liberated by
      the cell unit (150), and an oxygen gas receiver (160) receives and
      stores oxygen gas liberated by the cell unit (150). A gas
      expansion device (162) expands the stored gases to recover
      expansion work, and a gas combustion device (168) mixes and
      combusts the expanded hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to recover
      combusted work. A proportion of the sum of the expansion work and
      the combustion work sustains electrolysis of the cell unit to
      retain operational gas pressure in the gas receivers (158, 160)
      such that the energy system is self-sustaining, and there is
      excess energy available from the sum of energies.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to the generation of hydrogen gas
      and oxygen gas from water, either as an admixture or as separated
      gases, by the process of electrolysis, and relates further to
      applications for the use of the liberated gas. Embodiments of the
      invention relate particularly to apparatus for the efficient
      generation of these gases, and to use of the gases in an internal
      combustion engine and an implosion pump. The invention also
      discloses a closed-loop energy generation system where latent
      molecular energy is liberated as a form of 'free energy' so the
      system can be self-sustaining.<br>
      <br>
      Reference is made to commonly-owned International patent
      application No.PCT/AU94/000532, having the International filing
      date of 6 September 1994.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The technique of electrolysing water in the presence of an
      electrolyte such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide
      (KOH) to liberate hydrogen and oxygen gas (H2, 02) is well known.
      The process involves applying a DC potential difference between
      two or more anode/cathode electrode pairs and delivering the
      minimum energy required to break the H-O bonds (i.e. 68.3 kcal per
      mole @ STP).<br>
      The gases are produced in the stoichiometric proportions for O2:H2
      of 1:2 liberated respectively from the anode (+) and cathode (-).<br>
      <br>
      Reference can be made to the following texts: "Modern
      Electrochemistry, Volume 2, John O'M. Bockris and Amulya K.N.
      Reddy, Plenum Publishing Corporation", "Electro-Chemical Science,
      J. O'M. Bockris and D.M. Drazic, Taylor and Francis Limited" and
      "Fuel Cells, Their Electrochemistry, J. O'M. Bockris and S.
      Srinivasan, McGraw-Hill Book Company".<br>
      <br>
      A discussion of experimental work in relation to electrolysis
      processes can be obtained from "Hydrogen Energy, Part A, Hydrogen
      Economy Miami Energy Conference, Miami Beach, Florida, 1974,
      edited by T. Nejat Veziroglu, Plenum Press". The papers presented
      by J. O'M. Bockris on pages 371 to 379, by F.C. Jensen and F.H.
      Schubert on pages 425 to 439 and by John B. Pangborn and John C.
      Sharer on pages 499 to 508 are of particular relevance.<br>
      <br>
      On a macro-scale, the amount of gas produced depends upon a number
      of variables, including the type and concentration of the
      electrolytic solution used, the&nbsp; anode/cathode electrode pair
      surface area, the electrolytic resistance (equating to ionic
      conductivity, which is a function of temperature and pressure),
      achievable current density and anode/cathode potential difference.
      The total energy delivered must be sufficient to disassociate the
      water ions to generate hydrogen and oxygen gases, yet avoid
      plating (oxidation/reduction) of the metallic or conductive
      non-metallic materials from which the electrodes are constructed.<br>

      </b><b>Detalled Description and Best Mode of Performance</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The following description of Figs. la-6 is taken from
      PCT/AU94/000532.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. la and 2a show embodiments of a first and second type of
      cell plate 90,98 as an end view. Figs. 1b and 2b are partial
      cross-sectional views along the respective mid-lines as shown.
      Common reference numerals have been used where appropriate. The
      plates 90,98 can have the function of either an anode (+) or a
      cathode (-), as will become apparent. Each comprises an electrode
      disc 92 that is perforated with hexagonally shaped holes 96. The
      disc 92 is made from steel or resinbonded carbon or conductive
      polymer material. The disc 92 is housed in a circular rim or
      sleeve 94. The function of the perforations 96 is to maximise the
      surface area of the electrode disc 92 and minimise the weight over
      solid constructions by 45 %.<br>
      <br>
      By way of example, for a disc of diameter 280 mm, the thickness of
      the disc must be 1 mm in order to allow the current density (which
      ranges from 90 A / 2,650 cm2 - 100 A / 2,940 cm2 of the anode or
      cathode) to be optimal. If the diameter of the plate is increased,
      which consequently increases the surface area, it is necessary to
      increase the thickness of the plate in order to maintain
      uniformity of conductance for the desired current density.<br>
      <br>
      The hexagonal perforations in a 1 mm disc have a distance of 2 mm
      between the flats, twice the thickness of the plate in order to
      maintain the same total surface area prior to perforation, and be
      1 mm away from the next adjacent perforation to allow the current
      density to be optimal. A 1 mm (flat-to-flat) distance between the
      hexagonal perforations is required, because a smaller distance
      will result in thermal losses and a larger distance will add to
      the overall weight of the plate.<br>
      <br>
      The sleeve 94 is constructed of PVC material and incorporates a
      number of equally spaced shaft holes 100,102. The holes are for
      the passage of interconnecting shafts provided in a stacked
      arrangement of the plates 90,98 forming the common conductor for
      the respective anode and cathode plates. The further two upper
      holes 104,106 each support a conduit respectively for the out-flow
      of oxygen and hydrogen gases. The further holes 108,110 at the
      bottom of the sleeve 94 are provided for the inlet of water and
      electrolyte to the respective cell plates 90,98.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 shows an enlarged view of a portion of the cell plate 90
      shown in Fig.la. The port hole 104 is connected to the hexagonal
      perforations 96 within the sleeve 94 by an internal channel 112. A
      similar arrangement is in place for the other port hole 106, and
      for the water/electrolyte supply holes 108,110.<br>
      <br>
      If it is the case that the hydrogen and oxygen gases liberated are
      to be kept separate (i.e. not to be formed as an admixture), then
      it is necessary to separate those gases as they are produced. In
      the prior art this is achieved by use of diaphragms that block the
      passage of gases and effectively isolate the water/electrolyte on
      each side of the diaphragm. Ionic transfer thus is facilitated by
      the ionically conductive nature of the diaphragm material (i.e. a
      water - diaphragm - water path). This results in an increase in
      the ionic resistance and hence a reduction in efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 4 shows an exploded stacked arrangement of four cell plates,
      being an alternative stacking of two (anode) cell plates 90 and
      two (cathode) cell plates 98. The two ends of the stacked
      arrangement of cell plates delineates a single cell unit 125.<br>
      <br>
      Interposed between each adjacent cell plate 90,98 is a PTFE
      separation 116. Although not shown in Fig. 4, the cell unit
      includes separate hydrogen and oxygen gas conduits that
      respectively pass through the stacked arrangement of cell plates
      via the port holes 106,104 respectively. In a similar way,
      conduits are provided for the supply of water/electrolyte,
      respectively passing through the holes 108,110 at the bottom of
      the respective plates 90,98. Only two pairs of anode/cathode cell
      plates are shown. The number of such plates can be greatly
      increased per cell unit 125.<br>
      <br>
      Also not shown are the interconnecting conductive shafts that
      electrically interconnect alternative common cell plates. The
      reason for having a large diameter hole in one cell plate adjacent
      to a smaller diameter hole in the next cell plate, is so that an
      interconnecting shaft will pass through the larger diameter hole,
      and not make an electrical connection (i.e. insulated with PVC
      tubing) rather only forming an electrical connection between
      alternate (common) cell plates.<br>
      <br>
      The cell unit 125 shown in Fig. 4 arrangement is an exploded view.
      When fully constructed, all the elements are stacked to be in
      intimate contact. Mechanical fastening is achieved by use of one
      of two adhesives such as (a) "PUR-FECT LOK" (TM) 34-9002, which is
      a Urethane Reactive Hot Melt adhesive with a main'ingredient of
      Methylene Bispheny/Dirsocynate (MDI), and (b) "MY-T-BOND" (TM)
      which is a PVC solvent based adhesive. Both adhesives are Sodium
      Hyroxide (20% present in the electrolyte) resistant. In that case
      the water/electrolyte only resides within the area proscribed by
      the cell plate sleeve 94. Thus the only path for the inlet of
      water/electrolyte is by bottom channels 118,122 and the only
      outlet for the gases is by the top channels 112,120.In a system
      constructed and tested by the inventor, the thickness of the cell
      plates 90,98 is 1 mm (2 mm on the rim because of the PVC sleeve
      94), with a diameter of 336 mm. The cell unit 125 is segmented
      from the next cell by an insulating PVC segmentation disc 114. A
      segmentation disc 114 also is placed at the beginning and end of
      the entire cell bank.<br>
      <br>
      If there is to be no control over separation of the liberated
      gases, then the PTFE membranes 116 are not provided, nor is the
      sleeve 94 required.The PTFE membrane 116 is fibrous and has 0.2 to
      1.0 micron interstices. A suitable type is type Catalogue Code J,
      supplied by Tokyo Roshi International Inc (Advantec). <br>
      <br>
      The water/electrolyte fills the interstices and ionic current
      flows only via the water - there is no contribution of ionic flow
      through the PTFE material itself. This leads to a reduction in the
      resistance to ionic flow. The PTFE material also has a 'bubble
      point' that is a function of pressure, hence by controlling the
      relative pressures at either side of the PTFE separation sheets,
      the gases can be 'forced' through the interstices to form an
      admixture, or otherwise kept separate. Other advantages of this
      arrangement include a lesser cost of construction, improved
      operational efficiency and greater resistance to faults.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5a is a stylised, and exploded, schematic view of a linear
      array of three series-connected cell units 125. For clarity, only
      six interconnecting shafts 126-131 are shown. The shafts 126-131
      pass through the respective shaft holes 102,100 in the various
      cell plates 90,98 in the stacked arrangement. The polarity
      attached to each of the exposed end shafts, to which the DC supply
      is connected also is indicated. The shafts 126-131 do not run the
      full length of the three cell banks 125. The representation is
      similar to the arrangement shown in Figs. 7a and 8. One third the
      full DC source voltage appears across each anode/cathode cell
      plate pair 90,98.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the gas conduits 132,133, respectively for hydrogen and
      oxygen, that pass through the port holes 104,106 in the cell
      plates 90,98 also are shown. In a similar way, water/electrolyte
      conduits 134,135, passing through the water port holes 108,110 in
      the cell plates also are shown.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 5b particularly shows how the relative potential difference
      in the middle cell bank 125 changes. That is, the plate electrode
      90a now functions as a cathode (i.e.relatively more negative) to
      generate hydrogen, and the plate electrode 98a now functions as an
      anode (i.e. relatively more positive) to generate oxygen. This is
      the case for every alternate cell unit. The arrowheads shown in
      Fig. 5b indicate the electron and ionic current circuit. Fig. Sc
      is an electrical equivalent circuit representation of Fig. 5b,
      where the resistive elements represent the ionic resistance
      between adjacent anode/cathode plates. Thus it can be seen that
      the cell units are connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the change of function of the cell plates 90a and 98a,
      the complementary gases are liberated at each, hence the
      respective channels 112 are connected to the opposite gas conduit
      132,133. Practically, this can be achieved by the simple reversal
      of the cell plates 90,98.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6 shows the three cell units 125 of Fig. 5a connected to a
      gas collection arrangement. The cell units 125 are located within
      a tank 140 that is filled with water/electrolyte to the level h
      indicated. The water is consumed as the electrolysis process
      proceeds, and replenishing supply is provided via the inlet 152.
      The water/electrolyte level h can be viewed via the sight glass
      154. In normal operation, the different streams of hydrogen and
      oxygen are produced and passed from the cell units 125 to
      respective rising columns 142,144. That is, the pressure of
      electrolyte on opposed sides of the PTFE membranes 116 is
      equalised, thus the gases cannot admix.<br>
      <br>
      The columns 142, 144 also are filled with the water/electrolyte,
      and as it is consumed at the electrode plates, replenishing supply
      of electrolyte is provided by way of circulation through the
      water/electrolyte conduits 134,135. The circulation is caused by
      entrainment by the liberated gases, and by the circulatory
      inducing nature of the conduits and columns.<br>
      <br>
      The upper extent of the tank 140 forms two scrubbing towers
      156,158, respectively for the collection of oxygen and hydrogen
      gases. The gases pass up a respective column 142,144, and out from
      the columns via openings therein at a point within the interleaved
      baffles 146. The point where the gases exit the columns 142,144 is
      <br>
      <br>
      beneath the water level h, which serves to settle any turbulent
      flow and entrained electrolyte. The baffles 146 located above the
      level h scrub the gas of any entrained electrolyte, and the
      scrubbed gas then exits by respective gas outlet columns 148,150
      and so to a gas receiver. The level h within the tank 140 can be
      regulated by any convenient means, including a float switch, again
      with the replenishing water being supplied by the inlet pipe 152.<br>
      <br>
      The liberated gases will always separate from the
      water/electrolyte solution by virtue of the difference in
      densities. Because of the relative height of the respective set of
      baffles, and due to the density differential between the gases and
      the water/electrolyte, it is not possible for the liberated
      hydrogen and oxygen gases to mix.<br>
      <br>
      The presence of the full volume of water within the tank 140
      maintains the cell plates in an immersed state, and further serves
      to absorb the shock of any internal detonations should they occur.<br>
      <br>
      In the event that a gas admixture is required, then firstly the
      two flow valves 136,137 respectively located in the oxygen gas
      outlet conduit 132 and water/electrolyte inlet port 134 are
      closed. This blocks the outlet path for the oxygen gas and forces
      the inlet water/electrolyte to pass to the inlet conduit 134 via a
      one-way check valve 139 and pump 138. The water/electrolyte within
      the tank 140 is under pressure by virtue of its depth (volume),
      and the pump 138 operates to increase the pressure of
      water/electrolyte occurring about the anode cell plates 90,98a to
      be at an increased pressure with respect to the water/electrolyte
      on the other side of the membrane 116.<br>
      <br>
      This pressure differential is sufficient to cause the oxygen gas
      to migrate through the membrane, thus admixed oxygen and hydrogen
      are liberated via the gas output conduit 133 and column 144. Since
      there is no return path for the water/electrolyte supplied by the
      pump 138, the pressure about the cell plates 90,98a will increase
      further, and to a point where the difference is sufficient such
      that the water/electrolyte also can pass through the membrane 116.
      Typically, pressure differential in the range of 1.5 - 10 psi is
      required to allow passage of gas, and a pressure differential in
      the range of 10 - 40 psi for water/electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      While only three cell units 125 are shown, clearly any number,
      connected in series, can be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the present invention now will be described. Where
      applicable, like reference numerals have been used.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 7a and 7b show a first type of cell plate 190 respectively
      as an end view and as an enlarged cross-sectional view along line
      VIIb-VIIb. The cell plate 190 differs from the previous cell plate
      90 shown in Figs. la and 1b in a number of important aspects. The
      region of the electrode disc 192 received within the sleeve 194
      now is perforated. The function of these perforations is to
      further reduce the weight of the cell plate 190. The shaft holes
      200,202 again pass through the electrode disc 192, but so too do
      the upper holes 204,206 through which the conduits for the
      out-flow of liberated hydrogen and oxygen gases pass. The bottom
      holes 208,210, provided for the inlet of water and electrolyte,
      now also are located in the region of the sleeve 194 coincident
      with the perforated edge margin of the electrode disc 192.The
      channels 212,218 respectively communicating with the port hole 204
      and the supply hole 210 also are shown.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 8a and 8b show a second type of cell plate 198 as a
      companion to the first cell plate 190, and as the same respective
      views. The second cell plate 198 is somewhat similar to the cell
      plate 98 previously shown in Figs. 2a and 2b. The differences
      therebetween are the same as the respective differences between
      the cell plate shown in Figs. la and 1b and the one shown in Figs.
      7a and 7b. The arrangement of the respective channels 220,222 with
      respect to the port 206 and the water supply hole 208 also are
      shown.<br>
      <br>
      In the fabrication of the cell plates 190,198, the sleeve 94 is
      injection moulded from PVC plastics material formed about the edge
      margin of the electrode disc 192.<br>
      <br>
      The injection moulding process results in the advantageous forming
      of interconnecting sprues forming within the perforations 196 in
      the region of the disc 192 held within the sleeve 194, thus firmly
      anchoring the sleeve 194 to the disc 192.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 9 is a view similar to Fig. 3, but for the modified porting
      arrangement and perforations (shown in phantom where covered by
      the sleeve) of the region of the disc 192 within and immediately
      outside of the sleeve 194.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 10 shows a cell unit 225 in the form of an exploded
      alternating stacking of first and second cell plates 190,198, much
      in the same manner as Fig. 4. Only two pairs of anode/cathode cell
      plates are shown, however the number of such plates can be greatly
      increased per cell unit 225. The membrane 216 preferably is type
      QR-HE silica fibre with the alternative being PTFE. Both are
      available from Tokyo Roshi International Inc. (Advantec) of Japan.
      Type QR-HE is a hydrophobic material having 0.2 to 1.0 micron
      interstices, and is capable of operation at temperatures up to
      10000C.<br>
      <br>
      The cell unit 225 can be combined with other such cell units 225
      to form an interconnected cell bank in the same manner as shown in
      Figs. 5a, 5b and 5c.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, the cell units can be put to use in a gas collection
      arrangement such as that shown in Fig. 6. Operation of the gas
      separation system utilising the new cell plates 190,198 is in the
      same manner as previously described.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 11 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of three cell plates
      in the vicinity of the oxygen port 204. The cell plates comprise
      two of the first type of plate 190 shown in Fig. 7a constituting a
      positive plate, and a single one of the second type of plate 198
      shown in Fig. 8a representing a negative plate. The location of
      the respective channels 212 for each of the positive cell plates
      190 is shown as a dashed representation. The respective sleeves
      194 of the three cell plates are formed from moulded PVC plastics
      as previously described, and in the region that forms the
      perimeter of the port 204 have a configuration particular to
      whether a cell plate is positive or negative. In the present case,
      the positive cell plates 190 have a flanged foot 230 that, in the
      assembled construction, form the contiguous boundary of the gas
      port 204.Each foot 230 has two circumferential ribs 232 that
      engage corresponding circumferential grooves 234 in the sleeve 194
      of the negative plate 198.<br>
      <br>
      The result of this arrangement is that the exposed metal area of
      the negative cell plates 198 always are insulated from the flow of
      oxygen gas liberated from the positive cell plates 190, thus
      avoiding the possibility of spontaneous explosion by the mixing of
      the separated hydrogen and oxygen gases. This arrangement also
      obviates the unwanted production of either oxygen gas or hydrogen
      gas in the gas port.<br>
      <br>
      For the case of the gas port 206 carrying the hydrogen gas, the
      relative arrangement of the cell plates is reversed such that a
      flanged footing now is formed on the sleeve 194 of the other type
      of cell plate 198. This represents the converse arrangement to
      that shown in Fig. 11.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 12a and 12b show perspective side views of adjacent cell
      plates, with Fig. 12a representing a positive cell plate 190 and
      Fig. 12b representing a negative cell plate 198. The gas port 206
      thus formed is to carry hydrogen gas. The mating relationship
      between the flanged foot 230 and the end margin of the sleeve 194
      of the positive cell plate 192 can be seen, particularly the
      interaction between the ribs 232 and the grooves 234.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 13 is a cross-sectional view of four cell plates formed into
      a stacked arrangement delimited by two segmentation plates 240,
      together forming a cell unit 242. <br>
      <br>
      Thus there are two positive cell plates 190 and two negative cell
      plates 198 in alternating arrangement. The cross-section is taken
      in the vicinity of a shaft hole 202 through which a negative
      conductive shaft 244 passes. The shaft 244 therefore is in
      intimate contact with the electrode discs 192 of the negative cell
      plates 198. The electrodes discs 192 of the positive cell plates
      190 do not extend to contact the shaft 244. The sleeve 194 of the
      alternating negative cell plates 198 again have a form of flanged
      foot 246, although in this case the complementarily shaped ribs
      and grooves are formed only on the sleeve of the negative cell
      plates 198, and not on the sleeve 194 of the positive cell plates
      190.The segmentation plates 240 serve to delimit the stacked
      plates forming a single cell unit 242, with ones of the cell units
      242 being stacked in a linear array to form a cell bank such as
      has been shown in Fig. Sa.<br>
      <br>
      A threaded shaft nut 250 acts as a spacer between adjacent
      electrodes connecting with the shaft 244. Fig. 14 is a perspective
      view of the shaft nut 250 showing the thread 252 and three
      recesses 254 for fastening nuts, screws or the like.<br>
      <br>
      In all of Figs. 11 to 13, the separation membrane material 216 is
      not shown, but is located in the spaces 248 between adjacent cell
      plates 190,198, extending to the margins of the electrode disks
      192 in the vicinity of the gas ports 204,206 or the shaft holes
      200,202.<br>
      <br>
      An electrolysis hydrogen and oxygen gas system incorporating a gas
      separation system, such as has been described above, can therefore
      be operated to establish respective high pressure stores of gas.
      That is, the separated hydrogen and oxygen gases liberated by the
      electrolysis process are stored in separate gas receivers or
      pressure vessels. The pressure in each will increase with the
      continuing inflow of gas.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 15 shows an idealised electrolysis system, comprising an
      electrolysis cell 150 that receives a supply of water to be
      consumed. The electrolysis process is driven by a DC potential
      (Es) 152. The potential difference applied to the cell 150
      therefore must be sufficient to electrolyse the water into
      hydrogen and oxygen gas dependent upon, inter alia, the water
      pressure PC and the back pressure of gas PB acting on the surface
      of the water, together with the water temperature Tc. The separate
      liberated hydrogen and oxygen gases, by a priming function, are
      pressurised to a high value by storage in respective pressure
      vessels 158,160, being carried by gas lines 154,156.<br>
      <br>
      The pressurised store of gases then are passed to an energy
      conversion device that converts the flow of gas under pressure to
      mechanical energy (e.g. a pressure drop device 162). This
      mechanical energy recovered WM is available to be utilised to
      provide useful work. The mechanical energy WM also can be
      converted into electrical form, again to be available for use.<br>
      <br>
      The resultant exhausted gases are passed via lines 164,166 to a
      combustion chamber 168. Here the gases are combusted to generate
      heat QR, with the waste product being water vapour. The recovered
      heat QR can be recycled to the electrolysis cell to assist in
      maintaining the advantageous operating temperature of the cell.<br>
      <br>
      The previously described combustion chamber 168 can alternatively
      be a fuel cell. The type of fuel cell can vary from phosphoric
      acid fuel cells through to molten carbonate fuel cells and solid
      oxide cells. A fuel cell generates both heat (QR) and electrical
      energy (WE), and thus can supply both heat to the cell 150 or to
      supplement or replace the DC supply (Es) 152.<br>
      <br>
      Typically, these fuel cells can be of the type LaserCellTM as
      developed by Dr Roger Billings, the PEM Cell as available from
      Ballard Power Systems Inc. Canada or the Ceramic Fuel Cell (solid
      oxide) as developed by Ceramic Fuel Cells Ltd. Melbourne,
      Australia.<br>
      <br>
      It is, of course, necessary to replenish the pressurised store of
      gases, thus requiring the continuing consumption of electrical
      energy. The recovered electrical energy WE is in excess of the
      energy required to drive electrolysis at the elevated temperature
      and is used to replace the external electrical energy source 152,
      thereby completing the energy loop after the system is initially
      primed and started.<br>
      <br>
      The present inventor has determined that there are some
      combinations of pressure and temperature where the efficiency of
      the electrolysis process becomes advantageous in terms of the
      total energy recovered, either as mechanical energy by virtue of a
      flow of gas at high pressure or as thermal energy by virtue of
      combustion (or by means of a fuel cell), with respect to the
      electrical energy consumed, to the extent of the recovered energy
      exceeding the energy required to sustain electrolysis at the
      operational pressure and temperature. This has been substantiated
      by experimentation. This notion has been termed "over-unity".<br>
      <br>
      "Over-unity" systems can be categorised as broadly falling into
      three types of physical phenomena:<br>
      <br>
      (i) An electrical device which produces 100 Watts of electrical
      energy as output after 10 Watts of electrical energy is input
      thereby providing 90 Watts of overunity (electrical) energy.<br>

      (ii) An electro-chemical device such as an electrolysis device
      where 10 Watts of electrical energy is input and 8 Watts is output
      being the thermal value of the hydrogen and oxygen gas output.
      During this process, 2 Watts of electrical energy converted to
      thermal energy is lost due to specific inefficiencies of the
      electrolysis system. Pressure - as the over-unity energy - is
      irrefutably produced during the process of hydrogen and oxygen gas
      generation during electrolysis. <br>
      <br>
      Pressure is a product of the containment of the two separated
      gases. The Law of Conservation of Energy (as referenced in
      "Chemistry Experimental Foundations", edited by Parry, R.W.;
      Steiner, L.E.; Tellefsen, R.L.; Dietz, P.M. Chap. 9, pp. 199-200,
      Prentice-Hall, New Jersey" and "An Experimental Science", edited
      by Pimentel, G.C., Chap. 7, pp. 115-117, W.H. &amp; Freeman Co.
      San Francisco) is in equilibrium where the 10 watts of input
      equals the 8 watts thermal energy output plus the 2 watts of
      losses. However, this Law ends at this point. The present
      invention utilises the apparent additional energy being the
      pressure which is a by-product of the electrolysis process to
      achieve over-unity.<br>
      <br>
      (iii) An electro-chemical device which produces an excess of
      thermal energy after an input of electrical energy in such devices
      utilised in "cold fusion" e.g.10 watts of electrical energy as
      input and 50 watts of thermal energy as output.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention represents the discovery of means by which
      the abovementioned second phenomenon can be embodied to result in
      "over-unity" and the realisation of 'free' energy. As previously
      noted, this is the process of liberating latent molecular energy.
      The following sequence of events describes the basis of the
      availability of over-unity energy.<br>
      <br>
      In a simple two plate (anode/cathode) electrolysis cell, an
      applied voltage differential of 1.57 DC Volts draws 0.034 Amps per
      cm2 and results in the liberation of hydrogen and oxygen gas from
      the relevant electrode plate. The electrolyte is kept at a
      constant temperature of 40"C, and is open to atmospheric pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The inefficiency of an electrolytic cell is due to its ionic
      resistance (approximately 20%), and produces a by-product of
      thermal energy. The resistance reduces, as does the minimum DC
      voltage required to drive electrolysis, as the temperature
      increases. The overall energy required to dissociate the bonding
      electrons from the water molecule also decreases as the
      temperature increases. In effect, thermal energy acts as a
      catalyst to reduce the energy requirements in the production of
      hydrogen and oxygen gases from the water molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Improvements in efficiency are obtainable by way of a combination
      of thermal energy itself and the NaOH electrolyte both acting to
      reduce the resistance of the ionic flow of current.<br>
      <br>
      Thermal 'cracking' of the water molecule is known to occur at 1
      5000C, whereby the bonding electrons are dissociated and
      subsequently 'separate' the water molecule into its constituent
      elements in gaseous form. This thermal cracking then allows the
      thermal energy to become a consumable. Insulation can be
      introduced to conserve thermal energy, however there will always
      be some thermal energy losses.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Accordingly, thermal energy is both a catalyst and a consumable
      (in the sense that the thermal energy exites bonding electrons to
      a higher energetic state) in the electrolysis process. A net
      result from the foregoing process is that hydrogen is being
      produced from thermal energy because thermal energy reduces the
      overall energy requirements of the electrolysis system.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the graph titled "Flow Rate At A Given Temperature"
      shown in Fig. 16, it has been calculated that at a temperature of
      20000C, 693 litres of hydrogen/oxygen admixed gas (2:1) will be
      produced. The hydrogen content of this volume is 462 litres. At an
      energy content of 11 BTUs per litre of hydrogen, this then gives
      an energy amount of 5082 BTUs (11 x 462). Using the BTU:kilowatt
      conversion factor of 3413:1, 5082 BTUs of the hydrogen gas equate
      to 1.49 kW. Compare this with lkW to produce the 693 litres of
      hydrogen/oxygen (including 463 litres of hydrogen). The usage of
      this apparatus therefore identifies that thermal energy, through
      the process of electrolysis, is being converted into
      hydrogen.These inefficiencies, i.e. increased temperature and NaOH
      electrolyte, reduce with temperature to a point at approximately
      1000"C where the ionic resistance reduces to zero, and the
      volumetric amount of gases produced per kWh increases.<br>
      <br>
      The lowering of DC voltage necessary to drive electrolysis by way
      of higher temperatures is demonstrated in the graph in Fig. 17
      titled "The Effect of temperature on Cell Voltage".<br>
      <br>
      The data in Figs. 16 and 17 has two sources. Cell voltages
      obtained from 0 C up to and including 100"C were those obtained by
      an electrolysis system as described hereinbefore. Cell voltages
      obtained from 1500C up to 2000"C are theoretical calculations
      presented by an acknowledged authority in this field, Prof. J.
      O'M. Bockris. Specifically, these findings were presented in
      "Hydrogen Energy, Part A, Hydrogen Economy Miami Energy
      Conference, Miami Beach, Florida, 1974, edited by T. Nejat
      Veziroglu, Plenum Press" pp. 371-379. These calculations appear on
      page 374.<br>
      <br>
      By inspection of Fig. 17 and Fig. 18 (titled "Flow Rate of
      Hydrogen and Oxygen at 2:1"), it can be seen that as temperature
      increases in the cell, the voltage necessary to dissociate the
      water molecule is reduced, as is the overall energy requirement.
      This then results in a higher gas flow per kWh.<br>
      <br>
      As constrained by the limitation of the materials within the
      system, the operationally acceptable temperature of the system is
      1000"C. This temperature level should not, however, be considered
      as a restriction. This temperature is based on the limitations of
      the currently commercially available materials. Specifically, this
      system can utilise material such as compressed Silica Fibre for
      the sleeve around the electrolysis plate and hydrophobic Silica
      Fibre (part no. QR-100HE supplied by Tokyo Roshi International
      Inc., also known as "Advantec") for the diaphragm (as previously
      discussed) which separates the electrolysis disc plates.In the
      process of assembling the cells, the diaphragm material and
      sleeved electrolysis plates 190,198 are adhered to one another by
      using high-temperature-resistant silica adhesive (e.g. the
      "Aremco" product "Ceramabond 618" which has an operational
      tolerance specification of 1000 C).<br>
      <br>
      For the above-described electrolysis cell, for the electrolyte at
      10000C and utilising electrical energy at the rate of 1kWh, 167
      litres of oxygen and 334 litres of hydrogen per hour will be
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      The silica fibre diaphragm 116 previously discussed separates the
      oxygen and hydrogen gas streams by the mechanism of density
      separation, and produce a separate store of oxygen and hydrogen at
      pressure. Pressure from the produced gases can range from 0 to
      150,000 Atmospheres. At higher pressures, density separation may
      not occur. In this instance, the gas molecules can be magnetically
      separated from the electrolyte if required.<br>
      <br>
      In reference to the experiments conducted by Messrs Hamann and
      Linton (S.D. Hamann and M. Linton, Trans. Faraday Soc.
      62,2234-2241. Specifically, page 2240), this research has proven
      that higher pressures can produce the same effect as higher
      temperatures in that the conductivity increases as temperature
      and/or pressure increases. At very high pressures, the water
      molecule at low temperatures dissociates.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for this is that the bonding electron is more readily
      removed when under high pressure. The same phenomenon occurs when
      the bonding electrons are at a high temperature (e.g. 1500"C) but
      at low pressures.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 15, hydrogen and oxygen gases are separated into
      independent gas streams flowing into separate pressure vessels
      158,160 capable of withstanding pressures up to 150,000
      Atmospheres. Separation of the two gases thereby eliminates the
      possibility of detonation. It should also be noted that high
      pressures can facilitate the use of high temperatures within the
      electrolyte because the higher pressure elevates the boiling point
      of water.<br>
      <br>
      Experimentation shows that 1 litre of water can yield 1,850 litres
      of hydrogen/oxygen (in a ratio of 2: 1) gas mix after
      discomposition, this significant differential (1:1,850) is the
      source of the pressure. Stripping the bonding electrons from the
      water molecule, which subsequently converts liquid into a gaseous
      state, releases energy which can be utilised as pressure when this
      occurs in a confined space.<br>
      <br>
      A discussion of experimental work in relation to the effects of
      pressure in electrolysis processes can be obtained from "Hydrogen
      Energy, Part A, Hydrogen Economy Miami Energy Conference, Miami
      Beach, Florida, 1974, edited by T. Nejat Veziroglu, Plenum Press".
      The papers presented by F.C. Jensen and F.H. Schubert on pages 425
      to 439 and by John B. Pangborn and John C. Sharer on pages 499 to
      508 are of particular relevance.<br>
      <br>
      Attention must be drawn to the above published material;
      specifically on page 434, third paragraph, where reference is made
      to "Fig. 7 shows the effect of pressure on cell voltage...". Fig.
      7 on page 436 ("Effect of Pressure on SFWES Single Cell")
      indicates that if pressure is increased, then so too does the
      minimum DC voltage.<br>
      <br>
      These quotes were provided for familiarisation purposes only and
      not as demonstrable and empirical fact. Experimentation by the
      inventor factually indicates that increased pressure (up to 2,450
      psi) in fact lowers the minimum DC voltage.<br>
      <br>
      This now demonstrable fact, whereby increased pressure actually
      lowers minimum DC voltage, is further exemplified by the findings
      of Messrs. Nayar, Ragunathan and Mitra in 1979 which can be
      referenced in their paper: "Development and operation of a high
      current density high pressure advanced electrolysis cell".<br>
      <br>
      Nayar, M.G.; Ragunathan, P. and Mitra, S.K. International Journal
      of Hydrogen Energy (Pergamon Press Ltd.), 1980, Vol. 5, pp. 65-74.
      Their Table 2 on page 72 expressly highlights this as follows: "At
      a Current density (ASM) of 7,000 and at a temperature of 80"C, the
      table shows identical Cell voltages at both pressures of 7.6
      kg/cm2 and 11.0 kg/cm2. But at Current densities of 5,000, 6,000,
      8,000, 9,000 and 10,000 (at a temperature of 80"C), the Cell
      voltages were lower at a pressure of 11.0 kg/cm2 than at a
      pressure of 7.6 kg/cm2. "The present invention thus significantly
      improves on the apparatus employed by Mr. M.G. Nayar et al at
      least in the areas of cell plate materials, current density and
      cell configuration.<br>
      <br>
      In the preferred form the electrode discs 192 are perforated mild
      steel, conductive polymer or perforated resin bonded carbon cell
      plates. The diameter of the perforated holes 196 is chosen to be
      twice the thickness of the plate in order to maintain the same
      total surface area prior to perforation. Nickel was utilised in
      the noted prior art system. That material has a higher electrical
      resistance than mild steel or carbon, providing the present
      invention with a lower voltage capability per cell.<br>
      <br>
      The aforementioned prior art system quotes a minimum current
      density (after conversion from ASM to Amps per square cm.) at 0.5
      Amps per cm2. The present invention operates at the ideal current
      density, established by experimentation, to minimise cell voltage
      which is .034 Amps per cm2.<br>
      <br>
      When compared with the aforementioned system, an embodiment of the
      present invention operates more efficiently due to a current
      density improvement by a factor of 14.7, the utilisation of better
      conducting cell plate material which additionally lowers cell
      voltage, a lower cellivoltage of 1.49 at 800C as opposed to 1.8
      volts at 800 C, and a compact and efficient cell configuration.<br>
      <br>
      In order to further investigate the findings of Messrs. M.G. Nayer
      et al, the inventor conducted experiments utilising much higher
      pressures. For Nayer et al the pressures were 7.6 kg/cm2 to 11.0
      kg/cm2, whereas inventor's pressures were 0 psi to 2450 psi in an
      hydrogen/oxygen admixture electrolysis system.<br>
      <br>
      This electrolysis system was run from the secondary coil of a
      transformer set approximately at maximum 50 Amps and with an
      opencircuit voltage of 60 Volts. In addition, this electrolysis
      system is designed with reduced surface area in order that it can
      be housed in an hydraulic container for testing purposes. The
      reduced surface area subsequently caused the gas production
      efficiency to drop when compared with previous (i.e. more
      efficient) prototypes. The gas flow rate was observed to be
      approximately 90 litres per hour at 70"C in this system as opposed
      to 310 litres per hour at 700C obtained from previous prototypes.<br>
      <br>
      All of the following data and graphs have been taken from the
      table shown in Fig. 19.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 20 (titled "Volts Per Pressure Increase"), it
      can be seen that at a pressure of 14.7 psi (i.e. 1 Atmosphere),
      the voltage measured as 38.5V and at a pressure of 2450 psi, the
      voltage measured as 29.4V. This confirms the findings of Nayar et
      al that increased pressure lowers the system's voltage.
      Furthermore, these experiments contradict the conclusion drawn by
      F.C. Jensen and F.H. Schubert ("Hydrogen Energy, Part A, Hydrogen
      Economy Miami Energy Conference, Miami Beach, Florida, 1974,
      edited by T. Nejat Veziroglu, Plenum Press", pp 425 to 439,
      specifically Fig. 7 on page 434) being that "... as the pressure
      of the water being electrolysed increases, then so too does the
      minimum DC Voltage".As the.inventor's experiments are current and
      demonstrable, the inventor now presents his findings as the
      current state of the art and not the previously accepted findings
      of Schubert and Jensen.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 21 (titled "Amps Per Pressure Increase"), it can
      be seen that at a pressure of 14.7 psi (i.e. 1 Atmosphere being
      Test Run No. 1), the current was measured as 47.2A and at a
      pressure of 2450 psi (Test Run No. 20), the current was measured
      as 63A.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 22 (titled "Kilowatts Per Pressure Increase"),
      examination of the power from Test Run No. 1 (1.82 kW) through to
      Test Run No. 20 (1.85 kW) indicates that there was no major
      increase in energy input required at higher pressures in order to
      maintain adequate gas flow.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 23 (titled "Resistance (Ohms) Per Pressure
      Increase"), the resistance was calculated from Test Run No. 1
      (0.82 ohms) to Test Run No. 20 (0.47 ohms). This data indicates
      that the losses due to resistance in the electrolysis system at
      high pressures are negligible.<br>
      <br>
      Currently accepted convention has it that dissolved hydrogen, due
      to high pressures within the electrolyte, would cause an increase
      in resistance because hydrogen and oxygen are bad conductors of
      ionic flow. The net result of which would be that this would
      decrease the production of gases.<br>
      <br>
      These tests indicate that the ions find their way around the H2
      and 2 molecules within the solution and that at higher pressures,
      density separation will always cause the gases to separate from
      the water and facilitate the movement of the gases from the
      electrolysis plates. A very descriptive analogy of this phenomenon
      is where the ion is about the size of a football and the gas
      molecules are each about the size of a football field thereby
      allowing the ion a large manoeuvring area in which to skirt the
      molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to Fig. 24 (titled "Pressure Differential (Increase)"),
      it can be seen that the hydrogen/oxygen admixture caused a
      significant pressure increase on each successive test run from
      Test Run No. 1 to Test Run No. 11. Test Runs thereafter indicated
      that the hydrogen/oxygen admixture within the electrolyte solution
      imploded at the point of conception (being on the surface of the
      plate).<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to the table of Fig. 19, it can be noted the time
      taken from the initial temperature to the final temperature in
      Test Run No. 12 was approximately half the time taken in Test Run
      No. 10. The halved elapsed time (from 40"C to 700C) was due to the
      higher pressure causing the hydrogen/oxygen admixture to detonate
      which subsequently imploded within the system thereby releasing
      thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the table shown in Fig. 25 (titled "Flow Rate
      Analysis Per Pressure Increase"), these findings were brought
      about from flow rate tests up to 200 psi and data from Fig. 24.
      These findings result in the data of Fig. 25 concerning gas flow
      rate per pressure increase. Referring to Fig. 25, it can be seen
      that at a pressure of 14.7 psi (1 Atmosphere) a gas production
      rate of 88 litres per kWh is being achieved. At 1890 psi, the
      system produces 100 litres per kWh. These findings point to the
      conclusion that higher pressures do not affect the gas production
      rate of the system, the gas production rate remains constant
      between pressures of 14.7 psi (1Atmosphere) and 1890 psi.<br>
      <br>
      Inferring from all of the foregoing data, increased pressure will
      not adversely affect cell performance (gas production rate) in
      separation systems where hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced
      separately, nor as a combined admixture. Therefore, in an enclosed
      electrolysis system embodying the invention, the pressure can be
      allowed to build up to a predetermined level and remain at this
      level through continuous (ondemand) replenishment. This pressure
      is the over-unity energy because it has been obtained during the
      normal course of electrolysis operation without additional energy
      input.<br>
      <br>
      This over-unity energy (i.e. the produced pressure) can be
      utilised to maintain the requisite electrical energy supply to the
      electrolysis system as well as provide useful work.<br>
      <br>
      The following formulae and subsequent data do not take into
      account the apparent efficiencies gained by pressure increase in
      this electrolysis system such as the gained efficiency factors
      highlighted by the previously quoted Hamann and Linton research.
      Accordingly, the over-unity energy should therefore be considered
      as conservative claims and that such claimed over-unity energy
      would in fact occur at much lower pressures.<br>
      <br>
      This over-unity energy can be formalised by way of utilising a
      pressure formula as follows: E = (P - PO) V which is the energy
      (E) in Joules per second that can be extracted from a volume (V)
      which is cubic meters of gas per second at a pressure (P) measured
      in Pascals and where P0 is the ambient pressure (i.e. 1
      Atmosphere).<br>
      <br>
      In order to formulate total available over-unity energy, we will
      first use the above formula but will not take into account
      efficiency losses. The formula is based on a flow rate of 500
      litres per kWh at 10000C. When the gases are produced in the
      electrolysis system, they are allowed to self-compress up to
      150,000 Atmospheres which will then produce a volume (V) of 5.07 x
      10-8 m3/sec.<br>
      <br>
      Work [Joules/sec] = ((150-1) x 108) 5.07 x 10-8 m3/sec = 760.4
      Watts<br>
      <br>
      The graphs in Figs. 27-29 (Over-Unity in Watt-Hours) indicate
      over-unity energy available excluding efficiency losses. However,
      in a normal work environment, inefficiencies are encountered as
      energy is converted from one form to another.<br>
      <br>
      The results of these calculations will indicate the amount of
      surplus- over-unity energy after the electrolysis system has been
      supplied with its required 1 kWh to maintain its operation of
      producing the 500 Iph of hydrogen and oxygen (separately in a
      ratio of 2:1).<br>
      <br>
      The following calculations utilise the abovestated formula
      including the efficiency factor. The losses which we will
      incorporate will be 10% loss due to the energy conversion device
      (converting pressure to mechanical energy, which is represented by
      device 162 in Fig. 15) and 5% loss due to the DC generator We
      providing a total of 650 Watt-Hours which results from the
      pressurised gases.<br>
      <br>
      Returning to the 1 kWh, which is required for electrolysis
      operation, this 1 kWh is converted (during electrolysis) to
      hydrogen and oxygen. The 1 kWh of hydrogen and oxygen is fed into
      a fuel cell. After conversion to electrical energy in the fuel
      cell, we are left with 585 Watt-Hours due to a 65 % efficiency
      factor in the fuel cell (35 % thermal losses are fed back into
      electrolysis unit 150 via Qr in Fig. 15)<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 30 graphically indicates the total over-unity energy
      available combining a fuel cell with the pressure in this
      electrolysis system in a range from 0 kAtmospheres to 150
      kAtmospheres. The data in Fig. 30 has been compiled utilising the
      previously quoted formulae where the Watt-Hours findings are based
      on incorporating the 1 kWh required to drive the electrolysis
      system, taking into account all inefficiencies in the idealised
      electrolysis system (complete the loop) and then adding the output
      energy from the pressurised electrolysis system with the output of
      the fuel cell. This graph thereby indicates the energy break-even
      point (at approximately 66 k Atmospheres) where the idealised
      electrolysis system becomes self-sustaining.<br>
      <br>
      In order to scale up this system for practical applications, such
      as power stations that will produce 50 MW of available electrical
      energy (as an example), the required input energy to the
      electrolysis system will be 170 MW (which is continually looped).<br>
      <br>
      The stores of high pressure gases can be used with a
      hydrogen/oxygen internal combustion engine, as shown in Figs. 31a
      to 31e. The stores of high pressure gases can be used with either
      forms of combustion engines having an expansion stroke, including
      turbines, rotary, wankel and orbital engines. One cylinder of an
      internal combustion engine is represented, however it is usually,
      but not necessarily always the case, that there will be other
      cylinders in the engine offset from each other in the timing of
      their stroke. The cylinder 320 houses a piston head 322 and crank
      324, with the lower end of the crank 324 being connected with a
      shaft 326. The piston head 322 has conventional rings 328 sealing
      the periphery of the piston head 322 to the bore of the cylinder
      320.<br>
      <br>
      A chamber 330, located above the top of the piston head 322,
      receives a supply of regulated separated hydrogen gas and oxygen
      gas via respective inlet ports 332,334. <br>
      <br>
      There is also an exhaust port 336 venting gas from the chamber
      330.<br>
      <br>
      The engine's operational cycle commences as shown in Fig. 31a,
      with the injection of pressurised hydrogen gas, typically at a
      pressure of 5,000 psi to 30,000 psi, sourced from a reservoir of
      that gas (not shown). The oxygen gas port 334 is closed at this
      stage, as is the exhaust port 336. Therefore, as shown in Fig.
      31b, the pressure of gas forces the piston head 322 downward, thus
      driving the shaft 326. The stroke is shown as distance "A".<br>
      <br>
      At this point, the oxygen inlet 334 is opened to a flow of
      pressurised oxygen, again typically at a pressure of 5000 psi to
      30,000 psi, the volumetric flow rate being one half of the
      hydrogen already injected, so that the hydrogen and oxygen gas
      within the chamber 330 are the proportion 2:1.<br>
      <br>
      Conventional expectations when injecting a gas into a confined
      space (e.g. such as a closed cylinder) are that gases will have a
      cooling effect on itself and subsequently its immediate
      environment (e.g. cooling systems/refrigeration). This is not the
      case with hydrogen. The inverse applies where hydrogen, as it is
      being injected, heats itself up and subsequently heats up its
      immediate surroundings. This effect, being the inverse of other
      gases, adds to the efficiency of the overall energy equation when
      producing over-unity energy.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 31c, the piston head 322 has moved a further
      stroke, shown as distance "B", at which time there is
      self-detonation of the hydrogen and oxygen mixture. <br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen and oxygen inlets 332,334 are closed at this point,
      as is the exhaust 336.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 31d, the piston head is driven further downwardly
      by an additional stroke, shown as distance "C", to an overall
      stroke represented by distance "D".&nbsp; The added piston
      displacement occurs by virtue of the detonation.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 31e, the exhaust port 336 is now opened, and by
      virtue of the kinetic energy of the shaft 326 (or due to the
      action of others of the pistons connected with the shaft), the
      piston head 322 is driven upwardly, thus exhausting the waste
      steam by the exhaust port 336 until such time as the situation of
      Fig. 31e is achieved so that the cycle can repeat.<br>
      <br>
      A particular advantage of an internal combustion motor constructed
      in accordance with the arrangement shown in Figs. 3 1a to 3 1e is
      that no compression stroke is required, and neither is an ignition
      system required to ignite the working gases, rather the
      pressurised gases spontaneously combust when provided in the
      correction proportion and under conditions of high pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Useful mechanical energy can be extracted from the internal
      combustion engine, and be utilised to do work. Clearly the supply
      of pressurised gas must be replenished by the electrolysis process
      in order to allow the mechanical work to continue to be done.
      Nevertheless, the inventor believes that it should be possible to
      power a vehicle with an internal combustion engine of the type
      described in Figs. 31a to 31 e, with that vehicle having a store
      of the gases generated by the electrolysis process, and still be
      possible to undertake regular length journeys with the vehicle
      carrying a supply of the gases in pressure vessels (somewhat in a
      similar way to,&nbsp; and the size of, petrol tanks in
      conventional internal combustion engines).<br>
      <br>
      When applying over-unity energy in the form of pressurised
      hydrogen and oxygen gases to this internal combustion engine for
      the purpose of providing acceptable ranging (i.e. distance
      travelled), pressurised stored gases as mentioned above may be
      necessary to overcome the problem of mass inertia (e.g. stop-start
      driving). Inclusion of the stored pressurised gases also
      facilitates the ranging (i.e. distance travelled) of the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      Over-unity energy (as claimed in this submission) for an average
      sized passenger vehicle will be supplied at a continual rate of
      between 20 kW and 40 kW. In the case of an over-unity energy
      supplied vehicle, a supply of water (e.g. similar to a petrol tank
      in function) must be carried in the vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly electrical energy is consumed in generating the gases.
      However it is also claimed by the inventor that an over-unity
      energy system can provide the requisite energy thereby overcoming
      the problem of the consumption of fossil fuels either in
      conventional internal combustion engines or in the generation of
      the electricity to drive the electrolysis process by coal, oil or
      natural gas generators.<br>
      <br>
      Experimentation by the inventor shows that if 1,850 litres of
      hydrogen/oxygen gas mix (in a ratio of 2:1) is detonated, the
      resultant product is 1 litre of water and 1,850 litres of vacuum
      if the thermal value of the hydrogen and oxygen gas mix is
      dissipated. At atmospheric pressure, 1 litre of admixed
      hydrogen/oxygen (2:1) contains 11 BTUs of thermal energy. Upon
      detonation, this amount of heat is readily dissipated at a rate
      measured in microseconds which subsequently causes an implosion
      (inverse differential of 1,850:1). Tests conducted by the inventor
      at 3 atmospheres (hydrogen/oxygen gas at a pressure of 50 psi)
      have proven that complete implosion does not occur. However, even
      if the implosion container is heated (or becomes heated) to 400C,
      total implosion will still occur.<br>
      <br>
      This now available function of idiosyncratic implosion can be
      utilised by a pump taking advantage of this action. Such a pump
      necessarily requires an electrolysis gas system such as that
      described above, and particularly shown in Fig. 6.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 32a-32c show the use of implosion and its cycles in a
      pumping device 400. The pump 400 is initially primed from a water
      inlet 406. The water inlet 406 then is closed-off and the
      hydrogen/oxygen gas inlet 408 is opened.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 32b, the admixed hydrogen/oxygen gas forces the
      water upward through the one-way check valve 410 and outlet tube
      412 into the top reservoir 414. The one-way check valves 410,416
      will not allow the water to drop back into the cylinder 404 or the
      first reservoir 402. This force equates to lifting the water over
      a distance. The gas inlet valve 408 then is closed, and the spark
      plug 418 detonates the gas mixture which causes an implosion
      (vacuum). Atmospheric pressure forces the water in reservoir 402
      up through tube 420.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 32c shows the water having been transferred into the pump
      cylinder 404 by the previous action. The implosion therefore is
      able to 'lift' the water from the bottom reservoir 402 over a
      distance which is approximately the length of tube 420.<br>
      <br>
      The lifting capacity of the implosion pump is therefore
      approximately the total of the two distances mentioned. This
      completes the pumping cycle, which can then be repeated after the
      reservoir 402 has been refilled.<br>
      <br>
      Significant advantages of this pump are that it does not have any
      diaphragms, impellers nor pistons thereby essentially not having
      any moving parts (other than solenoids and one-way check valves).
      As such, the pump is significantly maintenancefree when compared
      to current pump technology.<br>
      <br>
      It is envisaged that this pump with the obvious foregoing positive
      attributes and advantages in pumping fluids, semi-fluids and gases
      can replace all currently known general pumps and vacuum pumps
      with significant benefits to the end-user of this pump.<br>

      A cell arrangement for the electrolysis of water to liberate
      hydrogen and oxygen gases is described. A cell unit (125) has a
      stacked arrangement of segmentation disks <br>
      <br>
      (114), a first type of (anode) cell plates (90), a second type of
      (cathode) cell plates (98) and separation membranes (116).
      Interconnecting conductive shafts (126-131) pass through holes
      (100, 102) of the cell plates (90,98) to have selective electrical
      interconnection therewith. Water and electrolyte are supplied by
      inlet ports (108, 110) to immerse the cell plates (90, 98). The
      membranes (116) normally isolate adjacent cathode and anode plates
      (90, 98) from the mixing of liberated oxygen and hydrogen gases
      while allowing ionic current to flow. By selective adjustment of
      the water/electrolyte pressure differential on the respective

      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to the generation of hydrogen gas
      and oxygen gas from water, either as an admixture or as separated
      gases, by the process of electrolysis, and relates further to
      applications for the use of the liberated gas. Embodiments of the
      invention particularly relate to an apparatus for the efficient
      generation of these gases, and to the use of the gases as a
      thermal source in atomic welding or cutting, and in gaseous waste
      disposal.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The technique of electrolysing water in the presence of an
      electrolyte such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide
      (KOH) to liberate hydrogen and oxygen gas (H2, O2) is well known.
      The process involves applying a DC potential difference between
      two or more anode/cathode electrode pairs and delivering the
      minimum energy required to break the H--O bonds (i.e. 68.3 kcal
      per mole @STP). The gases are produced in the stoichiometric
      proportions for O2 :H2 of 1:2 liberated respectively from the
      anode (+) and cathode (-).<br>
      <br>

      Electrochemistry, Volume 2, by John O'M. Bockris and Amulya K. N.
      Reddy, (Plenum Publishing Corporation)", "Electro-Chemical
      Science," by J. O'M. Bockris and D. M. Drazic, (Taylor and Francis
      Limited) and "Fuel Cells, Their Electrochemistry," by J. O'M.
      Bockris and S. Srinivasan, (McGraw-Hill Book Company).<br>
      <br>
      A discussion of experimental work in relation to electrolysis
      processes can be obtained from "Hydrogen Energy, Part A, Hydrogen
      Economy Miami Energy Conference," Miami Beach, Fla., 1974, edited
      by T. Nejat Veziroglu, Plenum Press. The papers presented by J.
      O'M. Bockris on pages 371 to 379, by F. C. Jensen and F. H.
      Schubert on pages 425 to 439 and by John B. Pangborn and John C.
      Sharer on pages 499 to 508 are of particular relevance.<br>
      <br>
      On a macro-scale, the amount of gas produced depends upon a number
      of variables, including the type and concentration of the
      electrolytic solution used, the anode/cathode electrode pair
      surface area, the electrolytic resistance (equating to ionic
      conductivity, which is a function of temperature), the achievable
      current density and anode/cathode potential difference. The total
      energy delivered must be sufficient to disassociate the water ions
      to generate hydrogen and oxygen gases, yet avoid plating
      (oxidation/reduction) of the metallic or conductive non-metallic
      materials from which the electrodes are constructed.<br>
      <br>
      Reference also is made to prior art Australian Patent No. 487062
      to Yull Brown, that discloses an electrolysis cell arrangement to
      produce hydrogen and oxygen on demand, together with a safety
      device preventing the generation of excess pressure of the
      liberated gases. FIG. 2 of the Brown patent shows a number of
      electrodes (20a,20b) in a series electrical arrangement between
      two terminals (22), across which a voltage is applied. The cell
      (20) produces a gas volumetric flow rate output, and if that
      output is insufficient for a particular application, then a larger
      number of individual cell units must be provided which are all
      electrically connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      The end result is a large structure to be supported.<br>
      <br>
      It is also not possible to produce high gas flow rates (of the
      order of 10,000 liters per hour) on demand from the prior art
      apparatus without the use of expensive and complicated equipment,
      and even then the equipment suffers from low efficiencies in the
      conversion of electrical energy to generate the hydrogen and
      oxygen gases. Thus, the large scale commercial implementation of
      such apparatus is not economically viable.<br>
      <br>
      Admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases (or hydroxy gas) are used as a
      thermal source when burnt in a stream, for example, in furnaces.
      Hydrogen alone is used for atomic cutting and often for atomic
      welding, although the device described in the Brown patent
      performed atomic welding with admixed hydrogen and oxygen. Recent
      industry practice clearly exemplifies that the presence of oxygen
      in a plasma arc causes severe oxidation of the tungsten
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      One of the problems experienced in implementing these applications
      is the need to incorporate electrical switchgear to transform main
      supply voltages to a level suitable for a bank of electrolysis
      cells (i.e. by step-down transformers). The resulting completed
      arrangement is electrically inefficient and cumbersome, and also
      can be expensive if precise voltage and current regulation (hence
      gas flow regulation) is required.<br>
      <br>
      Combusted hydrogen and oxygen gases mixed into a single stream
      burn at a very high temperature, typically of the order of 6000
      DEG C. Hydrogen/oxygen welding sets are generally known to
      comprise of a welding tip or hand piece connected by a dual gas
      hose to separate supplies of oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      There are four other common types of welding apparatus and
      techniques in use. These are oxy-acetylene welding, electric arc
      welding, MIG (metal-inert-gas)/TIG (tungsten-inert-gas) systems
      and plasma cutting.<br>
      <br>
      It is estimated that more than 100,000 oxy-acetylene sets are used
      in Australia. Of those, approximately 70% are used primarily for
      cutting metals, with the remainder being used as a heat source,
      for fusion welding of sheet metal, brazing, silver soldering and
      the like. Typically, oxy-acetylene sets can weld thicknesses of
      metal between 0.5 mm to 2 mm. Further, thicknesses up to 140 mm
      can be cut, but only where the steel contains a high percentage of
      iron. The reason for this is that the iron and the oxygen are
      required to support the oxidation process which induces the
      cutting effect. The acetylene gas provides the initial temperature
      to start the oxidation reaction, being typically 850 DEG C.
      Oxy-acetylene sets require a bottled supply of both acetylene and
      oxygen gas. Hence, the bottles must be bought or rented, then
      continually maintained and refilled with use.<br>
      <br>
      Electric arc welding is a method used for welding metals of
      greater than 1.5 mm in thickness. The principle of operation is
      that a hand piece is supplied with a consumable electrode, and the
      work piece forms the other electrode. An AC or DC potential
      difference is created between the electrodes, thus causing an arc
      to be struck when the hand piece is brought into proximity of the
      work piece. The arc can be used to fuse or weld metal pieces
      together.<br>
      <br>
      MIG systems are based around a continuous wire feed system. In one
      known arrangement, the consumable wire is shrouded by argon gas
      (or a plasma) which typically is provided from a bottled supply.
      TIG systems, on the other hand, require the filler wire to be
      hand-fed into the weld pool. MIG/TIG systems can weld metals from
      between 1 mm to 20 mm in thickness. These metals, typically
      include stainless steel, aluminium, mild steel and the like.
      Reference can be made to a text "The Science and Practice of
      Welding, Volume 2, A. C. Davies, Cambridge University Press" with
      respect to a plasma MIG processes.<br>
      <br>
      Plasma cutting is a method of cutting by introducing compressed
      air (comprising predominantly nitrogen) to a DC electric arc,
      thereby producing very high temperatures (about 15,000 DEG C.) and
      so stripping electrons from the nitrogen nucleus to form a high
      temperature plasma. This plasma can be utilized to cut ferrous and
      non-ferrous materials such as mild steel, stainless steel, copper,
      brass and aluminium. Available plasma cutters can cut up to a 25
      mm thickness and have the advantage of not requiring bottled gas,
      but rather utilize free air. Reference can be made to the text
      "Gas Shielded Arc Welding," by N. J. Henthome and R. W. Chadwick,
      (Newnes Technical Books.) with respect to plasma cutting.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen from the discussion of the prior art, no one unit
      or system has the capability of performing all welding and cutting
      functions, and typically, one of the systems already described
      would be chosen over another for any particular job. This then
      requires that metal workers or other metal trade industry
      manufacturers must purchase and maintain a number of different
      types of welding units in order to have the capability to handle
      any job on demand. The costs associated with the purchase of
      replacement bottled gas also are very high.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is a preferred object of the present invention to provide an
      arrangement whereby hydrogen and oxygen gases can be produced by
      electrolysis in a manner that avoids one or more of the foregoing
      disadvantages. In that sense, the electrolysis apparatus is
      compact and offers greater efficiencies than the prior art for
      comparative gas flow rates.<br>
      <br>
      It is a further preferred object of the invention to provide an
      improved structure for an electrolysis cell for use in the
      generation of hydrogen and oxygen gas. The electrolysis cell can
      be used in hydrogen/oxygen welding or hydrogen plasma cutting.
      Other applications may relate to industrial processes where a
      combustible source of fuel is required, such as incinerators, and
      to the incineration of intractable wastes.<br>
      <br>
      It is a yet further preferred object to provide an electrolysis
      cell arrangement that allows the selective separation or admixture
      of hydrogen and oxygen gas into individual gas streams.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention further preferably is directed to provision
      of a unitary welding unit which can provide all the welding or
      cutting requirements of a user. Advantageously, no bottled supply
      of hydrogen or oxygen is required. A bottled supply of any other
      gas also required is not. For example, argon is not required in
      shrouded MIG/TIG applications.<br>
      <br>
      It is a yet further preferred object of the invention to provide a
      flashback arrester for a hydrogen/oxygen welding or hydrogen
      plasma cutting tip.<br>

      therethrough dependant upon a pressure differential between
      opposite sides of a membrane.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND BEST MODE OF PERFORMANCE</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>An electrolysis cell bank embodying the invention is
      constructed of a number of hexagonally shaped electrolysis cell
      plates 10, one of which is shown in plan a in FIG. 1a and as a
      side view in FIG. 1b. Each plate 10 has three slots 12, each one
      arranged in alternating side edges of the plate 10. The other
      sides of the cell plate 10 each are provided with a conductive
      bridge or flange 14. Typically twenty individual cell plates 10
      are stacked to form one complete cell 16 as shown as a side view
      in FIG. 2. The total number of plates can vary in accordance with
      the required surface area, and thus, also is a function of plate
      diameter.<br>
      <br>
      The stacking of adjacent individual cell plates 10 is in a
      reversed order, so that the conductive bridges 12 of adjacent
      plates extend in opposed directions and with a relative rotational
      offset of 60 DEG . This rotational offset is provided so that
      adjacent plates 10 are to bear opposite polarity. The conductive
      bridges 14 are long enough to pass through a corresponding slot 12
      in an adjacent plate 10, without contacting that plate, and
      contact the next subsequent plate to form a conductive path
      between each alternate plate. In this way, the completed cell
      structure 16 has three positive end terminals and three negative
      end terminals, although FIG. 2 shows only two of the positive
      terminals and one of the negative terminals. The cell stack 16 is
      enveloped by an insulating case 18 (shown in cut-away form). The
      cell plates 10 shown in FIGS. 1a, 1b and 2 are suited to form in a
      parallel electrical arrangement, with each adjacent two cell
      plates 10 forming either the anode or the cathode.<br>
      <br>
      Parallel stacked flat cell plates are described in Australian
      Patent No. 487062. In that patent, a stack of twenty cell plates
      typically requires a potential difference across the individual
      electrodes of each cell plate in the range of 1.55-2.0 volts to
      liberate hydrogen and oxygen gas from the water containing an
      electrolyte of typically 15% sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows, as a vertical cross-sectional view, seven complete
      cell stacks 16 arranged in a hexagonal matrix and enclosed by a
      steel casing 20, thereby to provide an electrolysis cell bank 25.
      The cell stacks 16 are insulated from the steel casing 20 by nylon
      insulating bushes 22. The electrical interconnection of the
      individual cell stacks 16 is not shown, but typically the cells
      are connected between their respective positive (+) and negative
      (-) terminals by straps to form a series connection.<br>
      <br>
      It sometimes can be the case that a parallel interconnection of
      the cell stacks 16 is implemented. The actual electrical
      interconnection will depend upon the number of individual cell
      plates 10 comprising each cell stack 16, the supply voltage and
      the current that can be drawn from the supply.<br>
      <br>
      Water is consumed as the hydrogen and oxygen gas is liberated
      during the electrolysis reaction. One liter of water generates
      1860 liters of admixed oxygen and hydrogen at STP, in the
      volumetric proportion noted above. In the arrangement shown water
      is continually supplied through the inlet port 24.<br>
      <br>
      The nylon covers 18 separating adjacent stacks have the benefit of
      directing the liberated gas upwardly to be collected by, for
      example, a gas outlet 26 located at the top of the electrolysis
      cell bank 25. By virtue of volumetric displacement in a ratio of
      1:1860, the liberated gases are self-pressurizing as they pass
      from the outlet port 26 into the interconnecting pipe work (not
      shown), which has a far narrower cross-sectional area than that of
      the cell bank.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is a vertical cross-sectional view showing the mechanical
      configuration of an electrolysis cell in accordance with a further
      embodiment. The basic cell unit 30 is constituted by respective
      halves of a pair of interdigitated electrodes 32, 34 arranged much
      in the nature of interleaved combs. Each electrode is formed by a
      conductive spine 36, 38, typically constructed of resin bonded
      carbon material, mild steel or conductive polymers, from which
      extend eleven finger-like plates 40, 42, also constructed of
      carbon, steel or conductive polymer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a perspective view of one of the electrodes 32 in which
      the spine 36 and plates 40 are rectangular in shape. The
      electrodes need not necessarily be of the shape shown, but rather
      can take on many other forms, one example of which will presently
      be described. The common requirement for all such configurations
      is that the plates be parallel and interconnected by a common
      member usually arranged orthogonally to the plates.<br>
      <br>
      Each pair of electrodes 32, 34 are in a staggered arrangement so
      that the respective outermost plates 40a, 42a are offset by
      approximately one half of the total length of each electrode 32,
      34. The respective mid-point plates are identified by the
      reference numerals 40b and 42b.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 shows the staggering arrangement in a simplified form.
      Every sixth plate is located in the space formed between the first
      and eleventh plate of the respective opposed adjacent electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIG. 4 again, two complete cell units 30 and a part
      of the next respective adjacent cell units are shown. The total
      number of cell units is governed by the DC supply voltage, since a
      minimum anode/cathode voltage is required to derive the
      electrolysis process, and each adjacent cell unit is in a series
      electrical connection of the parallel-arranged plates 40, 42. In
      the electrolysis process, the cells 30 are immersed in water and
      electrolyte and a DC voltage is applied between the end-most
      plates 40c, 42c causing elemental ionic currents (some of which
      are represented by the dashed arrows) to flow between the adjacent
      plates 40, 42, and some current-wise along the respective spines
      36, 38 and plates 40, 42 (shown by the solid arrows). A different
      current path is followed at each mid-plate. For example, the DC
      current travels from one end cell plate 42a, through the
      electrolyte, passing through the mid cell plate 40b and again
      through the electrolyte to the next end cell plate 42a. This
      process causes the accumulation of net positive charge on one side
      of the mid-plate 40b, and a negative charge on the other side.<br>
      <br>
      The ionic current flow is accompanied by disassociation of the
      water molecules such that oxygen and hydrogen gas is produced
      respectively at the anode plate and cathode plate surfaces. The
      cathode plate surfaces are those surfaces towards which ionic
      current flows. The converse applies for the anode plate surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage applied across the end-most plates 40c is divided
      equally between the constituent cell units 30, with that fraction
      of the supplied voltage appearing between the respective
      outer-most plates and mid-point plates 40a &amp; 42b, 40b &amp;
      42a.<br>
      <br>
      The achievable current density is limited, in part, by the
      effective electrical resistance of the electrolytic solution. The
      smaller the gap between adjacent plates 40, 42 the less is the
      resistance. The interdigitated nature of the electrodes 32, 34
      means that there is a large surface area available per unit
      volume, and there is a minimum separation between electrode plates
      in all instances. In that case, the resistance of the electrolyte
      is kept low, hence efficiency of the conversion of electrical
      energy to generate the hydrogen and oxygen gases is greater than
      in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      By virtue of the specific arrangement shown, it is not necessary
      to isolate each individual cell unit 30 from adjacent ones
      thereof. The ionic flow naturally will take the path of least
      resistance, hence short-circuits between cell units 30, being a
      path otherwise of greater resistance, are avoided. A large number
      of cells therefore can be arranged to extend longitudinally, and
      allow direct connection to a rectified mains power supply, thus
      obviating the need to electrically interconnect groups of cell
      units by strapping, as has been done in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Each individual cell unit 30 satisfies the operational criteria
      regarding voltage, the surface area of the plates and so on, to
      successfully electrolyze water, and thereby operates essentially
      independently of the adjacent cell units 30.<br>
      <br>
      Testing has established that for a temperature range of 90 DEG C.
      to 50 DEG C., a DC voltage in the range 1.47-1.56 V applied across
      one cell unit 30 (i.e. across one half of a complete electrode 32
      or 34) a minimum (and the optimum) anode current density of 0.034
      A/cm@2 is required to generate a gas flow rate of about 340-300
      l/h per kWh respectively. The discovery that the minimum plate
      surface area corresponds to the optimum gas flow rate means that
      the total volume occupied can be kept to a minimum. By way of
      specific example, a rectified 240 Vrms main voltage nominally
      results in an average DC voltage of 215 V, hence for direct
      connection to the main supply via a rectifier (i.e. without
      requiring a step-down transformer), a total of about one hundred
      and forty cells are required. It is particularly advantageous not
      to require voltage transformation equipment in terms of equipment
      cost, technical simplicity and the avoidance of losses.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7a shows a partial cut-away side view of a cell unit 50 in
      accordance with another embodiment. The cell unit 50 is similar in
      configuration to that of FIG. 4 except for the number and shape of
      interconnecting spine members and the shape of the electrode
      plates.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7b shows an end view of the cell unit 50, and in particular
      the end-most plate 52c. The plate electrodes 52, 54 are hexagonal
      in shape. Each plate 52, 54 has six interconnecting rod-like
      spines 56, 58 passing therethrough, one near each vertice. Each
      alternate one of the spines 56 represents a common positive
      conductor and the other set of alternate spines 58 represents
      negative conductors. Each adjacent plate 52, 54 is electrically
      connected either to the positive conductors or the negative
      conductors. Spacing bushes 60 are provided between adjacent plates
      52, 54 to provide electrical isolation and to provide a space in
      which the water and electrolyte circulates. Connection of each
      spine conductor 56, 58 to the respective plate electrode 52, 54
      typically is by a threaded nut or interference fit. The reason for
      connecting each plate 52, 54 to three common spine conductors 56,
      58 is to achieve a uniform current distribution across the whole
      surface area of a plate 52, 54.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in FIG. 7b, the positive spine conductors 56 extend
      away from one end of the assembly for series interconnection with
      other arrangements of cells, as do three negative spine conductors
      58 from the other end. All unconnected ends of the conductors are
      blanked-off with a non-conductive end cap 62.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a stylized form of three cell units 50 electrically
      connected in series (arranged longitudinally), and particularly
      the passage of the spine conductors 56, 58. The cell units 50 are
      enclosed within an insulating tube 64, typically made of PVC,
      which has an access for the communication of water to envelope the
      plates 52, 54 and for the generated gases to escape.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows the series electrical interconnection of a number of
      cell units 50 directly connected with the DC output side of an
      AC/DC converter 66 (such as a simple diode bridge rectifier)
      without requiring a step-down transformer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10a shows an end view of the mechanical arrangement of seven
      assemblies (designated A-G), each consisting of three series
      connected cell units 50 (as shown in FIG. 8), forming a total cell
      arrangement 70. The cell assemblies 50 are located within a steel
      cylinder 72 containing the water and electrolyte required for the
      generation of the hydrogen and oxygen gases. Each group (A-G) of
      three cell units 50 is interconnected by means of a first group of
      steel connecting straps 74 at one end and a second group of steel
      connecting straps 76 (not shown) at the other end, arranged to be
      offset between the groups. While the first straps 74 alone are
      shown in FIG. 10a, both sets of the straps 74,76 are more clearly
      shown in FIG. 10b, which is a side view of the groups A-G when
      `unravelled`.<br>
      <br>
      The PVC tubes 64 shown in FIG. 10a insulate adjacent groups to
      avoid "short-circuiting" effects between one another. The cell
      arrangement 70 is very compact, and in a comparison with the prior
      art Brown arrangement is only one third of the physical size for a
      comparable gas volumetric flow rate. Moreover, there also being a
      similar reduction in total mass. The supply of water for the
      electrolysis process is provided by an inlet 78 located at the
      bottom of the cylinder 72, with the gases produced exit the
      cylinder 72 by an outlet 80 located at the top of the cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical connection to a DC power supply is across the totality
      of the cells, and in the arrangement is at a central terminal 82
      on the underside of cell A and a central terminal 84 on the top
      side of cell G, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 11a and 12a show further embodiments of a first and second
      type of cell plate 90, 98 as an end view. FIGS. 11b and 12b are
      partial cross-sectional views along the respective mid-lines as
      shown. Common reference numerals have been used where appropriate.
      The plates 90, 98 can have the function of either an anode (+) or
      a cathode (-), as will become apparent. Each comprises an
      electrode disc 92 that is perforated with hexagonally shaped holes
      96. The disc 92 is made from steel or resin-bonded carbon or
      conductive polymer material. The disc 92 is housed in a circular
      rim or sleeve 94. The function of the perforations 96 is to
      maximize the surface area of the electrode disc 92 and minimize
      the weight over solid constructions by 45%.<br>
      <br>
      By way of example, for a disc having diameter of 280 mm, the
      thickness of the disc must be 1 mm in order to allow the current
      density (which ranges from 90 A/2,650 cm@2 -100 A/2,940 cm@2 of
      the anode or cathode) to be optimal. If the diameter of the plate
      is increased, which consequently increases the surface area, it is
      necessary to increase the thickness of the plate in order to
      maintain uniformity of conductance for the desired current
      density.<br>
      <br>
      The hexagonal perforations in a 1 mm thick disc have a distance of
      2 mm between the flat portions of the plates and are 1 mm away
      from the next adjacent perforation, in order to maintain the same
      total surface area prior to perforation, and to allow the current
      density to be optimal. A 1 mm (plate to plate) distance between
      the adjacent hexagonal perforations is required because a smaller
      distance will result in thermal (resistive) losses and a larger
      distance will add to the overall weight of the plate.<br>
      <br>
      The sleeve 94 is constructed of PVC material and incorporates a
      number of equally spaced shaft holes 100, 102. The holes are for
      the passage of interconnecting shafts provided in a stacked
      arrangement of the plates 90, 98 forming the common conductor for
      the respective anode and cathode plates, much in the nature of the
      arrangement shown in FIGS. 7a and 7b. The additional two upper
      holes 104, 106 each support a conduit respectively for the
      out-flow of oxygen and hydrogen gases, respectively. The
      additional holes 108, 110 at the bottom of the sleeve 94 are
      provided for the inlet of water and electrolyte to the respective
      cell plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 13 shows an enlarged view of a portion of the cell plate 90
      shown in FIG. 11a. The port hole 104 is connected to the hexagonal
      perforations 96 within the sleeve 94 by an internal channel 112. A
      similar arrangement is in place for the other port hole 106, and
      for the water/electrolyte supply holes 108, 110.<br>
      <br>
      If the hydrogen and oxygen gases liberated are to be kept separate
      (i.e. not to be formed as an admixture), then it is necessary to
      separate those gases as they are produced. In the prior art, this
      is achieved by use of diaphragms that block the passage of gases
      and effectively isolate the water/electrolyte on each side of the
      diaphragm. Ionic transfer thus is facilitated by the ionically
      conductive nature of the diaphragm material (i.e. a
      water--diaphragm--water path). This results in an increase in the
      ionic resistance, and hence, a reduction in efficiency. Prior art
      patent No. 487062 describes another arrangement (see FIG. 6
      thereof) that utilizes magnets to cause the separation of the
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 shows an exploded stacked arrangement of four cell plates,
      being an alternative stacking of two (anode) cell plates 90 and
      two (cathode) cell plates 98. The two ends of the stacked
      arrangement of cell plates delineates a single cell unit 125.
      Interposed between each adjacent cell plate 90, 98 is a PTFE
      separation 116. Although not shown in FIG. 14, the cell unit
      includes separate hydrogen and oxygen gas conduits that
      respectively pass through the stacked arrangement of cell plates
      via the port holes 106, 104 respectively. In a similar way,
      conduits are provided for the supply of water/electrolyte,
      respectively passing through the holes 108, 110 at the bottom of
      the respective plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      Only two pairs of anode/cathode cell plates are shown. The number
      of such plates can be greatly increased per cell unit 125.<br>
      <br>
      Also not shown are the interconnecting conductive shafts that
      electrically interconnect alternate common cell plates. The reason
      for having a large diameter hole in one cell plate adjacent to a
      smaller diameter hole in the next cell plate, is so that an
      interconnecting shaft will pass through the larger diameter hole,
      and not make an electrical connection (i.e. insulated with PVC
      tubing) but rather only form an electrical connection between
      alternate (common) cell plates.<br>
      <br>
      The cell unit 125 shown in FIG. 14 arrangement is an exploded
      view. When fully constructed, all the elements are stacked to be
      in intimate contact. Mechanical fastening is achieved by use of
      one of two adhesives such as (a) "PUR-FECT LOK" (TM) 34-9002,
      which is a Urethane Reactive Hot Melt adhesive with a main
      ingredient of Methylene Bispheny/Dirsocynate (MDI), and (b)
      "MY-T-BOND" (TM) which is a PVC solvent based adhesive. Both
      adhesives are Sodium Hyroxide (20% present in the electrolyte)
      resistant. In that case, the water/electrolyte only resides within
      the area proscribed by the cell plate sleeve 94. Thus the only
      path for the inlet of water/electrolyte is by bottom channels 118,
      122 and the only outlet for the gases is the top channels 112,120.
      In a system constructed and tested by the inventor, the thickness
      of the cell plates 90, 98 is 1 mm (2 mm on the rim because of the
      PVC sleeve 94), with a diameter of 336 mm. The cell unit 125 is
      segmented from the next cell by an insulating PVC segmentation
      disc 114. A segmentation disc 114 is also placed at the beginning
      and end of the entire cell bank.<br>
      <br>
      If there is to be no control over separation of the liberated
      gases, then the PTFE membranes 116 are not needed.<br>
      <br>
      The PTFE membrane 116 is fibrous and has 0.2 to 1.0 micron
      interstices. A suitable type is type Catalogue Code J, supplied by
      Tokyo Roshi International Inc (Advantec). The water/electrolyte
      fills the interstices and ionic current flows only via the
      water--there is no contribution of ionic flow through the PTFE
      material itself. This leads to a reduction in the resistance to
      ionic flow. The PTFE material also has a "bubble point" that is a
      function of pressure. Hence by controlling the relative pressures
      at either side of the PTFE separation sheets, the gases can be
      "forced" through the interstices to form an admixture, or
      otherwise kept separate. Other advantages of this arrangement
      include a cheaper cost of construction, improved operational
      efficiency and greater resistance to faults.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15a is a stylized and exploded, schematic view of a linear
      array of three series-connected cell units 125. For clarity, only
      six interconnecting shafts 126-131 are shown. The shafts 126-131
      pass through the respective shaft holes 102, 100 in the various
      cell plates 90, 98 in the stacked arrangement. The polarity
      attached to each of the exposed end shafts, to which the DC supply
      is connected also is indicated. The shafts 126-131 do not run the
      full length of the three cell banks 125. The representation is
      similar to the arrangement shown in FIGS. 7a and 8. One third of
      the full DC source voltage appears across each anode/cathode cell
      plate pair 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the gas conduits 132, 133, respectively for oxygen and
      hydrogen, that pass through the port holes 104, 106 in the cell
      plates 90, 98 also are shown. In a similar way, water/electrolyte
      conduits 134, 135, passing through the water port holes 108, 110
      in the cell plates also are shown.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15b particularly shows how the relative potential difference
      in the middle cell bank 125a changes. That is, the plate electrode
      90a now functions as a cathode (i.e. relatively more negative) to
      generate hydrogen, and the plate electrode 98a now functions as an
      anode (i.e. relatively more positive) to generate oxygen. This is
      the case for every alternate cell unit. The arrowheads shown in
      FIG. 15b indicate the electron and ionic current circuit. FIG. 15c
      is an electrical equivalent circuit representation of FIG. 15b,
      where the resistive elements represent the ionic resistance
      between adjacent anode/cathode plates. Thus, it can be seen that
      the cell units are connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the change of function of the cell plates 90a and 98a,
      the complementary gases are liberated at each. Hence, the
      respective channels 112 are connected to the opposite gas conduit
      132,133. Practically, this can be achieved by the simple reversal
      of the cell plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 shows the three cell units 125 of FIG. 15a connected to a
      gas collection arrangement. The cell units 125 are located within
      a tank 140 that is filled with water/electrolyte to the level h
      indicated. The water is consumed as the electrolysis process
      proceeds, and replenishing supply is provided via the inlet 152.
      The water/electrolyte level h can be viewed via the sight glass
      154. In normal operation, the different streams of oxygen and
      hydrogen are produced and passed from the cell units 125 to
      respective rising columns 142,144. That is, the pressure of
      electrolyte on opposed sides of the PTFE membranes 116 is
      equalized. Thus, the gases cannot admix.<br>
      <br>
      The columns 142, 144 also are filled with the water/electrolyte,
      and as it is consumed at the electrode plates, replenishing supply
      of electrolyte is provided by way of circulation through the
      water/electrolyte conduits 134, 135. The circulation is caused by
      entrainment by the liberated gases, and by the circulatory
      inducing nature of the conduits and columns.<br>
      <br>
      The upper extent of the tank 140 forms two scrubbing towers 156,
      158, respectively for the collection of oxygen and hydrogen gases.
      The gases pass up respective columns 142, 144, and out from the
      columns via openings therein at a point within the interleaved
      baffles 146. The point where the gases exit the columns 142, 144
      is beneath the water level h, which serves to settle any turbulent
      flow and entrained electrolyte. The baffles 146 located above the
      level h scrub the gas of any entrained electrolyte, and the
      scrubbed gas then exits by respective gas outlet columns 148, 150
      and so to a gas receiver. The level h within the tank 140 can be
      regulated by any convenient means, including a float switch, and
      with the replenishing water supplied by the inlet pipe 152.<br>
      <br>
      The liberated gases will always separate from the
      water/electrolyte solution by virtue of the difference in
      densities. Because of the relative height of the respective set of
      baffles, and due to the density differential between the gases and
      the water/electrolyte, it is not possible for the liberated
      hydrogen and oxygen gases to mix. The presence of the full volume
      of water within the tank 140 maintains the cell plates in an
      immersed state, and further serves to absorb the shock of any
      internal detonations should they occur.<br>
      <br>
      In the event that a gas admixture is required, then, firstly, the
      two flow valves 136, 137 respectively located in the oxygen gas
      outlet conduit 132 and water/electrolyte inlet port 134 are
      closed. This blocks the outlet path for the oxygen gas and forces
      the inlet water/electrolyte to pass to the inlet conduit 134 via a
      one-way check valve 139 and pump 138. The water/electrolyte within
      the tank 140 is under pressure by virtue of its depth (volume),
      and the pump 138 operates to increase the pressure of
      water/electrolyte occurring about the anode cell plates 90, 98a to
      be at an increased pressure with respect to the water/electrolyte
      on the other side of the membrane 116. This pressure differential
      is sufficient to cause the oxygen gas to migrate through the
      membrane. Thus, admixed oxygen and hydrogen are liberated via the
      gas output conduit 133 and column 144. Since there is no return
      path for the water/electrolyte supplied by the pump 138, the
      pressure about the cell plates 90, 98a will increase further, and
      to a point where the difference is sufficient such that the
      water/electrolyte also can pass through the membrane 116.
      Typically, pressure differential in the range of 1.5-10 psi is
      required to allow passage of gas, and a pressure differential in
      the range of 10-40 psi for water/electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      While only three cell units 125 are shown, clearly any number,
      connected in series, can be implemented.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 17 shows another embodiment of a check valve and scrubber
      unit 160 for scrubbing liberated gas(es) before subsequent use.
      The unit 160 is filled with water, typically to a level being
      about half the full height of the unit. The level is regulated by
      a float switch 162. Water is supplied by means of the inlet 164. A
      sight column 166 is also provided, which serves to give a visual
      indication of the water level.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen and/or oxygen gases from the gas receiver, now under
      pressure, enter by an entry tube 168 having an opening 170 at the
      bottom end thereof. The gases travel down the tube 168 and out of
      the opening 170 to bubble upwardly on the inside of the inner
      column 172, which also is filled with the supplied water, thus
      performing a first scrubbing action to remove the sodium hydroxide
      electrolyte. The gas then enters another downwardly directed tube
      174 and out the opened end thereof, passing again through the
      water in the outer chamber 176 to be further scrubbed. The gas is
      to be stored under pressure within the space above the water level
      and be available for supply from the outlet 178.<br>
      <br>
      Admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases supplied from the output 178 to,
      for example, a welding tip (not shown) are in the correct
      stoichiometric proportions as a result of the electrolysis
      process, and ensures that, on combustion, a neutral flame is
      produced. The only products of the combustion process are heat and
      water vapour.<br>
      <br>
      If the gases are produced separately, two check-valve scrubbers
      160 are employed, the gases can then be mixed in a mixing chamber
      which also will produce the correct stoichiometric mix.<br>
      <br>
      If there is an explosion which backs-up through the outlet 178
      from a welding tip, it will be quenched by the water within the
      unit 160. The energy of the explosion will be absorbed by
      displacing the water in both the outer chamber 176 and the inner
      column 172. This displacement also cuts off the flow of inlet gas
      to the tube 168. In this way, there will be no possibility of the
      explosion further propagating towards an electrolysis cell bank
      producing the gases. The water within the unit 160 therefore acts
      both as a gas scrubber and also as a check valve.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 shows a welding tip 180 in cross-sectional detail. The
      hydrogen and oxygen gases are received along an inlet tube 182,
      passing by a needle valve 184 and into an expansion chamber 186.
      The expansion chamber 186 includes a flashback control apparatus,
      which comprises a cylindrically arranged flashback arrester 188,
      typically formed of 5 micrometer stainless steel meshing. In
      normal operation, the gases flow through the flashback arrester
      188 and to the outlet or nozzle 190, where combustion, or gas
      ionisation during the production of plasma, takes place.<br>
      <br>
      In the event that flashback occurs, the flashback arrester 188
      disallows further rearward passage of the flame, which cannot
      physically pass through openings as small as, for example, 5
      micrometers. This is coupled with a heat sink effect of the
      material from which the arrester 188 is constructed which operates
      to dissipate the energy of the flame, and thus, assist in
      extinguishing the flame.<br>
      <br>
      The use of hydrogen and/or oxygen in welding and cutting by
      electrolysis allows temperatures of the order of 6000 DEG C. to be
      achieved with the ability to produce gas on demand. No gas stored
      in bottle form is required. It is further possible to conduct fine
      flame welding with a high purity of gas, and also to be able to
      fuse ceramic materials.<br>
      <br>
      All of the following materials can be welded: carbon steel, cast
      iron, stainless steel, aluminium, brazing, silver soldering,
      copper and ceramics. The following ferrous and non-ferrous
      materials, due to the available production of pure hydrogen
      subsequently passed through a DC arc providing a hydrogen plasma
      stream (H2 .fwdarw.H1), can be readily cut: carbon steel, cast
      iron, stainless steel, aluminium, brazing and copper.<br>
      <br>
      The embodiment of the invention can provide a continuous supply of
      hydrogen gas at large flow rates. As such, it is well disposed to
      applications that consume large quantities of hydrogen. An example
      of one such process is the Plascon (TM) waste destruction process
      developed by the Australian CSIRO's Division of Manufacturing
      Technology. A summary of the Plascon process can be found in the
      CSIRO Journal "Ecos, Volume 68, Winter 1991".<br>
      <br>
      One application of the hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by the
      apparatus described above is in the thermal destruction of waste,
      and without the consumption of atmospheric oxygen. This procedure
      requires an on-demand supply of hydrogen and oxygen gas. The
      electrolysis apparatus described above can, in a scaled-up
      version, produce the requisite gas flow rates in order to combust
      waste gases on a commercial scale.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 19a and 19b show a configuration for a burner used in the
      destruction of such gaseous polluting emissions. FIG. 19a shows a
      cross-sectional view of a burner 200. The cross-sectional view
      along the mid-line is shown in FIG. 19b. The burner 200 has a
      combustion chamber 202 that is hemispherical in shape. The
      emissions, which may include a mixture of fumes containing
      hydrocarbons and other volatile pollutants as a waste product of
      industrial processes, are injected to the combustion chamber by an
      inlet path 206. There are two sources of an admixture of gaseous
      hydrogen and oxygen in stoichiometric proportions of 2:1, one each
      to an upper and lower quadrant of the combustion chamber 202.
      These gases are supplied by the two gas inlets 208 at points
      diametrically opposed on the sides of the burner 200. The mixture
      of hydrogen and oxygen and emissions formed within the combustion
      chamber 202 is ignited by means of a spark plug 210, or the like,
      and burns at a temperature of not less than 4000 DEG C., thus
      providing energy for molecular disassociation of all the
      pollutants into harmless compounds that can be discharged to the
      atmosphere. No atmospheric oxygen is consumed in the burning
      process. Complete combustion of the pollutants is aided by the
      "focusing" effect of the combustion chamber 202, which further
      improves the mixing of the gas streams.<br>
      <br>
      A thermocouple 212 measures the temperature within the silicone
      fiber refractory heat insulatory material 214 surrounding the
      combustion chamber 202. The cladding 216 applied to the burner 200
      is typically made of stainless steel.<br>
      <br>
      The burner configuration is formed by seven (only four are shown)
      concentrically arranged sets of nozzles 212, as is clearly shown
      in FIG. 19b. The nozzles 222 are directed to commonly intersect at
      the epicenter 204 of the combustion chamber 202. The cooling
      water, supplied by an inlet 218 and exiting by an outlet 220, is
      intended to maintain the nozzles 222 at a temperature of less than
      300 DEG C. Above 300 DEG C., hydroxy gas has the tendency to "back
      burn".<br>
      <br>
      The flow path of hydrogen and oxygen gases to the nozzles 222 from
      the inlets 208 has four 90 DEG (minimum) correction changes. This
      is intended to slow the linear momentum of the hydroxy flame in
      the event of a flashback, and so cause the flame to
      self-extinguish. This is particularly advantageous, as hydrogen
      burns at a rate of 3,600 m/s.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 20 shows in block diagram form a multi-modal cutting and
      welding apparatus 230. The apparatus receives a supply of DC power
      provided to an AC/DC converter 232. An AC supply is available for
      connection to AC electric arc welding apparatus 234, while the
      converted DC output voltage is provided for connection with a DC
      electric arc welding or cutting apparatus 236. The DC output
      supply voltage also is provided to an electrolysis cell unit 238
      for the generation of, in this case, separated hydrogen and oxygen
      gases. The hydrogen and oxygen gases both are provided to a
      hydroxy gas welding apparatus 240. The hydrogen (and oxygen for
      secondary injection) is made available for connection with plasma
      cutting apparatus 242. The hydrogen is passed through a DC arc to
      produce a plasma stream, and on a secondary injection, the oxygen
      is introduced into the plasma stream to produce an oxidizing
      plasma cutting effect which increases cutting efficiency.
      Thicknesses of up to 150 mm can be cut with this process. It
      should be noted that introducing oxygen downstream from the
      tungsten electrodes eliminates any oxidation of the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      The hydrogen gas alone also is provided to a MIG/TIG apparatus
      244, with the hydrogen in plasma form otherwise taking the place
      of the conventional inert gas. An AC or DC supply also is required
      to form the plasma.<br>
      <br>
      The converter 232 can be of any conventional design, typically
      having a multi-tapped transformer for the selection of appropriate
      rectified DC voltages. The electrolysis unit 238 can be of any of
      the embodiments previously described, and including the scrubber
      and check valve arrangements. The various cutting and welding
      apparatus 234, 236, 240, 242, 244, described also are
      conventional.<br>
      <br>
      The multi-modal apparatus 230 thus provides greater flexibility
      for the user in being able to select from the one unit the
      particular mode of cutting or welding required. Clearly, an
      apparatus comprised of any single or combination of
      welding/cutting apparatus is contemplated by the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 21 shows the multi-modal apparatus 230 in greater detail. As
      previously described, the electrolysis generator 238 separately
      produces gaseous hydrogen and oxygen and can also produce gaseous
      hydrogen and oxygen as an admixture.<br>
      <br>
      The power supply unit 232 comprises a multi-tapped transformer
      246. The reduced voltage is rectified by a bridge rectifier 247.
      The output rectified voltage is then connected by terminals 248 to
      the cell bank 238 containing 30 cells via a contactor 249 which is
      activated by a pressure switch 250. The switch 250 is, in turn,
      activated by a pressure sensor 251 which measures the gas pressure
      levels within the cell bank 238. Thus the contactor 249 is
      operable to remove the supply of power to the cell bank 238 on the
      establishment of an operational pressure. The contactor 249
      operates on demand with use of the gas.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, gas is produced as required, and typically for a total of 15
      liters at any one time. This 15 liters of gasses comprises 10
      liters of hydrogen and 5 liters of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The gases are provided from the scrubbing towers 156, 158 of the
      cell bank 238. As a closed loop system, the pressure in each tower
      will compensate for the other, thereby maintaining constant
      desired gas production levels. If, however, the water level is too
      high due to excessive use of either gas, the respective float
      switch 254, 255 in the respective tower 156, 158 will disallow gas
      flow by shutting the respective solenoid valve 256, 257.<br>
      <br>
      The float switches 254, 255 activate the solenoid valves 256, 257
      from an AC supply 258 tapped from the transformer 246. Other float
      switches located in the check valve and scrubber units 160 and the
      pressuring pump 138, also receive the AC supply 258.<br>
      <br>
      Two flow regulators 261, 262 are incorporated for the purpose of
      maintaining the desired back-pressure in the towers 156, 158 in
      order that the system will always have pressure even if the system
      is switched off and/or should the gases be exhausted through gas
      outlets, the gas outlets 263, 264 of the check valves/scrubber
      units 160 or by the welding tip 265.<br>
      <br>
      As opposed to separated generation in the cell bank 238, method of
      obtaining an admixture is once the hydrogen and oxygen have passed
      through the check valve and scrubber units 160, a selection valve
      266 allows the gases to mix and pass to the welding tip 265 where
      they are ignited and combusted to be used for the purposes of
      hydrogen/oxygen welding.<br>
      <br>
      If the hydrogen and oxygen gases are produced separately and
      required for hydrogen plasma cutting 242 and/or hydrogen plasma
      MIG/TIG welding 244, the selection valve 266 disallows the
      admixture of the two gases.<br>
      <br>
      The power supply unit 232 is a conventional arrangement of a
      multi-tapped transformer 246, including a reactor winding 267 and
      a range selector switch 268 which allows a selection of a chosen
      output voltage level. The generated secondary AC voltage also can
      be rectified by the rectifier 247 to produce a DC voltage output.
      All these output voltages pass another polarity selector 269
      allowing the user to select between an AC or DC output and to
      select the appropriate polarity for the DC output.<br>
      <br>
      The output 248 from the power supply unit 232 is shown connected
      to the electrolysis cell bank 238. However, the power supply also
      can connect with other forms of welding and cutting such as
      indicated in FIG. 20.<br>
      <br>
      Another output 271 supplies the necessary DC power for hydrogen
      plasma shroud MIG/TIG welding 244 and hydrogen plasma oxidising
      cutting applications 242. Yet another AC output 272 and DC output
      273 supply the necessary current to produce an arc for the MIG and
      TIG processes.<br>
      <br>
      Output voltages in the range of 20-60 Volts are required for the
      cell bank unit 238 and the electric arc units 234, 263, whereas
      the MIG/TIG welding 244 operates, typically, on an output voltage
      of 30-60 Volts (AC or DC). Plasma cutting and plasma shrouding, as
      provided by the plasma unit 242, typically requires the supply of
      120 Volts DC.<br>

      <b>FIELD:</b> chemistry. <br>
      <b>SUBSTANCE:</b> cellular device has complex structure composed
      of separating discs, cellular plates of first type ( anode ),
      cellular plates of second type ( cathode ) and separating
      membranes. Joining conductive rods pass through holes in cellular
      plates to perform selective electric connection. Water and
      electrolyte for submersion of cellular plates are supplied through
      inlets holes. Normally membranes isolate adjacent plates-cathodes
      and plates-anodes from mixing released gaseous oxygen and hydrogen
      and provide for flow of ion current. <br>
      <b>EFFECT:</b> enhanced efficiency of conversion of electric
      energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to the formation of hydrogen gas and
      oxygen gas from water, either as mixtures or as separated gases
      using an electrolysis process, and also relates to applications
      associated with the released gas.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiments of the invention, in particular, to an apparatus for
      the efficient production of these gases and to use these gases as
      a heat source in atomic welding or cutting, and to eliminate
      gaseous losses.<br>
      <br>
      Well known water electrolysis method in the presence of an
      electrolyte such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide
      (KOH) with the release of hydrogen and oxygen gases (H, O).<br>
      <br>
      The process involves application of the potential difference Vdc
      between two or more anode / cathode electrode pairs and supplying
      the minimum energy required to break bonds HO (ie<br>
      68.3 kcal / mol at normal conditions).<br>
      <br>
      Gases produced in the stoichiometric proportions for O: Hb 1:2
      respectively allocated at the anode (+) and the cathode (-).<br>

      Discussion of the experimental work in relation to the
      electrolysis process can be found in the "Hydrogen Energy, Part A,
      Hydrogen Economy Miami Energy Conference, Miami Beach, Florida,
      1974, edited by T. Nejat Veziroglu, Plenum Press".<br>
      <br>
      Particularly relevant is the article submitted J. O'M. Bockris on
      p.371-379, FC Lensen and FH Schubert on p. 425-439 and B. Pangborn

      <br>
      By and large, the quantity of gas dependent on a number of
      variables, including the type and concentration of the
      electrolytic solution, the surface area of ??the anode-cathode
      electrode pair, the electrolytic resistance (equal to the ion
      conductivity which is a function of temperature), the achievable
      current density and the potential difference between the anode and
      cathode.<br>
      <br>
      The total energy supplied shall be sufficient for the dissociation
      of water and ions formation of hydrogen and oxygen gases, but it
      is necessary to avoid coating (oxidation / reduction) metallic or
      non-metallic conductive materials making up the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      One can refer to the prior Australian Patent N 487062 website Yull
      Brown, which discloses construction of an electrolytic cell for
      producing hydrogen and oxygen as needed, together with a safety
      device to prevent pressurisation of evolved gases.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 2 Brown patent shows a plurality of electrodes (20a, 20b)
      electrically connected in series between two terminals (22) to
      which a potential difference is applied.<br>
      <br>
      Box (20) provides a flow rate of gas at the outlet, and when this
      capacity is insufficient for a particular application, then a
      larger number of individual cellular devices that are electrically
      connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      The end result is a great design that you want to maintain.<br>
      <br>
      Also it is not possible to achieve the required high volumetric
      gas flow velocities (about 10,000 l / h) from the previously known
      devices without the use of expensive and sophisticated equipment,
      but even then the equipment has a low conversion efficiency of
      electrical energy to produce hydrogen and oxygen gases.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the commercial application of such devices High resolution
      is not economically feasible.<br>
      <br>
      Mixed gas of hydrogen and oxygen (or hydroxy gas) are used as heat
      source in the combustion in the stream, such as furnaces.<br>
      <br>
      For cutting atomic hydrogen is only one and often - for atomic
      welding, although disclosed in Brown apparatus performs welding in
      the presence of atomic hydrogen and oxygen mixed.<br>
      <br>
      Modern industrial practice clearly confirmed that the presence of
      oxygen in the plasma arc causes intense oxidation of tungsten
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      One of the problems that occur during the use of these
      applications is the need to combine the electrical switchgear to
      transform the voltage to a suitable level for a block of
      electrolytic cells (i.e. by step-down transformers).<br>
      <br>
      Completed final design is inefficient, from an electrical point of
      view, and cumbersome and can be expensive if fine adjustment of
      voltage and current (and hence, the regulation of the gas flow).<br>
      <br>
      Combustible gaseous hydrogen and oxygen mixed into a single
      stream, burn at very high temperatures, typically of the order
      6000C. Hydrogen / oxygen welding devices are well known and
      consist of a welding tip or hand portion connected to the dual gas
      hose to separate feeding of oxygen and hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      There are four other known types of welding apparatus and methods
      of their application - it is the oxygen-acetylene welding,
      electric arc welding system MIG (metal inert gas) / TIG
      (tungsten-inert gas) and plasma cutting.<br>
      <br>
      It is estimated that in use in Australia are more than 100,000
      oxy-acetylene units.<br>
      <br>
      Of these, approximately 70% are used primarily for cutting, and
      the remaining are used as heat sources for welding fusing sheet
      metal, brazing, silver soldering, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Usually oxygen-acetylene welding metal settings can thickness from
      0.5 to 2 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, metal can be cut up to 140 mm thick, but only if the
      steel contains a high percentage of iron.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for this is that the iron and oxygen required to
      sustain the process of oxidation, which causes the effect of
      cutting.<br>
      <br>
      Acetylene gas creates an initial temperature to start the
      oxidation reaction is usually equal to 850C. Oxy-acetylene
      cylinders require installation of gases (oxygen and acetylene),
      and hence the cylinders shall be purchased or rented, and then
      constantly maintained in good condition and using refilled.<br>
      <br>
      Arc welding is a method used for welding metals more than 1.5 mm
      thick.<br>
      <br>
      The principle is that the hand piece is supplied with a consumable
      electrode and the working electrode forms the other part.<br>
      <br>
      Between the electrodes creates a potential difference of AC or DC,
      thereby causing arcing that manual portion is brought into an area
      close to the working part.<br>
      <br>
      The arc can be used for melting or welding together of metal
      parts.<br>
      <br>
      Systems MIG (metal inert gas) based on the continuous wire feed
      system.<br>
      <br>
      In one known construction the consumable wire is surrounded by
      argon gas (or plasma), which is usually fed from a cylinder.<br>
      <br>
      TIG (tungsten inert-gas) systems, on the other hand, require a
      weld wire that has to be entered manually into the welding area.<br>
      <br>
      MIG / TIG-welding of the metal thickness can be from 1 to 20 mm, a
      typical stainless steel, aluminum, mild steel, etc.<br>
      <br>
      References concerning plasma MIG-process can be made to the text
      of "The Science and Practice of Welding, v.2, AC Davies, Cambridge
      University Press ".<br>
      <br>
      Plasma cutting is a cutting manner by means of compressed air
      (comprising predominantly nitrogen) to a DC electric arc, thereby
      creating a very high temperature (about 15000C), and thus taking
      the electrons from the nitrogen nucleus to form a high temperature
      plasma.<br>
      <br>
      This plasma can be used for cutting iron and
      zhelezonesoderzhaschih materials such as mild steel, stainless
      steel, copper, brass and aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      Applied plasma cutters can cut the material to 25 mm thickness and
      have the advantage that they require no use of a gas cylinder, and
      the normal air.<br>
      <br>
      Reference to a plasma cutting can be done on the text "Gas
      Shielded Arc Welding, NJ Henthorne and RW Chadwick Newnes
      Technical Books".<br>
      <br>
      As follows from the discussion of the prior art, no one unit or
      system is unable to perform all welding and cutting functions, and
      typically one of the systems described above must be given
      preference to any other particular operation.<br>
      <br>
      This in turn requires that workers on metal or other metal
      industries industrial manufacturers bought and maintained in many
      different types of welding machines, in order to be able to do any
      work required.<br>
      <br>
      Costs associated with the purchase of gas in cylinders for
      replacement, are also very high.<br>
      <br>
      A preferred aim of the present invention is to provide a
      construction whereby the hydrogen and oxygen gases can be produced
      electrolytically, which lacks one or more of the aforementioned
      disadvantages.<br>
      <br>
      In this sense, the electrolytic apparatus is compact and offers
      greater efficiencies than the prior art devices, the gas at
      comparable costs.<br>
      <br>
      Another preferred object of the present invention is to provide an
      improved structure of an electrolytic cell for use in the
      production of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolytic cell can be used in a hydrogen / oxygen hydrogen
      welding or plasma cutting.<br>
      <br>
      Other applications may include industrial processes that require
      sources from burning fuels such as furnaces for calcining and
      burning intractable wastes.<br>
      <br>
      Another preferred object of the present invention is to provide an
      electrolytic cell structure which provides a selectable division
      or mixing gases of hydrogen and oxygen in a single gas stream.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention is further directed to a predominantly
      single welder that can satisfy all user requirements for welding
      or cutting.<br>
      <br>
      The advantage is that the cylinders do not require the presence of
      hydrogen or oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Cylinders is also not required by any other gas such as argon, in
      the systems of MIG / TIG immersion in an inert gas.<br>
      <br>
      Another preferred object of the present invention is to provide a
      damper for a reverse flame hydrogen / oxygen welding or cutting
      tip hydrogen plasma.<br>

      </b><b>Detailed description of the invention.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Block electrolytic cell embodying the invention consists of
      several electrolytic honeycomb hexagonal plates 10, one of which
      is shown in plan in FIG. 1a and in side view in FIG. 1b.<br>
      <br>
      Each plate 10 has three slots 12, each of which is located on the
      end sides of alternating plate 10.<br>
      <br>
      Other side of each mesh plate 10 provided with a conductive bridge
      or flange 14.<br>
      <br>
      Typically twenty individual cell plates 10 are combined into one
      set to form a completed cell 16 is shown in side view in FIG.<br>
      <br>
      2. Total number of plates can vary in accordance with the desired
      surface area and is therefore also a function of the diameter of
      the wafer.<br>
      <br>
      Combining a set of adjacent mesh plates 10 is carried out in a
      different order so that the conductive bridges 12 of adjacent
      plates extending in opposite directions and with a relative
      rotation of 60.<br>
      <br>
      Said rotation is due to the fact that adjacent the plate 10 must
      be of opposite polarity.<br>
      <br>
      The conductive bridges 14 are long enough to pass through a
      corresponding slot 12 in the adjacent plate 10, without contact
      with this plate and so as to contact with the next successive
      plate, forming a conductive path between each alternate plate.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, filled cellular structure 16 has three positive and three
      negative output output, although FIG. 2 shows only two positive
      and one negative output conclusion.<br>
      <br>
      Cellular set 16 surrounded by an insulating housing 18 (shown in
      cracked form).<br>
      <br>
      Mesh plate 10 shown in FIG. 1a, 1b and 2 are suitable for forming
      a parallel electrical connection with each adjacent two cell
      plates 10 forming either the anode or cathode.<br>
      <br>
      Parallel folded flat cell plates are described in Australian
      Patent N 487062.<br>
      <br>
      It set of twenty cell plates typically requires a potential
      difference between the electrodes of each individual mesh plates
      in the range of 1.55-2.0 V for release of gaseous hydrogen and
      oxygen from water containing an electrolyte of typically 15%
      sodium hydroxide solution.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 depicts a vertical sectional seven completed honeycomb 16
      sets collected in a hexagonal matrix and enclosed by the housing
      20 of steel, thus forming a block of electrolytic cells 25.<br>
      <br>
      Cellular sets 16 are isolated from the steel hull 20 nylon
      insulating sleeve 22.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical interconnection of individual cellular sets 16 are not
      shown, but usually the cells are interconnected by their
      respective positive (+) and negative (-) lead by straps to form a
      serial connection.<br>
      <br>
      Sometimes it happens that make parallel interconnect cellular sets
      16.<br>
      <br>
      Real electrical interconnection will depend on the number of
      individual cellular plates 10, set up each cellular 16, the
      applied voltage and current that would flow from the source.<br>
      <br>
      During the electrolysis reaction when released gaseous hydrogen
      and oxygen, water is consumed. 1 liter of water produces 1860
      liters of mixed oxygen and hydrogen at standard conditions (STP)
      per volume proportions indicated above.<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated construction, water is supplied continuously
      through the inlet 24.<br>
      <br>
      Nylon 18 separating adjacent sets contributes toward upward rising
      released gases to be collected via a gas outlet 26 located at the
      top of the electrolytic cell unit 25.<br>
      <br>
      Due to volume expansion ratio of 1: 1860 released gases are
      self-contracting when they emerge from the outlet 26 into the
      connection pipe (not shown), which has a much narrower
      cross-section than the unit cell.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 4 is a vertical sectional view showing the mechanical design
      of the electrolytic cell according to another embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      Main cellular device 30 is formed corresponding pair of
      overlapping halves of the electrodes 32, 34, arranged in a similar
      overlapping ridges.<br>
      <br>
      Each electrode is formed by conductive holders 36, 38 are
      typically made of resin-bonded graphite, mild steel or conductive
      polymers, from waste holder eleven plates 40, 42 in the form of
      fingers, also made from graphite, steel or conductive polymer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 5 is a perspective view of one of the electrodes 32 in the
      holder 36 and the plate 40 have a rectangular shape.<br>
      <br>
      Optionally, the electrodes have a specified shape, but rather can
      take on many other forms, one example of which will be described.<br>
      <br>
      A common requirement for all such designs is that the plates are
      parallel and are connected through a common structural member
      disposed orthogonally plates.<br>
      <br>
      Each pair of electrodes 32, 34 are located in an alternating
      structure so that the respective outermost plates 40a, 42a are
      offset by approximately half the total length of each electrode
      32, 34.<br>
      <br>
      Corresponding average plate reference numerals 40b and 42b.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 6 illustrates a folded structure in a simplified form.<br>
      <br>
      Every sixth plate is located in a space formed by the first and
      eleventh plate adjacent respective opposite electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      Referring again to FIGS. 4, which depicts two-filled cellular
      device 30 and the respective adjacent portion of the subsequent
      cellular devices.<br>
      <br>
      Total cellular units defined by the source of DC voltage, since
      the beginning of the electrolytic process requires a minimum anode
      / cathode voltage, and each adjacent honeycomb unit is
      electrically connected in serial parallel spaced plates 40, 42.<br>
      <br>
      When the process of the electric cell 30 are immersed and an
      electrolyte, a constant voltage is applied between the end plates
      40c and 42c, causing elemental ionic currents (some of which are
      represented by dashed arrows) to flow between the adjacent plates
      40, 42 and the total current - along the respective holders 36, 38
      and plates 40, 42 (shown by solid arrows).<br>
      <br>
      In each middle plate currents caused by different directions.<br>
      <br>
      For example, a constant current flows from one end mesh plate 42a
      through the electrolyte flowing through the middle plate 40b, and
      again through the electrolyte to the next terminal mesh plate 42a.<br>
      <br>
      This process causes the accumulation of the positive charge of the
      grid on one side of the middle plate 40b, and a negative charge -
      on the other side.<br>
      <br>
      Leakage of ionic current flow is accompanied by dissociation of
      water molecules, so that oxygen and hydrogen gases are produced
      respectively on the surfaces of the anode plates and cathode
      plates.<br>
      <br>
      Surfaces of the cathode plates are those plates, which are
      directed ionic currents.<br>
      <br>
      The reverse is true for surfaces of anode plates.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage applied to the outermost plates 40c, is divided
      equally between the constituent devices honeycomb 30, and as the
      applied voltage is divided equally between the respective
      outermost plates and the middle plate 40a and 42b, 40b and 42a.<br>
      <br>
      The achievable current density is limited, in particular, the
      effective electrical resistance of the electrolytic solution.<br>
      <br>
      The smaller the distance between the adjacent plates 40, 42, the
      less resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Overlapping design of electrodes 32, 34 means that there is a
      large surface area per unit volume, and there is a minimum
      distance between the electrodes, plates throughout the device.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the resistance of the electrolyte is kept low, hence
      efficiency of the conversion of electric energy into hydrogen and
      oxygen production than in previous designs.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the specific design shown is not necessary to isolate each
      individual honeycomb unit 30 from the same neighboring devices.<br>
      <br>
      Ionic current flows naturally along the path of least resistance,
      hence short-circuit between a honeycomb units 30, but having a
      greater resistance, are avoided.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, a large number of cells can be combined into an
      extended linear structure and allowed direct connection to the
      source of the rectified voltage, thus avoiding the need to
      electrically connect a group of cellular devices through a
      contraction, as was done in previous developments.<br>
      <br>
      Each single honeycomb unit 30 satisfies the conditions from the
      viewpoint of operability supply voltage, the surface area of ??the
      plates and so on, for successful electrolysis of water, and
      thereby operates essentially independently of the adjacent
      honeycomb units 30.<br>
      <br>
      Testing has established that for a temperature range of from 90 to
      50C at a DC voltage in the range 1.47-1.56, applied to one
      honeycomb unit 30 (ie, one half of the entire electrode 32 or 34)
      requires a minimum (and the optimum) anode current density 0.034 A
      / cm for receiving gas flow of about 340-300 l / h per 1 kW • h,
      respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery that the minimum plate surface area corresponds to
      the optimum gas flow rate means that the total volume occupied can
      be kept to a minimum.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the rectified mains voltage is 240 V (rms) results in
      an average nominal DC voltage 215 V, therefore, for direct
      connection to the device through a rectifier (ie, without the
      required step-down transformer) is required total of 140 cells.<br>
      <br>
      It is particularly advantageous that the equipment is not required
      for voltage conversion in terms of equipment cost, technical
      simplicity and the avoidance of losses.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7a shows a side view of a torn private cellular device 50, in
      accordance with another embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      Honeycomb apparatus 50 is similar in configuration to the
      apparatus shown in FIG. 4 except for the number and shape of the
      overlapping protruding elements and electrode plates form.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 7b shows a rear view of the cellular device 50 and, in
      particular, the most recent card 52c.<br>
      <br>
      Plate electrodes 52, 54 have the shape of a hexagon.<br>
      <br>
      Through each plate 52, 54 are six connecting rods 56, 58, one near
      each vertex.<br>
      <br>
      Each of the rods 56 alternating represents a common positive
      conductor and the other set of alternating rods 58 are negative
      conductors.<br>
      <br>
      Each adjacent plate 52 or 54 is electrically connected to the
      positive conductors or the negative conductors.<br>
      <br>
      The intermediate inserts 60 are inserted between the adjacent
      plates 52, 54 for electrical isolation and for the formation of a
      space in which the water and electrolyte circulates.<br>
      <br>
      Connecting each conductor 56, 58 to the respective plate electrode
      52, 54 is typically performed by screwing a nut or tight fitting.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for connecting each plate 52, 54 common to the three
      conductors 56, 58 is to achieve a uniform current distribution
      over the entire surface area of ??the plates 52, 54.<br>
      <br>
      As can be seen in FIG. 7b, the positive conductor 56 extends
      outwardly from one end of the apparatus for serial connection with
      the other set of cells, as well as projecting three negative
      conductor 58 - the other end of.<br>
      <br>
      All unconnected ends of the conductors are closed nonconductive
      plugs 62.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 8 shows a stylized form of three cellular devices 50,
      electrically connected in series (connected in the longitudinal
      direction), and in particular - the passage of the protruding
      wires 56, 58.<br>
      <br>
      Fusing device 50 are placed in an insulating tube 64, typically
      constructed of polyvinylchloride (PVC), which has access to water
      immersion exchange plates 52, 54 and for the removal of gases
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 9 shows a sequence of electrical connection of several
      cellular devices 50 connected directly to the output DC converter
      AC to DC (such as a simple rectifier using the diode bridge)
      without the use of step-down transformer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 10a shows a rear view of the mechanical construction of the
      seven devices (denoted AG), each consisting of three
      series-connected cellular devices 50 (as shown in FIG. 8), forming
      a general honeycomb structure 70.<br>
      <br>
      Fusing device 50 are in a steel cylinder 72 containing the water
      and electrolyte required for the production of hydrogen and oxygen
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      Each group (AG) of the three cellular devices 50 connected via a
      first group of steel connecting couplers 74 on one end and a
      second group of steel connecting ties 76 (not shown) at the other
      end to form bridges between groups.<br>
      <br>
      Although in FIG. 10a shows only the first coupler 74, both sets of
      ties more clearly shown in FIG. 10b, which is an expanded side
      view of the groups AG.<br>
      <br>
      PVC tubes 64 shown in FIG. 10a, insulate adjacent groups to avoid
      the effect of short-circuiting therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      The mesh structure 70 is a very compact, as compared with the
      known construction Brown occupies only one third of its volume
      with a comparable gas volumetric flow, while also reducing about
      the same total weight ratio.<br>
      <br>
      Feed water for the electrolytic process is carried out through the
      inlet opening 78 at the bottom raspolozhennoe cylinder 72, with a
      yield of the product gas through an outlet opening 80 at the top
      raspolozhennoe cylinder 72.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical connection to the conclusion that a DC source via a set
      of cells of said structure and connecting to a central terminal 82
      on the lower side of the cell A and the center pin 84 to the upper
      side of the cell G respectively.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11a and 12a depict a rear view of a further embodiment of the
      cellular inserts 90, 98 of first and second type.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 11b and 12b are partial cross-sectional views along the
      respective mid-lines as shown in FIG.<br>
      <br>
      General numbering used where reference is required.<br>
      <br>
      Plates 90, 98 can function as the anode or the (+) or a cathode
      (-), as will become apparent hereinafter.<br>
      <br>
      Each electrode plate 92 comprises a disc which has holes
      (perforations) 96 hexagonal shape.<br>
      <br>
      Disk 92 is made from steel or graphite or tarred conductive
      polymeric material.<br>
      <br>
      Disc 92 is an annular rim or sleeve 94.<br>
      <br>
      The function of the holes 96 is to maximize the surface area of
      ??the electrode disc 92 and minimize the weight of the solid
      structures 45%.<br>
      <br>
      For example, for a 280 mm diameter disc plate thickness must be 1
      mm in order that the current density (which ranges from 100 cm
      90A/2650 A/2940 smanoda or cathode) was optimal.<br>
      <br>
      If the diameter of the plate is increased, which accordingly
      increases the surface area, it is necessary to increase the
      thickness of the plate, in order to maintain the same conductivity
      for the desired current density.<br>
      <br>
      Between the planes of the hexagonal holes (perforations) in the
      disc thickness 1 mm spacing of 2 mm, and the holes are spaced 1 mm
      from the next adjacent hole in order to maintain the same total
      surface area as that of the prior art, and optimizing the current
      density .<br>
      <br>
      Between adjacent hexagonal holes required distance of 1 mm (plane
      to plane) because shorter distance leads to thermal (resistive)
      losses, and greater distance will increase the total weight of the
      plate.<br>
      <br>
      An annular ring 94 is made of PVC material and combines a
      plurality of holes 100, 102 equally spaced axes.<br>
      <br>
      The openings intended for the passage of connecting axles, present
      in the assembled structure of plates 90 and 98 forming the common
      conductor for the respective anode and cathode plates, as well as
      the design of the device shown in FIG. 7a and 7b.<br>
      <br>
      The following two upper openings 104, 106, respectively, each
      support pipe for flowing hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The openings 108, 110 in the lower portion of the annular rim 94
      are intended to intake water and electrolyte to the respective
      cell plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 13 is an enlarged view of the mesh plate 90 of FIG. 11a.<br>
      <br>
      Hole 104 is connected to the hexagonal holes 96 within the annular
      inner rim 94 through the channel 112.<br>
      <br>
      A similar construction is to place another hole 106 and holes 108,
      110, water feed / electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      In the case where the released hydrogen and oxygen gases must be
      kept separate (i.e. not to be obtained as a mixture), it is
      necessary to separate them on delivery.<br>
      <br>
      In previous designs is achieved by the use of diaphragms that
      block the passage of gases and effectively isolate the water /
      electrolyte on each side of the diaphragm.<br>
      <br>
      Ion transfer thus is facilitated by the ion permeability of the
      diaphragm material (i.e. the water path - diaphragm - water).<br>
      <br>
      This leads to an increase in ionic resistance, and hence reduced
      efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      BACKGROUND Patent N 487062 describes another construction (see
      FIG. 6 therein), which uses a magnet for the separation of gases.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 14 shows, in the form of a torn assembled structure of the
      four cellular plates, which constitute its two alternate (anode)
      cell plates 90 and two (cathode cell plates 98.<br>
      <br>
      Two extreme disk assembled structure of cellular plates complete
      the formation of one cellular device 125.<br>
      <br>
      Between each adjacent plates 90, 98 are located spacers 116 of
      polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).<br>
      <br>
      Although not shown in FIG. 14, the honeycomb unit contains a
      separate gas pipes for hydrogen and oxygen respectively, which
      pass through the assembled structure of cellular plates through
      holes 106, 104 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, the gas supply pipes are arranged for the supply of
      water / electrolyte, respectively passing through holes 108, 110
      in the lower portions of the respective plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      Shown, only two pairs of anode / cathode cell plates.<br>
      <br>
      Number of plates in such a device a cellular 125 may be
      significantly increased.<br>
      <br>
      Also not shown conductive connection axis that electrically
      connect the common striped cell plates.<br>
      <br>
      The reason for producing a large diameter hole in one plate and a
      mesh manufacturing smaller diameter holes in the next adjacent
      plate mesh is that the connecting axis will pass through the holes
      of a larger diameter, without an electrical connection (i.e.
      insulated with PVC tubing) while only forming electrical
      connection between the alternating (general) cell plates.<br>
      <br>
      Honeycomb apparatus 125 shown in FIG. 14 in the form of torn.<br>
      <br>
      The assembled all elements are assembled to obtain intimate
      contact.<br>
      <br>
      Mechanical fastening is achieved by using one of two binders
      (adhesives) such as (a) "PUR-FECT LOK" (TM) 34-9002, which is a
      urethane reactive hot melt adhesive having a main component
      Methylene Bispheny / Dirsocynate (MDI) and b ) "MY-T-BOND" (TM)
      which is a binder based on PVC solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Both binding substances are resistant to sodium hydroxide (a 20%
      availability in the electrolyte).<br>
      <br>
      In this case, the water / electrolyte are only in areas not
      occupied by the annular rim 94 mesh plate.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, by the water / electrolyte only a path from the inlet
      through the lower channels 118, 122 which serves to remove gases
      only by way of the upper channels 112, 120.<br>
      <br>
      In a system constructed and tested by the inventor, the thickness
      of the mesh plate 90, 98 is equal to 1 mm (2 mm from the edge of
      the annular rim 94 PVC), and the diameter - 336 mm.<br>
      <br>
      Honeycomb device 125 is separated from the next cell by separating
      the insulating disc 114 PVC. Separating disk 114 is also available
      at the beginning and end of the whole cellular bank.<br>
      <br>
      If you do not want to manage the division of released gases, the
      PTFE membrane 116 missing.<br>
      <br>
      PTFE membrane 116 is fibrous and has a lumen size of from 0.2 to
      1.0 microns.<br>
      <br>
      A suitable type is the Catalogue Code J., delivered Tokio Roshi
      International Inc.(Advantec).<br>
      <br>
      The water / electrolyte fills the interstices and ionic current
      flows only via the water - there is no compensation for the flow
      of ions through the PTFE material itself. This reduces the
      resistance to ion flow.<br>
      PTFE material also has a "point of foaming", which is a function
      of pressure, thus controlling the relative pressure on either side
      of the dividing sheets of PTFE, the gases may be "pushed through"
      through the holes to form a mixture or, alternatively, to maintain
      separation.<br>
      <br>
      Other advantages of this design are significantly lower
      construction costs, improved efficiency and significantly greater
      fault tolerance.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15a is stylized and ripped a schematic view of a linear
      connection of three series-connected cellular devices 125.<br>
      <br>
      For clarity, only six axes connecting 126-131.<br>
      <br>
      Axles 126-131 pass through corresponding axial holes 102, 100 in
      different cellular plates 90, 98 in the folded structure.<br>
      <br>
      Also contains the polarity power supply connected to each terminal
      uncovered axes, which connects DC power source.<br>
      <br>
      126-131 axis does not pass along the entire length of three units
      of 125 mesh.<br>
      <br>
      This design is similar to the structure shown in FIG. 7a and 8.<br>
      <br>
      One third of the total voltage DC source is present on each pair
      (anode-cathode) cellular plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      Further, the gas conduits are shown as 132, 133, respectively, for
      hydrogen and oxygen, which pass through holes 104, 106 in the cell
      plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, conduits 134 are shown, 135 for water / electrolyte,
      passing through the openings 108, 110 in the cell plates.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. Separately 15b shows how the relative potential difference in
      average honeycomb block 125.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the plate electrode 90a is functioning as a cathode (i.e.
      relatively more negative) to generate hydrogen, and a plate
      electrode 98a is functioning as an anode (i.e. relatively more
      positive) for the production of oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      This occurs for each alternating cellular device.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 15b arrows indicate the chain of electron and ion currents.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 15c is an electrical equivalent circuit of FIG. 15b, where
      the resistive elements represent the ionic resistance between
      adjacent anode-cathode plates.<br>
      <br>
      Thus it can be seen that the honeycomb units are connected in
      series.<br>
      <br>
      Due to changes in the function of cellular plates 90a and 98a on
      each of the additional gases are released, hence the respective
      channels 112 are connected to the opposite gas conduits 132, 133.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, this may be achieved by simple permutation of the
      plates 90, 98.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 16 shows three cellular device 125 shown in FIG. 15a,
      connected to a gas collection device.<br>
      <br>
      The honeycomb unit 125 is located within the reservoir 140 which
      is filled with water / electrolyte to the level indicated by h.<br>
      <br>
      Water consumed in the electrolytic process, and new feed it
      through the inlet 152.<br>
      <br>
      Level of water / electrolyte h can be seen through the transparent
      glass 154.<br>
      <br>
      In normal operation, produced a variety of streams of hydrogen and
      oxygen and tested by cellular device 125 to the corresponding
      towering columns 142, 144.<br>
      <br>
      That is, the pressure of electrolyte on opposed sides of the PTFE
      membranes 116 are aligned so that the gases can not be mixed.<br>
      <br>
      Columns 142, 144 are also filled with water / electrolyte, and a
      flow rate at the electrode plates is performed again by feeding
      the electrolyte circulating through the ducts 134, 135 for water /
      electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      Circulation caused by entrainment of released gases and circulates
      konstruktsiey pipes and columns.<br>
      <br>
      The upper part of the tank 140 forms two gazoochistitelnye columns
      156, 158, respectively, for collecting hydrogen and oxygen gases.<br>
      <br>
      Gases rise up the corresponding columns 142, 144 and exits the
      column through hole at a point within the overlapping baffles 146.<br>
      <br>
      Eta point where the gases exit the columns 142, 144 is below the
      water level h, which serves to eliminate any turbulent flow and
      entrained electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      Partitions 146 located above the level h, purified gas from any
      gas entrained electrolyte, and the purified gas is then eviscerate
      the column via respective outlet 148, 150 and, thus, - the gas in
      the receiver.<br>
      <br>
      The level h within the tank 140 may be adjusted by any of
      conventional methods using a float switch to the newly incoming
      water supplied through inlet pipe 152.<br>
      <br>
      Released gases will always be separated from the solution of water
      / electrolyte due to the difference in densities.<br>
      <br>
      Because of the relative height of the respective set of baffles,
      and due to the difference in density between water and gas /
      electrolyte mixing impossible liberated hydrogen and oxygen gases.<br>
      <br>
      Having full volume of water within the tank 140 maintains the cell
      plates in a submerged condition and also serves to absorb the
      shock of any internal detonations when they occur.<br>
      <br>
      In the case where the mixed gas is required, primarily closed two
      valves 136, 137 respectively located in the conduit 132 to exit
      and the oxygen gas inlet 134 for water / electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      IT'S inhibits the output path for the gaseous oxygen and causes
      the intake water / electrolyte held in the inlet conduit 134
      through unidirectional retaining valve 139 and pump 138.<br>
      <br>
      The water / electrolyte within the tank 140 is pressurized due to
      its depth (volume), and the pump 138 operates to increase the
      pressure of water / electrolyte around the anode cell plates 90,
      98a, which leads to an increased pressure relative to the pressure
      of water / electrolyte on the other side of the membrane 116.<br>
      <br>
      Eta is a sufficient pressure difference to cause movement of the
      oxygen gas through the membrane, thus the mixed oxygen and
      hydrogen are liberated via the gas output conduit 133 and column
      144.<br>
      <br>
      Since there is no return path for the feed pump 138 water /
      electrolyte, the pressure about the cell plates 90, 98a will
      continue to increase to a value at which the difference is
      sufficient to keep the water / electrolyte also can pass through
      the membrane 116.<br>
      <br>
      Usually it takes the pressure difference between 1.5-10 lbs /
      inch, to permit passage of a gas pressure difference and in the
      range of 10-40 lbs / dyuymdlya water / electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      Although depicted only three honeycomb unit 125, it is clear that
      there may be any number of them are formed connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 17 depicts another embodiment of a valve locking device 160
      and gazoochischayuschego purification released (s), gas (es)
      before subsequent use.<br>
      <br>
      Device 160 is typically filled with water to a level of half of
      the total height of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The level is controlled by a float switch 162.<br>
      <br>
      Water is supplied through inlet 164.<br>
      <br>
      Built as a transparent tube 166, which serves as a visual
      indication of water level.<br>
      <br>
      Gaseous hydrogen and / or oxygen from the pressurized gas receiver
      receives at input conduit 168 having a bottom exit 170.<br>
      <br>
      The gases pass down the tube 168 and out of holes 170, in the form
      of bubbles rising up inside the inner column 172, which is also
      filed filled with water, thereby performing an initial
      purification to remove the sodium hydroxide electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      The gas then flows into the down tube 174, and emerges from the
      open end thereof, passing again through the water in the outer
      chamber 176 to further purify, and so is the pressure in the
      volume above the water level for subsequent exit from outlet 176.<br>
      <br>
      Mixed gas of hydrogen and oxygen exiting from the outlet 178, for
      example, the welding tip (not shown) in the correct stoichiometric
      proportions as a result of the electrolytic process, and can be
      sure that the neutral formed by the combustion flame. The products
      of combustion are only heat and water vapor.<br>
      <br>
      If the gases are produced separately, the scrubbers 160 using the
      two valves lock, then the gases are mixed in a mixing chamber
      which also will produce the correct stoichiometric mix ratio.<br>
      <br>
      If there is an explosion that "back" through the outlet 178 of the
      welding tip, it must be repaid with water in the device 160, and
      the explosion energy is absorbed by water displacement and 176 in
      the outer chamber and the inner column 172, and also for the
      offset cuts incoming gas flow into the tube 168.<br>
      <br>
      In this case there should be the possibility of explosion
      propagation in the direction of the electrolytic cell bank
      producing the gases. Water device 160 acts so as cleaning gas and
      the valve stopper.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 18 shows a welding tip 180 in cross section.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen and oxygen gas coming from the inlet tube 182, needle
      valve 184 are omitted, and thus, enter into the expansion chamber
      186.<br>
      <br>
      Expansion chamber 186 comprises a control device reverse flame
      quenching, which consists of a cylindrical absorber 188 Reverse
      flame are usually made of a 5-micron stainless steel mesh.<br>
      <br>
      During normal operation gas flows through the damper 188 and the
      reverse flame so - to the outlet or nozzle 190, where combustion
      occurs or during ionization of the gas plasma formation.<br>
      <br>
      If the reverse flame damper 188 reverse flame prevents further
      spread of the flame in the opposite direction, which can not
      physically pass through the holes of such a small size as, say, 5
      microns.<br>
      <br>
      This is related to the heat absorption effect of the material of
      the absorber 188 is made, which leads to dissipation of the flame,
      and that, consequently, contributes to the destruction of the
      flame.<br>
      <br>
      The use of hydrogen and / or oxygen in welding and cutting by
      electrolysis allows temperatures of the order of 6000C to achieve
      the ability to produce a desired amount of gas.<br>
      <br>
      Not required gas stored in the tank.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to carry out high-quality welding flame with
      high purity gas, and can be melted ceramic materials.<br>
      <br>
      All of the following materials can be welded carbon steel, cast
      iron, stainless steel, aluminum, brass, silver solder, copper and
      ceramic.<br>
      <br>
      Following iron and <i>zhelezonesoderzhaschie</i> materials due to
      the possibility of production of pure hydrogen flowing through the
      DC electric arc, forming a stream of hydrogen plasma (H ---&gt;
      H), can be easily cut carbon steel, cast iron, stainless steel,
      aluminum, brass and copper.<br>
      <br>
      Embodiment of the invention can provide a continuous supply of
      hydrogen gas at a greater rate.<br>
      <br>
      If so, then the invention is well suited for applications that
      consume large amounts of hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      An example of such a process is Plascon (TM) process waste
      decomposition developed Australian CSIBO's Division of
      Manufacturing Technology.<br>
      <br>
      Overview-Plascon process can be found in CS1BO Journal "Ecos,
      Volume 68, Winter 1991."<br>
      <br>
      One application of hydrogen and oxygen gases produced by the
      above-described apparatus, the waste is thermally decomposed
      without burning atmospheric oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      This procedure requires on-demand supply of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      The above-described electrolysis apparatus may produce an increase
      in the size of the desired gas flow, in order to burn the waste
      gas in a commercial scale.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 19a and 19b show the configuration of the furnace used for
      the decomposition of gaseous pollutant emissions.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 19a shows a cross section of the furnace 200.<br>
      <br>
      The cross section along the center line shown in FIG. 19b.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace 200 is combustion chamber 202 of the hemispherical
      shape.<br>
      <br>
      Separation, which may comprise a mixture of fumes containing
      hydrocarbons and other volatile contaminants in a waste product
      from industrial processes, are injected into the combustion
      chamber through an inlet 206.<br>
      <br>
      There are two sources of mixing hydrogen and oxygen in a
      stoichiometric proportion of 2:1, which are the upper and lower
      quadrants of the combustion chamber 202.<br>
      <br>
      These gases are fed via two gas inlets 208 are located at points
      on opposite sides of furnace 200.<br>
      <br>
      The mixture of hydrogen and oxygen precipitates formed within the
      combustion chamber is ignited by a spark from spark plug 210 or
      the like, and is burned at a temperature not less than 4000C,
      thereby providing energy for dissociation of contaminants into
      harmless components which can be released into the atmosphere .<br>
      <br>
      During combustion the atmospheric oxygen is not consumed.<br>
      <br>
      Completion of combustion pollution contributes effect "focus" of
      the combustion chamber 202, which also improves the mixing of the
      gas streams.<br>
      <br>
      Thermocouple 212 measures the temperature inside the silicone
      fibrous refractory insulating material 214 surrounding combustor
      202.<br>
      <br>
      Cladding 216, applied to the furnace 200, typically made of
      stainless steel.<br>
      <br>
      The furnace is made of seven (only four shown) are concentrically
      arranged sets of nozzles 212, as clearly shown in FIG. 19b.<br>
      <br>
      Nozzles 222 are directed to a common point of intersection in the
      midst of 204 of the combustion chamber 202.<br>
      <br>
      Cooling water is supplied through inlet 218 and exiting through
      outlet 220, is designed to maintain a temperature of less than 222
      nozzles 300C. Over 300C hydrogen gas has a tendency to
      "burn-back."<br>
      <br>
      The flow path of gaseous hydrogen and oxygen to the nozzles 222
      from the inlet openings 208 has four (minimum) changes direction
      at 90C. This is intended to reduce the linear inertia
      hydroxy-flame combustion in the case of reverse, and thus make the
      flame extinguish itself.<br>
      <br>
      This is particularly advantageous when the hydrogen burns with a
      speed of 3600 m / s.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 20 shows in block diagram form and multimodule machine 230.<br>
      <br>
      To the device is supplied DC power coming from the converter 232
      AC to DC.<br>
      <br>
      Commercially available AC voltage source is intended for
      connection to the device 234, a welding arc AC voltage, while the
      converted DC output voltage is designed for connection to an
      apparatus, a welding arc voltage constant, or a cutting device
      236.<br>
      <br>
      The voltage applied to the output DC voltage is applied to the
      electrolytic cellular device 238 to obtain in this case separated
      hydrogen and oxygen gases. Hydrogen and oxygen gas are fed to the
      welding apparatus 240.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen (and oxygen for secondary injection) Secondary power
      supply available for connection to a plasma cutting device 242.
      Hydrogen passes through the DC arc for plasma flow and the
      secondary injection of oxygen introduced into the plasma stream to
      produce an oxidizing plasma cutting effect, which increases the
      cutting efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      With this process it is possible to cut the material to a
      thickness of 150 mm.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that the introduction of oxygen from the
      downflow of tungsten electrodes eliminates any oxidation of the
      electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      Device for MIG / TIG 244 manufactured in a hydrogen gas plasma to
      form Unlike conventional inert gas occurring.<br>
      <br>
      For plasma formation also requires a source of AC or DC.<br>
      <br>
      Transducer 232 may be of any conventional design, typically
      multiterminal imeyuschey transformer to select an appropriate
      rectified voltage.<br>
      <br>
      The electrolytic device 238 may be any of the previously described
      embodiments and may include a scrubber and the valve stopper.<br>
      <br>
      Various described cutting and welding devices 234, 236, 240, 242,
      244 are also conventional.<br>
      <br>
      Multimodular device 230 thus provides greater flexibility for the
      user with the ability to select one device of a particular mode
      desired cutting or welding.<br>
      <br>
      Clearly, the device comprising any single device or combination
      welding / cutting provided by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 21 is a multimodular device 230 with a high degree of detail.<br>
      <br>
      As described above, an electrolytic generator 238 separately
      generates hydrogen and oxygen gases, and may also produce hydrogen
      and oxygen as a mixture.<br>
      <br>
      Power supply device 232 includes a transformer 246 mnogovyvodnyh.<br>
      <br>
      Reduced voltage is rectified by a bridge rectifier 247.<br>
      <br>
      Rectified voltage output pin 248 is then connected to the unit
      cell 238 containing 30 cells, a contactor 249, which is driven by
      a pressure switch 250. Switch 250 in turn operates a pressure
      sensor 251 which senses the level of gas pressure within the cell
      block 238.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the contactor 249 is controlled to remove supply voltage to
      the unit cells 238 in setting the working pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Contactor 249 runs on demand using gas.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, gas produced in sufficient quantities, and typically 15
      liters at a time.<br>
      <br>
      These gases contained 15 l 10 l 5 l of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Gases come from gas... columns 156, 158, 238 block of cells.<br>
      <br>
      Since the ring system is closed, the pressure in each column will
      be compensated by the pressure in the other, thereby maintaining a
      constant level of production of a desired gas.<br>
      <br>
      If, however, the water level is too high due to an excessive use
      of gas, the corresponding float switch 254, 255 in the
      corresponding column 156, 158 will obstruct the flow of gas,
      corresponding to closing the solenoid valve 256, 257.<br>
      <br>
      Float switches 254, 255 actuated solenoid valves 256, 257 of the
      AC voltage source 258, the exhaust from the transformer 246.<br>
      <br>
      Other float switches located in the stop valve and the scrubber
      160 and forcing pump 138 also powered from AC voltage source 258.<br>
      <br>
      Two flow controller 261, 262 are combined in order to maintain a
      desired back pressure in the columns 156, 158, in order that said
      system is always under pressure, even if the system is disabled
      and / or gases are exhausted through the gas discharge holes, gas
      outlets 263, the stopper 264 valves / devices ... welding tip 160
      or 265.<br>
      <br>
      Another method is to produce a mixture that, when hydrogen and
      oxygen gases as opposed to the separation of cells in the block
      238 have passed through the locking valve and the cleaning device
      160, then select valve 266 allows gases to be mixed and supplied
      to the welding tip, where they are ignited and combusted, for to
      be used for hydrogen / oxygen welding.<br>
      <br>
      If hydrogen and oxygen are fed separately and are required for the
      hydrogen plasma cutting device 242 and / or hydrogen plasma device
      MIG / TIG-welding 244, the valve 266 does not allow the selection

          <b>Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          This invention relates to a compound power plant that utilises
          an internal combustion engine for the production of motive
          power. The power plant can be used in all forms of land
          vehicles, marine engines and stationary motor-driven generator
          sets.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Background of the Invention</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Internal combustion engines utilise hydrocarbon fuels as a
          power source, the chemical energy of which is converted to
          motive power by the engine (as is well known) with varying
          degrees of efficiency. Common forms of hydrocarbon fuel are
          gasoline, liquid petroleum gas. dieseline, marine diesel oil
          and natural gas. All forms of internal combustion engine have
          the problem of the undesirable waste combustion products such
          as non-combusted hydrocarbon, carbon, oxides of sulphur and
          nitrogen, and (in some circumstances) heavy metals.<br>
          <br>
          Considerable effort is being expended, particularly in the
          motor vehicle industry, in the reduction of polluants and
          greenhouse gas emissions in response to environmental laws.
          Another area of research associated with internal combustion
          engines is the imperfect nature of energy conversion from the
          latent chemical energy of the fuel to energy that can be
          mechanically harnessed.<br>
          <br>
          It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate one or
          more such disadvantages in the prior art.<br>

          </b><b>Detailed Description and Best Mode</b><br>
          <br>
          The compound power plant 10 shown at Fig. 1 has an internal
          combustion benzine 12 that receives a supply of hydrocarbon
          fuel from a fuel tank 14. The encrine provides motive force
          for a motor vehicle or marine vessel in which it is installe
          by a drive chain (not shown). The drive chais in the
          embodiment of a motor vehicle, inclues the tail shaft from the
          gear box or automatic transmission and the front and rear
          wheel axles, either or both of which axles may be driven bu
          tue tail shaft.<br>
          <br>
          In addition to the hydrocarbon fuel from the fuel tank 14, the
          engane 12 also receives a supply of admixed hvdrogell and
          oxygen gases (H2 and 0,,) provided by a gas generator 16, in
          the form of an electrolysis unit. A suitable form of
          electrolysis unit. havinc, the characteristics of being
          lightweight. compact and efficient. is disclosed in commonly
          owned International Publication<br>
          No. WO 95/07373 and US Patent No. 5,843,292, the contents of
          which are incorporated lzerein by wav of cross-reference. The
          gas generator 16 receives a supply of water from a water
          reservoir 18. Of course. the supply of water could be from a
          town main supply, and in that sense. be relatively unlimited
          with respect to a single engine.<br>
          <br>
          The admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases supplie to the engine 12
          are combusted in the engaine as an alternative, or as a
          supplement to the hydrocarbon fuel. In the latter case, the
          admixed gases act as a catalyst for the hydrocarbon fuel,
          providing for more efficient combustion. The use of both
          admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases and hydrocarbon fuel results
          in a significant decrease in undesirable combustion products,
          including carbon.<br>
          <br>
          For example, a 5% additive of hydrogen gas to a gasoline/air
          mix can reduce nitrous oxide emissions by 30-40%. Tests
          conducted by the inventor on a 3. 3 litre internal combustion
          engin. where 28 litre/min of admixed gas is mixed with 4,000
          litre/min of an air/fuel mix, reduced hydrocarbon emissions by
          40%. Also, tests conducted on diesel emissions recorde a
          reduction of 25% carbon black at flow rates of 6. 6 litres peu
          minute of admixed gas with air/fuel mix 2,200 litres per
          minute.<br>
          <br>
          Further tests carried out proved that the high pressure and
          temperature produced in the combustion chambrer of a diesel
          engine, in particular, did not cause the admixed gas to
          pre-ignite before the top dead centre of the combustion stroke
          and overall cycle, which would have caused pre-ignition. The
          reason for this is due to the admixed gases'unique gaseous
          properties, where the calorific value is low. therefore the
          detonation temperature is high. In this test it proved to be
          higher than the diesel fuel's ignition temperature.<br>
          <br>
          Internal combustion engines are known to be inefficient, in
          that up to 2/3 of the energy liberated during combustion is
          wasted: typically 40% as heat and 25% as exhaust pressure
          (also known as iblow down energy'). It would be useful to
          harness some of this otherwise wasted energy.<br>
          <br>
          In this reard. tlie exhaust gases from the engine 12 are
          provided to a turbo fan/alternator unit 20. The fonction of
          the turbo fan/alternator unit 16 is to induce rotation of a
          shaft-mounted fan which, in turn, causes rotation of an
          alternator mounted on the shaft from which electrical energy
          is generated. A suitable form of turbo fan/alternator unit 20
          is the"TurboGenerators"model manulactured by the company<br>
          AlliedSignal Inc. of 101 Columbia Road, Morristown, NJ 07862,
          USA. An AlliedSignalTM TurboGenerator of 25 ka rating (up to
          120, 000 rpm) would be suitable for matching with a 100 kW
          internal combustion engine. such as found in trucks and small
          marine vesses.<br>
          <br>
          The AC output from the unit 20 is passed to a rectifier unit
          22, and a regulated DC output then provided to a battery unit
          24. The battery unit 24 has a function of storing electrical
          charge, tao be supplie on demand. Battery unit 24 supplies DC
          power to an electronic power controller 26 that includes a
          conventional controlled chopper circuit.<br>
          <br>
          The power controller has an output characteristic shown in
          Fig. 2a: chopped waveform shaving controlled tl, and t,, I-f
          periods. This is sometimes known also as the mark-to-space
          ratio. The output voltage level during tolu must be arrange to
          be sufficiently high to promote electrolysis of the water,
          including tlie necessary overvoltage, as is well known.<br>
          <br>
          By supplying the waveform of the nature shown in Fig. 2a to
          the gas generator 16, an average gas flow will be achieved.
          That is, strictly electrolysis ceases during the period
          however because of inertia, there is an averaging of gas flow
          with time.<br>
          <br>
          The volume of gas supply must be regulated to match engine
          demand. These is an empirical relationship between a volume of
          admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases generated by the gas
          generator 16 and the volume of hydrocarbon fuel supply to the
          engine 12. This relationship has been determined to be
          approximately linear with respect to engine revolutions, in
          the manner shown generally in Fig. 2b. The period tofi-reduces
          as the gas demand increases.<br>
          <br>
          Of course. a limiting factor on the a rage volume of gas that
          can be provided by the gas generator 16 is the power available
          to be source from the battery unit 24. To account for this, a
          battery charge detector 28 senses tlie energy storage level of
          the battery unit 24, and provides a signal representative of
          this state to the power controller 26. If the power controller
          also receives a signal representative of the engine
          revolutions it can sense demande Las load and control the DC
          power provided to the gas generator 16 accordingly, subject to
          the electrical energy being available from the battery unit
          24. If the gas flow that which can be achieved by the
          electrical energy exceeds available from the battery unit 24,
          then the power controller 26 will clamp the volumetric slow-in
          a manner shown by the dashed line in Fig. 2b.<br>
          <br>
          It is also possible for tlle energy recovered by the turbo
          fan/alternator unit 20 simply to be stored in the battery unit
          24, rather than being instantly consume by the gas generator
          16.<br>
          <br>
          In another broader form, the DC output from the rectifier 22
          can be provided directly to the gas generator 16 in an
          unregulated manner.<br>
          <br>
          Considering then the energy balance aspect of the embodiment
          of Fig. 1.<br>
          <br>
          A 30 kW internal combustion engine 12 produces approximately
          7.5 kW of exhaust gas or blow down energy. The turbo
          fanalternator 20 recovers typically 70% of the available
          energy, being 5.25 kW. 5. 25 kW of electrical energy produces
          1470 1/h of admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases. This volumetric
          flow rate, when combusted by the engine 12, produces an
          additional 3. 8 kW of energy, which is a 12% recovery of the
          total energy available from the engine.<br>
          <br>
          For a compound power plant mounted on a motor vehicle, it is
          possible also to take avantage of other available recoverable
          forms of energy. In a further embodiment, shown in Fig. 3. the
          power plant 10'further inclues a wind generator 30 that
          supplies a further source of DC electrical energy to the
          battery unit 24. Any suitable wind generator can be chosen.<br>
          <br>
          A yet further embodiment of the compound power plant, again
          suitable for use with a motor vehicle, is shown in Fig. 4. The
          compound power plant 10"shows a representative drive cliain 32
          extending from the engine 12, (e. g. tail shaft or wheel
          axles) by which motive power is transmitted. Mounted
          concentrically around the drive chan 32 is an alternator 34.
          The drive shaft acts as the rotor of the alternator, having
          permanent magnets mounted to it. The interaction of the
          magnetic field generated by the shaft with the stator windings
          produces an alternating electrical output which acts to load
          the shaft and cause it to slow. Tous, the rotational kinetic
          energy can be recovered. The electrical output is from the
          stator rectifie and provided to the battery unit 24.<br>
          <br>
          It is desirable for tlle alternator 34 to be controlled in a
          switched manner to load the shaft when the vehicle's braking
          system is activated by the driver. An example of sucez a
          regenerative braking system is that implemented in the
          ToyotaTM PriusTM motor vehicle,<br>
          <br>
          The increased electrical energy recovered from the exhaust gas
          means that other electrical lods 36 in a motor vehicle can be
          accommodated. For example, an electrical air conditioning unit
          can be implemented, removing the conventional belt-driven
          compressor and unburdening the engine to provide greater
          available power (when the airconditioner is being operated).
          Of course, the use of electrical energy for other loads (sucs
          as airconditioning) may reduce the energy available for the
          generation of admixed hydrogen and oxygen gases. There is an
          engineering compromise to be made. Other examples of
          electrical loads are lights and instrumentation.<br>
          <br>
          Fig. 5 shows a side view of a vehicle, and the relative
          physical location of the elements of the compound power unit
          10'of Fig. 3. It will be readily understood that the
          consumable fuels. water and hydrocarbon are required to be
          replenished.<br>
