      <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;"><big>The
          Discoveries of Joe Parr<br>
        </big></div>
      <p style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">The following are briefs of
          information derived since 1976 relating to the geometric shape
          of the pyramid. All advances were made after the gamma ray
          transducer was discovered. The costs of this research, as of
          June 2000, have exceedd $60,000.</span><br style="font-weight:
          normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">1. The pyramid shape has 8
          input ports (4 opposite pairs ) located every 45 egrees around
          the base.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">2. To be usable, the most
          basic pyramid must include 4 horizontal rods forming a base,
          and 4 vertical rods forming the edges.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">3. Free-flowing ions in the
          air are the pyramids' energy source.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">4. A solid pyramid must have
          facilities to allow ions to flow at the geometric center.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">5. Every pyramid has an
          energy barrier surrounding it. This barrier protects three
          mass&nbsp; particles held captive at the geometric center of
          the shape.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">7. The mass particles can be
          captive outside the geometric shape by either decreasing the
          angle of the sides, or placement of rings inside the shape.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">8. To create an energy
          barrier (minimum charge) after 15 hours, the pyramid must be
          parallel to the earth, with one pair of ports aligned
          magnetically N-S.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">9. The instant a pyramid
          assumes a fixed position on the surface of the earth, a clock
          governed by the fibonacci spiral starts running.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">10. The term"history"
          reflects this spiral, and repeatable characteristics because
          of it.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">11. A one-inch base pyramid
          will control a radioactive isotope of 1.0 uc (microcurie) or a
          current of 1.0 ua (microamp).</span><br style="font-weight:
          normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">12. The usable energy of a
          pyramid does not increase with a larger pyramid.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">13. A one-inch base pyramid
          produces the same effects as each square inch at the top of
          the Great Pyramid.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">14. If you assume an energy
          output over a one year period as a Sine wave of 2 units
          amplitude at the King's Chamber, then you will also have a
          Sine wave of 0.8 units in the Pit Chamber, a null in the
          Queen's Chamber and a 1 unit pulsating wave (no negative
          excursions ) at the apex.</span><br style="font-weight:
          normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">15. The energy barrier is in
          the shape of a bubble. It will expand and contract by history
          and the influence of gravity, and becomes opaque by
          stimulation of the host particles.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">16. The bubble / barrier
          requires one of the two energy sources : </span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">(a) free flowing ions of
          either polarity; </span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">(b) acoustic energy at one,
          two or three specific frequencies.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">17. A stationary pyramid
          follows the sun's active portion of the 11-year solar cycle.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">18. A gamma ray source placed
          inside an active barrier will assume the Energy State of the
          pyramid and not the half-life of the source.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">19. Cosmic and gamma rays are
          reflected by the barrier proportional to its opacity.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">20. A quiescent barrier
          around a stationary pyramid will be from 1-3% opaque depending
          on the local tidal variations.</span><br style="font-weight:
          normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">21. During the non-active
          portion of the sun's 11-year cycle, the pyramid must be
          rotated inside a magnetic field to create a barrier.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">22. Centrifugal forces excite
          the host particles and can close the barrier within 50% of
          pinch-off. To obtain the energy to throw off the barrier into
          pinch-off will require the intervention of an atomic particle.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">23. The sun has been a
          reliable source of these particles, which terminate their
          existence upon striking the barrier.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">24. The centrifugal force to
          condition a barrier is least in mid-December and most in
          mid-June.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">25. The earth has passed
          through a conduit of atomic particle 3 times in mid-December,
          forming a line from out sun to the stars classified as the
          Belt of Orion.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">26. A closing barrier will
          attenuate the radio frequency spectrum, starting at DC and
          ending at light. Somewhere during the closing, gravity is
          blocked 100%.</span><br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">27. A barrier has no
          detectable fields and can be penetrated by a physical object
          until it is pinched-off.</span><br style="font-weight:
          normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">28. A barrier can develop a
          surface charge that is polarized opposite to the ions, but
          equal to their potential.</span><br style="font-weight:
          normal;">
        <br style="font-weight: normal;">
        <span style="font-weight: normal;">29. Two barriers of the same
          polarity oppose each other violently at pinch-off.</span><br
          style="font-weight: normal;">
      </p>
      <p>30. Assuming a new moon at rise as the gravitational source,
        the pyramid rotated inside a magnetic field, and&nbsp; (-) ions
        as the energy source, at inch-off the pyramid will accelerate
        away from the moon.<br>
        <br>
        31. With all things similar to statement 30, except that the
        ions are positive, at pinch-off the pyramid will acclerate
        toward the moon.<br>
      </p>
      <p>32. The kinetic energy increase for a short test has been
        calculated to be 1.3 x 10^5 OUO.<br>
      </p>
      <p>33. A barrier can be maintained only inside a magnetic field.
        Once inside, the barrier drops, and air friction will cause
        ionization and surface melting.<br>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">THE MYSTERY AND
        SECRET OF THE GREAT PYRAMID<br>
      </p>
      <p> The mystery is; I have been trying to get this report written
        for 15 years now and unless death overtakes me, this is the last
        time! My rendition of the secret of the pyramids only applies to
        pyramids that are not solid at the geometric center. Size and
        construction material is not important for this report. I feel
        certain my presentation will rub somebody the wrong way. This
        situation is not new. Please make allowances for my grasp of
        nuclear physics. My overview covers 25 years of experience. For
        definition of certain terms, please consult the article at the
        end.</p>
      <p> Now let me unlock a door into a new world of possibilities.
        First off, to my knowledge, there is only one secret of the
        pyramids! It would still be a secret today if not for the
        Gamma-Ray Transducer (l) and the Negative Ion Generator '(2).
        That secret, which Antoine Bovis discovered in dehydrated animal
        bodies during the 1930's and all the pyramid energy reports
        since 1970, is an Orb (3) surrounding the pyramid. See drawing
        below:<br>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="orb.gif" alt=""></p>
      <p>The Orb expands and contracts with the moon phases and requires
        the energy of the ion generator to study it. The edge is not
        detectable by conventional methods. Stationary pyramids can use
        positive or negative ions, but not an equal mix. If you aren't
        affected by depression, positive ions won't bother you!
        Thousands of hard data bits were logged using stationary
        pyramids. Unfortunately "good times" ended on December 4, 1979
        when all experiments except one started loosing their
        accumulated energy. In 9 days the isotopes were again on track
        with their half-lives. The only experiment still operating was
        the one that was rotating 5 degrees every 10 days. That
        experiment continued to grow in energy to exceed all others.</p>
      <p> The technique to rotate a pyramid properly took years to
        develop. The results were quite dramatic when I reached the
        projected speed. The experiment self- destructed. As each new
        test self destructed, one thing was evident. The ABS plastic
        pyramids were getting "beat-up". A few, which left the machine
        containment, imbedded in the wall. Two pyramids mounted back to
        back always self-destructed earlier than the rest. Something
        inside the pyramid was causing the problem. To study this, a
        piece of aluminum foil was installed behind one pyramid. This
        was rotated inside a machine having a strobe synchronized to the
        motor shaft. By viewing this rotating pyramid through an
        observation port, impressions could be seen on the metal foil.
        50 experiments were conducted with the foil, 15 self-destructed.
        What was learned follows;</p>
      <p> I) The Orb existed around the pyramid because of them.</p>
      <p> 2) The machine could be "fine-tuned" using their bunching.</p>
      <p> 3) They had sufficient energy to burn holes in test objects .</p>
      <p> 4) The 'History'(4) of the machine was a factor in their
        performance.</p>
      <p> 5) They become more active as the inertia increases.</p>
      <p> What are these things inside the pyramid? I chose to use the
        definition by 'Leonard G. Cramp'(5) and refer to them as 'Mass
        Particles'(6). The mass particles are excited into being by
        inertia at around 360 Hz. The particles have a magnetic
        signature, the Orb does not. As the inertia increases the
        density of the Orb increases and this is expressed as
        'Opacity'(7) because of it's attenuation to the entire
        electromagnetic spectrum from DC to Cosmic Rays. At some point
        in the experiment it is hopedthat the Orb will 'Pinch-'Qff(8).
        After pinch-off, gravity can no longer penetrate inside the Orb.
        Gravity now pushes or pulls on the Orb, depending on the
        polarity of the ions being used.</p>
      <p> At this point in the report I would like to talk about the
        Orb. Let me say with all seriousness the Orb is not "user
        friendly". It has the ability to extract energy from any source
        either mechanical or biological for the benefit of the mass
        particles. Meditating inside an Orb is NOT recommended. There is
        evidence that extended exposure will cause debilitation of the
        higher brain functions. It never has been possible to supply
        enough energy to an experiment to cause the Orb to pinch-off.
        The machine mostly conditions the Orb in preparation for some
        event called a "trigger" to come along.</p>
      <p> The illusive trigger remained a secret until 1993 when a new
        generation of machine went into full operation 24 hours/day. The
        new machine tested the ability of a 2-dimensional pyramid
        rotating in a magnetic field to capture and hold a mass
        particle. This experiment would not self-destruct. The
        experiment lost weight as predicted and the $1200 expense for an
        Ohaus scale was justified. After the experiment started,
        recordings indicated periodic events of greater weight loss
        occurring.'Fortunately the Ohaus machines designed by the Ohaus
        family could be modified to investigate this new event. The
        machine was modified to allow recording each time the experiment
        lost 5 grams of weight. 400-500 events were logged each day
        until December 9 when the numbers started to climb. On December
        16, 1992;'135,272 events were recorded before the machine burned
        up. Analysis of the motor showed that the stress on the motor
        from the experiment going from no load to full load and back to
        no load in milliseconds completely wore out both motor brushes.
        32 motors burned out during the 6 years of the experiment. The
        event that burned out the motors has been termed a 'Conduit'
        (9). From 12-16-92 until 9-1-97; 23 conduits were crossed by the
        earth going around the sun. The best conduit occurs between
        December 12 and 16.'The latest one recorded 87,346,836
        particles. The conduit was so intense that we recorded crests of
        3500/second with intervals between crests of 35 seconds.</p>
      <p>'Now if you draw a line from our sun, through the earth on
        December 12 and continue the line into space, some of you might
        not be surprised to find out that the conduit is heading for the
        star group called; Belt of Orion!</p>
      <p>'Last subject before I close. Dimensions of the Kings Chamber
        were fed into a acoustic computer used for sonar studies. A
        stream of fundamental and harmonics came forth which formed the
        basis of a 3 year acoustic study of the shape. The '2
        dimensional gravity wheel experiment was the experiment it was
        focused at. 'The object was to find some method to eliminate the
        ions from being used.'-ions around computers tends to blow them
        up, not to mention any other static sensitive device. Two fixed
        and one variable frequency was found which caused the Orb to be
        stimulated. Surprisingly one of the 3 frequencies was 51.5 Hz
        which happens to be the angle of the side of Cheops.</p>
      <p>'In closing let me mention two interesting tidbits;</p>
      <p>'I) 'Rocky Mc Collum,' on March 26, 1979, took a photograph in
        the queens chamber of a rare event. I am in possession of that
        photograph. I believe it is a mass particle because it is in the
        geometric center of Cheops.</p>
      <p>'2) During the year 2000, the newest machine stopped producing
        data. An investigation showed that something had plated itself
        all over the gravity wheel. This shorted out critical areas.
        Removing the material restored normal operation. The flakes
        removed are mallable, metalic and conductive. Anybody having
        access to an X-Ray Defraction Sgectroscopy machine and would
        like to test these samples, they might give a clue tothe
        particles striking the experiment. Please contact Dr. John
        DeSalvo and ask him to forward your request to me.</p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;"> THE EVOLUTION
        OF AN ENERGY FIELD --or-- NOW THAT I HAVE ONE, HOW DO I GET RID
        OF IT? </p>

      <p style="font-weight: bold; text-align: center;">Joe Parr </p>
      <p> After coming down from the Great Pyramid top in 1977,
        following an overnight stay, I decided to join the growing
        number of people trying to discover: “What 2,000,000 custom
        carved blocks were really for.” </p>
      <p> During a return trip to the Antarctic in 1978, equipped with a
        Pyramid Products "Energy Array", one pack of blades for my
        razor, their laboratory equipment, and a lot of free time during
        the long winter nights...Soon the Gamma-Ray Transducer was born.<br>
      </p>
      <p> After returning to the States, an intense 18 month effort was
        made using certified radioactive sources. After air ions were
        discovered as an energy source around the Pyramid, the secrets
        began to make themselves known. Up to 9 experiments ran
        simultaneously and data was collected every 12 hours, to the
        exact minute each time.<br>
      </p>
      <p> The investigation bubble burst on December 4, 1979.
        Simultaneously, every experiment, except one, stopped working!
        Within 7 days, the transducers only indicated the half-life
        level of the particular isotope used! The experiment that didn't
        stop, had been rotating 5 degrees every 10 days. 25 years later,
        I can safely say: The mechanism that influenced these Pyramids
        to switch OFF is located somewhere in the center of our galaxy!<br>
      </p>
      <p> It took 3 years to develop the Pyramid Centrifuge and locate a
        DC motor large enough to drive it to the calculated speed. The
        first Centrifuge was like a Model "T" Ford, very basic. When
        2500 RPM's was reached, on September 17, 1983, a loud explosion
        was heard. When the machine was shut down and cover removed, I
        discovered my arm was "wiped clean." Four Pyramids and a CS137
        isotope were surgically removed. At the time, I didn't know what
        had happened. After 55 such experiments, I realize that was my
        first jump into Hyperspace.<br>
      </p>
      <p> The last experiment to jump was July 5, 1987. It was quite
        obvious by then, further tests would yield predictable results.
        I had discovered 3 particles that come to life from centrifugal
        force and a shield or barrier or "bubble" that protects them.
        The moon supplies the gravity, +/- air ions, the energy source,
        and there is an unknown trigger source I have not been able to
        identify, since the experiment is essentially over at the
        instant it jumps. By accident, "History" of the magnets in the
        Centrifuge was discovered. I can safely state that magnets (or
        their fields) exist in more than our dimension. If it wasn't for
        this fact, the Pyramid could never accelerate to the next
        dimension. The length of the occasion in "negative-time" is
        governed by a Fibonacci Spiral. To reset history to "zero"
        requires either removal of the magnets or moving the machine for
        30 minutes. Since there are 108 magnets on the bottom row, it is
        obvious which was more efficient. </p>
      <p>It took 5 years to evolve a "Real-Time" machine that would not
        destroy itself every time it took a jump. On August 10, 1992,
        the miniature centrifuge (or gravity wheel, as it is now called)
        was placed into operation. It uses a 2-dimensional Pyramid arm.
        By monitoring the motor current, I noticed periodic noise pulses
        on the chart recorder. Since the experiment was conducted in a
        secure area at work, using my employer's test equipment, I soon
        learned those noise spikes were a change in weight of the
        machine.</p>
      <p> A risk purchase of an Ohaus Precision Plus Scale, with RS-232
        output, proved important then, and still is now. Those noise
        spikes turned out to be the unknown trigger mentioned earlier. A
        particle from our sun strikes a bubble on one of the
        2-dimensional Pyramids on the arm, causing it to instantly
        close-off. This results in the subtraction of the weight of the
        arm, that the Pyramid occupied. In turn, the scale sees this as
        a sudden change in the load it was measuring and shuts the data
        off. This in turn causes a pulse counter to indicate a “hit” and
        a speaker to notify me. The experiment was relocated next to the
        Centrifuge and ran 24 hours/day. 40-50 hits usually occur daily,
        but sometimes, I would take a reading and thousands of hits had
        occurred. </p>
      <p>The significant days when kilo-particles would arrive, could
        only be determined after the Sun’s direction of travel was
        determined. After this, I created a graph of the Earth circling
        the Sun, and lines on a chart representing the exact day and
        month the particles hit. They occur only during the “Quiet Sun”
        portion of the 11 year Sun Spot cycle. A number of years of
        repeated data can be accumulated. It was discovered, as the
        Earth travels around the sun, it passes through conduits of
        particles that are heading into space. Some conduits head
        towards the Galactic Center, but the most impressive and largest
        one, occurs on December 11-16, and if you show it on a Star
        Chart, it is heading towards the “Belt of Orion.” </p>
      <p> Negative air ions always fall on the experiment and these have
        made obvious high voltage problems for computers or test
        equipment inputs. To locate another energy source for the
        experiments, acoustics was tried! My employer graciously ran an
        acoustic computer program for me on the dimension of the King’s
        Chamber. Using two larger speaker assemblies, pumping their
        combined output at the Gravity Wheel, and the number of hits
        recorded in 24 hours as my guide, I soon learned the computer
        numbers were wrong! I had never considered that the stone coffer
        sitting in the room had altered the room’s resonance
        frequencies. So, starting at 40 Hz and increasing 0.5 Hz each
        day, I located and verified the first frequency after 100 days.
        It was 51.5 Hz (which I was reminded is also the angle of the
        sides). </p>
      <p> At this time (February 9, 1997), my laboratory silently gave
        birth to an “Unexpected Outcome,” and the basis of this report.
        From this point of the report and onwards, all information will
        be in chronological order to show the changes occurring. </p>
      <p> With the negative ions turned off and the humidity less than
        50%, the first strange event occurred in September 1997. Walking
        through the lab, caused an Electrostatic Charge on my body to
        set off the experiments pulse counter when you passed the
        gravity wheel. </p>
      <p>May 2000 - All particles arriving from the sun ceased to be
        recorded. </p>
      <p>June 2000 - Discovered a metallic substance on the Gravity
        Wheel that had caused the May 2000 problem. Analysis of the
        metal was: 35% Boron; 23% Barium; 21.8% Iodine; 12% Silver; 4%
        Bromine, 3.5% Selenium; 0.7% Gallium. Removal of the mystery
        metal returned the Gravity wheel to normal operation. </p>
      <p>August 2000 - Bill Cox, using his equipment, has determined
        that an energy field has developed around the Gravity Wheel
        experiment, which extends from floor to ceiling. </p>
      <p>September 2000 - A second energy field is detected which
        extends as far as 15 feet from center. Method of detection is
        interaction with the human body. Entering the field is quiet,
        but on EXIT, the experiment will lose weight, causing a pulse to
        be recorded. Since the scale is set for 5 grams, the event is
        significant. </p>
      <p>November 2000 - Two metal pyramids were hung from the ceiling.
        Bill Cox, who gave me the Pyramids stated one was hanging over
        his bed, and on some days it would turn as much as 45 degrees.
        One hour after hanging them, I noticed both were turning at a
        very slow rate. 5 years later, they are still turning. I use
        them to determine the health of the phenomena, which is still
        growing. </p>
      <p>March 2001 - Acquired a second Ohaus scale and built up a new
        Gravity Machine, duplicating all electronics. The new machine
        had a larger arm and more magnets. It was set up 3 feet from the
        first experiment. Within days, and using the human body as a
        test instrument (like Sept. 2000), I determined the room now had
        two energy fields. The fields opposed each other (similar to
        tests using the Centrifuge). The new, larger machine had taken
        over 2/3 of the lab, the smaller machine the balance. Later the
        log data reports that the larger machine will consume 90% of the
        room. </p>
      <p>June 2001 - Using the hanging Pyramids as a tool, determined
        that the Energy Field survives on wasted energy in the lab; ie.
        the experiments, unused wall-warts, magnetic field from the DC
        Treadmill motor, AC motors in the washing machine and dryer. The
        more energy it receives, the faster the Pyramids rotate back and
        forth. If you cut off it’s energy, the field can go dormant for
        days, but will return to life with any energy use. </p>
      <p>August 2001 - Discovered a New Moon at rise will shrink the
        boundary of the energy field into a bubble. If a differential
        pressure gauge is inserted from the experiment area (ground
        zero) to the outside of the bubble, and monitored before, during
        and after moon rise, the gauge will start at 0.0 Pascal before,
        increase to 0.2 Pascal at rise, and fall back to 0.0 later. </p>
      <p>September 2002. Suddenly after 1 year, the energy field starts
        to grow larger. It was only after NOAA announced the Sun had a
        second peak (during the current 11 year sun spot cycle). This
        new peak ties the bubble to the sun. </p>
      <p>October 2002 - Left the lab at 1230 hours and returned at 1420
        hours, in time to witness 18 honeybees dead or dying on the
        workbench below the only window in the room. </p>
      <p>I added 3 bees more the next day and 1 more the following. All
        bees were put into formalin. No hive was detected in the attic
        or trees. It could not be determine how they got into the
        laboratory. </p>
      <p>November 2002 - Terminated all acoustic tests after the
        generator was set to the Bee’s wing frequency. The effect on the
        Human Hosts was unsettling, due to the fact that the energy
        field was now entering the living areas of the house. </p>
      <p>December 2002 - After conducting a low power audio test using
        transducers for 30 days, it was determined that the medium
        inside the bubble is a damping field which prevents the Gravity
        Wheel from building up a charge. It normally took 15 hours to
        build up a suitable charge. </p>
      <p>March 2003 - Since the bubble was expanding into the living
        areas of the house, a series of tests were run to determine the
        intrusion under the house. Radius circles were drawn on a house
        scale drawing from point “0.” These were 8.5, 17, 27, 37, 47,
        and 56 feet. Using a strip chart recorder and special
        transducer, data was collected for 7-10 days at each convenient
        point on a radius circle. Some points were repeated. The results
        showed the bubble had crossed the 27 foot line. </p>
      <p>March 2003 - Conducted a “Ghost-Whisper” test using a
        microphone and recorder. 3 attempts heard nothing but “popping”
        sounds. A fourth attempt a few days later proved no popping and
        no eerie voices. A check with the conduit dates showed that the
        March conduit had occurred and the particles were striking the
        bubble, but not penetrating it. </p>
      <p>Additionally, measured the Cosmic Ray background using a
        Scintillation Counter. It was then measured at 100 feet from
        point “0.” It was determined at this point of time that the
        attenuation was 30-40%. </p>
      <p>April 2003 - From the 18th-24th, the Gravity Wheel caused the
        Ohaus Scale to start vibrating. The vibrations increased and the
        experiment started gaining weight. The scale measures 4000 +/-
        0.1 grams, and the experiment only weighs 1562 grams. On these
        days, the weight would increase to “scale overload” in seconds.
        A bathroom scale showed a weight gain of 7.5 lbs. </p>
      <p>July 2003 - Experiments with a Van De Graff Generator, which
        normally produced a 200,000 volt positive charge would only
        produce a negative charge inside the damping field. If you
        removed the generator away from the bubble, it would return to a
        positive charge. If I allowed the generator to remain outside
        for 24 hours, brought it back in and turned it on, a positive
        charge would accumulate, but within 60 seconds it would drain to
        zero and come back negative.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>July 2003 - 272 days after the last Honeybee invasion, they
        were back again. Between 0900-1000 hours, 30 bees were seen on
        the lab screen door. Before long, they had overcome that hurdle
        and were clinging to the solid wood door. When I returned from
        work, 10 dead bees were on the workbench and 6 were on the
        floor.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>August 2003 - Since the bubble we lived in attenuated a lot of
        noise generated by humanity and it’s toys, a test was conducted
        to verify it. I connected the lab’s D.N.C. Coil to a 10 MHz RMS
        meter. The results were strip chart recorded. The data was
        unexpected The high noise level during the daytime suddenly went
        away at night. The next day, the noise was back on.
        Investigation showed an event preceded the sun at sunrise and
        followed it a sunset. The event switching the noise on and off
        increased by +38 seconds each day during the Fall months. I lost
        it in September. Then suddenly everything toggled, and the noise
        was switched on at night and off during the day. It is not known
        how much the bubble influenced this test.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>October 2003 - Log entry. Sufficient time has lapsed to state
        the Human-Bubble interaction was over.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>January 2004 - I notified the Station Engineer at a local radio
        station that their station was switching level 15 DB
        periodically during the day. When he reported back to me that
        the signal was solid, and that he couldn’t explain what I had
        received, I knew the bubble was evolving again.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Tests showed a window had opened at: 1.43496 MHz, 1.6556 MHz,
        2.68612 MHz, and 4.3166 MHz. Additional higher frequencies
        probably existed, but no equipment was available to test them.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>May 2004 - My partner, Dan Davidson, who has duplicated my
        efforts, also received an <i>unexpected outcome</i>! His wife
        is highly sensitive to the bubble’s presence, and he was willing
        to try anything to regain peace at his home. His solution was to
        wrap the house with insulated copper wire and connect a 36 kV
        pulsing generator to it. He did this for two weeks and claims to
        have rid the house of the problem.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>I attempted the same solution on a smaller scale. I only
        wrapped the lab, where the bubble had it’s trunk. the 36 kV
        generator was on a shelf outside the house, since it generated
        copious amounts of ozone.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>After 10 days, I shut down. The bubble had become so active
        that the Pyramids were rotating as much as 250 degrees in each
        direction, and much faster than they had ever moved.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>June 2004 - In order to again get the Gravity Wheel
        functioning, I got permission to set up in a neighbor’s home,
        300 feet to the southwest. All equipment was relocated,
        calibrated and started. It would need 15 hours to charge up.
        Each day, a phone call reported no hits on the pulse counter.
        The following weekend, took the scintillator over and made a
        measurement. There was a 30-40% attenuation also! Took the Van
        De Graff Generator over and it produced a negative charge. Also
        shut down the experiment and returned it home.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>July 2004 - A magnetic compass used in the lab has been
        altered. It now points south.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>August 2004 - Installed a 56-inch long Hydrophone into the
        ground near point “0.” Then modified a 35 kHz Ultrasonic
        Generator to transfer it’s energy into two ground probes. With
        an assistant, we energized the ground at various points up to
        300 feet away and covering a 180 degree spread. The spread
        covered the house the experiment was located in. The results
        obtained verified my suspicion. There was a direct underground
        link between my bubble and the one created across the street.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>December 2004 - Since the bubble was expanding, needed to
        determine in “real time,” where the edges were. Taking advantage
        of the 1.45 MHz window, built up a portable transmitter and
        mounted it on one end of a 4 foot cardboard tube. Then took a
        Frequency Selective Voltmeter and mounted it at the other end.
        Using the dB meter on the receiver, walked inside the bubble and
        outside, until I had exited the bubble. At the edge, made
        careful measurements and determined there was no longer an
        immediate edge. The bubble was now an Energy Field and the
        energy at an edge decreases to zero.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>January 2005 - <i>Strait-Line Sonic Laser</i>, which was
        designed to measure wall distances has proven to be an
        interesting asset in the study of the Energy Field. The laser
        portion does nothing, but the ultrasonic signal bounces off
        invisible energy levels inside.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>September 2005 - Set up a one-Lunar Month test using the 1.45
        MHz Transmitter at point “0,” and a receiver 56 feet away, into
        a strip chart recorder. Results showed the moon’s influence was
        very visible. It also showed on Moon Days 23, 24, 25, 26, no
        openings occurred at any time. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>January 2006 - Have found a Garmin GPS-72, which has 10
        receivers tuned to 1575.42 MHz, makes an excellent device to
        measure attenuation at that frequency. Also the error percentage
        after “first contact” supplements the data. No results at this
        time though!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>January 2006 - In closing, the attenuation measured using the
        scintillator has risen to 66%. Apparently the Energy Field is
        still evolving and growing.<br>
