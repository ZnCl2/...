          A mixing device (11) in the form of a generally spheroidal
          multiple chambered enclosure is created from three shells (13,
          15, 17) and a pipe (29). The device (11) includes two
          hemispheroidal shells (13, 15) each with a rim (19) which
          joins to the rim of the other to form a first generally
          spheroidal chamber (33), and one truncated hemispheroidal
          shell (17) having a rim for joining to the rim (19) of one of
          the hemispheroidal shells (13, 15).<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The present invention relates generally to a device in which
          two or more fluids are commingled to form a highly homogeneous
          mixture and more particularly to such a device which
          continuously mixes such fluids providing a homogeneous output
          on a continuing basis. In a preferred form, one fluid is air
          and another is a liquid or gaseous fuel. In a specific
          preferred embodiment, a gaseous fuel and air are mixed and
          burned in a free-standing space heater.<br>
          <br>
          A wide variety of fuel-air mixing devices are known. Nearly as
          well known is the fact that inadequate mixing of fuel and air
          frequently results in the generation of undesirable combustion
          by-products such as carbon monoxide. Such by-products from
          internal combustion engines are undesirable and in
          free-standing home heating devices can be fatal.<br>
          <br>
          Among the several objects of the present invention may be
          noted the provision of a device which thoroughly mixes fluids
          passing therethrough; the provision of a gasfired space heater
          requiring no external vent; the provision of a high efficiency
          heat generating device; and the provision of a fuel burning
          system which in which fuel and air is mixed to a highly
          homogeneous state prior to combustion thereby promoting more
          complete combustion. These as well as other objects and
          advantageous features of the present invention will be in part
          apparent and in part pointed out hereinafter.<br>
          <br>
          In general, a multi-chambered mixing device has a spheroidal
          chamber, a toroidal chamber partially surrounding the
          spheroidal chamber and a cylindrical chamber having an outlet
          opening at one end and a flared inlet opening at the other
          end. The toroidal chamber functions as a manifold and is
          optional. Multiple direct inlets are sometimes preferred in
          which case, the mixing device is typically two-chambered. The
          cylindrical chamber is partially surrounded by the spheroidal
          chamber and the flared inlet opening is located within the
          spheroidal chamber while the outlet opening is located outside
          the spheroidal chamber. The spheroidal chamber is formed from
          two hemispheroidal shells each having a rim for joining to the
          rim of the other, and the toroidal chamber is formed between
          one hemispheroidal shell and a truncated hemispheroidal shell
          having a rim for joining to the rim of said one hemispheroidal
          shell. There is an inlet opening into the toroidal chamber for
          accepting a fluid mixture and a plurality of apertures in the
          one hemispheroidal shell for passing a fluid mixture from the
          toroidal chamber to the spheroidal chamber.<br>
          <br>
          Also in general, a high efficiency free-standing gas fired
          space heater has a preheated gaseous fuel mixed with air in a
          multi-chamber mixer, and the resulting homogeneous, highly
          combustible mixture fed to a screen-enclosed combustion area
          to be burned.<br>

          The exemplifications set out herein illustrate a preferred
          embodiment of the invention in one form thereof and such
          exemplifications are not to be construed as limiting the scope
          of the disclosure or the scope of the invention in any manner.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The mixing device of the present invention is generally
          spheroidal in shape. It may take on a substantially spherical
          interior configuration, be formed as an oblate or prolate
          spheroid, be ellipsoidal, or have some other similar generally
          globe-like configuration all hereinafter referred to as
          spheroidal or, in the case of its halves, hemispheroidal.<br>
          <br>
          Referring to Figures 1, 2 and 4, the mixing device 11 is
          formed as a generally spheroidal multiple chambered enclosure
          from two hemispheroidal shells 13 and 15. The shells each have
          a rim (16 and 18 in Figure 4) for joining to the rim of the
          other as indicated at 19 to form the generally spheroidal
          chamber 33. There is a further truncated hemispheroidal shell
          17 which also has a rim 20 for joining to the rim 18 of
          hemispheroidal shell 17 again as indicated at 19. The rims may
          be joined by a series of rivets such as 47, by welding, or by
          some other suitable technique.<br>
          <br>
          The truncated hemispheroidal shell 17 is larger than and nests
          with hemispheroidal shell 15 when they are joined to form a
          generally toriodal chamber 34.<br>
          <br>
          There is at least one and frequently a plurality of apertures
          such as 21, 23 and 31 in the hemispheroidal shell 15 which
          form passageways between the chamber 34 and chamber 33.
          Finally, there is a pipe 29 forming, on its interior, a
          cylindrical chamber and on its exterior, a surface which
          influences the flow directions within the chamber 33. The pipe
          passes through the hemispheroidal shell 13 to provide an
          outlet from the chamber 33.<br>
          <br>
          This pipe 29 passes substantially through the spheroidal
          interior of chamber 33 alid terminates in a flared end near
          the flattened inner surface 27 of hemispheroidal shell 15.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, there is a planar surface portion 27 adjacent the flared
          pipe end. In one implementation, the central angle subtended
          by the flattened surface area 27 was about 20 degrees. In that
          same implementation, the central angle subtended by the
          apertures, e.g., between 21 and 31 was about 60 degrees. The
          flared pipe end and the flattened surface 27 cooperate to
          induce a helical tornado-like flow through the pipe. A surface
          tension reducing polytetrafluoroethylene coating (45 in Figure
          4) may be applied to the inner surfaces of the hemispheroidal
          shells. A similar coating may be applied to the inner surface
          of the truncated hemispheroidal shell 17 if desired.<br>
          <br>
          There is a generally circular opening 25 formed where the
          truncated hemispheroidal shell is truncated for receiving a
          fuel-air mixture, for example, from the piezoelectric
          evaporator 37 of Figure 3. The pipe 29 extends from the
          hemispheroidal shell 13 a distance sufficient to provide a
          connection for conveying a homogeneous combustible mixture
          from the device to a fuel utilization device such as the
          combustion chamber 41 of Figure 3.<br>
          <br>
          The method of operation of the mixing device should now be
          clear. Fuel and air enter the inlet opening 25 with the
          fuel-air mixture flowing laminarly through that opening. The
          mixture then moves somewhat radially through the toriodal
          chamber 34 and from that chamber through the plurality of
          apertures 21, 23, 31 into the spheroidal chamber 33. The
          mixture flows turbulently through the chamber 33 and into the
          flared end of the pipe 29. Flow continues to be turbulent
          (actually tornado-like) through the pipe 29 and finally
          becomes a laminar flow as the extremely well mixed fuel-air
          exits the pipe 29. The tortuous path and turbulent flow
          contributes significantly to intimate mixing of the fuel with
          the air thereby improving combustion.<br>
          <br>
          As one example of a system utilizing the mixing device 11, the
          combustion device or system of Figure 3 includes a liquid fuel
          source 12 and a piezoelectric evaporator for agitating the
          fuel and changing the liquid fuel into a gaseous phase. The
          mixing device 11 as heretofor described receives the fuel
          vapor and air from source 10 and combines the gaseous fuel
          with air to form a homogeneous fuel-air mixture. The laminar
          flow output end of the pipe 29 conveys the fuel-air mixture
          from the mixing device by way of a blower 39 and one or more
          fire screens 43 to a combustion chamber 41. The fire screens
          43 are present merely as a precaution against combustion
          moving upstream in the system.<br>
          <br>
          As a second example of a system utilizing the mixing device
          11, an engine driven generator 49 of Figure 5 which may be,
          for example, of the emergency or "back-up" variety, receives
          its fuel-air mixture from pipe 29 of mixing device 11. The
          fuel, typically gasoline, is fed from supply 12 to an
          evaporating unit 51 and then to the inlet 25 of mixing device
          11.<br>
          <br>
          If the mixing device 11 is too large for a given application,
          the flow rate through it is too slow to induce the desired
          turbulence and the degree of mixing suffers. If the mixing
          device is too small for a given application, the throttling
          effect limits flow and performance suffers. In one
          implementation, a 5" diameter mixing device was found to work
          well with engines having displacements between 60 cc and 300
          cc, but performance was poor outside that range.<br>
          <br>
          Inlet manifold 34 may be replaced by individual inlet lines
          such as 53, 55 and 57 as shown in the modified mixing device 1
          la of Figures 6 and 7. These individual inlet lines 53, 55 and
          57 may be coupled together and to a source of fuel such as the
          evaporator 51 or 37, or may be coupled to different sources so
          that the mixing device may function to homogenize a plurality
          of different materials. Eight different materials could be
          mixed by the illustrated mixing device, but more or fewer
          inlets could be provided. Also, the inlets may be elongated
          slots rather than circular. Generally twelve inlets is
          preferred.<br>
          <br>
          As one more example of a system utilizing the mixing device
          11, the combustion device or system of Figure 8 includes a
          gaseous fuel source 61 such as natural or LP gas.<br>
          <br>
          The mixing device 11 as heretofor described receives the fuel
          and air from source 10 and combines the gaseous fuel with air
          to form a homogeneous fuel-air mixture. The laminar flow
          output end of the pipe 29 conveys the fuel-air mixture from
          the mixing device by way of a blower 65 and one or more fire
          screens 67 to a combustion chamber 71. Again, the fire screens
          67 are present merely as a precaution against combustion
          moving upstream in the system.<br>
          <br>
          An implementation of the system shown in Figure 8 appears in
          Figures 9 10 and 11. In Figure 9, the shroud 69 has air
          admitting apertures in a base portion 105 as well as in base
          support plate 103. Cool air enters the apertures and is heated
          in the shroud.<br>
          <br>
          Hot air exits through an open or apertured top. The unit rests
          on legs such as 101. The combustion chamber 71 is supported by
          a central tubular support 107 from which wires or rods 109
          extend upwardly. The combustion chamber 71 includes a
          screened-in region 115.<br>
          <br>
          In Figure 9, a gaseous fuel source 61 such as a natural gas
          meter, LP gas tank or the like supplies fuel through the
          conduit 73 which extends along a circuitous path first
          upwardly, then along the bottom of the outer chamber 69, and
          finally back downwardly and to one inlet to mixer 11. The
          conduit may extend along the bottom of chamber 69 or may be
          otherwise disposed in close proximity to the outer chamber 69.
          Thus, heat from the combustion chamber 71 provides the fuel
          preheating function 63. A source of combustion air 10 provides
          another inlet to the mixer 11. A motor 75 drives blower 65
          forcing the fuel-air mixture from the mixer 11 upwardly
          through fire screen 67 and into the conduit 77. The open end
          81 of conduit 77 functions as a burner outlet within the
          combustion chamber 71 and is shown in greater detail in Figure
          10. Electrically energizable igniter electrodes 79 and 84
          similar to those employed on conventional home gas furnaces is
          positioned closely adjacent the burner outlet 81. Also closely
          adjacent the burner outlet is a flame detector 87 of
          conventional type which functions as a safety device to shut
          off the flow of fuel when a flame should be present, but is
          not detected.<br>
          <br>
          An automatic shut-off solenoid 85 operates a butterfly valve
          89 or similar control valve within pipe 77 to close the pipe
          77 when the burner shuts off. Thus, an intentional or failsafe
          shutdown of the burner causes valve 89 to close as well as
          disconnecting fan motor 75 and closing a control valve (not
          shown) in the fuel supply line 73. This traps a fuel-air
          mixture within the system facilitating subsequent re-ignition.
          There is also a vane 83 within the pipe 77 open end formed
          generally from a flat sheet of metal which has been twisted so
          the edges are generally helical where they contact the inside
          wall of the pipe 77. This vane is for introducing a swirling
          turbulence into the fuel-air mixture as it exits the burner
          outlet 81. A metal enclosure or burner head 71 has screen 115
          which surrounds the burner outlet 81, igniter 79 and vane 83.
          The region within the metal screen 115 is the combustion
          region or chamber while the outer chamber or shroud 69 is
          rather larger and may be enclosed by one or more glass or
          metal plates as desired.<br>
          <br>
          Screen 115 functions somewhat like a lantern mantle and takes
          on a red glow during operation. Little or no flame appears
          beyond the confines of the metal screen.<br>
          <br>
          Figures 12-14 illustrate yet another variation on the
          combustion chamber of the present invention. Here, a highly
          temperature resistant combustion chamber is formed as a
          ceramic or stainless steel globe 117 open at the top and at
          the bottom and having generally serpentine shaped sidewalls.
          Beginning at the bottom, there is a relatively narrow region
          125 and then the globe widening into an intermediate region
          127 and finally narrows near the top at 129. The uppermost
          region of the globe is a flared mouth region 131 at the top.
          Figure 14 is a top view and illustrates the ceramic globe as
          an elongated generally racetrack shape while the top view of
          Figure 13 illustrates an alternative configuration where the
          globe is a surface of revolution.<br>
          <br>
          Fuel is conveyed to the combustion chamber of Figures 12 and
          13 by a fuel conveying tube 119 which extends centrally
          upwardly into the bottom of the globe. The fuel conveying tube
          119 has wires or rods 121 which support a conical diverter 123
          which urges the hot gasses outwardly so as to follow the
          serpentine contour of the globe inner sidewalls. As with the
          embodiment of Figures 9-11, combustion chamber 117 may be
          disposed within a shroud having an air inlet and an air outlet
          along with convection or some other means for circulating cool
          air into the inlet, through the shroud and hot air out of the
          outlet. If the globe 117 is elongated, the fuel may be
          supplied by an elongated manifold 133 similar to burner units
          found on home barbecue devices. A V-shaped spreader similar to
          the diverter 123 may be positioned over the manifold 133 if
          desired.<br>

          <b> </b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          This invention relates to liquid hydrocarbon fuel supply
          systems for spark ignition or diesel internal combustion
          engines and, more particularly, to the incorporation of a
          partial vaporizer within the system for varporization of the
          lighter fractions of the fuel and supplying the same to the
          incoming air supply to the engine prior to passage through the
          engine carburetor or its equivalent and the engine intake
          manifold.<br>
          <br>
          <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <br>
          Standard automotive internal combustion engine carburetion
          systems presently in use demand that the liquid fuel
          (gasoline) remain in a liquid state until its release, just
          prior to entering the engine intake manifold. As the engine
          intake manifolds have means for adding excessively high
          temperatures to the manifold materials passing therethrough by
          means of exhaust gas flow, a major portion of the fuel that
          would normally evaporate at relatively low temperature is
          damaged (carbonized) by this excessively high temperature
          prior to entering the engine combustion chambers and is no
          longer of any use. Additionally, the "time" factors involved
          do not allow for near complete vaporization (due to flow
          velocities up to 300 mph) to occur from the point of release
          of the liquid fuel, until it enters the extremely high
          temperatures of the combustion chambers themselves. Mixing of
          the liquid hydrocarbon with combustion air is also very
          limited and proper combustion requires the joining of proper
          amount of oxygen with the fuel to burn the fuel rapidly and
          completely. As a result of the above, only a minor portion of
          the fuel presently inducted into standard fuel systems is
          properly utilized as power output of the internal combustion
          engine.<br>
          <br>
          It is, therefore, a primary object of the present invention to
          overcome the problems inherent in standard fuel systems for
          internal combustion engines by partially vaporizing the light
          components or fractions of the liquid hydrocarbon fuel prior
          to entering the standard carburetor and for supplying those
          vaporized light components to the incoming air supply,
          separate from the heavier liquid fuel components in fine
          liquid particle form supplied at the carburetor or its
          equivalent to that incoming air supply.<br>
          <br>
          <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b></b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The present invention is directed to a split vapor/liquid fuel
          supply system for an internal combustion engine having: an
          intake manifold leading to at least one combustion chamber, a
          fuel tank holding a liquid hydrocarbon fuel supply and
          connected to the carburetor for feeding the fuel thereto, and
          air supply means for supplying engine intake air to the
          carburetor for mixing with the fuel. The improvement comprises
          a partial fuel vaporizer connected intermediate of the fuel
          tank and the carburetor. The partial fuel vaporizer includes
          an underlying liquid fuel chamber and an overlying vapor
          expansion chamber, means defining an intermediate main housing
          and a heat transfer plate having small diameter holes or
          passage means therethrough. The heat transfer plate separates
          the vapor expansion chamber from a bubble/liquid chamber
          section defined by the heat transfer plate and a perforated
          air distribution plate. Means are provided for permitting
          ambient air to enter an air/liquid chamber section below the
          liquid fuel level therein for percolation therethrough and the
          perforated air distribution plate. Bubbles of air then pass
          through said heat transfer plate. Tube means connect the vapor
          expansion chamber to said air suppy means (air intake housing)
          of said carburetor upstream of said carburetor. Further tube
          means connect said liquid fuel chamber to said carburetor,
          whereby the light hydrocarbon fuel components, in vapor form,
          from the vapor expansion chamber mix with the main intake air
          stream prior to its passage through the carburetor providing
          an increased time factor of air/fuel mixing. The result is
          less liquid fuel is needed by the engine, the speed of the
          flame front is increased within the combustion chamber,
          greater portions of the fuel are burned in the power stroke of
          the engine and there is less fuel waste during the engine
          piston exhaust stroke.<br>
          <br>
          The partial vaporizer may comprise a three-part housing
          including a lower liquid fuel housing, an upper vapor
          expansion chamber housing and a main housing or perforated
          heat transfer plate positioned between the upper and lower
          housings, all forming a vertically stacked array. Means are
          provided for sealing said upper and lower housings to
          respective faces of the heat transfer plate at their
          peripheries. The lower liquid fuel housing may include a float
          chamber separate form the liquid fuel chamber, a fuel intake
          line connected to the float chamber, a float valve within the
          chamber controlling the liquid fuel level within the float
          chamber and the liquid fuel chamber and a fuel feed passage
          within the lower housing connecting the float chamber to the
          liquid fuel chamber. The float is located such that the liquid
          fuel is maintained at a level within the lower liquid fuel
          housing just below the perforated heat transfer plate.<br>
          <br>
          The means for feeding air to the liquid fuel chamber below the
          liquid fuel level comprises an air passageway opening to the
          interior of the liquid fuel chamber below the level of
          accumulated liquid fuel. A perforated air distribution plate
          may be mounted within said lower liquid fuel housing above the
          opening of the air passageway thereto and an imperforate
          barrier plate or mesh screen or the like loosely mounted
          within said liquid fuel chamber beneath said perforated air
          distribution plate and below the level of said air inlet to
          said liquid fuel chamber. As such, liquid fueld, free of air
          bubbles, seeps by gravity into the bottom of the liquid fuel
          chamber about the periphery of the imperforate barrier plate.
          Relatively large air bubbles percolate through the
          bubble/liquid chamber section of the liquid fuel chamber
          between the air distribution plate and the barrier plate, pass
          through the perforations within the perforated air
          distribution plate and escape from the liquid fuel above the
          liquid level within the air/liquid chamber section prior to
          passage through the perforated heat transfer plate. A vacuum
          relief valve may be provided within the upper housings for
          permitting atmospheric air to enter the vapor expansion
          chamber under very high engine air intake vacuum pressure
          conditions. Preferably, the float chamber is vented to the
          vapor expansion chamber. The ambient air inlet passage to the
          liquid fuel chamber preferably includes a check valve to
          prevent fuel leakage from the liquid fuel chamber through the
          air inlet. the upper and lower liquid fuel housings may be of
          conical shape to facilitate expansion of the air and vapor
          mixture entering the vapor expansion chamber and concentration
          of the liquid fuel within respective upper and lower housings.
          The perforated heat transfer plate preferably includes a
          plurality of spaced vertical holes therein passing
          therethrough and expanding in the direction leading from the
          bubble/liquid chamber section to the vapor expansion chamber.
          The upper and lower housings may be of thermal insulative
          material and the heat transfer plate formed of a high thermal
          conductivity metal.<br>

          <b> </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</b><br>
          <br>
          Turning to FIG. 1, the split vapor/liquid fuel supply system
          of the present invention may be incorporated within any
          internal combustion engine, although preferably a gasoline
          fueled, spark ignition-type, internal combustion engines. The
          system indicated generally at 10 is shown as applied to such
          internal combustion engine 12 which is supplied with fuel
          carried by a fuel tank 14. The engine includes an air filter
          16 mounted to the top of the engine, and overlying the engine
          carburetor 18. Air enters the air filter housing 16a through
          an inlet tube 20 which opens to the ambient air. Ambient air
          enters as shown by arrow 22. Typically, a fuel pump 24 is
          mechanically driven by the engine 12, as at 26, and the pump
          24 is connected into a fuel supply line, indicated generally
          at 28, leading from the tank 14.<br>
          <br>
          The split vapor/liquid fuel supply system 10 of the present
          invention incorporates, as a primary component of the system,
          a partial vaporizer or device, indicated generally at 30,
          which is connected within the fuel supply line segment 28a via
          a fuel supply inlet fitting 32, opening to the partial
          vaporizer at its center. At the bottom of the partial
          vaporizer, a liquid fuel supply outlet fitting 34 connects
          back to a further segment 28b of the fuel supply line 28,
          which feeds to the carburetor 18 and is connected thereto in a
          conventional manner by a carburetor fuel supply connection or
          fitting 36. Further, the partial vaporizer includes a vapor
          outlet fitting 38 at the top thereof and connects via a
          vapor/air line or tube 40 to the air filter housing 16a such
          that the lighter fuel, in vapor form and mixed with some
          ambient air, in turn mixes with the main stream of intake air
          22 prior to passage through the carburetor and via intake
          manifold 42 to the combustion chambers 48 formed by pistons 46
          reciprocating within engine cylinders 44. Alternatively, tube
          40 may connect to the air inlet tube 20 of the air filter 16.
          The interior of the partial vaporizer 30 is open to
          atmospheric air via an air passageway, indicated generally at
          126.<br>
          <br>
          Turning to FIGS. 2-4 inclusive it may be seen that, with
          respect to the major component of the system 10, partial
          vaporizer 30 is composed of a vertical stack of three major
          housing components, a central or intermediate main housing or
          heat transfer plate 100, a lower liquid fuel housing 102 and
          an upper fuel vapor expansion housing 104. The main housing or
          heat transfer plate 100 which necessarily is of a high heat
          conductive material may be of cast or machined aluminum, of
          modified circular disk form including a short vertical height
          cylindrical portion 101 extending upwardly from an integral,
          perforated plate portion 103. The plate portion 103 is
          extended to one side by a float chamber cover portion at 103a,
          which covers a float chamber 131 defined principally by
          portion 102a of the lower liquid fuel housing 102. The
          cylindrical portion 101 of the main housing or heat transfer
          plate 100 includes an annular face 105 which faces a matching
          annular face 107 of the upper vapor expansion housing 104.
          Housing 104 is of generally conical form and terminates at its
          apex in a cylindrical end cap 104a. While it is essential that
          the main housing or heat transfer plate 100 be formed of a
          high heat conductive material such as aluminum, it is
          preferred that the lower liquid fuel housing 102 and the upper
          housing 104 be formed of a thermal insulative material such as
          a ceramic. The lower liquid fuel housing 102 is of conical
          configuration and includes an annular upper face 109 which
          abuts the lower face 111 of the heat transfer plate portion
          103 of the central component. In the illustrated embodiment,
          in addition to the main housing or heat transfer plate 100,
          the upper and lower housings are also formed of cast metal. In
          casting the main housing or heat transfer plate 100, a cavity
          119 is cast or otherwise recess formed within the bottom of
          the float chamber portion 103a, while a frustoconical recess
          121 is formed within the upper face of heat transfer plate
          100, at the center thereof, defining a relatively thick
          perforated heat transfer plate portion 103. Heat transfer
          plate 100 carries a large number of tapered or otherwise
          varying diameter vertical holes 112 passing through the samne
          and which holes narrow downwardly in the direction of the
          bottom surface 111 of the main housing or heat transfer plate
          100. Preferably the holes 112 are of conical form although
          they may be made by using decreasingly sized drill bits
          starting with a larger diameter drill bit from the top surface
          123 of heat transfer plate portion 103 bearing holes 112
          downwardly and decreasing the size of the drill bits employed
          and thus the diameter of drilled hole portions thereof. For
          instance, the upper third may be drilled using a No. 38 size
          drill, the center third being drilled with a No. 44 size drill
          bit, and the final (liquid fuel side) being drilled with a No.
          53 size drill bit. In the nonperforated area of the heat
          transfer plate 100 and, outwardly of the same, outwardly
          oblique annular wall 125 lead from surface 123 to the annular
          face 105 of the main housing or heat transfer plate 100 which
          faces the lower annular face 107 of the conical upper vapor
          expansion housing 104.<br>
          <br>
          In casting or otherwise forming the lower liquid fuel housing
          102, the housing 102 is so cast as to form a conical main
          section 102b and, to the side thereof, an integral float
          chamber section or portion 102a, underlying the float chamber
          cover section 103a of the main housing or heat transfer plate
          100. The annular upper face 111 of the main housing or heat
          transfer plate 100 and of the lower liquid fuel housing 102 is
          extended by the presence of the float chamber face section
          109a, which mates with the lower surface 111 of the main
          housing or heat transfer plate 100. The cover portion 103a of
          the main housing and heat transfer plate 100 forms with the
          float chamber section 102a of the lower liquid fuel housing,
          float chamber 131. Chamber 131 is of generally horizontally
          elongated, rectangular form. Further, in casting or otherwise
          forming the lower liquid fuel housing 102, conical internal
          wall 127 defined liquid fuel chamber 134. Housing 102 is
          provided with a pair of radially enlarged recesses 135, 137,
          respectively, in the direction of the upper face 109 of that
          member, forming steps or annular ledges 129, 133,
          respectively. The steps 129, 133 form seats upon which rest,
          respectively, a circular disc form, barrier plate 106 and a
          perforated, air distribution plate 108. Alternatively a mesh
          screen, such as one of 200 mesh may be substituted for plate
          106. Further, a vertically axially liquid fuel outlet hole 140
          is drilled or otherwise formed within the bottom lower liquid
          fuel housing 102, at its conical apex, and mounts liquid fuel
          outlet fitting 34 connected to fuel line section 28b, FIG. 1,
          leading to the engine carburetor 18.<br>
          <br>
          The stacked assembly of the lower liquid fuel housing 102, the
          main housing or heat transfer plate 100 and upper housing 104
          may be achieved by the utilization of a series of assembly
          screws 139, at spaced circumferential postiions, which pass
          through smooth bores or holes 141 within the upper housing
          104, and 143 through the main housing or heat transfer plate
          100 screws 139 terminate in threaded terminal ends 139a
          threadably received by taped holes 145 within the lower liquid
          fuel housing 102. Preferably, annular gaskets 147 and 149 are
          positioned, respectively, between the abutting faces 105, 107
          of members 104 and 100; and annular face 109 of the lower
          liquid fuel housing 102 and the bottom face 111 of the main
          housing or heat transfer plate 100.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in FIG. 2A, a vertically drilled hole 146 extends
          downwardly through the upper housing 104, the main housing or
          heat transfer plate 100 and to a certain extent within the
          lower liquid fuel housing 102, which hole 146 intersects a
          horizontal hole 148 opening to the liquid fuel chamber 134
          below the surface level L of liquid fuel F nearly filling the
          liquid fuel chamber 134 within the lower liquid fuel housing
          102. Holes 146 and 148 form air passageway 126. A check valve
          136 is provided within passageway 126 to prevent fuel from
          exiting through holes 148, 146 to the outside but permitting
          ambient air to be drawn into the liquid fuel chamber 134 as a
          result of vacuum pressure being created within the vapor
          expansion chamber 114. As may be appreciated, the air
          passageway 126 may be formed by other than the right angle
          intersecting holes 146, 148 and it is not necessary that the
          air passage 126 extend through all three main components. It
          is only necessary that the air passageway 126 open internally
          beneath the liquid fuel level L within the lower liquid fuel
          housing 102 and that it open to the exterior, at some height
          above the level.<br>
          <br>
          The liquid hydrocarbon fuel (gasoline) enters the float
          chamber 131 from fuel ine 28a as a result of operation of
          engine driven fuel pump 24. Float chamber 131 vents to vapor
          expansion chamber 114 via one or more holes 116 passing
          through plate 100. The float 130, forming a part of float
          valve 130a, pivots about a horizontal axis defined by an axle
          150 and bears a vertically displaceable valve member 152 which
          moves toward and away from a valve orifice or annular valve
          seat 154, opening to a vertical outlet port 156 within which
          fuel inlet fitting 32 is sealably mounted. Fitting 32 connects
          to the fuel line section 28a. Thus, the liquid hydrocarbon
          fuel enters the chamber 131 and is maintained within a
          reasonable tolerance of level L within a bubble/liquid chamber
          section 144. Fuel completely fills the underlying air/liquid
          chamber section 142 of the liquid fuel chamber 134. By the
          utilization of ledges or steps 129, 133, the circular disc
          form barrier plate 106 and perforated air distribution plate
          108 seat, respectively, thereon. Plate 108 may be screwed to
          ledge 133. The partial vaporizer 30 is so designed as to
          create a lowermost section 134a of chamber 134 for the
          accumulation of pure liquid fuel, an intermediate section 142
          for creating large air bubbles B within the liquid fuel
          captured therein (between the overlying perforated air
          distribution plate 108 and the underlying imperforate barrier
          plate 106), and a thick bubble/liquid chamber section 144
          wherein the bubbles of fuel captured air B escape from the
          liquid fuel above level L to contact the heat transfer plate
          portion 103 of the main housing 100. By the utilization of the
          three chambers sections therein, there is promoted the
          separation of the lighter fuel components or fractions of the
          liquid hydrocarbon fuel (gasoline) and their passage in vapor
          form to mix with the main stream of combustion air feeding to
          the carburetor and prior to its contact with the balance of
          the liquid fuel F fed via the liquid fuel outlet 140 to the
          carburetor.<br>
          <br>
          It should also be noted that the air/liquid chamber section
          142 is at the level where both the fuel F enters from the
          connected flow chamber 131 via transfer fuel feed passage 128
          and wherein, a controlled amount of ambient air A, FIG. 2A, is
          drawn in through air passageway 126 by engine vacuum created
          within the air filter 16, FIG. 1, and which vacuum pressure is
          transferred to the vapor expansion chamber 114 via tube 40
          connected therebetween.<br>
          <br>
          The presence of the perforated air distribution plate 108
          which is provided with a given number of openings or holes 110
          to cause the air stream entering device 30 at check valve 136.
          FIG. 2A, to break up into air bubbles which pass upwardly
          through the liquid fuel for release from the liquid fuel
          surface level L. In the illustrated embodiment, plate 108
          which may be formed of thin sheet metal such as aluminum,
          carries 24 holes in a random pattern of 3/32 inch diameter. By
          operation of the float 130, the fuel level L is maintained
          approximately 1/8 inch below the bottom surface 111 of the
          heat transfer plate 100 and within the bubble/liquid chamber
          section 144. This gap allows the fuel/air bubbles passing
          upwardly through the perforated air distribution palte 108 to
          reach their maximum expansion prior to bursting at the surface
          level L, thus causing a very thin film of fuel to come into
          contact with the heat transfer plate 100 at the small diameter
          holes 112 formed within the heat transfer plate portion 103 of
          that member. In the illustrated embodiment, there are 90 small
          diameter holes 112 which are randomly located in member 100
          but with the holes being no closer to each other than 3/16
          inch. The holes 112 diverge upwardly with their openings
          within surface 111 being, exemplary of .063 diameter. An air
          fuel mixture passes through the holes 112 subject to the heat
          of vaporization from plate 100 and the air fuel mixture in
          vapor form is encouraged to expand further by the diverge
          shape given to the lower portion of the vapor expansion
          chamber 114, i.e., recess 121 within the upper face of the
          main housing and heat transfer plate 100. If hydrocarbon fuel
          in liquid form passes through openings 112 which does not
          vaporize during that passage, such liquid fuel, in droplet
          form, will pass back into the bubble/liquid chamber section
          144, through the openings or holes 112.<br>
          <br>
          It may be appreciated the volume or flow rate of air A, FIG.
          2A which is allowed to enter into and mix with the liquid fuel
          F within the air/liquid chamber section 142 is controlled by
          sizing of the air passageway 126, and/or check valve 136. For
          example, for use in a 305 swept displacement engine, the hole
          diameter of 126 would be restricted to 1/8 inch while for a
          600 CI swept displacement engine, the diameter of the air
          passageway 126 (or the check valve 136 outlet) would be on the
          order of 1/4 inch.<br>
          <br>
          Further, a vapor outlet passage, indicated generally at 117,
          and defined by intersecting holes 113, 115 is sized
          accordingly, to limit the output flow of air/fuel vapor V.
          Correspondingly, for a 305 swept displacement engine, the
          outlet diameter of hole 115 may be on the order of 1/4 inch,
          while for the 600 CI swept displacement engine, the outlet
          diameter may be limited to 3/8 inch.<br>
          <br>
          Excess fuel vapor output will detract from the engine
          operation unless the liquid fuel flow is decreased accordingly
          for a standard carburetor fed internal combustion engine.
          Additionally, upon hard acceleration wherein a "shock" of high
          engine intake manifold vacuum pressure is applied to the
          expansion chamber 114, it is necessary to utilize a vacuum
          relief valve 122 to prevent liquid fuel from being drawn out
          of the vapor/air outlet 38 at that relatively high vacuum
          pressure. The upper housing 104 carries a pair of oblique air
          inlet holes 120 which open to a diverging conical bore portion
          146a of bore 146 which bore 146 extends completely through the
          wall of the upper housing 104. Bore 146 supports a headed
          valve member 150 which is spring biased by an expansion coil
          spring 151. Coil spring 151 is compressed between a washer 153
          fixed to the projecting end of the valve stem 150b of valve
          member 150 and the outside face of the upper housing 104 such
          that the enlarged conical valve head 150a of the valve 150
          seats on the conical surface 146a to close off the paired air
          inlet holes 120.<br>
          <br>
          In operation, the liquid hydrocarbon fuel pumped by the
          standard fuel pump 24 feeds to the float chamber 131 of the
          partial vaporizer or device 30. Within the device 30, liquid
          fuel flows from the float chamber 131, controlled by the float
          valve 130a, to maintain a given fuel level L within chamber
          131 and bubble/liquid chamber section 144 at L as shown. The
          liquid fuel heavier components drain by gravity into chamber
          section 134a and passes via the liquid fuel outlet fitting 34
          and fuel line section 28b to the standard carburetor 18, FIG.
          1, (or thereto, via an added electric fuel pump). Upon
          starting of the engine, a vacuum pressure is created within
          the engine air filter chamber 16b, via the intake manifold 18,
          and that vacuum pressure is transferred via the vapor/air
          outlet line 40 to subject the interior of the expansion
          chamber 114, FIG. 2A to that below atmospheric pressure. The
          vacuum pressure acts to cause atmospheric air A to enter air
          passageway 126 through filter element 124, with check valve
          136 opening, to cause air introduction into the body of fuel F
          below the surface level L of the fuel accumulating within the
          lower liquid fuel housing 102. The incoming air stream
          provides two important functions. The first is to thin the
          fuel as described, that is, to function to remove the fuel
          light components and, secondly, to act as a "carrier" for the
          light component vapors and to rapidly move them into the
          engine intake air, which would normally not occur due to the
          molecular weight of the hydrocarbon fuel.<br>
          <br>
          Under engine idle conditions, very little movement occurs due
          to the minimal pressure drop produced in expansion chamber
          114, but, as the engine throttle opening increases, an
          increasing vacuum pressure is produced in direct proportion to
          the throttle opening size. This results automatically in an
          increase or decrease of the volume of light component fuel
          vapor produced by the device and the flow rate of the same of
          the engine intake air within the air filter 16. In the
          preferred embodiment shown, the vapor/air line 40 from the
          device 30 attaches to the filter housing on the outside of the
          air filter element 16. In this manner, a greater degree of
          mixing is achieved by the fresh intake air and the air/vapor
          emanating from the expansion chamber 114 of the partial
          vaporizer 30 as they pass through the filter element 16 and
          into the carburetor 18. The filter element 16 also acts as a
          fire barrier should a malfunction of the engine occur and
          engine backfire. In some cases, it may be desirable to connect
          the outlet end of the vapor/air line 40 to the filter housing
          16a at a point radially inside of the filter element 16
          wherein a greater distance of vacuum pressure exists. If this
          is the case, a fire stop (not shown) may be required. A fire
          stop may constitute a simple stainless steel mesh screen in
          the 200 strand per inch range, which is large enough in size
          to prevent its being a restriction to flow. Such screens have
          an open area of approximately 33% and, via proper calculation,
          appropriate sizing can be determined to ensure the proper
          ratio of air and air vapor flow mixture prior to entering the
          engine carburetor 18.<br>
          <br>
          In the vapor state, the mixture V, shown by arrow, FIG. 2 is
          no longer subject to damage by high temperature within the
          intake manifold 42 or combustion chamber. The presence of the
          air/vapor mixture V creates a more rapid spread of the flame
          front of ignition occurring within the combustion chamber,
          thus allowing more of the liquid fuel which enters the
          combustion chamber in fine particle form within this combined
          air/air vapor stream to convert to vapor in the fractional
          time period allotted of the power stroke and in turn to
          develop propulsive (gas pressure) energy as a result of
          combustion. When properly sized and installed, the split fuel
          supply system of the present invention accomplishes a major
          lowering of exhaust pollutants.<br>
          <br>
          To further assist the mixing of fuel and air and to add
          increased vaporization for the lighter components or fractions
          of the liquid hydrocarbon fuel, the invention contemplates
          placement of one or more manifold inserts 160 in standard
          openings of conventional internal combustion engine intake
          manifolds 42. Such inserts 160 cause a static disruption to
          the flows leaving the carburetor venturi. Modestly heated by
          the intake manifold 42, the liquid fuel coming into contact
          with the insert is given the opportunity to pick up additional
          heat of vaporization to vaporize any lighter elements or
          components of the hydrocarbon fuel still remaining.
          Additionally, the static distribution causes the air to mix to
          a greater degree than could otherwise be expected, offering
          the hydrocrbon molecules the opportunity to take on more of
          the oxygen atoms needed for proper combustion. Test results
          show an added 2 to nearly 3 miles per gallon when incorporated
          within the fuel supply system as described hereinbefore on a
          1984 GMC 8-cylinder truck and a 1979 Chrysler New Yorker, thus
          roughly a 16% increase in fuel economy. Materials utilized for
          such inserts are required to be heat transferable such as
          aluminum of TEFLON-coated copper (bare copper deters gasoline
          vaporization). Additionally, the vapor/air outlet line 40 is
          required to be of a material that does not deter vapor flow
          and is slippery relative to this flow to allow unimpeded flow
          of the vapor from the expansion chamber 114 to the engine air
          filter housing 16a. In this respect, rubber lines are
          unsatisfactory.<br>
          <br>
          From the above description, it is readily apparent that due to
          the inherent nature of the lighter components of gasoline to
          readily vaporize at any ambient temperature, the split
          vapor/liquid fuel supply system of the present invention is
          highly desirable in gaining increased fuel economy at minimal
          cost and expense and is applicable to the highly controlled
          carburetors and ignition systems utilized in today's
          automotive vehicle industry. Due to the time factors in
          standard carburetor systems combined with the high flow
          velocities involved, there is a considerable limit both in
          terms of achieving vaporization of the fuel and its ability to
          combine with combustion oxygen prior to the power stroke of
          the engine. Applicant's theory involves the utilization of
          vapors in relatively small quantities from the partial
          vaporizer 30 to "tinder" the intake air 22 which modestly
          changes the speed at which combustion occurs, which results in
          added power output per stroke with the end result being less
          fuel required for a given engine performance.<br>
          <br>
          While the invention has been illustrated in terms of a partial
          vaporizer having a relatively large number of components, the
          partial vaporizer itself may be simplified and some of the
          components eliminated while still obtaining most of the
          desired effects and to a significantly high degree of
          worthwhile fuel economy, while achieving increased power
          output of the engine incorporating such fuel supply systems.
          However, the lower liquid fuel chamber 134 appears to be an
          absolute necessity to eliminate air-saturated fuel from
          leaving the device and delivery to the standard carburetor.
          The function of the barrier plate 106 which is imperforate
          (without significant passage therethrough) and is normally
          sized of a diameter slightly smaller than the diameter of the
          recess 135 bearing the same so as to permit a somewhat loose
          floating within the liquid fuel chamber 134 and fuel passage
          about the periphery thereof seeking outlet at 140, is to
          isolate the lower liquid fuel chamber section 134a from the
          intermediate air/liquid chamber section 142, within which the
          air percolates. The perforated air distribution plate 108
          could be eliminated and the device would still function,
          although to a slightly lesser degree than that described.
          Further, the air input location, i.e., the terminus of passage
          126 at check valve 136, may be varied but must be at some
          point below the surface level L of the liquid fuel so as to
          cause the necessary bubbling action. Heat may be added to the
          ambient air flow within air passageway 126. However, it is not
          seen that a large benefit will be experienced by preheating
          the air. Most of the desired separation of the lighter
          components of the liquid hydrocarbon fuel from the balance of
          such fuel, the carrying of the lighter components by the air
          bubbles and in turn the breakdown of the bubbles and the
          mixing of the air and fuel in vapor f/////<br>
          <br>
          orm is achieved by the main housing or heat transfer plate
          100. Holes 112 which could be of a fixed diameter and not
          increase in diameter in a direction away from the liquid fuel
          chamber 134 would provide a useful function, although it is
          believed that the action would produce less conversion of
          fuel. On smaller engines, such an arrangement may be adequate.<br>
          <br>
          The liquid fuel level L should be maintained fairly close to
          the bottom surface 111 of the heat transfer plate 100,
          although some variation may be permitted without adversely
          affecting the system operation. in the production of the
          favorable results documented, the sizes given for the inlet or
          input air passageway 126 and that of the output or outlet
          passage 113 for the vapor/air mixture must be kept within
          reasonable tolerances. Either an excess or too little fuel
          vapor relative to the air bearing same in mixture form will
          detract from the overall results achieved by the exemplary
          system shown. The vacuum pressure relief valve or system 122
          is of necessity to ensure that no liquid fuel is pulled from
          the device on hard acceleration and, while shown as located in
          the upper housing and opening to the chamber 114, it may be
          located where the vapor/air outlet line 40 connects to the air
          filter housing 16a. The frustoconical shape given to the
          expansion cavity 121 within the main housing or heat transfer
          plate 100 and the conical shapes given to the upper and lower
          housings, coupled thereto, may be varied. However, it has been
          found that the utilization of the shapes illustrated is highly
          desirable due to their effect on the flows experienced, thus
          eliminating the normal exit of liquid from the chamber which
          could materially affect the favorable action in joining the
          vapor/air line flow of lighter components to the main intake
          air 22 passing through the air filter 16 prior to mixing with
          fine particles of liquid fuel at the carburetor.<br>

          The heat transfer plate 100 may obviously be made from
          material other than that of aluminum, as long as it is capable
          of transferring sufficient heat from the ambient air. Aluminum
          has been found to be very practical, but mild steel may be
          utilized if coated to prevent rust. Further, the heat transfer
          plate 100 may be fitted with fins to speed up heat transfer.<br>
