          <b> </b>The present invention concerns an engine of
          Navigation. Navigating on a Sea, Lake, Ocean or any surface of
          water shaken by waves, undulations, the streams etc. The
          device according to the invention, aims at supplying a means
          of Navigation's appropriate (clean), easy to practice; it can
          be Additional in the other means of navigation's.<br>
          <br>
          The device according to this invention allows the navigation.
          By converting the Bi-directional Kinetic energy of movements,
          the oscillations, right-left an/or front-back and/or high/down
          .To a Uni-directional (one-way) horizontal push. These
          energies are free,renewable undeveloped in navigations up to
          day. They have an Uncomfortable and incidence.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          This device doing the conversion, a part of the oscillations.
          (Friction, Vertical Level variations), to a (one-way)
          horizontal push.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          In fact, any variation of the boat level is attenuated and
          converted to a uni-directional(One-way) horizontal push. This
          device converting the Bi-directional Kinetic Energy (up/down),
          to a horizontal Kinetic Energy (one-way) A similar device is
          used in the aviation for a century with the success. But in a
          opposite applications. The Aircraft manufacturers, the power
          developed by Engines, reactors pushing in front the Air-plane.
          The arrangement of wings and the position of lids, convert a
          part(party) of this power in a vertical push. Also Gliders
          convert the current of the ascending air(sight) and or while
          losing of height to a uni-directional horizontal push.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          This device is experimented on a prototype-reduced scale and
          it works perfectly. We can do a demonstration .<br>

          While about a month ago I was presenting an article about
          Suntory Mermaid II, a boat powered only by the movement of the
          waves, I am now presenting an inventor, named Francois
          Kneider, who in his seventies, continues to amaze the people
          who know him by the number of ideas he has and the innovations
          he brought to life. In 2005, he focused on building wave
          powered systems for boats.<br>
          <br>
          He has made concepts that shouldn’t work according to
          conventional theories and practices. When examining his
          demonstration of his cold cathode tube, the head of an
          electrical&nbsp; company told him, “It should not work!” while
          admitting that it did.&nbsp; Kneider compared this achievement
          to Newton’s apple remaining suspended in the air, as opposed
          to landing on his head.<br>
          <br>
          Kneider’s idea was to convert a vertical moving wave to push
          the boat on the horizontal. The following images demonstrate
          the concept :<br>
          <br>

          <img alt="" src="pesn4.jpg" height="269" width="328"><br>
          <br>
          Mr. Kneider is disappointed by the current progress in battery
          technologies (as of 2005), instead he says we should use
          self-generated power onboard our boats, because this kind of
          energy usage is the greenest and the most efficient (nothing
          is lost as heat or other forms of energy).<br>
          <br>
          Below is an example of a boat modified to suit the idea of
          self-power. The first example is the boat with the blades set
          for powering it, and the second is the case when, during a
          storm, the blades are raised for not being torn apart (the
          energy is higher than the system can bear, like in the video
          of the wind turbine torn apart by high velocity winds) – click
          to enlarge the photos:<br>
          <br>
          Mr. Kneider also put a comment on this blog for me to check
          out his website and inventions posted on PESN. I thank him for
          that matter. Great inventions!<br>

          <b> </b><b>Abstract</b> -- The invention relates to a device
          for sailing using wave energy, by converting the up-down
          linear movement into a horizontal directional thrust. The
          element B can tilt and is fitted with two stops K and L. Any
          thrust generated by the element A is converted into a
          horizontal thrust by the element B in the direction of the
          arrow F. The device according to the invention is particularly
          intended for moving boats by wave energy. <br>

          <br>
          Present invention relates to a motor of navigation functioning
          with the energy of the waves, swell, floods, corrugations etc.
          , sailing on a sea, a lake, an ocean, or any water surface
          agitated by waves. One knows already the technical ones used
          in the field of the navigation, using power plants, and
          sailboats. The heat energies are generally crude and generate
          pollution. Sailboats are very widespread, but they present
          also have disadvantages, for example: to go against the wind,
          and difficulties of management. The energies of the waves are
          practiced only on the surfing in a way very limited for
          sporting.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus described in this invention, aims at providing
          means of navigation that is clean and easy to practice, and it
          can be complementary with the other means quoted above.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus in accordance with the invention particularly
          makes it possible to be freed from constrained from the heat
          energies, and the disadvantages of the navigation with sail
          and the difficult character of surfing. With this aim, the
          invention proposes essentially navigation means with the
          energies of the waves, more exactly the energies generated on
          a floating member giving it a straight movement of high
          downwards, and the low one upwards; this straight movement of
          high downwards, and low upwards conceals a substantial source
          of potential energy not exploited before this invention. This
          phenomenon of straight movement present a maximum amplitude
          with the water surface, and progressively attenuates while
          going towards the depth, this attenuation is relatively
          progressive, it will reach agitating zero with a few metres of
          the water surface, therefore there is a difference in
          agitating going of high to the bottom, that is to say a
          potential difference in energy.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus in accordance with the invention aims at
          exploiting this potential difference by proposing a practical
          and economic apparatus converting this energy resultant of the
          straight movement into an horizontal thrust in a given
          direction, from where a motor functioning with the energies of
          the waves, by attenuating the high-low movement.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention is characterized as follows: It includes
          member A (see PL1 Fig.l) floating with the water surface being
          at the maximum point of agitation, a second member B placed in
          the submerged part at some distance from the agitating
          maximum, towards zero agitation .<br>
          <br>
          B, represents the converter element of the rectilinear energy
          giving directional thrust. To understand the object of the
          invention, we suppose that the part B is submerged with the
          vicinity of agitating zero. The part B consisted a member
          resembling with a pivotal plank on an axis C, being between
          the center of gravity of this plank and its end. Any thrust of
          member A of high to the bottom generates a thrust of the
          member B in the same direction, tilting the plank B and by
          positioning the high part D compared to the part E bass, that
          one would cause an horizontal thrust in the direction of the
          arrow F (see PL1 - Fig.l)<br>
          <br>
          Any thrust of member A, low to the top would rock the member D
          of the plank B to the bottom, and the part E to the top would
          continue a thrust in the direction of the arrow F, so each
          high-low straight movement and vice versa causes a thrust in
          the same direction. To choose its direction, it is enough to
          position the plank B via the member G in the wanted direction,
          independently of the direction of the waves and winds. Speed
          of displacement of this boat, boat etc, depends on the members
          following: the amplitude of the waves, the surface with
          element B and the angle of its pivot, its optimum depth, and
          resistance of the whole to the movements. This angle of
          swivels perhaps lies controlled by fixed stops and/or
          variable, placed to have the angle getting the optimum thrust.
          (see PL2 3-4). The angle the zero, i.e. plank B remaining
          immovable on its axis causes a thrust of the for these equal
          in two opposed directions, from where thrust EGA is zero. The
          change of a given angle would involve one thrust in the
          indicated direction and the proximity of it B compared to the
          point of agitating zero lies determines pushed. The member B
          is described in only one member for faci liter the description
          and the comprehension of the invention.<br>
          <br>
          The member B perhaps carried out in 1-2-3-4, etc., infinite
          numbers of elements. Numbers of the members and theirs sizes
          can be given by requirements of price, weight, effectiveness,
          size of the boat, ship, etc. Speed and the cost of
          construction will determine the numbers of members B and their
          sizes.<br>
          <br>
          The adaptation of several members B directed in way that the
          thrusts being opposed the ones to the others in a skilful way
          generated the fixity of member A independently of the waves
          and currents.<br>
          <br>
          The member H is presented in a pivotal bar, which perhaps
          realized by a fixed bar or flexible rope.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus in accordance with the invention cannot function
          without the agitating of the waves. One can assist it by a
          motor auxiliary which would be used for at this time to enter
          and leave ports in particular.<br>
          <br>
          The apparatus in accordance with the invention can find a
          considerable application in the field of the navigation, boat,
          boat, vessel, building, ship, platforms, etc., serving either
          with their movements or with their fixing. The overall
          construction can be carried out with steel, wood, synthetic
          and various products, for example:&nbsp; semi-flexible
          materials like the fins (used by divers) by the fact of their
          semi-rigid constitution, would make member B funtion without a
          pivot, although the efficiency is lesser. <br>
