        </center>
        <p>Solar power in the developed world is becoming ever more
          high-tech, and big business. Witness the attempts to steer
          president-elect Obama towards space-based solar power. </p>
        <p>But low-tech ways to harness the Sun's energy can have big
          impacts too, as these two new simple solar gadgets for use in
          poor areas of the world show: a solar-powered fridge and a
          drinking water steriliser, without a single moving part
          between them. </p>
        <p>The fridge, designed by Emily Cummins of West Yorkshire in
          the UK, consists of a two-walled cylinder, with the outer one
          perforated. Wet sand or soil fills the gap between the two
          walls. When sunlight heats the out wall and wet material,
          evaporating water cools the inner cylinder and its contents in
          the same way evaporating sweat cools our bodies. Cummins
          perfected her invention on a trip to Namibia. </p>
        <p>The Swedish invention Solvatten is also easy to use. Simply
          pour several litres of water into its two tanks, leave it in
          the sun for a few hours and collect the sanitised drinking
          water. An indicator signals it is safe to drink once the
          temperature inside has reached 55°C. That heating, together
          with exposure to UV radiation, helps destroy harmful bacteria,
          and the water is also filtered during pouring to remove
          particulates. </p>
        <p>It works even on cloudy days, the inventors say, although it
          can take up to 6hrs to reach temperature. Unfortunately, it
          doesn't work at all when it's raining. You can see Solvatten
          in action in the video below, which reports on a trial of the
          device in Nepal. </p>

            "><b>http://www.solvatten.se/SOLVATTEN/Start.html</b></a>
        </p>
        <p>"SOLVATTEN makes unsafe water drinkable by using solar
          energy. The portable 10 liter container is a patented and
          scientifically approved Swedish invention. Put SOLVATTEN in a
          sunny place, give it 3-4 hours and the water will be
          drinkable! An indicator shows when it is safe to drink...
          SOLVATTEN uses the idea of combining heat, UV and built-in
          filter in a specially designed container to clean contaminated
          water." </p>
        <p>"The number of days that SOLVATTEN can be used over the year
          depends on several factors. Considering the geographical
          location, prevailing weather conditions and climatic pattern
          the estimated range is between 250 and 365 days in a year. If
          the conditions are good, SOLVATTEN can be used twice a day...
          If we assume that we could use SOLVATTEN twice a day during
          sunny days, it will provide 20 liters of warm water. To boil
          one liter of water you need 1 kg of firewood which would in
          the end save about 20 kg wood/day assuming the weather is
          fine... If SOLVATTEN is used once a day during 250 days in a
          year, you can save 2 500 kg of firewood. That means less soil
          erosion and saves a large amount of&nbsp; CO2." </p>

        <p><b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The present invention relates to a
          container (2) for purifying water by utilization of sunlight,
          comprising a first surface (4, 8', 9', 10', 12') that is
          formed of a permeable layer for sunlight and a second surface
          (6, 8'', 9'', 10'', 12'') that is formed of an absorbing layer
          for sunlight. Further, the container comprises a first opening
          (14) and a second opening (16), respectively, provided with
          filter elements (18, 19). Filling with water is intended to be
          done in the first opening (14) and discharge of water is
          intended to be done through the second opening (16) after the
          water in the container (2) has been heated to a temperature of
          at least 600C after exposure by sunlight and also exposure of
          ultraviolet radiation in order to make it possible to kill
          undesired micro-organisms. </p>
        <p><b>BACKGROUND</b> </p>
        <p>[0002] Contaminated drinking water is frequent and a large
          problem in many parts of the world, particularly in developing
          countries. 1.1 billion people are without reliable drinking
          water and 1.6 billion are lacking electricity. There is a
          great demand for being able to purify drinking water in a
          simple way. Following natural disasters, at war and other
          large catastrophes such as Aids epidemics, which often leaves
          children without their parents, the problems with purification
          of water often culminates and causes usually serious diarrhoea
          diseases. WHO has provided a standard that disinfecting
          systems have to fulfil in order to be considered acceptable.
          This standard requires that a system shall manage to treat
          water with 100000 colon forming bacillus (colony forming
          units--CFU) of E-coli per 100 ml water and from this produce
          water less than one (1 part) CFU per 100 ml. </p>
        <p>[0003] It is previously known apparatuses and methods for
          purifying drinking water from harmful parasites and
          micro-organisms, which known apparatuses/methods utilises
          UV-light and/or heating to a temperature above 60.degree. C.
          during about 1 h for pasteurization of the water. Natural
          sunlight contains UV-light and large amounts of heat energy.
          It is also known, to use simple pieces of cloth to filter out
          micro-organisms that usually are combined with larger
          particles. In common with most of the known apparatuses is
          that they comprises many and expensive components, are
          relatively complicated and/or have not a suitable construction
          that ensures a guaranteed purification of the water. </p>
        <p>[0004] Through EP-A1-1106188 is previously known a container
          and a method for disinfection of drinking water. The container
          is preferably shaped of a flexible plastic material, such as a
          plastic bag. One side of the container comprises a
          UV-transparent layer and a second side comprises a layer that
          produces heat at exposure in sunlight. The container comprises
          a sealable opening that is used for discharging and filling of
          water. </p>
        <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
        <p>[0005] One object with the present invention is to achieve a
          container for purifying water that at least partially
          eliminates those drawbacks that are associated with
          apparatuses according to the state of the art. A further
          object is that the purifying of water in the container
          according to the present invention should fulfil WHO standard.
          An additional object is to achieve a container that to high
          degree ensures purifying of water in the container, that is
          simple to use, easy to distribute and cheap to produce. </p>
        <p>[0006] This object is achieved with a container for purifying
          of water by utilization of sunlight according to the present
          invention as defined in claim 1, which comprises a first
          surface that is formed of a permeable layer for sunlight and a
          second surface that is formed of an absorbing layer for
          sunlight. The second absorbing surface is composed of up to
          about 2/3-parts of the delimiting surfaces of the container.
          Further the container comprises a first sealable opening and a
          second sealable opening, respectively. The respective opening
          is provided with filter elements, whereby filling with water
          is intended to be done in the first opening and discharge of
          water is intended to be done through the second opening after
          the water in the container has been heated to a temperature of
          at least 60.degree. C. after exposure by sunlight and also
          exposure of ultraviolet radiation in order to make it possible
          to kill undesired micro-organisms. </p>
        <p>[0007] By those means, it is achieved that the one of the
          sides of the container, which container is filled with water,
          that is to be placed against the sunlight, is suitably shaped
          of a completely transparent layer, in order to allow a maximum
          of sunlight to pass to shine through the water, and the other
          side of the container is of an absorbing material, a so called
          absorber, which absorbing layer is hit by the sunlight. This
          absorber may substantially be composed of a black surface. The
          sunlight hits the absorber, whereby conversion to heat energy
          takes place through emission. The water temperature increases
          fast and the heat is kept in the container. The water is also
          exposed for UV-radiation and kills undesired micro-organisms
          and disinfects in that way the water. </p>
        <p>[0008] The two openings on the container that each are
          provided with a respective filter element, implies that the
          risk for contamination of the water in the container can be
          minimised. Thanks to that one opening is intended for
          discharge and one for filling of water, it can by those means
          be achieved that purified water in the container is not
          discharged through an opening for filling of water, which can
          re-contaminate the water as a consequence of those
          micro-organisms, which were separated at the filling, that can
          be left on the filter elements. Owing to that the opening for
          discharge of water also comprises a filter element, it is
          achieved that the water in the container becomes sealed, and
          thus means a safety that the water neither is contaminated
          through introduction of micro-organisms, parasites and also
          larger impurities through the discharge opening. One advantage
          with the solution according to the present invention is that
          the container can be formed with a shape, such as for instance
          a relatively flat design, which is most preferably according
          to an embodiment of the present invention in order to
          facilitate that the UV-radiation meets as large radiation
          surface as possible for disinfection of micro-organisms in the
          water. A shallow/flat shaping makes it also easy to store,
          transport, distribute, handle and can be shaped with a
          attractive design. Yet an advantage is that the present
          invention eliminates the need for chemical additives,
          electricity and complicated techniques of containers for
          purifying of water, at the same time as the purified water in
          the container can fulfil the demands according to the WHO
          standard. The container is refillable and can be produced to a
          low cost. The container according to the invention also
          creates the possibility for an easy distribution and
          uncomplicated handling for the end user thanks to the ability
          to stack them. </p>
        <p>[0009] The first surface that is formed of a layer for
          transmitting the sunlight is suitably formed of a transparent,
          see-through material such as a plastic that keeps its high
          degree of transparency, in order to let through a maximum of
          sunlight, during repeated use and thus not becomes turbid
          after a short time of use. </p>
        <p>[0010] The whole container can be of the same material as the
          above mentioned first surface, suitably of plastic material,
          however where the second surface is formed of an absorbing
          layer for sunlight, and suitably not a transparent layer. The
          layer is suitably substantially black in its colour. Thus, the
          second surface of the container can be painted black, produced
          from black plastic material, can be provided with a black
          layer, a film that is pasted on the side or in similar way
          provided with a sunlight and UV-radiation absorbing layer. The
          second absorbing surface comprises suitably at least about
          half the delimiting surface of the container and up to about
          2/3-parts of the delimiting surfaces of the container, which
          has been shown to provide a faster heating to a temperature of
          at least 60.degree. C. after exposure by sunlight compared to
          if only one fourth to one third of the container is of
          absorbing material. The first sunlight pervious surface is
          composed of suitably up to about half the delimiting surface
          of the container. </p>
        <p>[0011] Coarser impurities are separated by deposition on the
          filter when contaminated water is filled in the first opening.
          At the discharge of water, the second opening is used since
          impurities can be present on the filter of the first opening
          for the filling. Also the second opening for discharge of
          water is provided with a filter in order to avoid that
          impurities are introduced in the container during discharge.
          By using two sealable openings, vacuum in the container can be
          avoided in such a way that a lid that seals the filling
          opening can be slightly opened to let in air, such that the
          purified water in the container can be poured out through the
          discharge opening. The openings may also comprise filters for
          purification of chemical substances. </p>
        <p>[0012] Further advantages and features according to
          embodiments of the invention are evident from the claims, and
          also in the following from the description of the embodiments.

        <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
        <p>[0016] A container 2 for purifying water by utilization of
          sunlight is shown in FIG. 1, in accordance with the present
          invention. According to the embodiment in FIG. 1A-B, is a
          container 2 illustrated that comprises six sides, a first side
          4, a second side 6 opposite the first side, two short sides
          8,9, a bottom side 10 and a top side 12. In this way is a
          relatively shallow/flat container 2 formed that easily can be
          placed on the ground. By having a flat shaping, it is intended
          that the first and the second side 4, 6, respectively, have an
          essentially larger extension than the other sides 8-10, 12. A
          relatively flat form of the container also facilitates that
          the UV-radiation meets a relatively large radiation surface,
          i.e. a target area of the container, such that the water
          effectively and time efficiently is exposed for the
          UV-radiation and thereby facilitates at least some killing of
          micro-organisms. Within the scope of the inventive concept,
          the container may of course be of another shape, such as for
          example comprising more sides than six or be essentially
          cylindrical, although such a shape may imply that it is harder
          to place in correct position on the ground. In that respect,
          it is most preferred to have a relatively flat container,
          having plane sides, in accordance with the present invention.
          According to the present invention, the first sunlight
          permeable surface in the embodiment shown in FIG. 1A-B
          comprises the first surface 4, and also the halves 8', 9',
          10', 12' of the short sides 8, 9, the bottom side 10 and the
          top side 12 that is adjacent to the first side 4. Further as
          evident from FIGS. 1A-B, the second sunlight permeable surface
          comprises the second side 6, and also the halves 8'', 9'',
          10'', 12'' of the short sides 8, 9, the bottom side 10 and the
          top side 12 that is adjacent to the second side 6. In
          accordance with the container 2 according to FIGS. 1A-B, the
          short sides 8, 9, the bottom side 10 and the top side 12 are
          in that respect half painted black adjacent the second side 6.
        </p>
        <p>[0017] Further, the container comprises a first sealable
          opening 14 and a second sealable opening 16, respectively,
          provided with a respective filter element 18, 19, whereby
          filling with water is done in the first opening 14 and
          discharge of water is done through the second opening 16 after
          the water in the container 2 has been heated to a temperature
          of at least 60.degree. C. after exposure by sunlight. The
          filter elements 18, 19 can suitably be fixed in the openings
          14, 16, preferably fixed by welding, moulded or in similar way
          securely arranged in the openings. The respective filter
          element 18, 19, according to an embodiment of the present
          invention, may be arranged in a cylindrical house-formed body
          (not shown), provided with male threads, which is adapted to
          be screwed in the respective opening 14, 16, provided with
          corresponding female threads. The filter elements 18, 19
          according to the present invention are preferably formed such
          that they accomplish closeness and a pore size that admits
          self-flowing, i.e. a high flow rate. The pore size can
          preferably be in the size of up to about 20 micrometer. One
          filter element 18, 19 according to the present invention is
          suitably composed of a screen cloth in the form of a closely
          woven cloth, net, membrane or the similar, for example of
          nylon or silk, which is securely moulded on the outermost edge
          of an opening 14, 16. </p>
        <p>[0018] The first opening 14 may comprise a lid 20 for closing
          of the opening when water has been filled. The second sealable
          opening 16 can comprise a lid 22 which comprises indicator(s)
          that may be set for indication that the water in the container
          has been heated to a temperature of at least 60.degree. C.
          after exposure by sunlight. The lid 22 can be provided with a
          knob 24 that comprises two differently coloured surfaces 26,
          27, where one of the colours is set forward in order to
          indicate that the purification procedure has been carried out.
          The sides of the lids 20, 22 are suitably formed with sunlight
          permeable sides. Also the neck of the openings 14, 16 are semi
          UV-absorbing and semi UV-permeable in the embodiment shown in
          the FIGS. 1A-B. </p>
        <p>[0019] A temperature indicator (not shown), such as a LCD
          temperature indicator, may suitably be arranged centrally in
          the container 2, which temperature indicator is arranged to
          indicate when, and that, the water in the container 2 has
          reached a temperature of at least 60.degree. C. after exposure
          by sunlight. The temperature indicator can for instance be
          rod-shaped and arranged from one of the sides 4, 6, 8-9, 10,
          12 directed against the centre of the container 2. Suitably
          the temperature indicator is arranged to change colour when
          the temperature reaches at least 60.degree. C. The temperature
          indicator may suitably be provided with a memory such that a
          reached maximum temperature during the sunlight exposure can
          be checked afterwards. The temperature indicator may also be
          reset. </p>
        <p>[0020] The UV-light kills DNA in the micro-organisms such
          that a bactericidal effect is facilitated. An example of
          dimensions of the container for a volume of 2 litres can e.g.
          be 23.5 cm high, 17 cm wide and a thickness of 5 cm, but the
          container may of course be of other dimensions. The sunlight,
          that by means of the sunlight absorbing surface, the so called
          absorber, converts the sunlight energy into heat energy and
          rapidly raises the temperature of the water when exposed to
          sunlight, whereby it also achieves a pasteurization effect
          when the temperature has reached about 60.degree. C. During
          about 10 minutes the temperature should be kept at 60.degree.
          C. or higher. When the exposure of sunlight is completed, the
          container should be cooled in the shadow or over the night
          such that the water should reach a drinkable temperature. The
          container according to the invention is suitably recyclable.
          In that respect it is suitable that during a cycle of a day
          and night, have at least three containers: one for collection
          and purification, one for cooling and one for consumption.
          Suitably also instructions of application should be present on
          the side of the container, conveniently on the outside of the
          container having the absorbing surface, e.g. in the form of a
          drawn instruction that is easily understandable irrespective
          of age, language or education. </p>
