      <p>Hypothetical Scenario: A U.S. military Special Operations team
        is currently in the middle of a clandestine op, in-theater.
        They're running low on 5.56x45mm and 7.62x51mm ammo, magazines,
        40mm grenades, food, and medical supplies. One of the team's
        SOPMOD M4/M4A1 Carbines is down, and they need two extra HK69A1
        40mm grenade launchers and a Milkor MGL Mk-1S as force
        multipliers. As if that's not enough, the local warlord who's
        been assisting the team against enemy insurgents is now asking
        for another $500,000 U.S. and a brand new stainless steel Rolex
        Submariner wristwatch, just like the one he's seen on the wrist
        of one of the operators. </p>
      <p>DefenseReview.com (DefRev) is an online tactical technology
        magazine that focuses on advanced tactical armament, tactical
        equipment/gear (including combat/tactical camouflage
        technology), and tactical training/instruction for military
        infantry forces. DefenseReview.com strives to provide the most
        up-to-date information on law enforcement (LE) SWAT/SRT and
        military Special Operations (infantry)/Special Warfare (SPECWAR)
        technology developments as quickly as we learn about them. </p>
      <p>This team needs a little care package delivered, fast and
        low-profile. So, they call it in. Five hours later, as the team
        hangs tight under tree cover, four hexagonal corrugated paper
        boxes are airdropped from a non-descript utility aircraft at 300
        feet. Four low-signature airdrop bundles exit the aircraft.
        Pilot chutes and rotor blades on all four deploy, which allow
        them to autorotate down to the ground accurately at less than 40
        feet per second. As the containers hit the tree line, the rotor
        blades slice right through the tree canopy at 400 rpm. The team
        recovers the payload and extracts the requested goodies. They're
        back in business, and back in the game. </p>
      <p>The airdrop scenario described above is now possible because
        some creative thinkers at DropMaster, Inc. have come up with
        CopterBox, an item so simple in concept and design that it's
        easy to overlook its potential to profoundly change the U.S.
        military's resupply doctrine and logistics paradigm. </p>
      <p><b>Airdrop It and Forget It</b> </p>
      <p>The result of a privately funded 9-year, $450,000 project,
        CopterBox is an expendable airdrop delivery system specifically
        designed to deliver a 60-100 lb payload anywhere in the world,
        anytime it's needed. With CopterBox, you don't need specially
        trained riggers to rig Mil-Spec cargo parachutes and 200 lb
        (minimum) pallets for a 60-100 lb payload. And, you don't need a
        C-17 Globemaster III or C-130 Hercules tactical transport
        aircraft to airdrop it, or a CH-47D/MH47E Chinook heavy lift
        helicopter or UH1-Y Huey utility helicopter to land with it. All
        you need is a single non-specialized soldier to quick-assemble
        CopterBox, fill it up with the needed supplies, and load it onto
        any military or civilian aircraft that will hold it. Then, just
        airdrop it and forget about it. Once it's safely on the ground,
        a single operator can quickly recover the payload and dispose of
        the empty system, then get right back to the mission. Quick and
        easy. Four CopterBoxes dropped means four operators to recover
        them, and so on. </p>
      <p><b>CopterBox: The Skinny</b> </p>

        * Can be airdropped from any aircraft or helicopter <br>
        * Delivery accuracy outshines standard parachute-dropped
        supplies <br>

        it, contact DropMaster, Inc. at 910-630-3269, or by email at
        copterbox@dropmaster.com </p>
      <p>With the U.S. military's current parachute-based system, an
        open-field airdrop is usually the best way to go, since the
        chutes and lines can get hung up in the trees. But, an
        open-field recovery exposes the team. Aside from the rigging and
        delivery logistics problems, payload recovery with this system
        can also be physically difficult and time-consuming. A helo drop
        requires said helo to either hover over the drop zone or land
        with the risk of airborne sand brownout or foliage-related
        foreign object damage, plus the added danger of enemy attention.
        Helicopter flight time spent hovering and landing is very
        expensive, as is losing the aircraft to hostile fire. </p>
      <p>Fortunately, at only $300 per unit, CopterBox makes all this
        unnecessary. It's even more accurate than parachute-based
        systems, since wind drift hardly effects its trajectory. The
        CopterBox's impressive delivery accuracy/minimal wind drift has
        already been observed in prototype testing from 200 to 10,000
        feet above ground level. </p>
      <p>And, here's the kicker: with additional developmental funding,
        CopterBox can be outfitted with a low-drag cardboard fairing and
        hard points for UAV (or other aircraft) deployment. The
        CopterBox can also be constructed out of inexpensive corrugated
        plastic sheet for water-resistance or re-use, per organizational
        requirement and development funding. Another potential
        operational benefit is the ability to attach an altimeter or
        timer delay device to the pilot chute deployment system,
        allowing CopterBox to be free-dropped from high altitude out of
        small arms fire reach without the associated long drift time. A
        larger diameter or taller CopterBox can also be developed with
        additional funding, and can be scaled to customer/end-user
        requirements. For instance, a small arms/light weapons-specific
        version of Copterbox can be developed that will allow delivery
        of small arms and light weapons to the field, fully assembled.
        The weapons can be arranged concentrically with internal
        spacers, to prevent damage. Other versions can be developed to
        deliver replacement Javelin anti-armor missiles and Predator
        short-range assault weapons. </p>
      <p>The Rotor Blade Deployment Sequence </p>
      <p>When CopterBox is deployed from the aircraft, the small drogue
        chute comes out first. The drogue chute, utilizing mesh in lieu
        of shroud lines (to prevent tangling and snagging on foliage),
        orients CopterBox into the relative wind. The chute pulls on the
        drogue line. This causes a patented break-away stitching system
        to force a delayed deployment (i.e. opening) of the rotor
        blades, once CopterBox is safely away from the aircraft. The
        break-away stitching system also ensures reliable rotor blade
        deployment. </p>
      <p>Once the rotor blades are deployed, they cause CopterBox to
        spin at 400 rpm and begin the autorotative descent to the target
        area on the ground, and enable it to cut right through dense
        foliage on its way down. An added benefit of CopterBox's drogue
        chute/orientation system is that it negates payload
        center-of-gravity issues when it's packed and loaded onto the
        aircraft. It also makes CopterBox easy to locate, since you can
        color the drogue chute any way you like--even hot pink! Once you
        recover it, just stuff the brightly colored chute back inside
        CopterBox. </p>
      <p>During touchdown, a paper honeycomb shock absorber plug
        protects the payload from impact damage. This custom-made
        honeycomb is tailored to crush from the deceleration of 60 to
        100 lbs, unlike the much stiffer Mil-Spec material, which is
        designed for much heavier payloads. A welded wire rotor hub is
        at the top of the box, which withstands all of the rotor blade
        flight and centrifugal loads. The same part is used on the
        bottom as a landing skid, which protects the box during rigging,
        shifting around in the aircraft and upon ground impact. After
        landing, these two items can be used as camp stoves if needed. </p>
      <p>So, what's the word on the proverbial street about CopterBox?
        Word is, to a man, every U.S. military spec-operator who's seen
        the CopterBox prototype demonstrated is very excited about it,
        and wants it operational ASAP. PSYOPS personnel are excited
        about CopterBox's ability to be modified into a psychological
        warfare tool. CopterBox can be easily and inexpensively modified
        into a propaganda leaflet dispenser by including centrifugally
        opened panels on the hexagonal sides, triggered by the
        aforementioned timer or altimeter. So, as CopterBox spins, the
        leaflets spin right out, go everywhere, and accurately reach the
        intended population. </p>
      <p><b>CopterBox Kit</b> </p>
      <p>Simplicity itself: The CopterBox kit. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, U.S. military brass have allegedly been dragging
        their heels on adopting CopterBox. One of the speculated reasons
        is that CopterBox's extremely low $300 per unit price makes it
        administratively unattractive, and less of a "larger-ticket
        item." What should be stressed is that CopterBox is useful and
        adaptable, and has the potential to become a major program from
        sheer deployment numbers. As one considers the price of a
        CopterBox versus the astronomical expense of reusable cargo
        parachutes (that likely do not get reused) and all of their
        associated logistical costs, CopterBox's budgetary benefits
        quickly become clear. It's the author's opinion that our Special
        Operations personnel need CopterBox, or something like it, right
        now. So do our U.S. Army and Marine Corps general infantry, for
        that matter. Non-military applications also come to mind, such
        as humanitarian relief, domestic disaster relief, and the Forest
        Service's Smokejumpers. </p>
      <p><b>Dimensions and Specifications:</b> </p>
      <p>In its rectangular kit form, which comes in a plastic bag to
        protect it from the elements, CopterBox occupies a 9" X 18" X
        34" space on a shelf or pallet. In its rigged, hexagonal form,
        it is 34" tall and fits inside an 18" circle. The current
        product, the model 6036, is designed to hold 60 lbs and 3.6
        cubic feet of payload while fitting out of a Cessna 172 test
        aircraft's door. Although it is designed for 60 lbs, it can
        handle up to 100 lbs -- albeit at the expense of a higher
        descent rate, and the ability for a single person to load it
        into an aircraft and for one operator to easily handle it on the
        ground. With minimal training and the instruction sheet
        provided, one person can assemble a loaded CopterBox in about 5
        minutes. The instruction sheet has received real world end-user
        input to maximize clarity and ease of assembly. The patented
        rotor blades are constructed from high-strength corrugated paper
        but are folded in a way that provide a high degree of strength
        and aerodynamic lift. A yardstick-type spar is added for
        additional strength, as there is an incredible amount of
        aerodynamic stress on the blades during the deployment and
        flight sequences. </p>
      <p>It should also be noted that DropMaster, Inc. received a 98%
        rating by the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center (Natick), on
        their Phase I efforts on a Small Business Innovation Research
        (SBIR) grant. DropMaster, Inc. was also invited by Natick to
        participate in a Phase II grant, two years in a row. However,
        military funding obstacles have since intervened. </p>

        <p><b>CopterBox Expendable Airdrop Delivery System for Ammo,
            Food, Meds, and More</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>by David Crane</b> <br>
        <b>david@defensereview.com</b> </p>
      <p>DropMaster, Inc. has developed a new, expendable airdrop
        delivery system, called CopterBox. CopterBox is an autorotating,
        disposable aerial resupply system, and appears to be a
        superlative, off-the-shelf product. It is specifically designed
        to be quick to assemble with minimal training, easy to deploy
        with or without a static line and to be lightweight for a single
        operator to recover on the ground. </p>
      <p>When dropped from an aircraft, CopterBox decelerates a 60 lb
        payload to about 34 feet per second at sea level. DropMaster's
        main focus is simplicity and low cost. Since CopterBox is meant
        to be expendable (it's predominantly biodegradable and/or
        burnable), you can just drop it and forget it. A patented pilot
        chute delay system allows CopterBox to fall a safe distance away
        from an aircraft prior to rotor blade deployment. </p>
      <p>After the rotor blades deploy and autorotation begins, the
        steady-state descent is not affected much by wind drift, unlike
        parachute-based systems. This minimal wind drift has been
        observed in prototype testing from 200 to 1,500 feet, resulting
        in tremendous delivery accuracy. And, because it spins at about
        400 RPM, CopterBox cuts through trees and always reaches the
        ground, again, unlike... parachute-based systems. It is
        primarily made of high-strength corrugated paper (high-strength
        cardboard) with minimal metal and nylon parts. These simple
        materials allow CopterBox to be scalable to customer needs. </p>
      <p>With minimal additional cost, a low-drag cardboard fairing can
        be fitted along with hard points for deployment from UAVs or
        other aircraft. Pending proper funding, GPS guidance can be
        achieved for HALO drops where guidance occurs prior to
        altimeter-triggered rotor blade deployment at a pre-set
        altitude. CopterBox requires no logistical support or
        maintenance. </p>
      <p>Payload weight is currently limited to 60 to 100 lbs. This
        allows a single operator to recover the payload and easily
        dispose of the empty system, so he can quickly carry on with his
        mission. </p>
      <p>If necessary, CopterBox can easily be made from high-strength
        corrugated plastic sheet (instead of high-strength
        paper/cardboard), in order to be water-resistant. </p>
      <p>Priced at $300 per unit, CopterBox is patented and is the
        result of a nine year, $450,000 project. It should also be noted
        that DropMaster, Inc. received a 98% rating by the U.S. Army
        Natick Soldier Center, a.k.a. U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center
        (Natick), on their Phase I efforts on a Small Business
        Innovation Research (SBIR) grant. DropMaster, Inc. was also
        invited by Natick to participate in a Phase II grant, two years
        in a row. However, military funding obstacles intervened. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>An aerial cargo container system for transporting cargo from an
        aircraft to the ground having a cargo box with a continuous side
        wall with six rectangular side panels, and rotor blades having
        stowed positions against alternating box side panels and
        deployed positions extending outwardly from the box in a
        generally horizontal plane. Each blade may include a lower panel
        and an upper panel that has two triangular sections behind the
        leading edge that forms an aerodynamic camber. The blades are
        hinged to a rotor hub secured across the top of the box. The
        upward deployment of the blades is limited by tethers extending
        from the blades down to a tether attach frame secured across the
        bottom of the box. The box and blades are preferably formed of
        corrugated paper or plastic material. The entire unit rotates
        with the load to create aerodynamic braking and lower cargo to
        the ground with a minimum of energy being translated to the
        cargo on impact. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>(1) Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to an apparatus for
        transporting cargo from an aircraft to the ground, and in
        particular to an improved, disposable cargo container comprised
        of a box with extendible rotor blades that can be dropped from
        an aircraft to the ground under adverse conditions without
        damage to the cargo. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Numerous circumstances require the transport of various kinds
        of cargo to inaccessible or remote areas where ground
        transportation is not possible or timely. These circumstances
        include both military and peacetime conditions, such as
        providing emergency food, fuel and medical supplies to victims
        of natural disasters, fighting of forest fires, etc. </p>
      <p>In many instances, the cargo can be transported to the area by
        helicopter, or dropped from an airplane with a parachute.
        However, helicopters are not always readily available, and are
        expensive to operate. Parachutes are also expensive,
        particularly when used to drop relatively small quantities of
        cargo, and are usually not recoverable due to the terrain and
        the conditions under which the cargo is dropped. </p>
      <p>Various prior art patents, since at least as early as the
        1940s, have proposed an alternative means involving the dropping
        of containers of small cargo loads from an aircraft without a
        parachute. Instead, the container is constructed of a disposable
        box with attached wings or rotor blades that extend outwardly
        when the box is dropped from an aircraft. The force of the air
        against the lower surface of these blades causes the blades to
        turn in the direction of their leading edges, rotating the
        attached box and creating lift to slow the container's descent.
      </p>
      <p>The following patents are representative of these prior art
        devices: </p>
      <p>Patent Number Inventor <br>
        2,450,992 Sanderson <br>
        3,168,267 Ferris <br>
        2,324,146 Frazer <br>
        2,495,486 Stevenson <br>
        3,115,831 Suter </p>
      <p>This alternative transport means, while conceptually addressing
        the need for inexpensive cargo delivery, has apparently found no
        significant application. This lack of use is believed to be
        attributable to two somewhat related reasons; cost effectiveness
        and durability. In order for this type of devise to find a niche
        in cargo transport, the cost must be low since the container is
        not recovered. However, prior art designs that could be produced
        at an acceptable cost do not have the durability to withstand
        the destructive forces to which they are subjected, resulting in
        failure of the systems to get their load to the intended
        destination undamaged. However, the need remains and the basic
        concept is appealing. Therefore, a disposable aerial cargo
        container that could be manufactured at an acceptable cost while
        still having the required strength and durability should be of
        considerable utility. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The following summary describes an improved aerial cargo
        container useful in transporting cargo from an aircraft to the
        ground. This cargo container incorporates features not suggested
        by the prior art that enable production of the container at an
        acceptable cost, while still providing the strength and
        durability necessary for transportation of cargo loads of sixty
        (60) pounds or more under adverse conditions without significant
        damage to the cargo upon impact with the ground. </p>
      <p>Essentially, the performance of the cargo container of the
        present invention is attributable to various modifications and
        refinements of cargo containers of the type described in the
        above prior art. That is, the present container, like prior art
        containers, is comprised of a box for holding the cargo to be
        transported, and a plurality of wings or rotor blades having
        hinged roots, with the blades being deployable to a
        substantially horizontal attitude when the container is dropped
        from the aircraft. As with prior art containers, air pressure
        against the rotor blades causes the box to rotate and create
        aerodynamic lift to slow the descent of the container. </p>
      <p>The cargo container of the present invention, however,
        incorporates various features not suggested by the prior art.
        These improvements reside in the following three areas: 1) the
        box or cargo holder construction and blade positioning, 2)
        attachment of the rotor blades, and 3) the rotor blade
        construction. Each improvement contributes to the economical
        construction of the container and to its superior performance.
        Depending upon the particular container and its uses, these
        features may be used alone or in combination. </p>
      <p>The configuration of the cargo box and the placement of the
        rotor blades thereon can dramatically affect various aspects of
        the container including its carrying capacity, its durability,
        and its cost of manufacture. It has been determined that the
        preferred cargo box addressing these concerns is a box with a
        hexagonal cross-section comprised of a continuous side wall
        formed of six rectangular attached facets that are positioned in
        a hexagonal configuration, and a hexagonal end wall closing one
        end of the box formed by the side wall material. The open end of
        the container is closed with a hexagonal shaped plug type lid to
        enclose the cavity. </p>
      <p>The box walls, for purposes of disposability and economy, are
        preferably formed of corrugated paper or hardboard. The
        continuous sidewall may be formed of a single sheet with spaced
        creases to form the individual panels. The abutting ends of the
        sheet are joined, e.g., by taping, staples or glue.
        Alternatively, the sidewalls can be formed of six rectangular
        panels that are joined to each other at their abutting side
        edges. The size of the box will depend upon the type of cargo to
        be transported and the cargo size and weight. Generally, however
        a box with a length from about 32 to about 36 inches and a
        diameter from about 15 to about 18 inches will be suitable for
        most cargo up to a weight of about 60 pounds. Thus, each side
        panel will have a length of from about 32 to about 36 inches and
        a width of from about 15 to about 18 inches. </p>
      <p>The container includes three rotor blades, with each blade
        being positioned adjacent to alternating side panels. Thus, a
        container formed of six side panels will have three rotor
        blades, with one blade adjacent to every other panel. When the
        container is stowed, the rotor blades are folded against the
        side panels and, when deployed, extend outward from the box in a
        substantially horizontal plane substantially perpendicular to
        the side panels. In order to achieve maximum lift, while still
        being easy to store, the blades preferably have length and width
        dimensions approximating the corresponding dimensions of the
        side panels. </p>
      <p>In prior art disposable cargo containers, rotor blades have
        been hinged at their root to one panel or side of the container
        box. Since disposable boxes, of economic necessity, are usually
        made of corrugated paper, or another disposable material with
        low tear strength, forces against the rotor blade caused by air
        pressure and the centrifugal force tends to rip the hinge, and
        often part of the box. Separation of one or more rotors during
        flight can be disastrous to the load since the container will
        probably plummet to the ground, damaging the cargo. </p>
      <p>In the present invention, this deficiency has been addressed by
        the use of a separate rotor blade hub positioned at the closed
        (upper) end of the box, with the rotor blades being hinged at
        their roots to the hub, instead of directly to the box.
        Preferably, the hub is in the shape of a metal wire frame that
        extends over the top and upper edges of the box. The rotor hinge
        points on the hub are located on the support adjacent
        alternating box panels, with hinge pins being used to attach the
        rotor blades to the hinge points of the hub. Thus, the
        centrifugal force exerted by the blades act upon each other
        through the hub and not the box. Preferably, the hub includes a
        common central point with connections from the central point to
        each of the hinge points. With this arrangement, the rotor
        blade's centrifugal forces tend to act against each other to
        negate the stresses and loads on the box. </p>
      <p>Upward movement of the blades during deployment and flight is
        limited by tethers and shock cords having their upper ends
        attached to the blades and their lower ends attached at the lid
        (lower) end of the box. The tethers may be resilient, such as a
        bungee cord, or a non-resilient cord of a material such as
        nylon. </p>
      <p>The lower ends of the tethers can be attached directly to the
        box. However, since the tethers are also subjected to high
        forces, particularly during deployment, the box preferably
        includes a tether attachment frame that extends across the
        bottom wall (lid). This tether attachment frame includes
        attachment points to secure the lower end of each tether
        approximately beneath the rotor blade to which the upper end of
        the tether is attached. For example, the attachment frame can be
        in the shape of an equilateral triangle having apexes that
        extend beyond the periphery of the box under the alternating
        panel over which the panels are positioned, with one tether
        being attached at each apex of the triangle. </p>
      <p>Prior art rotor blades for expensive devices have been made of
        metal or wood. However, rotor blades for containers designed for
        the purpose of the present invention, have been made from a
        planar piece of corrugated paper or polymer to reduce cost.
        These latter blades are not of sufficient strength to withstand
        the forces to which the container is subjected or to create
        significant aerodynamic braking due to lift. The present
        invention solves this problem with a rotor blade that is made
        from a single corrugated material sheet or a plurality of
        segments joined in a particular manner to provide the needed
        structural integrity under incurred aerodynamic and centrifugal
        loading, while maintaining the required economy. </p>
      <p>Basically, the improved rotor blade is comprised of a lower
        facet, and a multi-facet upper panel secured to the lower panel
        to form an integral blade. The lower panel is essentially planar
        and of a single facet, with leading and trailing edges, which
        may have constant or varying chord distance between them along
        the span of the blade. Together, the panels form a blade having
        a planar bottom surface, and a top surface that includes an
        upwardly extending forward triangle adjacent to the leading edge
        of the blade and a planar surface extending downwardly and
        rearwardly from the forward triangular section aft to a point
        forward of the trailing edge, forming and aft triangular
        section. A pocket for a structural spar exists between these two
        triangular sections. </p>
      <p>To form the forward triangular section, the front segment is
        inclined upward and back from the leading edge of the blade. A
        generally vertical forward spar pocket segment has an upper edge
        common to the rear edge of the upper forward segment of the
        forward triangular section, and a lower edge abutting the lower
        panel. </p>
      <p>The center segment spar pocket common to the upper panel has a
        front edge adjacent and parallel to, but not necessarily
        abutting, the rear edge of the front segment, and is inclined to
        the rear and down to a rear edge that also abuts the lower
        panel. A generally vertical spar has an upper edge integral with
        the front edge of the center segment, and a lower edge abutting
        the lower panel. </p>
      <p>The rear segment of the upper panel is generally planar and
        abuts the upper surface of the lower panel, and has a front edge
        integral with the rear edge of the spar pocket and a rear edge
        integral with the rear edge of the lower panel. </p>
      <p>The lower and upper facets of the rotor blade can be made from
        a single corrugated material that is folded along the
        longitudinal axis of the blade to form the panel segments. That
        is, the blade can be formed by longitudinally folding the outer
        sides of a paper sheet over a planar central section that forms
        the lower panel. One side of the sheet is creased to form the
        front segment and forward spar pocket segment, while the other
        side of the sheet is folded to form the rear and central
        segments of the upper panels, and the aft spar pocket segment. </p>
      <p>A folded piece of corrugated material is inserted in the spar
        pocket and forms the spar. The top of the spar is even with the
        top of both the forward and aft triangular segments. The spar
        translates the aerodynamic forces to the tether and the box. The
        front and central segments of the upper panel, supported by the
        spar and the spar pocket, form a raised triangular section along
        the top of the blade parallel to the blade's longitudinal axis
        and adjacent the blade's leading edge. This triangular section
        forms the structural rigidity of the rotor, as well as providing
        the aerodynamic camber required to generate lift. </p>
      <p>The tether is attached to the spar in such a way to translate
        all of the aerodynamic lift and planar drag to the box from the
        rotor blade. The upper end of the tether can extend through the
        blade's lower facet and around the spar and spar pocket, and
        then back through the lower facet to form a loop. </p>
      <p>The box is designed to be loaded upside down. That is, the lid
        end of the box that will be in a down position when the box is
        in flight will be oriented upward during loading. For this
        discussion, box orientation convention will be rotor hub end
        down and lid end up. Thus, when assembled and oriented for
        loading, the box has a continuous sidewall formed of six
        adjacent, rectangular side panels, and a lower hexagonal end
        wall secured across the rotor hub end of the box. The box is
        inserted into the rotor hub, which forms a base or skid upon
        which the container rests. The rotor blades are attached at
        their root hinge points, to the support, and are folded up
        against the sidewalls of the box. A breakaway strap or other
        means of sacrament is used to hold the blades in their folded
        position during loading and transport to the drop zone. </p>
      <p>When loading, a spacer may first be inserted into the
        container. This spacer serves two purposes. First, the spacer
        prevents cargo from being loaded into what will become the upper
        end of the container after deployment, thereby ensuring that the
        center of gravity of the box will be near the centroid of the
        cavity to ensure positive blade deployment. Also, the spacer,
        which can be of an expanded material, such as honeycomb paper,
        can absorb some of the shock of loading and carriage in the
        aircraft. </p>
      <p>After the payload is centered and chocked with disposable
        packing along the vertical axis of the box, the hexagonal plug
        lid is secured in the open end. This lid is constructed of
        honeycomb or expanded material which will tend to crush upon
        landing, absorbing shock and dissipating the deceleration
        forces. The tether attach frame is placed over the lid and
        strapped into place with a packing strap that runs around the
        rotor hub and the entire box. The strap will hold the lid, the
        tether attach frame, and the rotor hub in place on the box until
        the aerodynamic and deceleration loads can hold the assembly
        together in flight. Once the box has landed, the strap is
        removed to unpack the payload. </p>
      <p>The loaded container is then placed in the same orientation in
        which it was loaded in an aircraft and flown to the drop area.
        The box is pushed from the aircraft over the drop zone with a
        static line or other mean removing the blade-restraining strap
        that allows the blades to deploy. The relative wind around the
        box causes a lifting force to deploy the rotor blades which
        rotate about their hinge attach points and are snubbed by the
        tethers and the shock cords. The blades will be limited to a
        substantially horizontal orientation, i.e. plus or minus ten
        (10) degrees of horizontal by the tethers. In turn, the tether
        attach frame absorbs the tension in the tethers instead of the
        box. </p>
      <p>The force of the air against the lower facet of the blades,
        with the leading edges of the blades being lower than their
        trailing edges, causes the container to rotate in the direction
        of the leading edges, and accelerate rotationally until it
        achieves rotational terminal velocity, generating maximum
        aerodynamic lift, thereby slowing the box to its terminal
        vertical velocity. Centrifugal forces acting on the blades that
        heretofore could cause the blades to rip from the box during
        deployment and rotation are absorbed by the rotor hub. </p>
      <p>The triangular facets of the rotor blades creates an
        aerodynamic camber and form structural box beams to insure rotor
        blades stiffness until centrifugal force stiffening can assist
        the structure during maximum deceleration. This slower rate of
        descent minimizes damage to cargo upon impact of the container
        with the ground. The crushable shock-absorbing lid further
        lessens the risk of damage to the payload. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention is to provide
        an aerial cargo container comprising a box having a continuous
        side wall formed of six rectangular side panels, an upper end
        wall at one end of the side wall and a lower end wall at the
        opposite end of the side wall, the walls forming a cargo cavity;
        and three rotor blades having hinged roots, the blades having a
        stowed position against alternating side panels and a deployed
        position extended outwardly in a generally horizontal plane. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of the present invention is to provide an aerial
        cargo container comprising a cargo box having a continuous side
        wall, a first end cap and a second end cap; a rotor hub across
        the first end cap; and a plurality of rotor blades having
        leading and trailing edges, and root hinged to the rotor hub,
        the blades having a stowed position against the box and a
        deployed position extending outwardly from the box in a
        generally horizontal plane. </p>
      <p>Still another aspect of the present invention is to provide an
        aerial cargo container comprised of a cargo box with a plurality
        of rotor blades with leading and trailing edges, each of the
        blades having a stowed position against the box and a deployed
        position extending outwardly from the box in a generally
        horizontal plane, the blades being formed of corrugated material
        and having a planar lower surface and an upper surface that
        includes triangular raised sections adjacent the leading and
        trailing edges. </p>
      <p>Another aspect of the invention is to provide an aerial cargo
        container comprising of a box having a continuous side wall
        formed of six rectangular side panels, an upper end wall at one
        end of the side wall and a lower end wall at the opposite end of
        the side wall, the walls being constructed of corrugated
        material and forming a cargo cavity; three rotor blades having
        leading and trailing edges, and inner root ends, the blades
        having a stowed position against alternating side panels of the
        side wall and a deployed position extending outwardly from the
        box in a generally horizontal plane, each of the blades consists
        of a lower panel and an upper panel, made up of two triangular
        boxes, a spar pocket and a spar. The front triangular box is
        adjacent to the leading edge of the blade, the rear triangular
        box is adjacent to the trailing edge, abutting the lower panel,
        and the central section between the two triangular boxes
        consisting of the spar pocket and the spar contained therein; a
        rotor hub across the first end wall, the root ends of the blades
        being hinged to the hub; a tether attach frame across the second
        end wall; and blade tethers attached to the blade spars to the
        tether attach frame. </p>
      <p>These and other aspects of the present invention will become
        apparent to those skilled in the art after a reading of the
        following description of the preferred embodiment. </p>

      <p>In the following description, terms such as horizontal,
        upright, vertical, above, below, beneath, and the like, are used
        solely for the purpose of clarity in illustrating the invention,
        and should not be taken as words of limitation. The drawings are
        for the purpose of illustrating the invention and are not
        intended to be to scale. </p>
      <p>As best shown in the drawings, a preferred embodiment of the
        container includes a box, generally 10, a rotor hub 12, three
        rotor blades 14, a tether frame 16, and strut tethers 18. </p>
      <p>Box 10 is formed of six rectangular side panels joined at their
        abutting edges to from a continuous sidewall 20. An upper
        hexagonal end wall 22 closes the upper end of wall 20 and a
        lower hexagonal honeycomb plug lid 24 closes the opposite end of
        wall 20. A load spacer 28 is inserted into the interior of box
        10 adjacent wall 22 during loading of box 10 to position the
        payload closer to the centroid of the box </p>
      <p>Rotor hub 12 is formed of a lightweight welded wire or extruded
        plastic cage extending across end cap 22 and around the upper
        ends of wall 20. Hub 12 is strengthened by the use of a central
        plate 30 and three triangular sections 32 with their apexes
        welded or formed to plate 30 and their bases adjacent the upper
        ends of alternating side panels of wall 20. </p>
      <p>Blades 14 are hinged at their roots to hub 12 with hinge pins
        34, which extend through hinge points 36 extending from hub 12
        on alternating sides. In order for the box to rotate and create
        aerodynamic lift, the chord line of each rotor blade is set at a
        negative angle of incidence from a horizontal line that is
        parallel to the end cap 22. This angle creates rotative forces
        that spin the entire assembly. The angle of incidence is between
        minus four (-4) and minus six (-6) degrees. At the lower end of
        the container, a tether frame 16 extends across plug lid 24.
        Tethers 18 extend from the tether frame 16 to approximately the
        mid-span of each rotor blade 14. </p>
      <p>As shown in FIG. 2, each rotor blade 14 consists of a folded
        corrugated material that forms a lower panel 38, an upper panel
        comprised of a front segment 40, a spar pocket 46, a trailing
        segment 42, a rear segment 44, and a spar 48 inserted and bonded
        into the spar pocket formed by 46. Each blade of the preferred
        embodiment is formed of a single corrugated piece, with the
        corrugations being parallel to the span of the blade. A hinge
        tube 50 is attached to the root of each blade by a root
        re-enforcement plate or strap 52. Plate 52 stiffens the blade
        root and helps to translate the centrifugal and twisting forces
        to hub 12. </p>
      <p>The container is positioned as shown in FIG. 5 when being
        loaded and transported. Spacer 28 is inserted into the container
        cavity, followed by the cargo (C). After loading, the plug lid
        24 and tether attachment plate 16 are secured in place with a
        strap assembly 54 by securing the hub 12 and frame 16 to the box
        10. Tethers 18 from each rotor 14 are attached to attach frame
        16. The rotors 14 are secured with rotor containment strap 54.
        The box is loaded in the aircraft and the blade containment
        system is attached to the blade deployment static line in the
        aircraft. The box is pushed out of the aircraft and blade
        containment strap 54 is released, causing all three blades 14 to
        be deployed into the relative wind. The box starts to rotate,
        generating aerodynamic braking forces by generating lift. This
        aerodynamic lift is translated through the struts to the tether
        attach frame 16 which then directs the force through the plug
        lid 24 to the cargo (C). This force will stabilize when the box
        and load decelerate to the terminal velocity. This is the
        minimum velocity the box achieves before landing. </p>
      <p>Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those
        skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description.
        It should be understood that all such modifications and
        improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of
        conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of
        the follow claims. </p>

      <p>An aerial cargo container is described that includes a cargo
        box with a plurality of hinged rotor blades having a stowed
        position against the sides of the box and a deployed position
        extending outwardly from the box, and a deceleration and
        orientation assembly to slow the descent of the container and
        align the longitudinal axis of the container with the relative
        wind direction, thereby minimizing damage to the blades upon
        opening. The assembly includes a drogue chute, a blade retainer
        to secure the blades in the stowed position, and a folded
        metering cord attached between the drogue chute and the box, and
        a segment securing the blade retainer, whereby the cord segments
        unfold sequentially upon exertion of a force to slow and orient
        the container, prior to release of the blade retainer to permit
        movement of the blades to their deployed positions. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>(1) Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates generally to an improved,
        disposable cargo container comprised of a box with extendible
        rotor blades that can be dropped from an aircraft to the ground,
        and in particular to a disposable cargo container that includes
        a mechanism for decelerating and orienting the container before
        extension of the rotor blades, thereby reducing the possibility
        of damage to the container. </p>
      <p><b>(2) Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Numerous circumstances require the transport of various kinds
        of cargo to inaccessible or remote areas where ground
        transportation is not possible or timely. These circumstances
        include both military and peacetime conditions, such as
        providing emergency food, fuel and medical supplies to victims
        of natural disasters, fighting of forest fires, etc. </p>
      <p>In many instances, the cargo can be transported to the area by
        helicopter, or dropped from an airplane with a parachute.
        However, helicopters are not always readily available, and are
        expensive to operate. Parachutes are also expensive,
        particularly when used to drop relatively small quantities of
        cargo, and are usually not recoverable due to the terrain and
        the conditions under which the cargo is dropped. </p>
      <p>Various prior art patents since at least as early as the 1940s
        have proposed an alternative means involving the dropping of
        containers of small cargo loads from an aircraft without a
        parachute. Instead, the container is constructed of a disposable
        box with attached wings or rotor blades that extend outwardly
        when the box is dropped from an aircraft. The force of the air
        against the lower surface of these blades causes the blades to
        turn in the direction of their leading edges, rotating the
        attached box and creating lift to slow the container's descent.
      </p>
      <p>This alternative transport means, while conceptually addressing
        the need for inexpensive cargo delivery, has apparently found no
        significant application. This lack of use is believed to be
        attributable to two somewhat related reasons; cost effectiveness
        and durability. </p>
      <p>A disposable aerial cargo container that addresses these prior
        art deficiencies, i.e., a container that can be manufactured at
        an acceptable cost while still having the required strength and
        durability necessary for transportation of cargo loads of up to
        about sixty (60) pounds or more under adverse conditions without
        significant damage to the cargo upon impact with the ground is
        described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,947,419, issued Sep. 7, 1999 to
        Warren et al., and incorporated herein by reference. </p>
      <p>The Warren et al. container, like prior art containers, is
        comprised of a box for holding the cargo to be transported, and
        a plurality of wings or rotor blades having hinged roots, with
        the blades being deployable to a substantially horizontal
        attitude when the container is dropped from the aircraft. As
        with prior art containers, air pressure against the rotor blades
        causes the box to rotate and creates aerodynamic lift to slow
        the descent of the container. The preferred Warren et al.
        container includes a cargo box with a hexagonal cross-section
        comprised of a continuous side wall formed of six rectangular
        attached facets that are positioned in a hexagonal
        configuration, and a hexagonal end wall closing one end of the
        box formed by the side wall material. The open end of the
        container is closed with a hexagonal shaped plug type lid to
        enclose the cavity. Alternatively, both ends of the box can be
        closed and the plug placed inside the box to act as a crushable
        or frangible cushion of landing. The box walls, for purposes of
        disposability and economy, are preferably formed of corrugated
        paper or hardboard. </p>
      <p>The preferred Warren et al. container includes six side panels
        with three or more rotor blades, one blade adjacent to every
        other panel depending on the number of blades used. When the
        container is stowed, the rotor blades are folded against the
        side panels and, when deployed, extend outward from the box in a
        substantially horizontal plane substantially perpendicular to
        the side panels. In order to achieve maximum lift, while still
        being easy to store, the blades preferably have length and width
        dimensions approximating the corresponding dimensions of the
        side panels. </p>
      <p>While the rotor blades may be hinged at their root to one panel
        or side of the container box, there is a risk of separation of
        one or more rotors during flight, causing the container to
        plummet to the ground, damaging the cargo. In the Warren et al.
        invention, this deficiency is addressed by the use of a separate
        rotor blade hub positioned at the closed (upper) end of the box,
        with the rotor blades being hinged at their roots to the hub,
        instead of directly to the box. Preferably, the hub is in the
        shape of a metal wire or composite material frame that extends
        over the top and upper edges of the box. The rotor hinge points
        on the hub are located on the support adjacent alternating or
        sequential box panels, with hinge pins being used to attach the
        rotor blades to the hinge points of the hub. Thus, the
        centrifugal force exerted by the blades act upon each other
        through the hub and not the box. Preferably, the hub includes a
        common central point with connections from the central point to
        each of the hinge points. With this arrangement, the rotor
        blade's centrifugal forces tend to act against each other to
        negate the stresses and loads on the box. </p>
      <p>Upward movement of the blades during deployment and flight is
        limited by tethers and shock cords having their upper ends
        attached to the blades and their lower ends attached at the lid
        (lower) end of the box. The tethers may be resilient, such as a
        bungee cord, or a non-resilient cord of a material such as
        nylon. Since the tethers are also subjected to high forces,
        particularly during deployment, the box preferably includes a
        tether attachment frame that extends across the bottom wall
        (lid). This tether attachment frame includes attachment points
        to secure the lower end of each tether approximately beneath the
        rotor blade to which the upper end of the tether is attached.
        For example, the attachment frame can be in the shape of an
        equilateral triangle having apexes that extend beyond the
        periphery of the box under the alternating panel over which the
        panels are positioned, with one tether being attached at each
        apex of the triangle. Alternatively, a hub similar to the rotor
        hub can be placed on the bottom of the container to protect the
        box during handling and serve as a multiple (up to six) attach
        points for the tethers for all the blades. </p>
      <p>Unlike earlier prior art rotor blades of metal or wood, the
        Warren et al. rotor blades are made from a planar piece of
        corrugated paper or polymer, either in the form of a single
        corrugated material sheet or a plurality of segments joined in a
        particular manner to provide the needed structural integrity
        under incurred aerodynamic and centrifugal loading, while
        maintaining the required economy. Each rotor blade is comprised
        of a lower facet, and a multi-facet upper panel with a
        multi-faceted forward section, a rotor spar of wood or other
        material, and a generally planar rear section secured to the
        lower panel to form an integral aerodynamically-shaped blade. </p>
      <p>When loaded, the rotor blades are held against their respective
        box facets by a blade restraining strap. At the drop zone, the
        box is pushed from the aircraft with a static line or other
        means removing the blade-restraining strap. The relative wind
        around the box causes a lifting force to deploy the rotor blades
        which rotate about their hinge attach points and are snubbed by
        the tethers and the shock cords. The blades will be limited to a
        substantially horizontal orientation, i.e. plus or minus ten
        (10) degrees of horizontal by the tethers. In turn, the tether
        attach frame absorbs the tension in the tethers instead of the
        box. The force of the air against the lower facet of the blades,
        with the leading edges of the blades being lower than their
        trailing edges, causes the container to rotate in the direction
        of the leading edges, and accelerate rotationally until it
        achieves rotational terminal velocity, generating maximum
        aerodynamic lift, thereby slowing the box to its terminal
        vertical velocity. </p>
      <p>While the Warren et al. cargo container is a significant
        improvement over prior art containers, there is still a risk of
        damage to the container and its contents when the container is
        released from the aircraft, particularly with heavy and
        asymmetrical loads or when the container is being deployed in
        high relative winds (airspeeds). As noted above, the rotor
        blades in the Warren et al. container are released for movement
        to their deployed or extended position from their stowed
        position as the container is released from the aircraft. As a
        result, the blades extend while the container is dropping
        rapidly, exerting considerable force on the blades and the
        hinged attach points. After the blades are fully extended and
        the container is rotating, the container will orient so that an
        equal force is exerted on all blades. However, when the
        container is dropped from a moving aircraft, the orientation of
        the container may be such that unequal blade forces are exerted.
        These unequal forces, particularly if the container is moving at
        a high rate of speed, may cause damage to one or more rotor
        blades, or prohibit their deployment. </p>
      <p>Thus, the utility of containers constructed similar to the
        Warren et al. container, would be considerably enhanced, and the
        risk of damage decreased, if the container could be oriented and
        its descent slowed prior to deployment of the rotor blades. By
        slowing the container prior to blade deployment, the container
        will be farther away from the drop aircraft, insuring that the
        container is not struck by the aircraft. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In general, the desired results of the present invention are
        achieved by adding a deceleration and orientation assembly, also
        referred to herein as a delay assembly for brevity, as described
        herein in detail, to cargo containers of the type that include a
        cargo box with hinged blades having a stowed position against
        the box and a deployed position extending outwardly from the
        box. </p>
      <p>The delay assembly of the present invention is generally
        comprised of an air resistance device, such as a drogue chute; a
        blade retainer adapted to secure the rotor blades in their
        stowed position; and a folded metering cord that has one end
        attached to the resistance device, an opposed end attached to
        the top of the container, and a segment attached to the blade
        retainer. Preferably, the metering cord includes a plurality of
        folds that are adapted to unfold in sequence. </p>
      <p>When loading the container, the bottom cage or hub with the
        respective blade tethers and rotor blades attached is placed on
        the floor. The box is inserted into the bottom cage in its
        hexagonal shape and the frangible plug is inserted into the box.
        The payload is placed in the box on top of the plug and secured
        in the center of the box with packing and dunnage. The top wall
        of the box is closed and the rotor hub cage is placed over the
        top of the box. The top and bottom hubs are strapped together to
        maintain their relative position with each other with the box in
        between them. The rotor blades are then pinned in place to the
        rotor hinge clips on the upper hub and secured. The delay
        assembly and blade retaining strap is then attached and secured
        for transport to the aircraft for launch. </p>
      <p>When the cargo container is discharged from the aircraft, the
        drogue chute or other drag device, e.g., a streamer, exerts a
        drag due to wind resistance, creating tension on the metering
        cord, sequentially opening folds of the cord, thereby slowing
        the descent of the container. At the same time the cord tension
        orients the container so that its axis is aligned with the wind
        direction. Following deceleration and orientation, the blade
        retainer is released permitting the rotor blades to open to
        their extended position. Since the container is moving at a
        slower speed, and since the force of the air is approximately
        equal against all of the blades, all rotor blades will deploy.
        Thus, the risk of damage is substantially reduced. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, the metering cord is folded into an
        a plurality if S-type folds, with the folds being secured by
        thread that has a breaking strength below the force exerted on
        the metering cord during deceleration, e.g., about 15 pounds
        force to about 30 pounds force. The number of thread loops
        securing the folds is equal to twice the number of folds, with
        the upper or outer fold being engaged by one thread loop and
        each half sequential fold being engaged by a one additional
        thread loop. The lower fold, used to secure the blade retainer
        is sewn with all thread loops and therefore the last to break. </p>
      <p>When a force exceeding the breaking strength of the thread is
        exerted on the cord, the single loop holding the outer fold is
        broken, allowing the outer fold to open. As a result, a brief
        drop in restraining force against the container is followed by
        an increased force, or tug, acting to decelerate and orient the
        container. The continuing force on the cord then causes the
        second loop to break, allowing the next fold to open with a
        similar effect. This sequence continues until the final thread
        holding the lower elongated fold is broken, resulting in pulling
        of the elongated fold from the blade retainer, and permitting
        the blades to open. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In the following description, terms such as horizontal,
        upright, vertical, above, below, beneath, and the like, are used
        solely for the purpose of clarity in illustrating the invention,
        and should not be taken as words of limitation. The drawings are
        for the purpose of illustrating the invention and are not
        intended to be to scale. </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiment of the present invention will be
        described in the context of the Warren et al. container
        discussed above. It will be understood, however, that the delay
        assembly can also be used with other cargo containers, as well
        as with other items that are deployed aerially without a
        parachute in lieu of static line systems now in use. </p>
      <p>As best shown in the drawings, a preferred embodiment of the
        invention is comprised of a cargo container, generally 10,
        having a delay assembly, generally 12, positioned on the top of
        container 10. Container 10 is comprised of a box 14 formed of
        six rectangular side panels joined at their abutting edges to
        from a continuous sidewall, a rotor hub 16 formed of a
        lightweight welded wire or extruded plastic cage, three rotor
        blades 18, a lower hub 20 similar in construction to hub 16, and
        strut tethers 22 joining blades 18 to hub 20. Blades 18 are
        hinged at their roots to hub 16 with hinge pins 24. In order for
        the box to rotate and create aerodynamic lift, the chord line of
        each rotor blade is set at a negative angle of incidence from a
        horizontal line that is parallel to the end cap 22. This angle
        creates rotative forces that spin the entire assembly. Different
        airfoil shapes may need different angles of attack. For example,
        the angle of incidence may be between minus four (-4) and minus
        six (-6) degrees. Tethers 22 extend from tether frame 20 to
        approximately the mid-span of each rotor blade 18. </p>
      <p>Delay assembly 12 is comprised of a flexible metering cord 30
        that is folded as shown in FIG. 3 prior to deployment and held
        in the folded condition by breakable threads 32, a drogue chute
        34, and a housing 36, which may be a cardboard box, to enclose
        cord 30 and chute 34 prior to deployment. Blade retainer 38 is
        stretched around box 14 and blades 18 and secured by a segment
        of cord 30. Cord 30 is formed of a flexible material, such as
        nylon webbing or a nylon cord that will not break under the
        conditions of use. Cord 30 will normally have a length of from
        about 15 feet to about 30 feet for use with most containers. </p>
      <p>As best illustrated in FIG. 3, cord 30 is initially folded into
        a plurality of folds, i.e., an outer fold 40; an elongated inner
        fold 42, which serves to secure blade retainer 38; and one or
        more intermediate folds 44 between folds 40 and 42. For ease of
        packing, and to facilitate a uniform deployment, outer fold 40
        and intermediate folds 44 are generally of the same size, while
        inner fold 42 will be of a length sufficient to engage blade
        retainer 38. For purposes of discussion, it will be understood
        that each "fold" is formed of two adjacent, overlapping cord
        segments. </p>
      <p>As will be discussed in greater detail hereinafter, it is
        desirable for the cord folds to open sequentially during
        deployment, with outer fold 40 opening first, followed by each
        intermediate fold 44 beginning with the intermediate fold
        closest to outer fold 40, and finally inner fold 42. To achieve
        this sequential opening, the folds are joined by a plurality of
        thread loops that will break when subjected to the forces of
        deployment. Specifically, an outer thread loop 50 joins all of
        the folds together. An inner thread loop 52 joins only the
        segments of inner fold 42, and intermediate thread loops 54 join
        each intermediate fold 44 to lower fold 42 and all folds between
        the particular intermediate fold and the lower fold.
        Supplemental breakable threads 56 and 58 may be used to secure
        the outer ends of folded cord 30 until deployment. By
        duplicating the thread stitch pattern from the inner fold to the
        outer fold loop pattern, additional break points can be used to
        increase the amount of brake tugs imparted to the container,
        thereby slowing down the container prior to lade deployment. </p>
      <p>Thus, the folds open sequentially when a pulling force is
        exerted between the ends of cord 30, beginning with outer fold
        40. That is, outer thread loop 50 initially breaks, since thread
        loop 50 is the only thread loop securing outer fold 40. Then,
        since fold 44 is secured by only one thread loop, the thread
        loop 54 breaks. This sequential breakage and extension of cord
        30 continues until inner thread loop 52 is broken, allowing
        inner fold 42 to be pulled from blade retainer 38. </p>
      <p>Outer end 60 of cord 30 is attached to a drag device, such as
        drogue chute 34, with inner end 62 being attached to the top of
        cargo container 10, e.g., at the center of rotor hub 16. Folded
        cord 30 and drogue chute 34 are packaged within housing 36.
        Housing 36 includes an first or upper access opening 66 to
        permit removal of drogue chute 34 and cord 30, a second or
        bottom access opening 68 that is opened to withdraw inner end 52
        of cord 30 for attachment to hub 16, and a third or side access
        opening 70 to withdraw inner loop 42 to secure blade retainer
        38. Each opening may be covered by a flap or other cover prior
        to use. </p>
      <p>Blade retainer 38 in the preferred embodiment is comprised of a
        stretchable band or strap, e.g., a bungee cord that is stretched
        around box 14 and all blades 18 to secure blades 18 in a stowed
        position against the sides of box 14. The ends of retainer 38
        are held together by inner fold 42. For example, as illustrated
        in FIG. 4, the opposed ends of retainer 38 may include closed
        loops 74 and 76, with loop 74 being inserted through loop 76 and
        the end of inner fold 42 being inserted through loop 74. </p>
      <p>When cargo container 10 is to be dropped from an aircraft, the
        operator opens the flap or lid covering opening 66 of housing 36
        and removes chute 34. Container 10 is then pushed or thrown from
        the aircraft. To ensure opening, chute 34 may be briefly held by
        the operator or by a breakable static line. As container 10
        begins to fall, the force of air resulting from the forward and
        downward movement of container 10 opens chute 34, causing a
        force to about 30 pounds or more to be exerted on cord 30,
        causing folds 40, 44 and 42 of cord 30 to sequentially open.
        Each loop break meters the stowed cord and imparts a pull to
        decelerate and orient container 10 so that the longitudinal axis
        of container 10 aligns with the direction of movement. Finally,
        thread loop 52 securing inner fold 42 is broken, resulting in
        inner fold 42 being pulled from blade retraining strap 38. As a
        result, blades 18 are released to move outwardly to their
        extended positions. Thus, when blades 18 extend, the speed of
        container 10 has become oriented at the correct attitude and its
        descent slowed. Therefore, an equal and reduced force is exerted
        on all blades, significantly reducing the possibility of damage
        on one or more of the blades. </p>
      <p>Certain modifications and improvements will occur to those
        skilled in the art upon a reading of the foregoing description.
        It should be understood that all such modifications and
        improvements have been deleted herein for the sake of
        conciseness and readability but are properly within the scope of
        the following claims. </p>
