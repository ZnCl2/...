                the Betz Limit</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
            </big></div>
          <br>
          For the same swept area (by a wind turbine), the wind energy
          captured by the sail-shaped body of the Saphonian is twice as
          higher as that of conventional wind turbine. By replacing the
          blades' rotor by a compact sail-shaped body (curved) that
          enjoys high aerodynamic coefficients (Cl and Cd), the
          Saphonian has set itself free from the insurmountable Betz
          limit.<br>
          <br>
          Empirical performance tests have shown that the Saphonian
          efficiency level is 2.3 times as high as that of the bladed
          wind turbine on account of the following:<br>
          <br>
          - For the same swept area (by a wind turbine), the wind energy
          captured by the Saphonian is twice as higher as that of
          conventional wind turbine.<br>
          <br>
          - The Saphonian has eliminated most of aerodynamic and
          mechanical losses, originally due to the use of blades and
          gearbox and to the characteristics of the rotational motion.<br>
          <br>
          Over the last two years, Saphon’s team has designed, developed
          and tested number of operating prototypes. The latest
          empirical tests made on a 300-500 Watt prototype (diameter of
          120 cm) confirmed and validated the theoretical assumptions.
          This allowed us to optimize the initial design and further
          improve the hydro-mechanical performance. A second generation
          prototype is under tests.<br>

        <div align="left"> [TUNIS] A Tunisian invention that harvests
          wind energy through adesign inspired by sailboats promises
          cheaper, more efficient wind energy.<br>
          <br>
          The bladeless wind turbine, the Saphonian, named after the
          wind divinity that was worshipped by the ancient
          Carthaginians, also promises to be more environmentally
          friendly than existing wind turbines that produce noise and
          kill birds through their blade rotation.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of rotating blades, the Saphonian's sail-shaped body
          collects the kinetic energy of the wind, Anis Aouini, the
          Saphonian's inventor, told SciDev.Net.<br>
          <br>
          He explained that the resulting mechanical energy moves
          pistons which generate hydraulic pressure that can be stored
          in a hydraulic accumulator or converted into electricity.<br>
          <br>
          "This is not the first bladeless wind turbine, but we thought
          outside the box: the initial idea came from sails — the only
          human system that can capture and convert the bulk of the
          wind's power into mechanical energy," said Aouini.<br>
          <br>
          An average wind turbine captures only 30 to 40 per cent of the
          wind's kinetic energy, while the Saphonian can capture up to
          80 per cent, according to Aouini.<br>
          <br>
          Hassine Labaied, chief executive of Saphon Energy, the
          start-up energy company established to get the turbine to
          market, said the Saphonian reduces the aerodynamic and
          mechanical energy losses associated with rotating-blade
          turbines.<br>
          <br>
          "Our second generation prototype is 2.3 times more efficient,
          and costs nearly half the price of its predecessors
          [conventional wind turbines]. It discards the most expensive
          components in a traditional wind turbine, which are the
          blades, hub and gearbox," said Labaied.<br>
          <br>
          Aouini and Labaied patented the technology in Tunisia in
          September 2010, and received an international patent in March
          2012. Saphon Energy is now looking for a partnership with a
          manufacturer to deploy the technology worldwide.<br>
          <br>
          "We are negotiating with a number of international companies
          that produce renewable energy technology, and will finalise
          this by the end of this year," said Labaied. He estimated that
          it would take up to two years until the commercial product
          reaches the market.<br>
          <br>
          Ali Kanzari, a renewable energy expert and director-general of
          Solar Energy Systems, told SciDev.Net that the Saphonian
          "seems to be a radical and economically viable alternative to
          bladed turbines". However, he added that "the manufacturing
          step is important as it will determine how the market will
          accept it".<br>
          <br>
          "The electricity produced through wind in Tunisia represents
          five per cent of total electricity production in the country,"
          Ayadi Ben Aissa, former chief executive of the Tunisian
          Society of Electricity and Gas (STEG), told SciDev.Net.<br>
          <br>
          He said that using the Saphonian technology could produce up
          to 20 per cent of Tunisia's electricity from wind in the
          medium term.<br>

        Applicant: SAPHON ENERGY LTD<br>
        <br>
        <div align="left"> The invention consists of a system for
          converting wind energy (SCEE) into mechanical and then
          electrical energy. This system (SCEE) is not subject to the
          theoretical Betz limit (59%). The system (SCEE) has a wheel
          (F) equipped with a series of blades arranged all around it.
          The wheel (F) turns in a pivoting connection about a fixed
          axle (L). Set on the axle (L), a support (E) attaches the end
          plates of a series of double-acting actuating cylinders (D).
          The cylinder rods of the latter are in a ball jointed
          connection with the body (A), the purpose of this being to
          offer the latter a maximum degree of freedom in space. A rigid
          arm (C) is set on one side of the wheel (F) and held on the
          other side, in a pivoting connection, on a U-shaped section
          piece (B). Having a circular satellite movement, the latter
          turns with the wheel (F) while at the same time sliding over a
          peripheral region of the body (A). When the wind blows against
          the body (A), the latter pivots with the section piece (B) and
          pushes on the cylinder rods of the actuating cylinders (D).
          Having a circular satellite movement, the section piece (B)
          turns, sliding over a peripheral region of the body (A), thus
          changing the fulcrum of the moment of the resultant force of
          the wind (the pivot connection of the section piece (B))
          applied to the body (A). The cylinder rods of the actuating
          cylinders (D) will therefore be pulled and pushed, while at
          the same time having a cyclic translational movement. Set on
          the axle (L), and a nacelle (J) chiefly contains a hydraulic
          motor (H) and an electric generator (G), which can be coupled
          via a speed multiplier. During the reciprocating movements of
          the pistons of the actuating cylinders (D), a set of valves
          allows for a one-way flow of hydraulic fluid inside "out and
          back" hydraulic circuits either by pulling or pushing. The
          "out and back" hydraulic circuits are also connected to the
          hydraulic motor (H). To keep the system (SCEE) always facing
          into the wind and allow it to pivot on the mast (1), it can be
          orientated by a tail vane (K) which is fixed, via a support,
          to the nacelle (J).<br>

            Description</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The invention description about this technique, is a system
          for converting wind energy (CESG) into mechanical energy and
          then electricity.<br>
          <br>
          This system of conversion of wind energy (CESG), described
          below, is not subject to the theoretical limit of Betz (59%).<br>
          <br>
          Therefore, this invention provides a performance much higher
          than wind turbines currently in use.<br>
          <br>
          System (WECS) has a wheel (F) with a series of blades arranged
          around (see drawing N [deg.] L).<br>
          <br>
          The wheel (F) is rotated in association pivot about an axis
          (L) fixed, thanks to the kinetic energy of the wind through
          the blades, providing the wheel (F) a mechanical energy of
          rotation.<br>
          <br>
          Flush to the axis (L), a holder (E), rigid enough, secures the
          plates (or the rear end) of a series of double-acting
          cylinders (D).<br>
          <br>
          The latter may consist of one or more double-acting cylinders
          (see drawing 1M [deg.]1).<br>
          <br>
          To simplify the present description, the system (WECS) has a
          series of three double-acting cylinders.<br>
          <br>
          Distribution and positioning of the series of double-acting
          cylinders (D) on the bracket (E) to be assured of a
          well-defined way to ensure a better functioning (See detail N
          [deg.] The drawing N [ deg.] l).<br>
          <br>
          The piston rods of the plurality of double-acting cylinders
          (D) are connected with the ball joint housing (A) and that, in
          order to provide the latter with a maximum degree of freedom
          in space, allowing one movement and a more fluid into the wind
          (See detail N [deg.] the drawing N [deg.] l) &amp; (drawing N
          [deg.]7).<br>
          <br>
          Said body (A) has a shape and surface property determined,
          respectively to achieve a drag coefficient higher and a
          maximum resultant force of wind captured.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, the body (A) must have the lightest weight
          possible.<br>
          <br>
          For this case, and not limited to a portion of its surface may
          be, for example, covered with veil (See drawing N [deg.]2).<br>
          <br>
          In order to allow the wheel (F) to rotate freely and
          independently of the body (A), its active surface (the surface
          facing the wind) is kept constantly exposed to the wind (see
          the front views of the drawings N [deg.]3, N [deg.]4, N [deg.]
          5 &amp; ??N [deg.]6).<br>
          <br>
          The mountings of the piston rods of the double-acting
          cylinders (D) on the body (A) to be set at the axis which
          coincides with the direction of the vector of the resultant
          force of the wind attacks the body (A) (See detail N [deg.]
          the drawing N [deg.] l).<br>
          <br>
          A rigid arm (C) is recessed from one side to the wheel (F) and
          maintained on the other side, pivotally connected to a profile
          (B) U-shaped With a circular motion satellite, it turns,
          therefore, with the wheel (F) while sliding on a peripheral
          area of ??the body (A) (See drawing N [deg.]2).<br>
          <br>
          In order to minimize the friction of the sliding profile (B),
          the latter may be in contact with the sides of the peripheral
          area of ??the body (A) via the rollers or the like.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, the peripheral area of ??the body (A) must be
          smooth enough and stiff enough.<br>
          <br>
          When the wind acts on the body (A), the latter rotates under
          the effect of the moment of the resultant force of the wind,
          as with that of the pivot section (B) and the body (A) grows
          without jamming through bonds ball, the stems of double acting
          cylinders (D) that are present in the area diametrically
          opposite the rail (B).<br>
          <br>
          The rods double acting cylinders (D) present in the reverse
          zone (zone side of the profile (B)) tend to be drawn (see
          drawing IM [deg.]3).<br>
          <br>
          Having a circular satellite movement, the profile (B) is
          rotated while sliding on a peripheral area of ??the body (A),
          thereby changing the pivot point of the resultant force of the
          wind (the pivot connection of the profile (B)) which s'
          applied to the body (A).<br>
          <br>
          The rods double acting cylinders (D) will, therefore, drawn
          and pushed, while having a translational movement cycle (See
          drawings N [deg.]3, N [deg.]4, N [deg.]5 &amp; ??N [deg.]6).<br>
          <br>
          Thus, wind energy captured by the wind body (A) is converted
          into mechanical energy of translation of the piston at the
          double-acting cylinders (D), thus creating pressure on the
          latter.<br>
          <br>
          The views from the front, left, top and perspective drawings N
          [deg.]3, N [deg.]4, N [deg.]5 &amp; ??N [deg.] 6 show the
          action of the body (A) on the stems of double-acting cylinders
          (D) as well as the behavior of the system (WECS) upwind for
          different positions (0 [deg. ], 90 [deg.], 180 [deg.] &amp;
          270 [deg.]) of the profile (B) on the peripheral area of ??the
          body (A).<br>
          <br>
          A nacelle (D) is embedded to the axis (L).<br>
          <br>
          This platform (J) contains mainly a hydraulic motor (H) and an
          electrical generator (G), which can be coupled via a speed
          multiplier (See drawing N [deg.] L).<br>
          <br>
          During the back and forth movements of the pistons series
          double acting cylinders (D), they grow hydraulic fluid to the
          hydraulic circuit path (in red) convertible to either pulling
          or pushing, and through a set of valves (see drawing N
          [deg.]7).<br>
          <br>
          The latter also allows to suck the hydraulic fluid in the
          double effect cylinders (D) through the hydraulic return
          circuit (blue) and, in single direction "regardless of the
          motion by pulling or pushing."<br>
          <br>
          The hydraulic circuit of the aisle (red) is connected to the
          input of a hydraulic motor (H).<br>
          <br>
          The back (blue) is also connected to the output of the
          hydraulic motor (M) (see drawing N [deg.]7).<br>
          <br>
          Thus, the flow of hydraulic fluid under pressure, is converted
          into a rotational movement of the motor shaft (H), which is
          connected to the axis of the electric power generator (G) via
          a speed multiplier, generating so clean electricity (see
          drawing N [deg.]7).<br>
          <br>
          To allow for the wind direction kept the system (WECS), can be
          equipped with a system of automatic orientation allowing it to
          pivot on the mat (i) and keep the body (A) and the wheel (F )
          continually face the wind, and this mode upstream or
          downstream.<br>
          <br>
          In addition, the orientation can be achieved using a rudder
          (K), well-defined dimensions, fixed through a medium, the
          nacelle (J) (see drawing N [deg.] L).<br>
          In order to simplify the operation of the orientation system
          (WECS) and not limited to the solution of the rudder (K) is in
          this case taken as illustrative example.<br>
          <br>
          Thus, wind energy captured by the body (A) is converted into
          mechanical energy of translation and rotation, respectively,
          via the rods of the set of cylinders (D) and the hydraulic
          motor (H).<br>
          <br>
          This mechanical energy is then converted into electrical
          energy with the electric generator (G).<br>
          <br>
          The link in this chain of energy conversion on the conversion
          of mechanical energy into mechanical energy of translation of
          rotation can be insured without limitation, via several other
          mechanisms such as crank-connecting rod or other ...<br>
          <br>
          As announced at the beginning of the technical description,
          the system (WECS) is not subject to the theoretical limit of
          Betz (16/27%) and provides a better yield of wind energy
          conversion.<br>
          <br>
          The only component subject to the Betz limit, is that the
          wheel (F) which has only a small surface area compared to the
          total active surface system (WECS).<br>
          In addition, this wheel (F) only serves to change the position
          of the profile (B) in a circular motion satellite and the
          energy it captures is not required to consider the chain of
          energy conversion described above, or in the final recovered
          energy.<br>
