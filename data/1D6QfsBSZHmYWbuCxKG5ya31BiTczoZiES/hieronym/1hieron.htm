      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Introduction</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Complete theories do not
          fall from heaven"...&nbsp; Freud.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This well exemplified the
          attitude of many people --- that if an idea is not completely
          developed and the theory so foolproof as to be beyond
          question, then they want no part in it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Following Benjamin
          Franklin’s discovery of electricity, a scoffer caustically
          asked, "Of what use is that kind of knowledge?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To which Franklin kindly
          replied, "Of what use is a child? He may grow into a man."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are very much in the same
          position as Franklin. We have discovered a new force or rather
          we have uncovered a force that has been here since the
          beginning of time but only a few have recognized it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The BIG question is, "What
          shall we do with it?"</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At the moment, we are doing
          two things: continuing research and acquainting interested
          people with the idea in order to get their cooperation. That
          is the reason for this paper. This is the first time the
          subject has been discussed publicly before an audience.</font>
      </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eloptic Radiation Theory</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is an all-pervading
          media that is capable of being set into activity by certain
          forces. This media might be the same as that which is
          described by electronic and electrical engineers and
          physicists as the ether in action at higher harmonics than so
          far explored, or it may be a finer media. Since it acts as if
          it were different, let’s call it the FINE MEDIA for
          descriptive purposes at the moment.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our material world is made
          up of combinations of a few units, some of which are called
          electrons, protons, and neutrons. These units act as if they
          were precipitations out of the Fine Media, because these units
          may be disintegrated or put back into their original state in
          the Fine Media. There is much in today’s scientific literature
          that points the way to these conclusions in addition to our
          own research results. The Fine Media can take on or manifest
          several different qualities, such as frequency and cohesive
          force.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just as the ether can be
          caused to vibrate at different bands of frequencies to
          manifest as electricity, radio, heat, light, ultraviolet,
          etc., so can the Fine Media be caused to manifest in many
          ways.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the Fine Media is
          properly influenced, it can be caused to coalesce to the point
          where material units such as electrons, protons, and neutrons
          are formed. When these units are desired to be grouped
          together, a still further manifestation of the Fine Media
          takes the form of the cohesive force necessary to form the
          nits into elements such as helium, iron, gold, and uranium. A
          still further manifestation of the cohesive force is necessary
          to form elements into compound or complex groups.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When such units are formed
          into elements or compounds, there is a stress field, or aura,
          around or radiating from such elements and complex groups.
          This field or aura has a frequency that is characteristic for
          each nuclear and molecular combination.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For example, chromium having
          in its nucleus 24 protons and 30 neutrons will have a slightly
          lower frequency than will iron with 26 protons and 28
          neutrons, even though both nuclei contain the same total
          number of 54 units each.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This phenomenon is the basis
          of the idea covered by patents and its use as an analyzing
          medium, the subject matter of this paper.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It takes a certain amount of
          energy to cause the Fine Media to coalesce so that the units,
          protons and neutrons, will be formed and a lesser amount of
          energy to combine the units into the group of particles called
          the element, e.g., hydrogen, silver or mercury, and still a
          lesser amount of energy to form the molecules of the various
          compounds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such an element or compound
          can be disintegrated back into its components or units or even
          completely back into the Fine Media from whence it came. The
          atomic bomb action obeys this principle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To disintegrate an element
          and change it back to its units takes energy, the amount
          depending upon the way the energy is applied. Assume a very
          heavy weight suspended by a long chain. To cause this weight
          to oscillate over, e.g., one foot with one blow from a hammer
          might require a hammer of very large proportion and a giant to
          wield it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the other hand, if a
          small boy gave the weight a push, then waited a bit and gave
          another push and another, all timed properly, the weight would
          begin to swing andintime would be swinging through the arc of
          one foot.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When a single blow in the
          form of a fast-moving particle, such as a neutron or alpha
          particle, accelerated in a cyclotron, is the "hammer", and the
          nucleus of an element is to be broken up, the "hammer" must
          strike a tremendous blow (millions of electron volts) to crack
          the nucleus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the other hand, if a
          small amount of energy is fed into the nucleus at its proper
          frequency, the nucleus will easily, slowly, quietly fall apart
          into its units, just by neutralizing the effect of the
          cohesive force or binding energy as it is sometimes called.
          Thus a little energy of proper frequency steadily applied may
          do more than an enormous amount of energy applied in the brute
          force manner.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the most used but
          least controlled and understood methods of setting the Fine
          Media into oscillation is by the Mental-Emotional output from
          a human being. Just as the crystal in a radio power oscillator
          sets the frequency, and the energy applied to the plate
          circuit determines the power output, so does the Mind act to
          set the frequency and the Emotional Body to furnish the power.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Every time we generate an
          emotion we start a wave motion in the Fine Media. Such a wave
          motion can travel infinite distances, and it continues to
          oscillate until some counteracting wave motion is set up to
          neutralize the original or until the original wave motion is
          absorbed by someone or something that is in the proper
          frequency relation to it.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just as a radio receiver
          that is tuned to the exact same frequency as a transmitter
          acts as if it were connected via some invisible medium to the
          transmitter by responding exactly as the transmitter is
          activated, so does a specimen of certain things act as if
          there were a connection between it and the parent body form
          which it was taken by responding exactly to all activities of
          the parent body.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Substantiation</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point, the scoffer
          usually says, "That’s all bunk!" Suppose we digress a moment
          and see to whom he directs his verdict of "bunk".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Almost 20 years ago, Dr
          Robert Millikan, former president of the California Institute
          of Technology and Nobel Prize winner in physics for his work
          in weighing the electron, was speaking before a joint meeting
          of all the technical societies of Kansas City, MO. He showed a
          large number of slides, the last of which was a smooth curve
          with "f" along the left margin and "e" across the bottom. He
          said, "Some day we will find that each of the elements of
          material matter vibrates at a frequency, each different from
          the other."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The writer was thrilled
          beyond words because some of the material in this paper had at
          that time already been discovered.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Years laterm Dr I.I. Rabi of
          Columbia University won the AAAS prize for his work on nuclear
          resonance. Quoting from Science News Letter for January 6,
          1940, on this work, we read, "Atoms can act like little radio
          transmitters broadcasting on ultra short waves."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Associated Press release
          of December 30, 1939, went further and said about Dr Rabi’s
          findings, "Man himself as well as all kinds of supposedly
          inert matter constantly emit rays. The existence of such rays
          coming from man and all living things, and probably from the
          inanimate, has been suspected by a few scientists for many
          years. Today brought experimental proof. The discovery shows
          that every atom and every molecule in nature is a continuous
          radio frequency broadcasting station. Those who believe in
          telepathy, second sight and clairvoyance, have in today the
          first real proof of the existence of invisible rays which
          really travel from one person to another."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another Associated Press
          release next day states, "Scientists who have studied Dr
          Rabi’s report said it furnishes for the first time a logical
          explanation of such things as telepathy, heretofore a
          quasi-scientific phenomenon, and the ‘feeling’ that someone
          else is approaching in a dark room. It may also prove to be
          the source of attraction or repulsion between individuals
          since all the atoms of the body are continually broadcasting
          weak but detectable radio signals."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">David Sarnoff, president of
          RCA, speaking before the 7th International Congress on
          Rheumatic Diseases in New York (June 1, 1949), said, "Men do
          not understand how their thoughts and emotions are born, and
          by what power they grow to fruition. Is this force
          electricity? When we understand each other, is it because we
          are attuned to each other electrically or electronically? If
          so, we should learn the electrical characteristics of the
          human body."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On March 7, 1951, the Miami
          Herald (FL) printed a UP release from Copenhagen, Denmark,
          Agricultural expert Herluf Hansen said, "Any mental
          disturbance is immediately reflected in the pig sty. Keep your
          temper, talk friendly to your pigs, and caress them. The
          financial result will be excellent."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The same paper on march 16,
          1950, carries this, "If beautiful blondes run away at your
          approach, if dogs growl at you without explanation, cheer up,
          maybe it’s not your face after all. Might be your body
          vibrations."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is the theory put
          forward today b y Austrian psychologist Dr Hubert Rochracker,
          who says, "The human body sends out minute vibrations that,
          for good or ill, affect all our daily lives."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Norman Hillier of New York,
          speaking at a convention of the National hair Dressers and
          Cosmetologists Association in Des Moines, IA, said, "A quarrel
          with her husband will have repercussions in milady’s hair in
          five minutes." It reduces the life of a permanent.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The United Press (July 7,
          1949) under a Paris dateline quotes two Frenchmen, Jules Clate
          and Andre Coatrieux, "Every metal and every person, living or
          dead, sends out short waves of different length. Personal
          wavelengths are as individual as fingerprints. Eventually we
          hope to develop it for diagnosing disease."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You are all acquainted with
          the work of Dr J.B. Rhine of Duke University I extrasensory
          perception and his study of the mind and the way it can
          control things. Every doctor has recognized the effect of the
          emotions upon the physical body. Expression such as "that man
          gives me a pain" and "this business makes me sick" may be
          literally true, according to Dr Edward Weiss of Temple
          University Medical School. "The body has some sort of 'organ
          language' for the outlet of tense emotions, which mimic almost
          any disease", said Dr Weiss.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The work of Dr Felix Bloch
          and his group at Stanford University and by Dr E. M. Purcell
          and his group at Harvard, the two groups working independently
          but simultaneously in 1945, confirmed the work of Dr Rabi and
          carried it further.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Anyone who is interested
          will find that hardly a week goes by without some press
          article or technical reference that ties in and touches on
          some phase of this phenomena.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eloptic Energy</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A form of energy hitherto
          unknown has been discovered, and a basic patent has been
          issued covering its use.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The name ELOPTIC has been
          coined and assigned to the energy. The word is taken from the
          first two letters of electricity and the word optic, because
          the energy has some, but not all, of the characteristics of
          both those forms of energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eloptic energy radiates from
          or is in some manner given off from, or forms a force field
          around, everything in our material world under normal
          conditions at ordinary room temperature and without any
          treatment of any kind. Each element and combination of
          elements that make up our material world gives off this
          energy; however, the energy from each element differs in
          frequency from the radiation coming from every other element.
          Thus, we have a means of determining the contents of an
          unknown material by analyzing the radiations from it without
          in any way destroying or disturbing the object or material in
          question, or having to excite it in any manner.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Eloptic energy obeys certain
          laws just as does electricity, heat and light, and we have
          uncovered man, but not all, of these laws and have learned
          much about the utilization of eloptic energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Just as electricity in its
          infancy had few uses because little was known about
          conductors, insulators, and the laws governing the action of
          the force, so is the use of eloptic energy today limited only
          by available technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have barely scratched the
          surface of the possibilities; however, there are quite a few
          uses that have been developed and much is already known about
          the behavior of eloptic energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have identified the
          radiations from over one-third of the elements of material
          matter; the ones easily obtained in relatively pure form such
          as beryllium, carbon, magnesium, aluminum, iron, copper, zinc,
          silver, tin, tantalum, platinum, gold, lead, bismuth, etc.
          Carnotite ore has been analyzed for radium and uranium. Many
          ore samples have been analyzed to determine the various
          elements contained in them, and the findings have been
          verified by more extensive chemical, spectrographic or other
          analytical methods.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Combinations of two or more
          elements give off a characteristic frequency of radiation by
          which the combination may be identified. For example,

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus far, only the
          analytical phase of the utilization of eloptic energy has been
          discussed, and that only in a very limited way; but it should
          be evident that eloptic energy has desirable applications in
          the fields of: (1) Laboratory chemical analysis, (2) Mining,
          (3) Prospecting, (4) Medicine, (5) Nutrition, (6) Animal
          husbandry, (7) Horticulture, (8) Military intelligence, (9)

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Naturally, as time goes on
          and research is continued, many additional uses for eloptic
          energy will be discovered. We already know that eloptic energy
          can be generated or picked up from a natural source, filtered,
          amplified and directed into a tissue of the human body, a
          plant or animal to produce certain desired effects.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Refraction</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When the eloptic energy from
          an unknown material is caused to refract through a proper
          prism, it behaves in the same manner as energy from the
          visible portion of the spectrum, except that the angles of
          refraction are much more acute.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It must not be inferred that
          eloptic radiations and visible light and ultraviolet
          radiations are the same or related because they all may be
          refracted through the same prism or that the frequencies are
          related. Eloptic radiations will behave similarly to the
          radiations of the electromagnetic spectrum in some respects
          and entirely different in other respects, showing that they
          are probably not the same energy at all.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For this reason I prefer to
          call it the Finer Media.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A 31.5°&nbsp; glass prism
          with an index of refraction of 1.505 was used in one
          experiment (see circular coordinate chart). Eloptic energy
          from a number of elements was caused to enter the prism at an
          angle of incidence of 5.5° .</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Using the face of the prism
          as "0", carbon (element # 6) refracted at an angle of 18.25°
          to the face of the prism, and bismuth (element # 83) at
          48.25°. Later, hydrogen gas was found to refract at 16.45°, a
          range of 31.8° for 83° of the elements of the material world.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another arrangement
          employing a 24°&nbsp; prism with an angle of incidence of 17°
          showed hydrogen approximately 7° from the face of the prism,
          and bismuth at 62.3°, or a range of 5.3° for the same 83
          elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A 19 black plexiglass prism
          of 1.847 index of refraction with an angle of incidence of 19
          allowed bismuth to refract through at approximately 65.7° and
          carbon at 12.15°. All of the angles were measured with a
          protractor in a somewhat crude way because of the construction
          of the apparatus, but they are very close to being correct.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If a 90° arc is drawn with
          the center at the point of eloptic energy emergence at the
          face of the prism, between a line projected out in the
          direction along the face of the prism, it will be found that
          all of the radiations are refracted out in this quadrant (see
          Prism Refractor sketch). If the arc of the quadrant is divided
          into 1600 parts with "0" on the line extending along the face
          of the prism and 1600 on the line perpendicular to the face of
          the prism, then it will be found that with a certain apparatus
          arrangement, one of the isotopes of beryllium (Atomic # 4)
          refracts through at approximately 186 on the scale and that
          bismuth (Atomic # 83) refracts through at 1097 on the scale,
          and all of the other elements and their various isotopes
          refract through in their proper relationship, the one having
          the lowest nuclear weight indicating a higher frequency and a
          more acute angle of refraction, and the one with a heavier
          nuclear weight indicating a lower frequency and emerging at a
          less acute angle. The tests show that eloptic energy obeys
          some of the laws of refraction just as does the visible
          portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Radiation from the Nuclei
            of Elements</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A series of experiments has
          been carried out that points rather conclusively to the
          assumption that the radiation that comes from the various pure
          elements is from the entire nucleus and not from the planetary
          electrons or from either the neutrons or the protons alone.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The best obtainable pure
          specimens of the elements Titanium, Vanadium, Chromium,
          Manganese, Iron and Nickel were used. Tests were run on
          Radiation Analyzer # 508. Energy peaks from these elements
          were measured and the prism dial settings for each peak were
          noted. A study of the number of energy peaks for the various
          elements indicated that the number coincided in most case with
          the number of isotopes of the respective elements.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One important item was that
          one of the peaks for chromium and one for titanium were very
          close together; that is, they refracted through the prism at
          near the same angle. The same for another peak of chromium and
          one for iron, and another for an iron peak and a nickel peak.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The number of protons in
          each of the isotopes was multiplied by their individual mass
          weight of 1.00758 and the number of neutrons were multiplied
          by their individual mass weight of 1.00894 and the two
          products added to get a factor representing the differnce in
          two isotopes of the same nuclear particles but with a
          different number of neutrons and protons in each nuclei.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Thus, titanium with 22
          protons and 28 neutrons has a factor of 50.41708, while
          chromium with 24 protons and 26 neutrons has a factor of
          50.41436, a difference of 0.00272, chromium being the lighter,
          in nuclear weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Titanium = ( 22 x 1.00758 )
          + ( 28 x 1.00894 ) = 50.41708</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chromium = (24 x 1.00758 ) +
          ( 26 x 1.00894 ) = 50.41436</font> <br>
        <font face="Times New Roman,Times">Difference = 0.00272</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These factors and the prism
          dial settings were&nbsp; used to produce the curve shown
          (Nuclear Weight Factor vs Prism Angle). One outstanding fact
          noted was that the lighter the factor value, the lower the
          dial setting or higher the frequency of the emanating energy.
          Another was the smoothness of the curve. Nearly all points are
          in proper relationship. Irregularities are probably due to
          slight variations from a true flat of the prism surface.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While plotting this curve,
          it was noted that in a few cases, there were apparently too
          many energy peaks for some of the elements. Further study
          revealed that there were radioactive isotopes of the so-called
          man-made variety that would fit into these spots. It had
          already been noted that known radioactive elements gave a much
          more violent radiation than the so-called stable variety.
          Tests were then made on the various isotopes to determine the
          distance that the radiation, or rather, the force field,
          seemed to extend out from the specimen. Vanadium showed that
          the three isotopes radiated 18.5", 5.5", and 15.5"
          respectively, indicating that apparently the middle one was
          the stable one and the other two were radioactive. The same
          thing was done for Iron and the distances were 16.5", 8.5",
          17", 13" and 10" respectively. This looked like there might be
          a discrepancy as there should not be a radioactive isotope at
          the point of higher degree of radiation. A reference to the
          percentage of material usually found in the various isotopes
          showed that the isotope that radiated 17" was the one that
          runs about 90.2% prevalence. It could be that some of the iron
          of this weight was radioactive or there might have been some
          contamination from manganese which has a radioactive isotope
          of the same weight.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After this same procedure
          had been followed for all the places where there might be a
          question, and everything seemed to fall into proper place, it
          was decided to try it on elements at the heavy end of the
          list. Bismuth showed four isotopes in a row with radiation
          distances as follows: 13" for the stable and lightest isotope,
          and 24.5", 22", and 26", respectively, for the radioactive
          isotopes. Then a gold link bracelet of very old gold, an
          heirloom made before the days of so much alloying, was used.
          The lightest was the stable isotope with a radiation distance
          of 6", with two others of 12.75" and 14.5" for the two
          radioactive isotopes.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The chief chemist of the
          analytical laboratory of a large corporation learned, through
          a mutual friend, about some of our work while the patent
          application was being processed in Washington and were not too
          anxious to divulge much information, but after several letters
          we agreed to help him. One of his letters said, "We have
          recently expanded into a new field of research and some of the
          problems encountered are giving us a great deal of trouble.
          Your apparatus may be the answer."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We allowed him to bring his
          specimens to our laboratory and we spent two days with him,
          most of the time in getting equipment ready for the tests.
          Finally, we analyzed the contents of four bottles marked A1,
          A2, A3, A4. We had no idea beforehand what was in them.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We poured a small quantity
          of liquid from bottle A1 into a pyrex beaker, placed it in the
          instrument, and proceeded to "tune in" to all the "broadcasts"
          that came from the beaker and its contents. Then we did the
          same for the liquid in bottles A2, A3, and A4. As soon as we
          had listed the five energy peaks from the empty beaker, six
          from A1, nine from A2, four from A3and nine from A4, and had
          charted them with relation to each other, the chemist said,
          "Now I know my trouble. A1 is a solvent that works fine, A2 is
          supposed to be the same. Our tests and those of the oil
          company who sells it to us say it is the same as A1, but it
          will not work right and is causing us much trouble. It is
          quite obvious that A2 has been contaminated by A4, which is
          toluene. A3 is benzene."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The three contaminants
          marked (*) were in both solvent A2 and toluene. The empty

          has nine characteristic groupings within the molecule, five of

          the early day electrical apparatus and how peculiar it
          appeared. Remember the first crystal detector wireless set you
          ever saw, and then look at a modern radio installation.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We are just now learning
          which materials are conductors and which are insulators of

          have learned more about eloptic energy so we can get it to
          ring a bell, light a light, or actuate a meter. Until then, we

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We have been able to impose
          eloptic energy upon an electric current and amplify it, but

          techniques sofar developed, it can do things in the laboratory
          in a few minutes that are absolutely impossible or may take
          long periods of time by chemical analysis. It can quickly
          point the way for chemical analysis to follow in order to
          eliminate many of the time-taking tests when an unknown is to
          be analyzed. It is especially valuable where there is only a
          small quantity of the material available. A drop of unknown
          liquid will work better than a gallon. The material to be
          analyzed is on no way changed or destroyed during the
          analysis. Only the emanation normally radiating from it are
          utilized.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A major problem in
          prospecting for minerals with the Eloptic Energy Analyzer
          proved to be precise location. Experiment had demonstrated
          that the energy from buried metal, etc., spreads around it on
          a very large irregular pattern, varying in shape and size from
          day to day and even from hour to hour. It had also been
          observed on a small scale that this energy can be influenced
          by magnetism. Therefore it was decided to explore the
          possibility of using magnets in the field to eliminate or
          concentrate the diffused energy.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For this purpose, several
          ounces of sterling silver were buried about 30 inches deep in
          a level, open field. The Analyzer was placed nearby and its
          input was connected to a long insulated copper wire. On the
          end of this was fastened a test probe.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To determine how far the
          energy extended from the buried silver, the probe was driven
          into the ground successively at various distances along
          several radii, and readings were taken on the Analyzer. In
          this way the field of radiation was found, at that time, to
          form an irregular "pool", extending not less than 50 feet from
          the silver and mostly very much farther.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now two magnets were made,
          hollow core solenoids drawing about 10amperes at twelve volts.
          These were paced on end about 20 feet due east of the silver,
          and iron rods (5/8" by 4 ft) were driven through them and
          about two feet into the ground.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At first three batteries (18
          volts) were connected, and about an hour was allowed for the
          energy field to adjust itself. Then tests were run as before
          with the Analyzer, and it was found that the field had shrunk
          considerably. Following this, two more batteries were attached
          and additional tests were made. The energy field was now found
          to have shrunk still farther, and to possess a more simplified
          outline showing certain definite characteristics. Toward the
          East it terminated near the magnets, and to the Northwest it
          exhibited a pronounced bulge of about 15 or 16 ft radius.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At this point the two
          magnets and batteries were moved to within 12 ft of the silver
          and two more batteries were added, making 7 in all (42 volts).
          Measurements with the Analyzer now showed that the energy pool
          had completely disappeared as such. There remained only two
          well defined bands or streams of energy about a foot wide. One
          of these extended along a straight line connecting the silver
          and the magnets, and the other thrust out about 8 ft toward
          the Northeast, then turned and proceeded directly to the
          magnets. Further tests with the Analyzer showed that the
          energy drawn to the magnets appeared to dissipate itself above
          them and over the batteries in a kind of plume.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This experiment demonstrates
          that this energy is definitely subject to magnetic attraction.
          It also shows that the energy exhibits a strong tendency to
          flow toward the Northwest.</font> </p>

          intensity or quantity of any of the known electrochemical
          series of elements of material matter, or the combination of
          two or more such elements, whether in solid, fluid or gaseous
          forms at ordinary room temperatures and without special
          treatment or requiring any change in the material under
          observation.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The primary aim of this
          invention is the provision of a method and apparatus for
          detecting the presence of any element or combination of
          elements that may be in the substances under observation and
          to determine the intensity or quantity thereof.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention has for a
          still further object to provide a method and means for
          detecting the presence of and analyzing and measuring the
          quantity or intensity of elements or combinations of elements
          in the substance under observation through the capture and
          analysis of radiations emanating from the said elements,
          whether the said radiations be of electrical or optical
          characteristics, or both.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A yet further aim of this
          invention is to provide an instrument having a reaction
          device, the surface whereof is affected by the introduction of
          radiations thereto, in such a manner that the surface of the
          device will have its ability to resist movement of articles
          over its face changed when energy flows through the apparatus,
          of which the reaction device is a part.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A further aim of the
          invention is to provide an atomic radiation analyzer, having
          as one of its important elements, a reaction device, the
          surface whereof is affected to increase adhesion or friction
          as the operator of the analyzer strokes the surface of the
          device and manipulates the instrument to direct radiation
          thereto.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It ahs been discovered that
          there are radiations emanating from or released from each of
          the known elements constituting material matter. These
          radiations occur at ordinary room temperatures, i.e., 40° F to
          90° F and they have electrical and optical characteristics and
          frequencies which are disposed in the zone from the violet ray
          portion of the visible spectrum up into the ultraviolet
          portion, which zone has as yet not been fully explored. Since
          it has been found that these radiations from the elements or
          their effect may be carried over electrical conductors, it is
          the object of this invention to provide apparatus having
          suitable conductors and parts so that analyzing of substances
          may be accomplished. The radiation or the effect of such
          radiations from known elements or combinations of two or more
          elements of material matter may not only be carried over
          electrical conductors and handled in a manner similar to an
          ordinary electrical currnet, but they may be affected by
          electrical capacity inductance and resistance. The radiations
          may also be refracted, focused, diffracted or otherwise
          manipulated in the same manner as the radiations of the
          visible spectrum. Accordingly, therefore, this invention has
          for one of its aims to provide an instrument for handling the
          radiations, identifying their presence, analyzing them and
          measuring their intensity --- all to the end that the presence
          of one or more of the known elements may be concluded from the
          character of the radiation as determined by the behavior of
          the analyzing device and the values read from the appropriate
          scales forming a part of the instrument.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prior to referring
          specifically to the parts of the apparatus diagrammatically
          illustrated in the drawing, clarification of the theory upon
          which the invention is predicated will be made by explaining
          experiments heretofore conducted and capable of proving the
          phenomenal theories hereinafter disclosed as having a bearing
          upon the practicability and utility of both the electrical and
          optical apparatus.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Radiations from each of the
          known elements of matter produce some form of energy, probably
          electrons which can be made to flow along electrical
          conductors. The flow from each of the elements having
          characteristics different from the others. Conversely, the
          flow of electrons along a conductor produces a radiation
          having characteristics of the radiation from each respective
          element.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such of the known elements
          as are required to feed growing plants have been transmitted
          to the plants through metallic conductors as the plants were
          entirely isolated from the elements upon which they were fed.
          More precisely, seeds were planted in boxes in a darkened
          basement room. One of the boxes of plants of plants containing
          some of the seeds was used as a control and no apparatus for
          transmitting element radiations thereto provided. The
          remaining boxes of plants had electrodes or plates of
          conducting material mounted or otherwise disposed adjacent
          thereto, and each box of plants was separately attached to a
          conductor extending to a plant outside the building where
          electrodes or plates were attached to a conductor extending to
          a point outside the building where electrodes or plates were
          attached to the conductors and allowed to remain exposed to
          the light. Such of the known elements as required to impart
          normal characteristics to the plants were apparently fed
          thereto by having the radiations of the elements from the
          light conducted to the plants through the wires and associated
          electrodes. The treated plants were relatively healthy but the
          control plants assumed the characteristics of growing
          vegetation which has been deprived of the elements in natural
          light. Particularly was the control plant devoid of
          chlorophyll while the remaining plants were green.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apparatus for laboratory or
          commercial use and for detecting the presence of any of the
          known elements, preferably relies upon the element of touch,
          and therefore the skill of the operator. The instrument
          diagrammatically illustrated in Figure 1 comprises a unit 10
          including a coil 12 disposed to pick up radiation from
          substance 14, wherein the known elements are disposed and that
          are to be detected. The temperature of substance 14 may be
          within the range of from 40° to 90°&nbsp; F, but such
          temperature is not critical. This range has been found
          satisfactory in actual practice.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Coil 12 may be a spirally
          wound flat body approximately 2 inches in diameter and formed
          of magnet insulated wire of any conventional size. As an
          alternative, this coil 12 may be a single layer, cylindrical
          coil, wound on an insulating material substantially 1 inch in
          diameter. The examples given for this coil 12 are not critical
          and so long as the coil is in the field of radiation of
          substance 14, the purpose of unit 10 will be fulfilled.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Instead of employing coil
          12, wire 20 may be directly connected to substance 14 or wire
          20 may be terminated in an electrode and the latter disposed
          with relation to substance 14 as to pick up the radiations
          therefrom, as does coil 12 in the illustrated embodiment. In
          this case, wire 18 may be grounded or connected separately to
          substance 14 or terminated in another electrode which may also
          be placed near substance 14. The proximity of substance 14 to
          coil 12 or the electrodes as the case may be, is such as to be
          within the field of radiation of the emanations from substance
          14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apparatus 16 is a manually
          manipulatable analyzer tuneable to the specific radiation
          desired. It consists of two principal parts, the first being
          the two standard type of variable condensers, 22 and 24, and
          the second being the ray refracting device made up of
          electrode 32 --- passageway 36, prism 28, and electrode 38,
          all as shown in Figure 2. Apparatus 16 is joined to unit 10 by
          conductors 18 and 20 across which is disposed a conventional
          variable condenser 22 and with which is employed a condenser
          of similar type 24, located in conductor 26, as illustrated.
          Variable condensers 22 and 24 may be of standard radio
          broadcast type and they are provided with graduated scales in
          conventional manner.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Prism 28 is of any suitable
          ray defracting substance as glass, quartz or analogous
          materials. In practice a prism 28 having two polished faces
          disposed at angles from 30 to 60 degrees has proved
          satisfactory. An electrode 32 is joined to coil 12 by
          conductor 20 and conductor 34. Stationary electrode 32 may be
          of any electrical conducting material such as aluminum, brass,
          copper or substances having analogous electrical properties.
          The distance of electrode 32 from prism 28 is not critical so
          long as the radiations or emanations reach prism 28 through a
          confined path of travel in the nature of a thin band or line.
          In practice, this distance was from one-half to two inches. A
          passageway 36 formed between a pair of optically opaque
          insulating elements directs the radiations to a desired area
          on one face of prism 28.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The angle of incidence of
          this path of travel to the face of the prism 28 was of the
          order of 5.5 degrees for best results and for obtaining the
          wisest useful segment along scale 31.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An electrode 38 shiftable
          along scale 31 is joined to unit 40 by conductor 42. Electrode
          38 is of the same specifications as to materials and distance
          from prism 28 as electrode 32 but is suitably mounted for
          movement adjacent to scale 31 where its position may readily
          be indicated by a pointer 78 moveable therewith and extending
          outwardly therefrom toward scale 31 in alignment with the path
          of travel of the thin ray of energy indicated by the line 76.
          The axis of rotation of electrode 38 is substantially on a
          median line extending longitudinally across the face of prism
          28 proximal to electrode 38. Electrodes 32 and 38 work best
          when they are relatively thin and of the order of a few mils
          thickness.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As illustrated in Figure 2,
          scale 31 is calibrated with indicia 44, and these indicia are
          on chart 46 along one edge thereof. The indicia on chart 46
          have been given a corresponding reference numeral to those on
          scale 31 for clarifying the description hereinafter set down.
          Indicia 48 on chart 46 designate the atomic weight of elements
          of matter and continue up to include all known elements of the
          electrochemical series when the full size chart is employed.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unit 40 is a variable
          resistor. It may be either a continuous variable type or it
          may consist of a series of non-inductive resistance units 50,
          52, 54 and 56, each adjusted by a switch having movable points
          62, 64, 66 and 68 respectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practice, unit 50 will
          have ten times the resistance of unit 52, which in turn is ten
          times the size of unit 54, etc. (The values may range from
          fractions of 1 ohm up to several megohms). Unit 50, e.g.,
          might be 1 megohm in steps of 100,000 ohms each; unit 52 would
          then be 100,000 in steps of 10,000 ohms each; unit 54 then
          would be 10,000 ohms total in steps of 1,000 ohms each, and so
          on until the smallest unit would have steps low enough to give
          the desired exactness to the measured volume or intensity of
          the radiations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unit 40 is joined to unit 70
          by means of an untuned radio frequency type transformer 58
          through the medium of conductors 42 and 60. Unit 40 may be
          joined to unit 78 by resistance coupling or other conventional
          coupling of the type frequently used in standard broadcast
          radio receivers and which is analogous to transformer 58.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Unit 70 may be a
          conventional three stage tuned radio frequency broadcast band
          type of amplifier with the usual variable resistances omitted
          or it may be of the resistance coupled or impedance coupled
          type often used in radio broadcast type amplifiers. Said
          amplifier intensifies the value of the radiations reaching it
          so that the effect upon detector 72 is clearly discernable.
          Under some conditions, the reactions from unit 40 may be put
          directly into detector 72 without interposing unit 70 but
          amplification of the radiations is desirable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Detector 72 is a device that
          will indicate a change from its normal state when the
          radiations from the analyzer 16 are caused to influence it.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Detector 72 is preferably an
          electrical conductor coated with a material having such
          characteristics that under the influence of energy flowing
          through the conducting portion, the coating will change its
          surface tension or viscosity, or in some manner give evidence
          of the presence of the energy flowing through the conducting
          portion by producing a greater drag or resistance to the
          movement of any part of the body of the operator thereover,
          such as the hand or fingers. It has been found practical to
          use a metal plate covered with a sheet of plastic or coated
          with lacquer, which plate is of an area convenient for
          stroking with the tips of the fingers or the palm of the hand.
          It may also be a sheet or plastic with a coil similar to coil
          12 disposed adjacent thereto and connected to the coupling
          transformer 14.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Figure 4 illustrates another
          form of that part of unit 16, sowing Figure 2, so far as the
          element separator or filter portion thereof is concerned. This
          separation or filtering is accomplished in the embodiment
          illustrated in Figure 1 and Figure 2 by prism 28. In Figure 4
          a lens 100 has the electrode 32 disposed adjacent thereto and
          movable electrode 38 is shiftable toward and from lens 100.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Scale indicia 44 are
          disposed in a line parallel to the path of travel of electrode
          38 and the element or elements involved will be determined by
          the location or the scale of pointer 78 at the instant a
          reaction is obtained at detector 72.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Chart 46 is of course
          produced as a part of the complete apparatus when such
          apparatus is manufactured and after prism 28 (or lens 100, as
          the case may be) is installed as a unit of the material
          detector. A small quantity of each of the known chemical
          elements is placed adjacent to coil 12 and with full knowledge
          of the element, the angle of radiation formed by line 76 and,
          the face of the prism 28, is determined and the degree numeral
          on scale 31, which identifies the angle of radiation, is
          placed on chart 46 as one of the indicia 44 (degree readings
          from scale 31) and indicia 48 (the atomic weight of the known
          elements) then when the apparatus is in practical use, any
          material or substance may be located adjacent to coil 12 and
          its components definitely determined by positioning electrode
          38 on a line of radiation 76 where the degree number on the
          face of the scale 31 is quickly read and used by referring to
          chart 46. When the degree indicia 44 is so located, the line
          on chart 46 extending therefrom is followed until it reaches
          the diagonal line 45 on chart 46 whereupon the operator then
          follows the intersecting line to the lower edge of the chart
          where the value of the atomic weight 48 is read. These atomic
          weights are well known and are used in conventional texts and
          scientific works.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In practice, for example,
          let it be assumed that substance 14 contains calcium but it is
          not known that such is the case. The angle at which the
          unknown ray or radiation leaves prism 28 will teach its name
          form as the operator moves the fingers over the surface of
          detector 72, electrode 38 is shifted slowly and pointer 78
          moves along scale 31 until a greater degree of adhesion or
          resistance to motion at the surface of the detector 72 is set
          up. This occurs when the energy or radiation flows from unit
          16 through units 40 and 70 into detector 72. When electrode 38
          is at a position where it is intercepting a radiation from
          prism 28, or lense 100, the resistance to stroke at detector
          72 will be of highest order.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As soon as electrode 38 has
          been positioned as described, variable condenser 22 is
          adjusted while the operator continues to stroke detector 72 to
          a position where the greatest drag at detector 72 is again
          manifested. Next, variable condenser 24 is similarly
          manipulated to obtain a setting where the drag at detector 72
          again reaches a maximum. Electrode 38 is then readjusted for a
          final position. The employment of condensers 22 and 24 insure
          a more accurate setting of pointer 78 by virtue of their
          additional filtering action.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the illustration,
          electrode 38 has intercepted the path of radiation with
          pointer 78 at the numeral 30 on scale 31 and reference to
          chart 46 will teach the operator that the element having
          atomic weight 79.2 is that from which the radiation along
          dotted line 76 is traveling. If atomic weight 79.2 is calcium
          then that element in substance 14 has been located.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The manner of using lense
          100 is substantially the same as described in connection with
          the use of prism 28. The focal point of paths of radiation of
          the elements will cause detector 72 to react and establish a
          drag to the operator’s touch, whereupon the scale 31 may be
          read and its reading translated by reference to chart 46.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What actually happens at
          detector 72 to increase or decrease it drag to the touch of
          the operator, is not known but the apparatus functions as
          above set forth when constructed as specified, and therefore,
          a positively acting analyzer for atomic radiations is produced
          even though the principle upon which it is based is not fully
          known.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Radiation from hydrogen
          passes through prism 26 at the sharpest angle or at the lowest
          degree measured from the face of prism 28. Radiations from
          other elements and their isotopes pass through prism 28 at
          greater angles but in the same order as their atomic weights
          --- the heavier the element or its isotope, the wider the
          angle.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A substance composed of two
          or more of the known elements may be analyzed as herein set

          identified because the emanations therefrom will produce a
          composite frequency peculiar to that combination of elements.
          All combinations may be charted in precisely the same manner

          into the circuit without interrupting the reactions manifested
          at detector 72. The switches are calibrated in conventional
          resistance values and a chart must be prepared that will

              Chlorophyll Energy over Wires"</font></b> <br>
          <b>by Dr. T. Galen Hieronymous</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>About 1930, I decided to try an experiment of conducting
        Chlorophyll Energy over wires. I had been conducting Eloptic
        Energy over long distance via wire. </p>
      <p>A wood platform was installed on the south side of the house
        about six feet above the ground in order to get the desired
        potential of energy which increases with distance above the
        ground. </p>
      <p>Having some wooden cigar boxes available, I cut boxes apart and
        cut pieces and made eight boxes that were 2" X 2" X 4" although
        any size boxes will work. </p>
      <p>Aluminum foil was placed on the bottom of seven boxes inside so
        as to be in contact with the soil. </p>
      <p>Similar pieces of foil were placed on the underside of the lid
        of each box. </p>
      <p>Wires were connected to each piece of foil, the wires from the
        lids were extended to the sun plates, the wires from the bottom
        foils were connected to the water pipe and thus grounded. </p>
      <p><b>See Figure #2 (on the right) for details of the box
          construction.</b> </p>

        <p><img src="hier2.gif" height="403" width="361"></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Refer to Figure #1 which shows a 'side' view of the
          installation.</b> </p>

        <p><img src="hier1.gif" height="754" width="347"></p>

        <p><img src="hier3.gif" height="413" width="385"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Seven plates were placed on the platform so as to pick up
        energy from the sun and a wire was connected to each plate and
        extended down into the basement, each box having the top foil
        plate connected via wire to a plate out on the platform in the
        sunlight. The eighth box had no connection to the outside, it
        being the 'control'. </p>
      <p>The plates on the platform were all different in size. The
        smallest was 2" X 4", the next 4" X 8", the largest was about 8"
        X 10" and one plate was copper screen wire. </p>
      <p>Some dirt was screened and 1/2 inch of dirt placed in each box.
        Oat seeds were selected, all of uniform size and planted in two
        rows of 5 seeds spaced in each row, the 1/2" of dirt was placed
        on top in the box. The same amount of water was added to each
        box as needed from day to day. </p>
      <p>All of the seeds sprouted about the same time. Then we noticed
        that there was no chlorophyll in the 10 plants in the control
        box. All of the boxes connected to outside plates had plants
        with much chlorophyll. </p>
      <p>We were quite surprised to note that the plants in boxes with
        large outside plates seemed to look as if they had been
        subjected to heat. Apparently the large outside plates were
        bringing in an excess of energy compared with the effect of the
        small size outside plates. </p>
      <p>Very soon, the plants grew too tall for the small amount of
        'head room' in the boxes so each box was equipped with a spacer
        to raise the top of each lid up about 3/4". </p>
      <p>The boxes were placed on a shelf in the end of the basement
        where there was little light, with no windows at that end. Also,
        the shelf was kept dark by a board placed in front and another
        on top to exclude all light. The plants were dark all of the
        time except when they were examined by a flashlight. </p>
      <p>A friend tried to duplicate the experiment, but did not follow
        all instructions. Their basement was only about 3 feet from the
        basement floor to the ground level outside. </p>
      <p>Instead of placing the outside plates above ground 6 feet, they
        laid on the ground, thus they did not have the potential
        differences between outside collector and inside boxes and the
        experiment was a failure. Also, there was a window near that let
        much light into where the boxes were placed. </p>
      <p>Anyone who expects to duplicate an experiment should be sure
        they know all the factors and that they follow the instructions
        exactly without any substitution or change. And as to changes,
        if you are trying to get a special result and are trying out
        several methods or ideas, one of the cardinal points to doing
        good work is to make just one change at a time. </p>
      <p>Then you know just what the results are. If you make two
        changes and the result is a failure, you do not know but that
        one of the changes and the results is a failure, you do not know
        but that one of the changes may have been alright.</p>
