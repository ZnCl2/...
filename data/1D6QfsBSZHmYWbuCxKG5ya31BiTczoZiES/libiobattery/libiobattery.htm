      <br>
      A novel device that uses only sunlight and wastewater to produce
      hydrogen gas could provide a sustainable energy source while
      improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment.<br>
      <br>
      A research team led by Yat Li, associate professor of chemistry at
      the University of California, Santa Cruz, developed the
      solar-microbial device and reported their results in a paper
      published in the American Chemical Society journal ACS Nano. The
      hybrid device combines a microbial fuel cell (MFC) and a type of
      solar cell called a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC). In the MFC
      component, bacteria degrade organic matter in the wastewater,
      generating electricity in the process. The biologically generated
      electricity is delivered to the PEC component to assist the
      solar-powered splitting of water (electrolysis) that generates
      hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      Either a PEC or MFC device can be used alone to produce hydrogen
      gas. Both, however, require a small additional voltage (an
      "external bias") to overcome the thermodynamic energy barrier for
      proton reduction into hydrogen gas. The need to incorporate an
      additional electric power element adds significantly to the cost
      and complication of these types of energy conversion devices,
      especially at large scales. In comparison, Li's hybrid
      solar-microbial device is self-driven and self-sustained, because
      the combined energy from the organic matter (harvested by the MFC)
      and sunlight (captured by the PEC) is sufficient to drive
      electrolysis of water.<br>
      <br>
      In effect, the MFC component can be regarded as a self-sustained
      "bio-battery" that provides extra voltage and energy to the PEC
      for hydrogen gas generation. "The only energy sources are
      wastewater and sunlight," Li said. "The successful demonstration
      of such a self-biased, sustainable microbial device for hydrogen
      generation could provide a new solution that can simultaneously
      address the need for wastewater treatment and the increasing
      demand for clean energy."<br>
      <br>
      Microbial fuel cells rely on unusual bacteria, known as
      electrogenic bacteria, that are able to generate electricity by
      transferring metabolically-generated electrons across their cell
      membranes to an external electrode. Li's group collaborated with
      researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) who
      have been studying electrogenic bacteria and working to enhance
      MFC performance. Initial "proof-of-concept" tests of the
      solar-microbial (PEC-MFC) device used a well-studied strain of
      electrogenic bacteria grown in the lab on artificial growth
      medium. Subsequent tests used untreated municipal wastewater from
      the Livermore Water Reclamation Plant. The wastewater contained
      both rich organic nutrients and a diverse mix of microbes that
      feed on those nutrients, including naturally occurring strains of
      electrogenic bacteria.<br>
      <br>
      When fed with wastewater and illuminated in a solar simulator, the
      PEC-MFC device showed continuous production of hydrogen gas at an
      average rate of 0.05 cubic meters per day, according to LLNL
      researcher and coauthor Fang Qian. At the same time, the turbid
      black wastewater became clearer. The soluble chemical oxygen
      demand--a measure of the amount of organic compounds in water,
      widely used as a water quality test--declined by 67 percent over
      48 hours.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers also noted that hydrogen generation declined over
      time as the bacteria used up the organic matter in the wastewater.
      Replenishment of the wastewater in each feeding cycle led to
      complete restoration of electric current generation and hydrogen
      gas production.<br>
      <br>
      Qian said the researchers are optimistic about the commercial
      potential for their invention. Currently they are planning to
      scale up the small laboratory device to make a larger 40-liter
      prototype continuously fed with municipal wastewater. If results
      from the 40-liter prototype are promising, they will test the
      device on site at the wastewater treatment plant.<br>
      <br>
      "The MFC will be integrated with the existing pipelines of the
      plant for continuous wastewater feeding, and the PEC will be set
      up outdoors to receive natural solar illumination," Qian said.<br>
      <br>
      "Fortunately, the Golden State is blessed with abundant sunlight
      that can be used for the field test," Li added.<br>

      Cruz, are co-first authors of the ACS Nano paper. The other
      coauthors include UCSC graduate student Gongming Wang; LLNL

      <b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Here we demonstrate the feasibility of continuous, self-sustained
      hydrogen gas production based solely on solar light and biomass
      (wastewater) recycling, by coupling solar water splitting and
      microbial electrohydrogenesis in a photoelectrochemical
      cell–microbial fuel cell (PEC-MFC) hybrid device. The PEC device
      is composed of a TiO2 nanowire-arrayed photoanode and a Pt
      cathode. The MFC is an air cathode dual-chamber device, inoculated
      with either Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (batch-fed on artificial
      growth medium) or natural microbial communities (batch-fed on
      local municipal wastewater). Under light illumination, the TiO2
      photoanode provided a photovoltage of 0.7 V that shifted the
      potential of the MFC bioanode to overcome the potential barrier
      for microbial electrohydrogenesis. As a result, under light
      illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW/cm2) without external bias, and
      using wastewater as the energy source, we observed pronounced
      current generation as well as continuous production of hydrogen
      gas. The successful demonstration of such a self-biased,
      sustainable microbial device for hydrogen generation could provide
      a new solution that can simultaneously address the need of
      wastewater treatment and the increasing demand for clean energy.<br>

      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      In recent years there is an increasing interest to find
      sustainable alternative energy (SAE) sources due to the
      heightening cost of fossil fuels and the detrimental effects of
      global climate change. Photovoltaic (PV) cells have received
      significant attention due to the limitless influx of photons from
      the sun. Recent market energy analysis is predicting energy parity
      between conventional energy production and PV costs in cents per
      kilowatt hour (cents/kWh) in only 5-8 years (LoPiccolo, P. Solid
      State Technology 2007, 50, 2). Efficiency of silicon solar cells
      have attained a solar conversion efficiency of 20%, however the
      manufacturing process is very expensive and involves the use of
      toxic chemicals inherit in the semiconductor industry.<br>
      <br>
      To date, there have been reports of two types of solar cells based
      on nanostructured semiconductor materials: the Gratzel solar cell,
      based on dye sensitized nanoporous semiconductor thin films and
      the quantum dot solar cell, based on composite films of
      semiconductor nanoparticles (CdSe) and conjugated polymers studied
      by Greenham et al. (see, for example, O'Regan, B.; Gratzel, M.
      Nature 1991, 353, 737; Greenham, N. C; Peng, X. G.; Alivisatos, A.
      P. Phys. Rev. B 1996, 54, 17628). Gratzel's initial report in 1991
      presented a nanocrystalline dye-sensitized solar cell converting
      light to electrical energy with an efficiency of 7% (O'Regan et
      al. supra). The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) consists of TiO2
      nanoparticles acting as a highly porous wide-bandgap semiconductor
      electron acceptor layer. In the DSSC visible light absorbing dye
      molecules adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface act as the sensitizer to
      harvest more of the solar flux. Under irradiation, the
      photoexcited dye molecules inject electrons to the TiO2 layer that
      are 5 transported through the porous TiO2 layer and collected by a
      conductive fluorine doped SnO2 layer on the glass surface. The
      oxidized dye is regenerated by a liquid electrolyte, with the
      highest reported efficiency of about 10%. Greenham et al. (supra)
      investigated the processes of charge separation and transport in
      the interface between a conjugated polymer and semiconductor
      nanocrystal as a hybrid organic-inorganic system. A quantum
      efficiency of up 12% has been reported with a high concentration
      of nanocrystals, where both nanocrystals and polymers provide
      continous pathways to the electrodes (Greenham et al. supra). The
      absorption, charge separation and transport properties of the
      composities were found to be a function of the size, material and
      the surface ligands of the nanocrystals utilized.<br>
      <br>
      TiO2 and ZnO nanoparticles represent good examples of
      nanocrystalline materials used for potentially low cost PV devices
      for energy conversion, as an alternative to silicon solar cell
      technology and for photocatalysis (Belver, C; Bellod, R.; Fuerte,
      A.; Fernandez- Garcia, M. Applied Catalysis B -Environmental 2006,
      65, 301 ; Gregg, B. A. J. Phys. Chem. B 2003, 107, 4688; Hagfeldt,

      2005, 105, 267; Smestad, G. P.; Spiekerniann, S.; Kowalik, J.;

      <br>
      R.; Nozik, A. J. J. Phys. Chem. 1990 94, 3381). Titanium dioxide
      (TiO2), or titania, exists in three crystalline phases: anatase,
      rutile and brookite. Anatase and rutile have found uses mainly in
      PV cells, photoelectrochemical cells (PEC), and photocatalysis
      applications (Colon, G.; Maicu, M.; Hidalgo, M. C; Navio, J. A.
      Applied Catalysis B-Environmental 2006, 67, 41; Kim, Y. G.;
      Walker, J.; Samuelson, L. A.; Kumar, J. Nano Letters 2003, 3, 523;
      Toyoda, T.; Tsuboya, L; Shen, Q. Materials Science &amp;
      Engineering C-Biomimetic Supramolecular Systems 2005, 25, 853; and
      Wang, J. W.; Zhu, W.; Zhang, Y. Q.; Liu, S. X. J. Phys. Chem. C
      2007, 111, 1010). On the contrary, the brookite phase has not
      received similar attention, perhaps because it is the most
      difficult to prepare in the form of a thin film (Djaoued, Y.;
      Bruning, R.; Bersani, D.; Lottici, P. P.; Badilescu, S. 5 Mater.
      Letters 2004, 58, 2618). Titania has a wide band gap (3.2 eV) and
      absorbs only 5% of the solar spectrum, resulting in poor
      conversion efficiency in solar cell applications. Non metal-doped
      TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes have been shown to produce
      electronic states in the TiO2 bandgap, thereby extending
      photoresponse to the visible region and improving photoactivity
      (Huang, D. G.; Liao, S. J.; Liu, J. M.; Dang, Z.; Petrik, L. J.<br>
      <br>
      Photochem. Photobio. A-Chem. 2006, 184, 282; Huang, L. H.; Sun, Z.
      X.; Liu, Y. L. J. Ceramic Soc. Jap. 2007, 115, 28; Nishijima, K.;
      Naitoh, H.; Tsubota, T.; Ohno, T. J. Ceramic Soc. Jap. 2007, 115,
      310). Recent studies of TiO2 :N and ZnO:N have found success in
      narrowing the bandgap and increasing light harvesting efficiency
      with nitrogen doping, and research has been focusing on the
      resulting photoelectro-chemical properties and photocatalytic
      activity for SAE production. Several different synthesis protocols
      have been developed to produce TiO2 :N. The usual doping process
      involves using ammonia as a nitrogen source by sol-gel, thermal,
      or hydrothermal chemical methods (Moribe, S.; Ikoma, T.; Akiyama,
      K.; Zhang, Q. W.; Saito, F.; Tero-Kubota, S. Chem. Phys. Lett.
      2007, 436, 373; Sathish, M.; Viswanathan, B.; Viswanath, R. P.;
      Gopinath, C. S. Chem. Mater. 2005, 17, 6349; Beranek, R.; Kisch,
      H. Electrochem. Commun. 2007, 9, 761 ; Chen, H. Y.; Nambu, A.;
      Wen, W.; Graciani, J.; Zhong, Z.; Hanson, J. C; Fujita, E.;
      Rodriguez, J. A. J. Phys. Chem. C 2007, 111, 1366; and Yin, S.;
      Ihara, K.; Aita, Y.; Komatsu, M.; Sato, T. J. Photochem. Photobio.
      A-Chem. 2006, 179, 105).<br>
      An alternative method to obtain TiO2 :N involves using
      hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) by chemical and mechanochemical
      processes. The resulting effect on crystalline phase composition
      showed increased photocatalytic activity and photovoltaic
      properties, with specific morphologies produced (Wu, J. M.; Qi, B.
      J. Phys. Chem. C 2007, 111, 666; Yin, S.; Komatsu, M.; Zhang, Q.
      W.; Saito, F.; Sato, T. J. Mater. Science 2007, 42, 2399).
      Nitrogen doping within TiO2 can be interstitial or substitutional,
      with the latter being more effective, resulting in mixing of N 2p
      states with O 2p states, and contributing to the bandgap
      narrowing. Different techniques have been used to study N doped
      TiO2 crystallographically, including XPS, EPR, Raman spectroscopy
      and XRD and absorption spectroscopy (see Chen and Burda J. Phys.
      Chem. B 2004, 108, 15446; Reyes-Garcia et al. J Phys. Chem. C
      2007, 111, 2738; and Wan et al. Appl. Surf. Sd. 2007, 253, 4764).
      5 Theoretical studies have supported the visible absorption and
      the resulting yellowish color of TiO2:N thin films and powders
      (see, for example, Asahi, R.; Morikawa, T.; Ohwaki, T.; Aoki, K.;
      Taga, Y. Science 2001, 293, 269; Di Valentin, C; Pacchioni, G.;
      Selloni, A.; Livraghi, S.; Giamello, E. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005,
      109, 11414; Chen and Burda, supra; Reyes-Garcia et al. supra; Wan
      et al. supra; Livraghi, S.; Paganini, M. C; Giamello, E.;<br>
      10 Selloni, A.; Di Valentin, C; Pacchioni, G. J. Am. Chem. Soc.
      2006, 128, 15666; and Burda, C; Lou, Y. B.; Chen, X. B.; Samia, A.
      C. S.; Stout, J.; GoIe, J. L. Nano Letters 2003, 3, 1049).<br>
      <br>
      Alternative techniques to increase the photoresponse besides
      doping include the utilization of tunable narrow bandgap
      semiconductor nanoparticles or quantum dots (QDs) such as CdS,
      CdSe, and CdTe to sensitize wide bandgap semiconductors such as
      the metal oxides, e.g. TiO2 and ZnO (Leschkies, K. S.; Divakar,
      R.; Basu, J.; Enache-Pommer, E.; Boercker, J. E.; Carter, C. B.;
      Kortshagen, U. R.; Norris, D. J.; Aydil, E. S. Nano Letters 2007,
      7, 1793; Levy-Clement, C; Tena-Zaera, R.; Ryan, M. A.; Katty, A.;
      Hodes, G. Adv. Mater. 2005, 17, 1512; Robel, L; Kuno, M.; Kamat,
      P. V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007, 129, 4136; and Somasundaram, S.;
      Chenthamarakshan, C. R.; de Tacconi, N. R.; Ming, Y.; Rajeshwar,
      K. Chem. Mater. 2004, 16, 3846). QDs with their large extinction
      coefficient strongly absorb visible light and inject electrons
      into the conduction band of metal oxides, and thereby contribute
      to increased solar energy conversion. Attachment of CdSe QDs to
      nanocrystalline TiO2 has been shown to be successful with an
      immersion method using a bimolecular linker (Robel, I.;
      Subramanian, V.; Kuno, M.; Kamat, P. V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006,
      128, 2385). Sonochemical, photodeposition, and chemical bath
      deposition of CdSe on TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes has also
      been studied for photocatalysis applications (Liu, H. Y.; Gao, L.

      However, the use of QDs to improve TiO2 based solar cell
      efficiency is still an area of active exploration.<br>

      Hydrogen is very attractive as a clean fuel due to its high energy
      density and benign chemical byproduct, water (Bak, T.; Nowotny,
      J.; Rekas, M.; Sorrell, C. C. Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 2002, 27,
      (10), 991-1022; Yilanci, A.; Dincer, L; Ozturk, H. K. Prog. Energ.
      Combust. 2009, 35, (3), 231-244). Producing hydrogen from water
      splitting using solar energy based on photoelectrochemical (PEC)
      cells, photovoltaic cells and photocatalysis is highly desirable
      because it leaves less of a carbon footprint and the resources
      used, water and sunlight, are abundant (Bak et al. supra; Yilanci
      et al. supra; Li, Y.; Zhang, J. Z. Laser Photonics Rev. 2009, in
      press; Fujishima, A.; Honda, K. Nature 1972, 238, (5358), 37-38;

      Mater. 2008, 20, 35-54). A conventional PEC cell is established
      with a semiconductor photoanode and a platinum electrode as the
      cathode in an electrolyte solution. Electrons and holes are
      created when a semiconductor anode absorbs light. The depletion
      layer formed at the semiconductor-electrolyte interface leads to
      energy band bending that facilitates separation of photo generated
      electrons and holes. The electrons and holes perform chemical
      redox reactions at the semiconductor photoanode and the platinum
      cathode (Bak et al. supra; Fujishima and Honda supra). Typically,
      the reaction is the splitting of water, 2H2O -&gt; 2H2 + O2, but
      hydrogen can also be generated by the use of sacrificial
      electrolytes, such as Na2S and Na2SO3 (Rao, N. N.; Dube, S. Int.
      J. Hydrogen Energy 1996, 21, (2), 95-98).<br>
      <br>
      Wide bandgap semiconductors such as TiO2, ZnO and WO3 have been
      demonstrated as promising candidates for photoanodes due to their
      energy band position, thermal and chemical stability in solution
      (Bak et al. supra; Fujishima and Honda supra; and Yang, X.;
      Wolcottt, A.; Wang, G.; Sobo, A.; Fitzmorris, R. C; Qian, F.;
      Zhang, J. Z.; Li, Y. Nano Lett. 2009, 9, (6), 2331-2336). However,
      they are not ideal due to their weak absorption of visible light
      (Murphy et al. supra). Doping of such wide bandgap metal oxides is
      one of the most promising approaches to increasing their visible
      light absorption. Asahi et al. first reported N-doped TiO2 films
      prepared by sputtering that showed noticeable visible light
      absorption at wavelengths less than 500 ran due to the bandgap
      narrowing by mixing of N 2p states with O 2p states (Asahi, R.;
      Morikawa, T.; Ohwaki, T.; Aoki, K.; Taga, Y. Science 2001, 293,
      (5528), 269-271). On the other hand, sensitizing metal oxides with
      small bandgap semiconductors is another attractive method for
      increasing their visible light absorption, which has recently been
      demonstrated for ZnO and TiO2 (Tak, Y.; Hong, S. J.; Lee, J. S.;
      Yong, K. Cryst. Growth Des. 2009, 9, (6), 2627- 2632; Lee, Y. L.;
      Chi, C. F.; Liau, S. Y. Chem. Mater. 2009, in press). When the
      conduction band edge of a small bandgap semiconductor is higher
      than that of the metal oxide, the photogenerated electrons in the
      small bandgap semiconductor can be injected to the conduction band
      of the metal oxide. To date, both sensitization and doping of
      metal oxide nanostructures have been explored separately for solar
      energy conversion applications, yet little work has been done on
      combining the two approaches.<br>
      <br>
      There is therefore a need in the art for compositions and methods
      for synthesis of hydrogen that is both relatively inexpensive and
      uses relatively simple compositions and components.<br>

      </b><b>Detailed Description of the Invention </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In this disclosure, we demonstrate a relatively simple approach to
      dope TiO2 nanoparticles with nitrogen and also efficiently
      sensitize the doped nanoparticles with CdSe quantum dots (QDs).
      The nanoparticle films have been characterized in terms of their
      structural, optical and morphological properties using a
      combination of experimental techniques. The results showed
      substantially enhanced photoresponse and high-energy conversion
      efficiency of the TiO2 nanoparticle films when nitrogen doping and
      QD sensitization are used in unison. Possible explanations are
      provided in terms of the morphological and optical properties of
      the films. This method based on combined doping and QD
      sensitization is promising for solid-state PV cells and
      photoelectrochemical applications.<br>
      <br>
      We also disclose the synthesis and photoelectrochemical (PEC)
      studies of TiO2 nanoparticles and nanowires simultaneously doped
      with nitrogen and sensitized with CdSe quantum dots (QDs). These
      novel nanocomposite structures have been applied successfully as
      photoanodes for PEC hydrogen generation using Na2S and Na2SO3 as
      sacrificial reagents. We observed significant enhanced
      photoresponse in these nanocomposites compared to N-doped TiO2 or
      CdSe QD sensitized TiO2. The enhancement is attributed to the
      synergistic effect of CdSe sensitization [alpha]nc? N-doping that
      facilitate hole transfer/transport from CdSe to TiO2 through
      oxygen vacancy states (V0) mediated by N- doping. The results
      demonstrate the importance of designing and manipulating the
      energy band alignment in composite nanomaterials for fundamentally
      improving charge separation and transport and thereby PEC
      properties.<br>
      <br>
      The simultaneous application of nitrogen incorporation into
      nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films along with CdSe quantum dot (QD/
      nanoparticle) has shown to enhance photovoltaic performance and
      can be utilized also for photoelectrochemical (PEC) water
      splitting. While nitrogen doping of TiO2 has been performed, and
      shown to increase visible light harvesting, it has never been used
      in conjunction with CdSe QD sensitization. The two-fold advantage
      of this system is that (1) nitrogen doping extends the absorption
      of TiO2 to 600 nm into the visible range (without doping it is 380
      nm) and (2) the CdSe QDs can be exploited to further collect light
      depending on the size of the nanocrystals into the TiO2 :N
      nanocrystalline thin film. A general illustration is given in
      Figure 19.<br>
      <br>
      When considering the band structure of the nanocrystalline TiO2 :N
      in unison with the CdSe QDs, is where the unique aspects of this
      system arise. While it is well known that various dyes and QDs can
      inject electrons into the conduction band of nanocrystalline TiO2
      (Graetzel et al. supra), what is new in our system is the added
      benefit of the mid bandgap position of the nitrogen energy level
      (see Figure 12). One embodiment encompasses the energy bands
      associated with a 3.5 nm CdSe QD with a bandgap of 2.17 eV. Once
      photoexcited by a photon of greater energy than the bandgap, an
      electron-hole pair or exciton is generated. The electron now being
      in the conduction band of CdSe is then injected into the
      conduction band of TiO2:N (D) and the positive hole localized to
      the valence band. Photoexcited electrons in the conduction band of
      TiO2. N then diffuse through the network of interconnected
      nanoparticles to generate a photocurrent. Other processes of
      photoexcitation and relaxation include arrows (A, B and C), which
      include excitation from the valence to conduction band of TiO2:N
      (A), excitation from the nitrogen dopant energy level (B), and
      nonradiative recombination from the conduction band to nitrogen
      dopant level (C). Ultimately the most unique aspect of the doped
      and sensitized system is the ability for dopant level electrons
      from nitrogen to combine with valence band photogenerated holes.
      In most photovoltaic applications, hole mobility becomes the
      limiting factor for power conversion efficiency. The probability
      of this pathway increases due to the localization of nitrogen
      doping on the surface of TiO2 :N and the conjugation of CdSe QDs
      through the TGA molecule.<br>
      <br>
      Overall the performance of nitrogen doping of TiO2 with
      sensitization of CdSe showed increased performance over simple
      CdSe sensitization of undoped TiO2. Several types of TiO2 thin
      films were produced with CdSe sensitization and during colloidal
      synthesis of the TiO2, nitric acid was either not used or was used
      to acidify the solution to a pH= 1.23. TiO2 thin films without and
      with nitric acid addition achieved power conversion efficiencies
      of 0.120 % and 0.729 %, respectively, when utilized with CdSe QD
      sensitization. Comparatively, when hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)
      was used as the nitrogen dopant source in conjunction with nitric
      acid addition and CdSe QD sensitization we were able to achieve a
      power conversion efficiency of 0.840 %, an increase of over 15 %
      what was seen without nitrogen doping. We believe this is due in
      large part to the electron recombination discussed above along
      with increased light absorption of the TiO2 :N in the visible
      region. While success has been definitively seen with the
      combination of both nitrogen doping and QD sensitization, we
      believe it can also be successfully applied to PEC cells as well
      for water splitting.<br>
      <br>
      TiO2 and TiO2 :N have both been shown to be able to split water
      and oxidize species on their surface photoelectrochemically. Our
      goal is to also extend this regime of work to include the two
      prong doping/sensitization protocol to produce hydrogen through
      photolysis. With increased photocurrents in the dual TiO2:N-CdSe
      system we feel the water splitting to be a natural progression
      from the characterization already performed in aqueous Na2S
      solutions for photovoltaic applications.<br>

      TiO2 Films for Solar Energy Conversion Applications<br>
      <br>
      N-doping of TiO? nanoparticles with hexamethylenetetramine<br>
      <br>
      It is known (Yin, S.; Komatsu, M.; Zhang, Q. W.; Saito, F.; Sato,
      T. J Mater, Science 2007, 42, 2399) that
      hexamethylenetetramineJ[Eta]MT) hydrolyzes in aqueous solutions to
      form ammonia and formaldehyde above 70 &lt;0&gt;C, as shown in the
      following equation:<br>

      C6H12N4 + 6H2o -^-&lt;r&gt;^[iota]-&gt; [beta]HC[theta] + 4NH3. 0)<br>
      <br>
      Ammonia reacts with Ti(OCH(CH3 )2)4 (TTIP) to form a nitrogen
      containing precursor (TiO2-x[Nu]y*nH2O). Dehydration of the TiO2
      complex in pure and doped TiO2 samples is completed at
      temperatures below 200 &lt;0&gt;C and NH3 molecules remain until
      the calcination temperature rises to 300 &lt;0&gt;C. Therefore,
      crystallization of TiO2-xNy can be summarized as<br>
      <br>
      TiO2 (TTIP) &lt;H&gt;*[deg.]'&lt;NHi &gt;etc&gt; &gt; TiO2^xN y x
      nH2O &lt;300[deg.] c&gt; &gt; TiO2_xN y .<br>
      <br>
      A yellowish tint was observed in all films synthesized with HMT or
      HMT plus PEG, suggesting the presence of a TiO2 :N sol-gel
      solution (Livraghi et al. supra). The XPS spectra for all the
      films showed two evident peaks corresponding to Ti 2p, O 1 s at
      458.5 and 531.5 eV binding energies accompanying with traces of Sn
      from conductive SnO2:F film over which the TiO2 films were formed.
      Also traces of carbon at 284 eV were also present due to the
      intentional hydrocarbon contamination used for calibration. Carbon
      (C Is) atoms percentage increases from 29% for TiO2-I to 37% and
      40% for TiO2-S and TiO2-4 respectively. The TiO2-4 prepared with
      both HMT and PEG contains the highest carbon content, which may be
      attributed to uncombusted material from the precursor solutions,
      including HMT and PEG. The sample prepared with PEG, TiO 2-4,
      contains the highest carbon content. Sample T1O2-2 prepared with
      nitric acid and without HMT in vacuum present extremely weak
      nitrogen signals at 401.2. However Ti[theta]2-S and Ti[theta]2-4
      films exhibit N Is at -400 eV and 401.2 eV, which are indicative
      of nitrogen incorporation. We attribute N Is at 400 eV to N atoms
      from N-N, N-H, O-N or N- containing organic compounds absorbed on
      the surface. It has been reported that N Is features appearing
      above 400 eV is due to Ti-O-N linkage suggesting that doping
      within the crystal lattice is in fact interstitial in nature
      (Moribe et al. supra).<br>
      <br>
      Based on the XRD patterns of different TiO2 films (Figure 3),
      nitric acid, HMT and PEG seem to have a significant effect on the
      TiO2 crystalline structure. The phase composition appears to be
      strongly related to the added quantity of nitric acid, and
      therefore to pH. The film prepared without nitric acid shows pure
      anatase structure (Figure 3a). A reduction of the pH to 1.23
      resulted in the appearance of rutile and brookite phases mixed
      with anatase (Figure 3b). However, for the samples prepared with
      HMT at pH~1.65, the antase phase decreases (Figure 3c). These
      results suggest that nitric acid and HMT promote the formation of
      brookite and rutile phases. The reason for this is not yet clear
      and needs further study. When added, PEG increases the pH to ~
      2.06, and the corresponding film shows a presence of the brookite
      and rutile phases (Figure 3d). Further research is also needed to
      understand the possible correlation between the different crystal
      phases and their photovoltaic performance. The phases determined
      by XRD are supported by Raman scattering spectroscopy measurements
      of the films (Figure 4). The TiOj-1 thin film shows Raman peaks at
      144, 399, 515 and 636 cm&lt;"1&gt; (Figure 4a), which indicate a
      pure anatase crystal phase based on a previous report (Djaoued et
      al.). Ti[theta]2-3 thin film shows vibrational modes at about 244,
      281, 409, 501, 589, and 633 cm&lt;"1&gt;, indicative of the
      brookite phase, and peaks at 230, 445, and 604 cm&lt;"1&gt;,
      indicative of a rutile phase. The 7702-2 films contains a mixture
      of peaks ' that can be attributed to anatase, brookite, and rutile
      phases, as a result of nitric acid incorporation. The lowest
      frequency mode shifts slightly for these films to 146 cm&lt;"1&gt;
      as compared to 144 cm&lt;'1&gt; for the pure anatase (T1O2-I).
      This might be caused by changes in crystallographic composition
      due to nitrogen doping attributed to the vibrations of Ti-N-O
      introduced by nitric acid and HMT. Raman spectrum of the TiO 2-4
      thin film shows that PEG suppresses the formation of the rutile
      and brookite phases, also consistent with XRD data. The intensity
      of the 146 cm&lt;"1&gt; peak for the TiO 2- 3 film is higher and
      sharper than undoped TiO2, indicating good crystallinity and size
      uniformity of the TiO2 :N film.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Morphologic properties</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Composition of the thin films was observed to be a mix of
      individual particles interconnected with high porosity. However,
      Ti[theta]2-3 and Ti[theta]2-4 films were far more porous than
      TiO2-I and TiO2-2 films. This suggests that HMT and PEG promote
      porosity as was previously demonstrated in the case of PEG
      interacting with TiO2 systems (Liu, X. X.; Jin, Z. G.; Bu, S. J.;
      Yin, T. J. Sol-Gel ScL Techn. 2005, 36, 103). The morphology was
      noticeably more evident by AFM due to an atomically flatter
      surface produced with thin films on the order of 150 nm in
      thickness. The surface properties of the TiO2:N films are expected
      to be important in determining how well the CdSe QDs can link to
      and interact with the TiO2 nanoparticles. AFM images of all TiO2
      films functionalized with CdSe QDs clearly show the presence of
      QDs as evidenced by the apparent flattening of the films in the
      AFM images (for example, Figure 5 for the TiO2- 3 -TGA-CdSe film).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Optical properties</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Comparison of the absorption spectra of all samples under study
      show that films without HMT and PEG (TiO2-J and TiO2-I) have
      absorption around 340 and 400 nm respectively. However, TiO2-3 and
      TiO2-4 films with HMT or HMT plus PEG have a red shift of the
      absorption edge toward the visible region at 600 nm for samples
      annealed at 550 &lt;0&gt;C due to the electronic transition of N
      2p[pi] to Ti dxy (Figure 7c and 7d). The red-shift absorption can
      be attributed to the doping of nitrogen into the crystal lattice
      of TiO2 due to the addition of HMT in the sol gel solutions.
      TiO2-3 and TiO 2-4 films and calcined powders are also yellowish
      in color, attributed to the presence of nitrogen that results in
      the effective narrowing of the bandgap. All the films sensitized
      with CdSe QDs exhibit strong absorption at 560 nm, which is the
      characteristic excitonic absorption band of CdSe QDs (Figure 7e).
      As shown in Figure 8, CdSe QDs in solution exhibit strong and
      narrow bandedge emission at 580 nm while the PL spectrum of the
      TiO &gt;2-3 '-TGA-CdSe film shows a weak and blue-shifted PL band
      peaked at 575.5 nm. These results suggest interactions between
      TiO2 nanoparticles and CdSe QDs and likely electron injection from
      CdSe to TiO2. The small blue-shift of the PL peak could be due to
      slight oxidation of the film exposed to the atmosphere and thus a
      decrease in CdSe QD size during the sensitization process. The
      electron transfer process indicated by PL quenching is supported
      by photoelectrochemical measurements to be discussed later. TiO2-I
      and TiO 2-2 films also have emissions in 580 nm due to CdSe QDs.
      However, there is no blue-shift of the PL spectrum. This is
      possibly because the TiO2-I-CdSe and TiO2-2-CdSe have lower
      porosity than TiO2S and TiO2-4 and the CdSe QDs are not inside the
      pores of the TiO2 film and thereby have weak interactions with
      TiO2 nanoparticles. This is illustrated schematically in Figure
      Id. The average QD size is estimated to be 3.5 nm based on the
      absorption spectrum.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic characterization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As summarized in Table 1, thin and thick films sensitized with
      CdSe QDs show enhanced photocurrents and power conversion
      efficiency under white light, in comparison to films without
      sensitization of CdSe QDs. The greatest enhancement was observed
      for TiO2 films doped with nitrogen and simultaneously sensitized
      with CdSe QDs. What is interesting is that the QD-sensitized TiO2
      :N shows much larger enhancement than the simple sum of just
      N-doping and only QD sensitization, especially in terms of
      photocurrents (Figure 9). One possible explanation is that
      N-doping alters the surface property of the TiO2 film so that the
      interaction between TiO2 and CdSe QDs becomes stronger and allows
      for more efficient electron injection. XPS data also revealed a
      localization of nitrogen upon the surface (Figure 2b), and binding
      between exposed Cd&lt;2+&gt; and surface nitrogen atoms on TiO2
      could also increase interaction The porosity of the TiO2 film
      could also be affected by N-doping that in turn influences how the
      CdSe QDs enter the pores and adsorb on to the TiO2:N
      nanocrystalline surface. The mixed brokite and rutile phases could
      also have some effect on the CdSe-TiO2 interaction. Table 1.

      <br>
      For the thick TiO2-I and TiO2-2 films, it was also observed that a
      layer of CdSe QD film formed on the TiO2 film surface. This seems
      to indicate that CdSe QDs did not all disperse into the pores of
      the TiO2 films efficiently, and were instead localized upon the
      TiO2 surface. Therefore, CdSe QDs inject electrons mainly in the
      TiO2 film surface, with CdSe QDs in contact with a thin layer of
      TiO2 nanoparticles, which could possibly explain why the short
      circuit current, FF, and conversion efficiency are low for these
      two films. However, the conversion efficiency of TiO 2-2 is higher
      than that of TiO 2-1, probably due to nitrogen residues from the
      nitric acid added to TiO2 sol. hi comparison to the thick TiO
      &lt;]&gt;2-3-TG 'A-CdSe film with the highest power conversion
      efficiency ([eta]=0.84%), the TiO 2-4 -TGA-CdSe (CdSe QD
      sensitized with HMT and PEG) has lower conversion efficiency. This
      could possibly be due to a weakened interaction between CdSe QDs
      and TiO2 nanoparticles caused by hydrocarbon species on the TiO2
      surface from uncombusted polyethylene glycol (PEG). It is clear
      that IPCE is enhanced when the films were sensitized with CdSe QDs
      (Table 2) due to their strong visible absorption and electron
      injection. The highest IPCE percentage was found for TiO 2-3
      -TGA-CdSe films (95% in 300 nm) where the larger content of
      brookite and rutile phases of the TiO2 :N was present. The lower
      IPCE in T1O2-I samples is possibly due to the lower porosity and
      probably due to the presence of the anatase crystalline phase
      (Figure 10). The performance of the solid solar cell is similar to
      that reported previously, as shown in Figure 11 (Grant, C D.;
      Schwartzberg, A. M.; Smestad, G. P.; Kowalik, J.; Tolbert, L. M.;
      Zhang, J. Z. J. Electroanal. Chem. 2002, 522, 40). In this case,
      the highest IPCE is 6% at 400 nm and a strong response, larger
      than 4%, was observed at 600 nm. The first increase at 600 nm is
      attributed to the absorption onset of the 4.6 nm QDs utilized to
      sensitize the 7[Iota]O2-3-TGA-CdSe film. The direct overlap with
      the first excitonic band (inset figurel 1) of the CdSe QDs with
      the IPCE measurements confirms the electron injection into the
      TiO2 conductive band. This in turn, confirms the important role of
      the QDs to harvest photons and increase the generated
      photocurrent. All these results indicate the sensitive dependence
      of the cell performance on the film porosity, QD-TiO2 interaction,
      and N-doping.<br>
      <br>
      The electronic band structure of CdSe QD and TiO2:N could help to
      better understand the reason behind increased performance in TiO2
      :N thin films sensitized with CdSe. Figure 12 shows different
      electron-hole relaxation, recombination pathways and band
      structure of both CdSe QDs with a bandgap of 2.17 eV (3.5 nm in
      average diameter) and nitrogen doped TiO2 with an overall bandgap
      of 3.2 eV at pH=7. The band diagram of CdSe and TiO2 :N have both
      been placed in relation to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).
      CdSe QDs of 3.5 nm has a top valence band position of ca. +0.7 V
      and a lower conduction band of ca. -1.4 V based on previous
      reports (Robel, L; Subramanian, V.; Kuno, M.; Kamat, P. V. J. Am.
      Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 2385). The band structure of TiO2 :N in turn
      has a valence band at ca. +2.6 V and a conductive band at ca. -0.6
      V based on the work by Sakthivel and Kisch (Sakthivel, S.;
      Janczarek, M.; Kisch, H. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 19384;
      Sakthivel, S.; Kisch, H. Chemphyschem 2003, 4, 487). N doping
      introduces a state at 1.14 eV above the valence band and 2.06 eV
      (600 nm absorption onset) below the conduction band of TiO2 (Di
      Valentin et al. supra). Several groups have also reported an
      absorption onset at 600 nm via reflectance spectroscopy Chen, X.
      B.; Burda, C. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 15446; (Burda, C; Lou,
      Y. B.; Chen, X. B.; Samia, A. C. S.; Stout, J.; GoIe, J. L. Nano
      Letters 2003, 3, 1049; and GoIe, J. L.; Stout, J. D.; and Burda,
      C; Lou, Y. B.; Chen, X. B. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004, 108, 1230).
      Incorporation of nitrogen into nanocrystalline TiO2 acts as an
      electron acceptor site within the TiO2 bandgap, and effectively
      should be considered a p-type doping. This state acts as an
      electron acceptor site within the TiO2 bandgap. Now it is still
      important to consider the typical n-type behavior of TiO2 as a
      result of oxygen vacancies in the crystal lattice, and therefore
      act as donor sites within the structure, and effectively increase
      the Fermi level (Ef) to more negative potentials (versus NHE). The
      bandgap dopant N state is populated as evidenced by the weak
      absorption onset at 600 nm (2.06 eV) explained by Asahi et al.
      (2001 , supra) as a N 2p[pi] to Ti dxy transition. Due to the
      relatively weak absorption of this N 2p[pi] to Ti dxy electronic
      transition in comparison to the quantum confined CdSe transition
      (ISh ISe) transition, we expect that, for the CdSe QD sensitized
      TiO2 :N films, the optical absorption is dominated by the CdSe
      QDs.<br>
      <br>
      To understand the charge transfer and recombination kinetics, we
      will ignore the weak absorption due to N-doping for the QD
      sensitized TiO2 :N film. In this case, photoexcitation of the CdSe
      QD generates a hole in its valence band and an electron in its
      conduction band. The electron in the conduction band of CdSe QD is
      injected into the conduction band of TiO2 (left to right yellow
      arrow) and the transfer of the hole in the valence band of CdSe
      can be mediated by the electron occupied N state (right to left
      yellow arrow). The energy level of the N state is close to the top
      of the valence band of CdSe and this proximity in energy will aid
      in the hole (or electron) transfer process. Since this only exists
      for the CdSe QD sensitized and N-doped TiO2 film, the N-mediated
      hole transport may be the key to the enhanced photoelectrical
      response of this film compared to TiO2 films with only N doping or
      only QD sensitization. This is possible, especially considering
      that the hole transport is often the limiting step for overall
      charge transport in nanoparticle films. It is clear that N doping
      into TiO2 has introduced extra pathways for the charge carriers
      that could be beneficial for overall chare transport and thereby
      cell performance. Optimization of the system via an increased
      dopant level (currently 0.6-0.8 %, see Table 1) and manipulation
      of the capping agents of CdSe may further enhance the photocurrent
      density as well as power conversion efficiency above that of 0.84%
      currently observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several TiO2 films with nitrogen doping and/or CdSe QD
      sensitization have been systematically investigated using a
      combination of synthetic, spectroscopic, XRD, XPS, microscopy, and
      electrochemistry techniques. The structure of TiO2:Nhas been found
      to be generally a mixture of anatase, brookite, and rutile phases.
      Nitrogen doping into the TiO2 lattice results in a red-shift of
      the electronic absorption and enhanced photocurrent response of
      relative to undoped TiO2 films. In addition, CdSe QDs linked to
      TiO2:N nanoparticles were found to significantly increase the
      photocurrent and power conversion of the films compared to
      standard TiO2 :N films without QD sensitization. The IPCE is 6% at
      400 nm for TiO2:N-TGA-CdSe solid state solar cells and 95% for
      TiO2 :N-TG A-CdSe films near 300 nm in a Na2S electrolyte, which
      is much higher than undoped TiO2 with QD sensitization or TiO2 :N
      without QD sensitization. A power conversion efficiency ([eta]) of
      0.84% was found along with a fill factor (FF%) of 27.7% for 1100
      nm thick TiO2:N-TGA- CdSe thin films. The results show that the
      combination of nitrogen doping and QD sensitization of TiO2 thin
      films is an effective way to enhance the photoresponse, which is
      promising for photovoltaic (PV) and photoelectrochemical
      applications.<br>
      <br>
      One exemplary application comprises a photovoltaic cell comprising
      the thin film structure as disclosed herein. In one embodiment,
      the photovoltaic cell has a power conversion efficiency of between
      1 &lt;-&gt; 10&lt;~3&gt; and 5 [eta]%. In another embodiment the
      power conversion efficiency is of between 5-10&lt;"3&gt; and 1
      [eta]%. For example, the power conversion efficiency can be
      MO&lt;"3&gt;, 2.5- 10&lt;'3&gt;, 5- 10&lt;'3&gt;, 1 10&lt;"2&gt;,
      2.5-10&lt;"2&gt;, 5-10&lt;"2&gt;, 1-10&lt;"1&gt;,
      2.5-10&lt;"1&gt;, 5-10&lt;"1&gt;, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5,
      and 5 [eta]%.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment the photovoltaic cell has an incident photon
      to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of between 1% and 99%. In
      another embodiment, the IPCE is of between 13% and 95%. In another
      embodiment the IPCE is of between 25% and 90%. In yet another
      embodiment the IPCE is of between 50% and 85%. For example, the
      IPCE can be 1%, 2%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 12.5%, 15%, 17.5%, 20%, 25%,
      30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%,
      95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, and 99.5%.<br>

      2) Synergistic Effect of CdSe Quantum Dot Sensitization and
      Nitrogen Doping of TiO2 Nanostructures for Photoelectrochemical
      Applications<br>
      <br>
      Our lab has demonstrated a synergistic effect in combining CdSe QD
      sensitization with N-doping of TiO2 that substantially increases
      photovoltaic response and was tentatively attributed to increased
      hole transport from the CdSe valence band to the N dopant level
      (Lopez-Luke et al. supra). In this work, we report the first
      example of CdSe QD sensitized and N-doped TiO2 nanomaterials for
      PEC hydrogen generation with substantially enhanced photocurrent.
      Again, significant synergistic effect between QD sensitization and
      N-doping has been observed. A detailed study reveals that it is
      still the enhanced hole transfer/transport that is responsible for
      the observed synergistic effect, however, the enhanced hoe
      transfer/transport is not directly coupled to the N energy levels
      but is rather caused by oxygen vacancy states (V0) of TiO2 that is
      mediated indirectly by N-doping. We have synthesized novel
      nanocomposite materials based on visible light- absorbing CdSe QDs
      and N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and nanowire arrays with properties
      tailored for PEC hydrogen generation. We have experimentally
      demonstrated for the first time, to our best knowledge, that the
      synergistic effect of sensitization and elemental doping
      significantly enhances the photoelectrochemical activities of the
      TiO2 nanostructured photoanodes. These composite nanostructures
      show enhanced overall charge transport and improved PEC
      performance when the relevant bandgap states are properly aligned
      and utilized. Enhanced electron-hole separation and hole
      transfer/transport through the oxygen vacancy states, V0, mediated
      by N-doping has been proposed to explain the observed experimental
      results. Such nanocomposite structures simultaneously enhance
      visible light absorption and interfacial charge transfer. The
      results provide useful insights for developing new nanostructures
      tailored for PEC and other applications via controlled band
      engineering.<br>

      following examples, which are included merely for purposes of
      illustration of certain aspects and embodiments of the present
      invention and not as limitations.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>

      conductive glass (Tec glass 30 Ohms) was obtained from Hartford
      glass (Hartford City, IN) and the reference electrodes Ag/ AgCl
      from CH Instruments Inc. (Austin, TX). B. TiO2 film preparation.<br>
      <br>
      Four kinds of TiO2 films (TiO2-I, TiO 2-2, TiO2S and TiO 2-4) were
      made by a sol- gel method. All TiO2 films were made using 375
      [mu]L of titanium iso-propoxide as a precursor which was stored in
      a nitrogen filled glovebox. For TiO2-I, TiO2-2, TiO2-3 and TiO2-4,
      titanium iso-propoxide was injected into 250 [mu]l of Milli-Q
      water and 5 mL of ethanol within the glovebox. TiO2-I solutions
      did not contain nitric acid, while TiO2-2 solutions contained a
      drop wise addition of nitric acid until the solution reached a pH
      ~ 1.23. TiO2S solutions is similar to TiO2-2, but 0.05 g of HMT
      was added under vigorous stirring. Solution TiO2-4 is similar to
      TiO2-3 with an addition of 0.90 g of polyethyleneglycol (PEG-
      10,000 g/mol) under vigorous stirring all within an O2 free
      environment. As a point of clarification, acidification (TiO2-2,
      TiO2-3 and TiO2-4) was performed outside of the glovebox prior to
      titanium isopropoxide addition within the 5 glovebox. The sol was
      then stirred for three days within the glovebox at ambient
      temperatures (~ 25 &lt;0&gt;C). All TiO2 films were made by spin
      coating at 2000 rpm for 60 seconds onto FTO (SnO2:F) conducting
      substrates in ambient conditions. The thickness was estimated with
      mass, area and density of the TiO2 films and was confirmed with
      AFM measurements (~150 nm and ~1100 nm thick). The films were
      annealed at 550 &lt;0&gt;C for 1.5 hours with a Leister heat gun
      in open air conditions. For thin TiO2-I, TiO2-2, TiO2-3 and TiO2-4
      films, 50, 200, 100 and 50 [mu]L of the sol solution was used,
      respectively. For thick TiO2-I, TiO2-2, TiO2-3 and TiO2-4 films,
      400, 2000, 700, 250 [mu]L respectively of the sol solution was
      used. The sol solution was put on the conductive glass with 1
      &lt;[chi]&gt;2.2 cm&lt;2&gt; areas, respectively. It was necessary
      to apply different volumes in order to obtain approximately the
      same film thickness because of the different viscosities of the
      various solutions. C. CdSe QD synthesis.<br>
      <br>
      High-quality CdSe QDs were synthesized based upon the protocol of
      Qu, Peng, and Peng (2001) wherein CdO is utilized as the Cd
      precursor, and TDPA and TOPO are the ligands and coordinating
      solvents, respectively (see Qu, Peng, and Peng, Nano Letters 2001,
      1, 333). The resulting CdSe nanocrystals were in the strong
      confinement size regime and were synthesized in normal air-free
      reaction conditions. The synthesis of the CdSe nanoparticle
      follows the procedure reported by Robel et al. wherein 0.05 g
      (~0.39 mmol) CdO, 0.3 g (-1.1 mmol) TDPA and 4 g of TOPO was
      heated to 110 &lt;0&gt;C and degassed under vacuum and then heated
      to 300 &lt;0&gt;C under a nitrogen flow (Schlenk line) (Robel et
      al. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 2385). A SeTOP (0.7% by weight)
      solution was obtained by adding 0.026 g of Se powder with 4.25ml
      of TOP inside a glove box and stirred for lhr to insure complete
      dissolution of the Se powder. After reaching 300 &lt;0&gt;C the
      Cd-TDPA-TOPO solution was cooled to 270 &lt;0&gt;C prior to the
      injection of SeTOP. Under a nitrogen flow, 3 ml of SeTOP was
      injected, which resulted in the lowering of the temperature to 260
      &lt;0&gt;C. The temperature was then increased to 280 &lt;0&gt;C
      to facilitate particle growth and aliquots were removed and probed
      to track nanocrystallite growth via UV-vis absorption spectroscopy
      and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. The CdSe solution was
      cooled and was removed from the reaction flask at around
      80&lt;0&gt;C and dissolved into - 10 mL of toluene. The QDs in
      toluene were then cleaned twice through a precipitation and
      decantation regime using methanol and centrifugation at 3000 rpm,
      and the QDs were ultimately redissolved in toluene prior to their
      use as a sensitizer. D. CdSe QD linkage to TiO2.<br>
      <br>
      CdSe QDs were linked to nanocrystalline TiO2 and TiO2 :N thin
      films using TGA as a molecular linker. TiO2 has a strong affinity
      for the carboxylate group of the linker molecules, while the
      sulfur atom of TGA binds strongly to CdSe nanoparticles through
      surface Cd&lt;2+&gt; cations. The films were heated in a heat gun
      at 100 &lt;0&gt;C for 4 hrs to remove H2O from the surface due to
      ambient humidity adsorption. They were later immersed in undiluted
      neat TGA for 12 hrs in a nitrogen environment in a glove box. The
      films were then immersed in toluene, removing the excess TGA and
      in turn immersed in a CdSe solution for 12 hrs inside the glove
      box. Four films of 1 x 1 cm&lt;2&gt; were immersed in 5 ml of CdSe
      QDs suspended in toluene as described earlier. The TiO2:N-TGA-CdSe
      films were stored in a nitrogen filled glove box and not exposed
      to light prior to PEC characterization. The solid state
      TiO2:N-TGA-CdSe cell after PEC measurements remained stable for
      months . The TiO2:N-TGA-CdSe cell in the electrolyte is very
      stable, however, when is removed from the electrolyte the PEC
      properties diminish after a hours of experimentation. Long term
      stability need to be further studied in future research.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example II: Structural and morphology characterization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) studies of the films were
      carried out on an X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, PHI
      Quantera SXM) using a non- monochromatized Al KR X-ray source
      (1486.6 eV). The energy resolution of the spectrometer was set at
      0.5 eV. The binding energy was calibrated using a C Is (284.6 eV)
      spectrum of a hydrocarbon that remained in the XPS analysis
      chamber as a contaminant. Crystalline phase identification was
      performed via X-ray diffraction (XPvD) in conjunction with Raman
      spectroscopy. XRD analysis was conducted on a MINIFLEX
      diffractometer operating at 30 kV/15 mA using Cu-Ka radiation and
      scanning speed of 1[deg.] 2[theta]/min.<br>
      <br>
      Raman spectroscopy of the films was performed using a Renishaw
      micro-Raman setup with a (5/ 10/ 20/ 50) X objective lens and a
      633 ran excitation wavelength. Renishaw' s WiRE (Windows based
      Raman Environment) was used for collection and data analysis of 1
      to 5 scans ranging in accumulations of 1 to 10 seconds.<br>
      <br>
      AFM images of the films without and with QDs were acquired under
      ambient conditions with a PicoLE SPM instrument (Molecular
      Imaging) in tapping mode. The tapping mode cantilevers exhibit
      resonant frequencies between 60 and 90 kHz (typical 75 kHz), force
      constants of 2.5-5.5 N/m, and tip apex radii of -10 run. The
      resulting images were flattened and plane-fit using software from
      Molecular Imaging. Silica etched tips were purchased from
      MikroMasch (Watsonville, OR).<br>
      <br>
      A JEOL model JEM-1200EX microscope was used for the low-resolution
      transmission electron microscope (TEM) studies of the CdSe QDs.
      The TEM was equipped with a Gatan Model 792 Bioscan digital camera
      running on a Windows 2000 computer with Gatan Digital Micrograph
      as the analyzing software.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example III: Optical and electrochemical characterization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      UV-visible light (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy was conducted on
      a Hewlett- Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer. UV-vis
      absorption spectra were measured first by placing a blank FTO
      glass substrate in the light path, subtracting the absorption
      pattern, and then performing the UV-VIS absorption measurement on
      the variety of TiO2 thin films.<br>
      <br>
      Photo luminescence (PL) spectroscopy was gathered on a Perkin
      Elmer LS 5OB with an excitation wavelength of 390 nm and 1%
      attenuator. QDs in toluene were placed in an open sided 1 cm path
      length quartz cuvette for both UV-vis absorption and PL
      measurements. Thin films were placed in a thin film sample holder
      from Perkin Elmer (#52123130) for PL spectra.<br>
      <br>
      Photoelectrochemical studies (linear sweep voltammetry and
      incident photon-to- current conversion efficiency (IPCE) in solid
      state and in electrolyte were carried out with a CHI440
      electrochemical workstation (Austin, TX). Linear sweep voltammetry
      was used to obtain the I-V profiles. Actively investigated thin
      films were the TiO2, TiO2:N and TiO2)N-CdSe thin films described
      earlier. A Ag/ AgCl and Pt wire coil were used as reference and
      counter electrodes, respectively. Before each measurement the Na2S
      5 electrolyte solution was deaerated by bubbling ultra-high-purity
      N2 for 20 minutes through the electrolyte solution and a nitrogen
      flow was also subsequently blown over the surface during data
      gathering. For I-V measurements a halogen lamp was utilized (75
      watts) and for IPCE measurements and a IOOOW Xe lamp (Oriel
      Research Arc Lamp assembly #69924 and power supply #69920) coupled
      to a infrared (IR) water filled filter (Oriel # 6127), and then
      aligned into a monochromator (Oriel Cornerstone 130 l/8m) for
      spectral resolution from 300 to 800 nm,. An aqueous Na2S solution
      serves as the redox couple to maintain the stability of the QD 's,
      as discussed elsewhere (Mueller, N.; Tenne, R.; Cahen, D. J.
      Electroanal Chem. 1981, 130, 373; Ueno, Y.; Minoura, H.;
      Nishikawa, T.; Tsuiki, M. J. Electrochem. Soc. 1983, 130, 43). A
      maximum photocurrent was produced with 1 M Na2S using 6.5 ml of
      Milli-Q water (18 M[Omega]). Diminished molarities OfNa2S were
      found to decrease overall photocurrent performance. EPCE
      measurements were also conducted for solid state TiO2:N-TGA-CdSe
      solar cells. A schematic of the photoelectrochemical setup is
      shown in Figure l(a-b).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example IV: Results</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The amount of nitrogen in N-doped TiO2 nanoparticle films was
      identified by the XPS technique. Figure 2 shows the XPS spectra
      for the Ti[theta]2-3 film. Figure 2a shows the Ti2p, O Is, CIs,
      NIs and Sn binding energy from 0 to 1000 eV (Sn is identified from
      the conductive film). Figure 2b shows only the nitrogen binding
      energy from 396 to 408eV, showing two peaks at 400 and above
      401.2eV. To compare the effect of HMT and PEG, TiO2-3 film has
      37.45 % of C, 0.60 % of N, 50.16 % of O and 11.79 % of Ti. TiO2-4
      film shows elemental composition of C and N of 39.93% and 0.80%,
      respectively, with 48% of O and 11.27 % of Ti.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 3 shows the XRD patterns for all the films prepared,
      respectively, for determining the crystal phases of both TiO2 and
      TiO2 :N. All the XRD data show the crystal phase of the conductive
      glass (SnO2 :F), which is marked as (SnF). The TiO2-I film
      (without nitric acid) XRD pattern is representative of the anatase
      crystal phase (Figure 3a). For the TiO2-2 film (with nitric acid),
      the brookite and rutile phases appear, with a mix of anatase,
      brookite and rutile phases (Figure 3b). With HMT added for the
      TiO2S film, a mixture of brookite and rutile phases dominate with
      a trace amount of anatase phase (Figure 3c). With further addition
      of PEG and HMT, as in the TiO2-4 film, the brookite and rutile
      phases decrease and the anatase is predominant. Additional
      evidence for the various crystal phases of the different films
      comes from their Raman spectra that show anatase as the primary
      phase for TiO2-I and TiO2-4, (Figure 4a and 4c) and a mix of
      anatase, brookite and rutile phases in TiO2-2 and TiO2S films.
      Representative Raman spectrum of the TiO2S film is shown in Figure
      4b. It can be seen that the characteristic peak for the anatase
      phase at 144 cm&lt;"1&gt; shifts slightly to 146 cm&lt;"1&gt; with
      nitrogen doping (TiO2S and TiO 2-4 films).<br>

      Morphology of the films with and without QDs was studied by AFM in
      ambient conditions. The average TiO2 nanocrystal size was found to
      be around 100 nm in diameter. Films with HMT (TiO2S) or HMT plus
      PEG (TiO2-4) show more porosity than TiO2-I and TiO 2-2 films. A
      representative AFM image for the TiO2S film with about 150 nm
      thickness is shown in Figure 5a. For thicker films (for example,
      1100 nm), TiO2 particles were observed to form clusters. All films
      show the presence of CdSe QDs after they were sensitized, as
      exemplified by the AFM image for the TiO2S-TGA-CdSe film shown in
      Figure 5b. While it is not easy to determine the exact size of the
      CdSe QDs based on AFM, the average size of the QDs appear to be on
      the order of a few nanometers. To better characterize the CdSe
      QDs, TEM measurements was conducted. Figure 6 shows a
      representative TEM image of CdSe QDs. The image appears to show
      reasonably uniform size distributions of the CdSe QDs with an
      average diameter of 3.5 nm.<br>
      <br>
      Optical absorption of the different films was characterized by UV-
      Vis spectroscopy, with emphasis on comparing the effect of
      nitrogen doping through HMT or nitric acid. Figure 7 shows a
      comparison of the UV-vis absorption spectra of different films.
      For films without HMT and PEG (TiO2-I and TiO2-2), the absorption
      is primarily around 340 and 400 nm (Figure 7a and 7b). However,
      for films with HMT (TiO2S and TiO[iota]-4), the spectra show an
      obvious red-shift of the absorption edge towards the visible
      region, with peaks around 350, 426, and 542 nm (Figure 7c) or 412
      run, 532 nm and an absorption onset at 600 nm (Figure 7d). Figure
      7e shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of the TiO2-3-CdSe film,
      with strong absorption around 560 nm due to the CdSe QDs. For
      comparison, Figure 8a and 8b show the absorption and
      photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdSe QDs in toluene under
      ambient conditions. The absorption spectrum shows the expected
      strong and sharp excitonic peak around 560 nm while the PL
      spectrum shows a narrow emission band near 580 nm, which is
      clearly due to bandedge emisison. Figure 8c shows the PL spectrum
      of the TiO 2- 3 -TGA-CdSe film, with a relatively weak emission
      peak at 575.5 nm, which is slightly blue shifted with respect to
      the PL peak of CdSe QDs in toluene solution.<br>

      The current-voltage (I- V) profiles for solar cells fabricated
      using the films with different thicknesses (150 nm and 1100 nm)
      were obtained using a halogen lamp and a 1 M Na2S. With the cell
      configuration shown schematically in Figure 1, the I- V profiles
      measured are shown in Figure 9. The cell without HMT
      {Ti[theta]2-l-CdSe film) present a low short-circuit current
      density of -169 [mu]A/cm&lt;2&gt; with an open-circuit voltage of
      -1.3V (Figure 9a) within the voltage window of -1.4 to 0.3 V, and
      the fill factor is 14.8% with a low power conversion efficiency of
      [eta]=0.120%. For the cell based on Ti[theta]2-3-TGA-CdSe thin
      film (150 nm), the I-V curve in Figure 9b shows a short-circuit
      current (-242 [mu]A/cm&lt;2&gt;) with an open-circuit voltage of -
      1.0 V, a fill factor of 25.4% and power efficiency of
      [eta]=O.228%. The cell based on TiO2S-TGA-CdSe thick film (1100
      nm) have the highest short-circuit (- 683 [mu]A/cm&lt;2&gt;) with
      an open-circuit voltage of 1.2V (Figure 9c) and the highest fill
      factor of 27.7% and power conversion efficiency of [eta]=0.840%.
      Short-circuit current and open circuit voltage found in Figure 9
      is summarized in Table 1. The fill factor (FJF) and power
      conversion efficiency (7%) were calculated using short-circuit
      current and open circuit voltage&lt;45&gt; and are also given in
      Table 1.<br>
      <br>
      FF=(jVmax)/Qsc V00) (3) where jsc is the short circuit current
      density, Voc is the open circuit voltage, QV) max is the maximum
      power observed from the current density-voltage curve for each
      device and /, is the incident light power density (27
      mW/cm&lt;2&gt;). It is clear that thick films (-1100 nm) exhibit a
      higher FF and [eta]% than thin films (-150 nm). However, cells
      with TiO2 :N nanoparticles sensitized with CdSe QDs exhibit a much
      higher [eta]% than films without sensitization.<br>
      <br>
      The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was
      studied for solid cells and in electrolyte (IM Na2S) with
      different thicknesses. EPCE at different wavelengths was
      determined from the short circuit photocurrent (jsc), where V=O at
      different excitation wavelengths ([lambda]) using the expression:<br>
      <br>
      IPCE %=[(1240 x jsc(A/cm&lt;2&gt;)]/ [[lambda](nm)
      xl,(w/cm&lt;2&gt;)] x 100 (5) where I,nc is the incident light
      power. The IPCE results OfTiO2 and TiO2:N without and with CdSe
      QDs are shown in Figure 10. It is clear that the photocurrent
      response is much stronger with the presence of CdSe QD
      sensitization. The TiO2-I-TGA-CdSe film (QD sensitized but without
      N doping) shows photocurrent responses at 300, 530 and 620 nm,
      with the highest response near 300 nm with IPCE=56%. The
      TiO2S-TGA-CdSe film (QD sensitized and N-doped) shows similar
      response but an overall stronger IPCE with the highest response
      around 95% at 300 nm. The EPCE of both films closely match the
      absorption spectrum of CdSe QDs, and TiO2:N as shown in Figure 7e.
      The EPCE% is 1.06 at 300nm for TiO2:N (magnified 1OX in Figure 10)
      showing photocurrent responses at 320, 360 and 420 nm also which
      are close to absorption spectrum as shown in Figure 7c.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the EPCE% of TiO 2-3 -TG A-CdSe thin film (150 nm)
      solid cell was studied and the result is shown in Figure 11. It
      can be seen that peaks at 480 and 600 nm correspond to absorption
      of the CdSe QDs (see Figure 11 inset that shows the absorption and
      emission spectra of the CdSe nanoparticles in toluene). This cell
      shows an EPCE response around 6% at 400 nm and the results are
      summarized in Table 2. Table 2 Summary of EPCE results from our
      study of thin and thick films based solar cell in electrolyte

      Example V: Synthesis and Analysis of Nanoparticle Films and
      Nanowires To understand the synergistic effect between N-doping
      and CdSe sensitization, we synthesized and studied the PEC
      properties of both anatase TiO2 nanoparticle films and vertically
      aligned rutile TiO2 nanowire arrays. TiO2 nanoparticle films were
      made by spin coating 150 [mu]L OfTiO2 sol-gel nanoparticle
      solution at 2000 rpm for 1 minute on a piece of fluorine-doped tin
      oxide (FTO) conductive glass. The films were dried at 50
      &lt;[deg.]&gt;C for 30 minutes, followed by repeated coating and
      drying, and eventually sintered in air at 550 [deg.]C, as
      previously described (Guo, B.; Liu, Z.; Hong, L.; Jiang, H.; Lee,
      J. Y. Thin Solid Films 2005, 479, (1-2), 310-315). TiO2 nanowire
      arrays were grown on FTO glass based on a recently reported hydro
      thermal method with slight modification (Liu, B.; Aydril, E. S. J.
      Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, 3985-3990). The FTO substrate was placed
      in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave consisting of a
      mixture of aqueous solution of titanium n-butoxide and
      hydrochloric acid. The autoclave was heated in an electric oven at
      150 &lt;0&gt;C for 5 hours, and a uniform film of dense and
      vertically aligned TiO2 nanowire arrays on a substrate was
      obtained. N-doping of the nanomaterial films was achieved by
      annealing in an ammonia atmosphere at 530 [deg.]C using a quartz
      tube furnace (Yang et al. supra). Films were sensitized with CdSe
      QDs by chemical bath deposition (CBD) following previously
      published results (Kale, R. B.; Lokhande, C. D. J. Phys. Chem. B
      2005, 109, (43), 20288- 20294). A concentrated ammonia solution
      was added to 10 ml of 0.5 M aqueous solution of Cd(acetate)2
      dihydrate to a pH of 12.5 followed by the slow addition of 30 ml
      of 0.25 M Na2SeSO3 while being stirred for a few minutes. TiO2
      films were placed vertically in the solution at room temperature
      for about 15 hours to allow deposition of CdSe onto TiO2.<br>
      <br>
      The resulting TiO2 nanoparticle films were characterized using
      electron microscopy and spectroscopy techniques. Scanning electron
      microscopy (SEM) studies verified that the sintered TiO2
      nanoparticle film has good coverage of the substrate, with a
      thickness of -200 nm. Atomic force microscopy studies confirmed
      that the film is porous with particles -50-100 nm in size. X-ray
      power diffraction results proved that the sintered TiO2
      nanoparticles have anatase crystal structures. More importantly,
      there is no phase change after annealing the nanoparticle films in
      ammonia. After ammonia annealing, the color of the TiO2
      nanoparticle films changed from colorless to pale yellow,
      suggesting that the incorporation of N introduces bandgap states
      of TiO2 and thereby enhances visible light absorption.<br>
      <br>
      To gain a quantitative understanding on the concentration and
      chemical state of the doped N, we performed X-ray photoelectron
      spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the TiO2 nanoparticle films. High
      resolution XPS spectrum of the N Is region showed three peaks
      centered at 402.4 eV, 400.0 eV and 397.2 eV respectively. The
      peaks located at 402.4 eV and 400.0 eV can be ascribed to
      chemisorbed N2 and/or amines (NHx) originating from ammonia
      annealing (Asahi et al. supra; Saha, N. C; Tompkins, H. G. J.
      Appl. Phys. 1992, 72, (7), 3072-3079). The peak at 397.2 eV is
      typical of the N Is binding energy of oxynitride (O-Ti-N),
      confirming that atomic N atoms incorporate substitutionally at O
      sites (Vitiello, P. R.; Macak, J. M.; Ghicov, A.; Tsuchiya, H.;
      Dick, L. F. P.; Schmuki, P. Electrochem. Commun. 2006, 8,
      544-548). The atomic percentage for all nitrogen species found in
      N-doped TiO2 sample was 1.94 %.<br>
      <br>
      Both TiO2 and N-doped TiO2 (TiO2 :N) films were sensitized with
      CdSe QDs using the CBD method. SEM studies showed that the films
      were coated with very large particles of -200 ran in diameter,
      which were aggregates of smaller CdSe QD. These CdSe aggregates
      were formed on the surface of the TiO2 via a "cluster by cluster"
      growth mechanism (Kale et al. supra; Froment, M.; Lincot, D.
      Electrochim. Acta 1995, 40, (10), 1293-1303). These CdSe
      sensitized TiO2 (CdSe-TiO2) and N-doped TiO2 (CdSe-TiO2:N)
      nanoparticle films were orange in color due to the strong visible
      absorption of the CdSe QDs. To quantitatively understand the role
      of N-doping and CdSe sensitization in electronic transitions in
      TiO2 nanoparticle films, their UV-visible absorption spectra were
      measured, as shown in Figure 1(13). All spectra show an apparent
      absorption peak near 325 nm, which was caused by blanking with a
      conductive FTO glass substrate. For pristine TiO2, strong
      absorption starts around 350 nm, and for TiO2:N slightly increased
      absorption of visible light appears in the region of 350-520 nm.
      The electronic energy level due to substitutional N-doping at O
      sites (N0) has been estimated previously, using Density Functional
      Theory calculations, to be only 0.14 eV above the valence band
      OfTiO2 (Di Valentin, C; Pacchioni, G.; Selloni, A.; Livraghi, S.;
      Giamello, E. J. Phys. Chem. B 2005, 109, (23), 11414-11419). The
      increased visible absorption for TiO2 :N is thus not likely to be
      due to electronic transitions from the N0 energy levels to the
      conduction band OfTiO2. A previous study also indicated that
      transition from N0 to the conduction band OfTiO2, as mainly
      originating from a N 2P[pi] to Ti d^ transition, is not strong
      (Tak et al. supra). On the other hand, it has been reported that
      N-doping facilitates the creation of oxygen vacancies (V0) in TiO2
      lattice (Livraghi, S.; Paganini, M. C; Giamello, E.; Selloni, A.;
      Di Valentin, C; Pacchioni, G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, (49),
      15666-15671; Nambu, A.; Graciani, J.; Rodriguez, J. A.; Wu, Q.;
      Fujita, E.; Sanz, J. F. J. Chem. Phys. 2006, 125, (9),
      094706-094708). In particular, the ammonia annealing process could
      increase the V0 formation, since H2 generated from as ammonia
      breakdown at 530[deg.]C can reduce Ti&lt;4+&gt; to Ti&lt;3+&gt;
      (oxygen vacancy) (Irie, H.; Watanabe, Y.; Hashimoto, K. J. Phys.
      Chem. B 2003, 107, (23), 5483-5486; Wang, J.; Tafen, D. N.; Lewis,
      J. P.; Hong, Z. L.; Manivannan, A.; Zhi, M. J.; Li, M.; Wu, N. Q.
      J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2009, 131, (34), 12290-12297). The formation of
      V0 creates midgap states about 0.7 - 1.18 eV below the conduction
      band of TiO2 (Wang et al. supra; Sanjines, R. T., H. Berger, H.
      Gozzo, F. Margaritondo, G. Levy, F. J. Appl. Phys. 1993, 75, (6),
      2945-2951; Thomas, A. G.; Flavell, W. R.; Kumarasinghe, A. R.;
      Mallick, A. K.; Tsoutsou, D.; Smith, G. C; Stockbauer, R.; Patel,
      S.; Gratzel, M.; Hengerer, R. Phys. Rev. B 2003, 67, (3), 035110;
      Kuznetsov, V. N.; Serpone, N. J. Phys. Chem. C 2009, 113, (34),
      15110-15123). The somewhat enhanced visible light absorption of
      TiO2 :N is therefore attributed to excitation of electrons from
      the N0 levels to the localized electronic levels of V0. (See Di
      Valentin et al. supra; Nambu et al. supra; Wang et al. supra; and
      Serpone, N. J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, (48), 24287-24293.)<br>
      <br>
      In comparison to TiO2 and TiO2 :N films, CdSe sensitized TiO2
      films exhibit a significant enhancement in absorption of visible
      light. Both sensitized films showed similar absorption profile
      with a dominant peak near 525 nm (Figure 1(13)), which corresponds
      to the first excitonic absorption of quantum confined CdSe QDs,
      with an average diameter of -2.6 nm estimated based on the peak
      position of the exciton absorption (Yu, W. W.; Qu, L.; Guo, W.;
      Peng, X. Chem. Mater. 2003, 15, (14), 2854-2860). To the blue of
      525 nm, absorption due to transitions to higher electronic states
      clearly occurs. These excitonic absorptions of CdSe QDs are
      important for enhancing visible absorption of the CdSe-TiO2
      composites.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example VI: Photoelectrochemical Studies of Nanoparticles</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell studies on four TiO2 nanoparticle
      films, TiO2, TiO2 :N, CdSe-TiO2 and CdSe-TiO2 :N, have been
      carried out to understand the effect of N- doping and CdSe
      sensitization on TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoanode for PEC water
      splitting. All the PEC studies were conducted in a three-armed
      cell with a coiled platinum wire as the counter electrode
      (cathode) and Ag/ AgCl double junction reference electrode under
      nitrogen atmosphere. Photoanodes fabricated from TiO2 films were
      made by attaching a copper wire to a bare portion of the FTO
      conductive glass with a high purity conductive silver paint.
      Measurements were made on a Solartron 1280B potentiostat using a
      IOOOW Xenon Arc Lamp as the white light source. The electrolyte
      used was a mixture of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 aqueous
      solution, where Na2S in solution acts as a hole scavenger and is
      oxidized into S2&lt;2"&gt; to prevent the photocorrosion of CdSe.
      To ensure efficient hydrogen production at the cathode, Na2SO3 was
      added to reduce disulfides back to sulfides, S2 &lt;"&gt; + SO3
      &lt;'&gt; -&gt; S &lt;"&gt; + S2O3 &lt;"&gt;, which has been shown
      to significantly increase the amount of hydrogen produced
      (Banerjee, S.; Mohapatra, S. K.; Das, P. P.; Misra, M. Chem.
      Mater. 2008, 20, (21), 6784-6791; Buehler, N.; Meier, K.; Reber,
      J. F. J. Phys. Chem. 2002, 88, (15), 3261-3268; Chi, C. F.; Lee,
      Y. L.; Weng, H. S. Nanotechnology 2008, 19, (12), 125704).<br>
      <br>
      The linear sweep voltammograms recorded from these samples in the
      dark and with white light illumination of 100 mW/cm&lt;2&gt; are
      shown in Figure 2(14). The results exhibit several key features.
      First, all TiO2 film samples showed a substantial photoresponse,
      indicating efficient charge separation upon light irradiation.
      Pristine TiO2 and TiO2 :N samples showed relatively low steady
      state photocurrent, ~25 [mu]A/cm&lt;2&gt;. Pristine TiO2 is
      expected to be low due to the limited absorption of visible light.
      However, it is somewhat surprising that the TiO2:N sample showed
      more or less the same maximum photocurrent density as the pristine
      sample. This can be understood in terms of the N doping energy
      levels in TiO2. The observed visible light absorption in TiO2 :N
      is attributed to the electron excitation from N0 levels to V0
      levels. Since the V0 levels are located well below the hydrogen
      reduction potential (H2O/H2), they are not able to result in
      hydrogen generation and thus enhance the photocurrent, which is
      consistent with our experimental observation.<br>
      <br>
      Second, both CdSe sensitized samples showed a significant
      enhancement in photocurrent. CdSe-TiO2 has a steady state
      photocurrent density of 0.15 mA/cm&lt;2&gt; (Figure 2(14)), which
      is an order of magnitude enhancement compared to pristine TiO2 or
      TiO2 :N. The enhancement is somewhat expected due to strong
      visible light absorption of CdSe QDs. Significantly, the
      photocurrent of CdSe-TiO2:N almost doubles that Of CdSe-TiO2.
      Since N-doping alone does not noticeably increase the photocurrent
      and the photocurrent for CdSe-TiO2:N is much higher than the
      simple sum of photocurrents for CdSe-TiO2 and TiO2 :N, a
      synergistic effect between N-doping and CdSe QD sensitization is
      clearly in operation and responsible for the enhanced photocurrent
      in CdSe-TiO2 :N compared to CdSe-TiO2. Due to the importance of
      this observation, major efforts have been made to ensure validity
      of comparison and reproducibility of the results with proper
      control experiments, including film thickness and light intensity.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example VII: Model of Physical Chemistry</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To better explain the observed trend in photocurrent density of
      CdSe-Ti[theta]2tN &gt; CdSe-TiCh " TiO2 ~ TiO[sum]tN, we develop a
      model based on the relevant electronic states of the different
      components in these composite nanostructures, as shown in Figure
      3(15). The conduction band edge of TiO2 has been reported to be
      located at -0.5 eV versus Normal Hydrogen Electrode (NHE), while
      the conduction band edge of bulk CdSe is close to -0.8 eV versus
      NHE (Graetzel, M. Nature 2001, 414, 338-344; Wang, C. J.; Shim,
      M.; Guyot-sionnest, P. Science 2001, 291, 2390-2392). For CdSe
      QDs, quantum confinement effect makes the energy level of
      conduction band even more negative (on an NHE scale) with
      decreasing particle size (Kongkanand, A.; Tvrdy, K.; Takechi, K.;
      Kuno, M.; Kamat, P. V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2008, 130, 4007-4015;
      Norris, D. J.; Bawendi, M. G. Phys. Rev. B 1996, 53, 16338). This
      alignment between the conduction band edges of CdSe QDs and TiO2
      nanoparticles should allow for efficient electron transfer from
      CdSe to TiO2. Therefore, the photoexcited electrons created in
      small bandgap CdSe QDs are expected to inject efficiently into
      TiO2 nanoparticles and lead to increased photocurrent. More
      detailed discussion of the model, especially the effect of
      N-doping, will be given after the IPCE results are disclosed
      below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example VIII: Photoresponse Studies</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To further quantify the PEC performance, IPCE measurements have
      been made to study the photoresponse of the TiO2 nanoparticle
      samples with and without CdSe 25 sensitization as a function of
      incident light wavelength. The IPCE was determined at no bias
      voltage by the equation:<br>
      <br>
      IPCE = ( 1240 x I) / ([lambda] x Jlight) (6) where I is the
      photocurrent density, [lambda] the incident light wavelength, and
      Jnght is the measured irradiance. Figure 4(16) shows the IPCE
      results for the different TiO2 30 nanoparticle films with and
      without N doping and/or CdSe QD sensitization. The unsensitized
      samples have strong photoresponse in the near UV region but little
      photoresponse in &gt;400 nm. Pn contrast, the sensitized samples
      show substantial photoactivity in the visible light region from
      400 to 600 nm in addition to strong photoresponse in the near UV.
      These results clearly confirm that CdSe sensitization 5 improves
      the visible light absorption and the photogenerated electrons in
      CdSe QD can be transferred to TiO2. While N-doping has little
      effect on IPCE for the unsensitized sample, it significantly
      increases the IPCE throughout the entire visible to near UV region
      for the QD sensitized sample. This again indicates a clear and
      significant synergistic effect between QD sensitization and
      N-doping.<br>
      <br>
      In comparison to the undoped sample, TiO2 :N has a higher density
      of oxygen vacancy states, V0. It has been proposed that when both
      V0 and N impurities are present in TiO2, the electrons from
      occupied 3d states (Ti&lt;3+&gt;) would transfer to lower energy
      empty 2p states (N&lt;2&gt; impurities) (Livraghi et al. supra;
      Nambu et al. supra; and Torres, G. R.; Lindgren, T.; Lu, J.;
      Granqvist, C-G.; Lindquist, S.-E. J. Phys. Chem. B 2004,108, (19),
      5995-6003). This electron transfer mechanism is favorable since it
      simultaneously lower the formation energy of V0 and stabilize the
      N impurities (Livraghi et al. supra; Nambu et al. supra; and
      Torres et al. supra). We suggest that this electron transfer
      process results in partially occupied V0 levels located at -0.4 eV
      above the CdSe valence band edge (as shown in Figure 3(15)) that
      can facilitate hole transfer from CdSe to TiO2 following
      photoexcitation of the CdSe QDs. This interfacial hole transfer
      could improve the PEC photocurrent of CdSe-TiO2:N nanoparticle
      films in two ways. First, it can lead to reduction in
      electron-hole recombination in CdSe QDs. Second, the holes
      transferred to the V0 levels in TiO2 can either oxidize the
      sacrificial reagent on site or be further transported through the
      TiO2 network to other oxidation sites, the latter being especially
      important for thick nanocrystalline films. Both processes are
      expected to lead to enhanced conversion efficiency of light to
      photocurrent. This explanation is consistent with all the UV-vis
      and IPCE results. This model is also modified from the previous
      model we proposed to explain enhanced photoresponse in CdSe-TiO2
      :N films for photovoltaic cells where N-doping was thought to
      directly facilitate hole transport (Lopez-Luke et al. supra).<br>
      <br>
      The present novel results strongly suggest that the enhancement in
      photoresponse for the QD-sensitized and N-doped TiO2 is due to
      improved hole transfer/transport enhanced by oxygen vacancy states
      mediated by N-doping. Detailed kinetic studies on the interfacial
      carrier transfer between CdSe QD and TiO2 need to be carried out
      in the future.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example IX: Photoelectrochemical Studies of Nanowires</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      To confirm this enhanced hole transfer/transport model first
      developed for zero- dimensional (OD) TiO2 nanoparticle films and
      extend it to one-dimensional (ID) nanostructures, we have also
      conducted photoelectrochemical (PEC) studies on different TiO2
      nanowire samples (TiO2, TiO2 :N, CdSe-TiO2 and CdSe-TiO2:N). High
      density and vertically aligned TiO2 nanowire arrays were grown on
      FTO glass using a hydrothermal method. Electron microscopy studies
      showed that the as-prepared nanowires are single crystal rutile
      structures and are uniform with diameters in the range from -100
      nm to 150 ran. The typical nanowire lengths are 2 - 3 [mu]m, which
      depends on the growth time. These TiO2 nanowire arrays were
      N-doped in ammonia and sensitized with CdSe QDs using the CBD
      method, as for TiO2 nanoparticles. The linear sweep voltammograms
      recorded from these samples in dark and with light illumination of
      100 mW/cm&lt;2&gt; are illustrated in Figure 5(17). TiO2 nanowires
      exhibit a pronounced photocurrent density of 0.5 mA/cm&lt;2&gt; at
      -0.2 V vs. Ag/ AgCl. The maximum photocurrent density of TiO2 :N
      nanowires is similar to that of the pristine sample, as expected.
      Significantly, both TiO2 and TiO2 :N nanowire samples showed a
      great enhancement in photocurrent after CdSe sensitization. In
      particular, the electrode with the greatest photocurrent density
      of 2.75 mA/cm&lt;2&gt; is the CdSe-TiO2:N nanowires, -showing
      almost two times enhancement compare to CdSe-TiO2 nanowires. These
      experimental observations are fully consistent with those obtained
      for TiO2 nanoparticle samples in terms of the synergistic effect
      between QD sensitization and N- doping and indicate that the
      proposed enhanced hole transfer/transport model is valid for both
      anatase and rutile TiO2 nanostructures in OD or ID. In addition,
      it is noted that the TiO2 nanowire-based photoanodes have almost
      an order of magnitude higher photocurrent density than that of the
      TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoanodes. This enhancement can be
      attributed to improved vectorial charge transport in ID structures
      and/or the increased thickness of nanowire film. Those skilled in

      As one of the most prevalent metal oxides on Earth, iron oxide,
      especially a-Fe2O3 or hematite, has been the subject of intense
      research for several decades. In particular, the combination of a
      relatively small bandgap and related visible light absorption,
      natural abundance, low cost, and stability under deleterious
      chemical conditions has made it ideal for many potential
      applications. However, the short charge carrier lifetime or
      diffusion length has limited its applicability. Nanostructures of
      hematite offer the possibility of overcoming some of the
      limitations through control of the structures and thereby its
      optical and electronic properties. In this review, we provide an
      overview of recent progress on the synthesis and characterization
      of nanostructured hematite, with an emphasis on the charge carrier
      dynamics and photoelectrochemical properties. Both current
      challenges and future opportunities are also discussed.<br>
