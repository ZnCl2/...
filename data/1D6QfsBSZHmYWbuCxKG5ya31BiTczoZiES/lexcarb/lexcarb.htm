      <p><b>Development of On-Board Water Recovery Unit for the Future
          Combat System (FCS), HMMWV and the Tactical Quiet Generator</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Executive Summary</b> </p>
      <p>The primary goal is to develop a fully integrated and automated
        prototype system for the collection, purification and storage of
        potable water from the exhaust gases of military land vehicles.
        A heat exchanger &amp; refrigeration system is used to recover
        water generated during the combustion process. The system is
        designed to operate under desert conditions. A mesoscale heat
        exchanger is under development at MesoSystems, Inc. This unit
        would be smaller than conventional heat exchangers and could
        eventually fit in the wheel arch of the HMMWV. The water cleanup
        is performed using a purification train under development
        consisting of an ultra-high efficiency glass fiber filter,
        activated carbon and carbon fiber, zeolites and ion exchange
        resins. The water purification canister design is challenging
        since the water contains a mixture of organic and inorganic
        acidic compounds. Currently, the water meets drinking water
        standards with a TOC of &lt; 2 ppm and in most cases is less
        than 0.5 ppm, and a metal's content below EPA regulated limits.
        Identification and removal of remaining TOC is the focus of
        current research. For comparison most municipal water supplies
        have a TOC of 2-3 ppm. </p>
      <p>The successful development of a system that produces potable
        water from vehicle exhaust and is small enough to be of military
        utility will augment a unit's water supply and reduce its
        dependence on the supply infrastructure. This will lead to a
        more mobile, deployable, and flexible force. The technology will
        also provide water to small units in water scarce environments.
        The system will provide safe, lifesaving, drinking water in
        disaster relief and emergency applications. It could also
        provide recreational vehicles in water scarce environments with
        a critical survival tool... </p>
      <p>But don't ask Jagtoyen, who can often be seen driving a red
        Hum-Vee around town, to chug a bottle of her diesel water just
        yet. There are still traces of two unidentified compounds in the
        otherwise pure water. They're probably harmless, she said, but
        so far she's only sipping. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b>&nbsp; An apparatus and method of use with
        internal combustion engines, such as used for land vehicles, for
        the on-board recovery and purification of water. The source of
        water is from the vehicle's exhaust, where it is collected by
        condensation. The water recovery system consists of a device for
        cooling the exhaust so as to condense out the water, such as a
        counter-current flow heat exchanger in combination with a
        chiller (a refrigerant-cooled heat exchanger), which cools the
        exhaust below its dew point. Exhaust condensate is collected at
        the outlet of the chiller. These cooling devices may be coupled
        with the vehicle's air conditioning system. The condensed water
        then flows through the water purification portion of the present
        invention. The water purification system can rely upon solids
        filtration and different forms of activated carbons and
        activated carbon fiber composite materials which can be used in
        combination with ion exchange resins to provide a water
        purification train which is integrated with the water recover
        unit on board the vehicle. The water can be purified to have a
        TOC of less than 2 ppm to meet EPA drinking water standards, as
        well as Department of Defense tri-service requirements for
        long-term consumption as specified in TB Med 577. Potable water
        can be produced at a rate of approximately up to 0.7
        gallons/gallon fuel utilizing a HMMWV diesel engine. This allows
        production of about 15 gallons per day of potable water on-board
        the HMMWV (based on consumption of about 30 gallons of fuel per
        day). </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for
        the recovery and purification of water from the exhaust gases of
        internal combustion engines, such as those used in land transit
        vehicles, (e.g., cars). More particularly, an on-board, portable
        device produces potable water from vehicle exhaust gases. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>Several devices have been utilized over the years to attempt to
        provide a feasible system for producing potable water from
        vehicle engine exhaust. These attempts have been generally
        unsuccessful. </p>
      <p>Combustion of diesel, kerosene, gasoline, LP gas or other
        fossil fuels in an internal combustion engine produce water
        vapor, which is expelled with the exhaust gases. The present
        invention allows for the recovery of that water to provide a
        source of water for potable and other uses. The engine exhaust
        emissions vary as a function of fuel type and composition, as
        well as the fuel:air ratio, the type of engine and mode of its
        operation, and also factors such as ignition timing, cylinder
        design and fuel additives. Although the relative concentrations
        of various exhaust components may change depending on the mode
        of engine operation, generally the nature and content of exhaust
        remains within a predictable range. It would be useful to be
        able to capture this water vapor and turn it into drinkable
        water, particularly for military operations or travel in hostile
        environments (e.g., desert areas). </p>
      <p>The concentration of water vapor in exhaust gases of either
        gasoline or diesel engines or turbines ranges up to about 10% by
        volume. Upon cooling the exhaust gases below its dew point, i.e.
        about 100.degree. F., water begins to condense. Some gases
        present in the exhaust, such as oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen,
        do not condense. The other exhaust components, such as
        hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide
        and particulates and suspended solid matter, other dissolved
        organic and inorganic matter (including metals), contaminate the
        condensed water by dissolving in or condensing with the water
        vapor and must be removed to obtain a potable water product. The
        treatment apparatus for the recovery of potable water from the
        engine exhaust must condense the water vapor, remove the
        particulates, and purify the water produced therefrom. </p>
      <p>Vehicle exhaust gases and the condensed water produced
        therefrom are very corrosive. The untreated water that is
        recovered from the exhaust has a pH of about 3 and, in
        combination with high temperatures, corrosion easily occurs in
        pits and crevices of a heat exchanger, ducting and ancillary
        equipment used to condense it. High exhaust temperatures and the
        elevated ambient temperatures that prevail under desert/arid
        conditions exacerbate the rates of chemical attack on materials.
        Hence, the selection of materials for the components is
        extremely important. </p>
      <p>Attempts to recover drinking water from exhaust gases of
        vehicles have heretofore been unsuccessful because the
        purification of the water was not considered technically and
        commercially feasible (i.e., the apparatus was too large, the
        impurities were too high and/or the process was too expensive).
      </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>In brief, the present invention relates to a method for
        recovering potable water from the exhaust gases of an internal
        combustion engine, comprising the steps of: (a) cooling said
        exhaust gases so as to cause water to condense from said gases
        (for example, utilizing heat exchangers); (b) passing said water
        through one or more particulate filters having a maximum pore
        size of from about 0.1 to about 10 microns; (c) passing said
        water through one or more activated carbon beds (a preferred one
        sequentially combining a wood-based carbon having a majority of
        pores in the range of from about 17 to about 40 .ANG., with a
        coal-based water-treatment carbon having an average pore size of
        from about 6 to about 20 .ANG.--the wood-based carbon preferably
        made by phosphoric acid activation and treated to minimize the
        amount of phosphorous released into the water); and (d) passing
        said water through one or more ion exchange resin beds (a
        preferred one being a mixed bed of highly acidic and strongly
        basic type 1 ion exchange resins with low organics and
        particulate contaminants with high cation and anion exchange
        capacity). </p>
      <p>Optionally, a buffer such as sodium bicarbonate or a base such
        as sodium hydroxide may be added to decrease water acidity. The
        sodium bicarbonate may also improve the taste of the water.
        These additions may be carried out before either the carbon
        filtration or the ion exchange resin filtration steps. </p>
      <p>This system can provide potable water having TOC less than
        about 0.5 ppm, an inorganic content less than about 2 ppm, and a
        pH between about 6 and about 8. The potable water can be
        produced at a rate of at least about 0.5 gallons of water per
        gallon of engine fuel combusted. </p>
      <p>The present invention also includes an apparatus for recovering
        potable water from the exhaust gases of an internal combustion
        engine comprising a means for connecting said apparatus to the
        exhaust portal of said engine (preferably via the catalytic
        converter); a means for cooling the exhaust gases so as to cause
        the water in said gases to condense; a means for collecting said
        water and channeling it to a purification system which comprises
        one or more particulate filters having a maximum pore size of
        from about 0.1 to about 10 microns, one or more activated carbon
        beds, and one or more ion exchange resin beds; and means for
        collecting the water which has passed through said purification
        system. </p>
      <p>More specifically, this invention relates to a portable
        apparatus and the method of recovery and purification of potable
        water from vehicle exhaust gases. Water can be produced at a
        rate of at least about 0.5 gallons/gallon of diesel using a 6.5
        liter diesel engine with a compression ratio of 21:5:1 and a
        Brake Mean Effective Pressure (BMEP) of about 300 psi, as is
        standard issue in a HUMVEE, or "HMMWV" United States armed
        forces vehicle, while having only a small (i.e. &lt;7%) effect
        upon the engine performance of the vehicle. A combination of
        particulate filtration to remove solids, treatment by activated
        carbon to remove organic compounds and some inorganics, and
        treatment by ion exchange resin to remove ionic species, provide
        effective removal of toxic and other contaminants to produce
        potable water having a purity which exceeds the EPA drinking
        water standards, as well as the DOD TB MED 577 tri-service water
        quality standards for long-term consumption. </p>
      <p>The activated carbon material used in the instant invention
        removes essentially all of the organic contaminants, even though
        some are present at concentrations in the ppb range. The water
        purification step involves passing the water condensed from the
        exhaust gases having a high concentration of Total Organic
        Carbon (TOC) materials of from about 50 to about 250 mg/L and a
        pH of about 2.8, through a particle filter and an activated
        carbon filter to obtain TOC levels in a range of from about 3 to
        about 100 mg/L. The resulting product is then passed through an
        ion exchange resin to remove metals, inorganic, acidic, and
        remaining organic contaminants. The filtered water samples have
        a TOC content below detectable limits (BDL) which is 0.5 mg/L
        for current EPA drinking water regulations and as low as 0.1
        mg/L in some instances. This is a significantly lower TOC than a
        control sample obtained from the local municipal water supply
        (2.6 mg/L). Moreover, the filtered samples did not contain any
        of the hazardous organics mentioned in the EPA's drinking water
        rules. </p>
      <p>The present invention recovers potable water from engine
        exhaust by manually or automatically diverting a desired portion
        of the exhaust gas stream to the water recovery system. The
        exhaust gas is preferably first passed through the vehicle's
        catalytic converter. The catalytic converter generally contains
        catalyst consisting of platinum metals, transition metals or
        mixtures and oxides deposited either on alumina extrusions or
        honeycomb-type monolithic supports. The catalytic converter
        needs to be at a certain temperature to completely oxidize the
        hydrocarbons present in the exhaust. This normally requires
        temperatures of from about 700.degree. to about 1200.degree. F.
      </p>
      <p>The conditions of the catalytic converter are important to the
        quality of the produced exhaust condensate. They can
        significantly affect the amount of particulates and TOC in the
        condensate. It has been determined that the lifetime of the
        catalytic converter (for purposes of this invention) is
        preferably less than about 50,000 miles, more preferably less
        than about 40,000 miles to produce water with the lowest TOC. </p>
      <p>Another important factor is the temperature inside the
        catalytic converter, which depends mainly on the operating
        conditions of the vehicle. At low speeds or low vehicle engine
        loads, the temperature in the exhaust is lower than about
        500.degree. F., which is not sufficient for the catalytic
        converter to fully oxidize the hydrocarbons present in the
        exhaust. It is preferable that the temperature be at least about
        500.degree. F., preferably at least about 600.degree. F., or
        more preferably at least about 700.degree. F. in order to
        produce exhaust condensates with as low TOC as possible. In
        order to produce the highest quality drinking water, the exhaust
        gases are passed through the catalytic converter and vented
        through a bypass valve when the temperature in the catalytic
        converter is below the desired operating range. When the
        temperature of the catalytic converter reaches its operating
        range, the bypass valve is closed and the treated exhaust gas
        flows through the catalytic converter to the water collection
        unit. </p>
      <p>The first part of the water collection unit is heat exchange.
        The heat exchangers used in the present invention can be
        manufactured from aluminum coated with Heresite, stainless steel
        (SS), inconel, ceramics, or graphite, preferably stainless
        steel, inconel or ceramic. The initial cooling generally takes
        place in either an air to gas heat exchanger or a
        counter-current gas to gas heat exchanger. For the air-gas heat
        exchange system, the exhaust gas is cooled to about 20.degree.
        F. above ambient temperature. The exhaust may then be further
        cooled in an air conditioner cooled condenser. In the most
        likely application scenario, the ambient "desert" temperature is
        above the exhaust gas dew-point. Thus, ambient air cooling alone
        will be insufficient to condense any water at all. A source of
        cooler heat exchange fluid is required and this is most
        conveniently provided by refrigerant at 30-80.degree. F., or
        more preferably 30-50.degree. F., from a typical automotive
        air-conditioning system. The non-condensable gases from the
        exhaust are vented and the condensed water is pumped or passed
        by gravity through a particle filter, activated carbon filer and
        ion exchange resin column for removal of acidic, metallic,
        inorganic and remaining organic components and is then sent to a
        storage tank where it can be disinfected if storage is required
        for prolonged periods of time. Optionally, a small amount of
        sodium bicarbonate may be added to the water before carbon or
        ion exchange filtration. This buffers the water, raising its pH
        so that it will not attack the filters, particularly the ion
        exchange resins. It may also improve the taste of the water. </p>
      <p>Key issues in putting together the water recovery system is the
        design of a system which fits in a standard vehicle and does not
        reduce significantly the efficiency of the engine, the removal
        of particulates and dissolved contaminants which affect taste
        and odor and can be hazardous to human health, the production of
        a high enough volume of water to be competitive with
        alternatives (e.g., carrying a large volume of water), and the
        ability to work in the high temperature and acidic environment
        of the exhaust system. </p>
      <p>The present invention addresses these issues and will be more
        fully understood from the following detailed description of the
        invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The process of the present invention is comprised of two parts:
        the water collection phase during which the water is condensed
        from the exhaust gases, and the water purification phase during
        which particulates, organics and other contaminants are removed
        in order to make the water potable. </p>
      <p>In the water collection phase, the hot exhaust gases are cooled
        causing the water vapor in the exhaust to condense. This may be
        accomplished by any known cooling mechanism, but is generally
        done using heat exchangers, cooled by a combination of one or
        more of the following fluids: ambient air, refrigerant e.g.
        Freon, or chilled exhaust gas. Prior to entry into the
        collection phase, the exhaust is preferably passed through the
        vehicle's catalytic converter to fully oxidize the hydrocarbons
        in the exhaust to the fullest reasonable extent. </p>
      <p>In the water purification phase, the water from the collection
        phase is treated to remove impurities and make the water
        potable. This generally is accomplished by passing the water
        through a particle filter, an activated carbon filter, and an
        ion exchange resin filter. </p>
      <p>Each of these steps will be described in detail below. </p>
      <p><b>1. Water Collection System</b> </p>
      <p>Any condensing means known in the art can be used to collect
        water from the hot exhaust gases. Two possible exemplary
        alternative mechanisms will be described for the water
        condensation system. This does not exclude other systems based
        on ceramic, graphitic, inconel or other heat exchanger-based
        systems. </p>
      <p><b>A. Exhaust Condensation by Air-Gas Heat Exchange Combined
          with Chiller</b> </p>
      <p>The estimated average temperature of the exhaust at the tail
        pipe is normally up to about 800.degree. F. The bulk of the
        cooling of the exhaust is performed in an air-cooled heat
        exchanger made either from aluminum coated with Heresite,
        stainless steel, inconel, titanium, ceramic, mesophase pitch,
        foam or graphite. The intercooler used in this example is
        normally used to cool charge air after turbo-compression in
        large truck engines. The particular intercooler used in these
        experiments may be obtained, for example, from Thermal Control
        Technologies Corporation of Prescott, Ariz., but can also be
        obtained from a range of manufacturers. The intercooler core is
        35.5" wide and 30.75" high and has a thickness of 2". It
        consists of aluminum rectangular section tubing with finned
        inserts both on the process and service sides. This core is
        modified to reduce corrosion by coating with Heresite, a
        commercial process which results in a phenolic resin coating
        that is only thousandths of an inch thick and has only a minimal
        effect on heat transfer. Two 16" diameter 12 volt DC fans pull
        ambient air at up to 6,000 scfm through the intercooler. This
        heat exchanger cools the exhaust gases down to within about
        50.degree. F., and usually within about 20.degree. F., of
        ambient temperature, which may be below the dew point of the
        gas. If further cooling is necessary (e.g., in a desert
        environment), the exhaust gases are further cooled by
        refrigeration, utilizing the engine-driven compressor from the
        vehicle's air conditioning system (see below). The water is
        collected in a container, which may optionally contain a
        demister to prevent fine aerosol water droplets from escaping
        with the exhaust air. These components can, for example, be
        mounted on the rear bed of a HMMVW vehicle. </p>
      <p>As described above, a chiller, i.e. another heat exchanger, is
        optionally mounted after the intercooler. One such chiller is a
        GM Van Rear AC Chiller #1254-3631 which can be installed inside
        the water collection vessel to save space. The chiller is sealed
        in the inlet to the vessel so that all exhaust gases must pass
        the Heresite-coated fins, allowing more cooling of the exhaust
        gases. The coolant is piped from the front of the vehicle to the
        rear into the chiller via flexible lines installed under the
        vehicle along the frame rails and entering the bed of the
        vehicle through a hole cut into the floor. Optionally, thermal
        insulation can be added to the chiller vessel. Also optionally,
        a fan shroud can be added to cover the outlet air side of the
        intercooler in order to duct the colder air exiting from the
        second fan down to the hot end of the intercooler. FIG. 1 shows
        a schematic of an on-board water recovery unit utilizing an
        air-to-air heat exchanger in combination with a chiller to
        recover exhaust condensate. </p>
      <p>In the Figures, T denotes a temperature sensor and P denotes a
        pressure sensor in the apparatus used to carry out the present
        invention. These pressure and temperature sensors are used to
        monitor the process of the present invention on an ongoing basis
        to optimize its performance. </p>
      <p>A fan may be used to suck air into the heat exchanger.
        Moreover, a duct may be placed at a forward or elevated position
        of the vehicle in order to capture air which has not been
        subjected to engine heat. </p>
      <p><b>B. Exhaust Condensation by Gas-Gas Counter-Current Flow Heat
          Exchanger Using Chilled Exhaust as Cooling Medium</b> </p>
      <p>An alternative system for water recovery includes a
        counter-current flow heat exchanger, which uses the
        chiller-cooled exhaust as cooling medium. This heat exchanger
        can be manufactured in stainless steel (particularly 304 SS),
        inconel, titanium, ceramic or graphite. If it utilizes narrow
        (&lt;1 mm) meso channels and ultra thin walls (&lt;0.1 mm), it
        may be small enough to install under the vehicle or in a wheel
        arch because it does not need a supply of cool ambient air (as
        opposed to the air-gas exchanger described above). This does not
        preclude the desirability of additional heat loss by locating
        the exchanger in a cool area or by the use of a small amount of
        fan-blown ambient air. </p>
      <p><b>FIG. 2</b> shows a schematic for a water recovery system
        including a counter-current flow heat exchanger. </p>
      <p>Refrigerating the exhaust gas already cooled to near ambient
        temperature and having a relatively high water vapor partial
        pressure is extremely attractive. For example, cooling the
        exhaust gases to around 100.degree. F. involves a heat exchange
        of around 50 kW (e.g., cooling from 600.degree. F. to
        100.degree. F.), and possibly no condensation at all if the dew
        point was 100.degree. F. A further extraction of 5 kW would drop
        the temperature such that about 15 lbs/hr of water would
        condense, i.e. a consequent massive increase in the efficiency
        of the water recovery unit. Moreover, the use of a cooler can
        reduce the size of the heat exchanger. The compressor and its
        associated condenser may be shared with the vehicle's air
        conditioning system or be an independent system. The compressor
        can be driven by the engine of the vehicle and a switch can be
        installed to control the compressor and maintain it in the
        activated position whenever water recovery is desired to be
        maximized. </p>
      <p>An important consideration in selecting a heat exchanger is the
        material of construction. Aluminum is inexpensive but if coated
        with Heresite should not be used with temperatures exceeding
        about 450.degree. F. Stainless steel is heavier and more
        expensive but provides the durable corrosion resistant material
        desired. Other alternatives include producing a heat exchanger
        from ceramics; one such example is a unit similar to those used
        in catalytic converters, although they need to be rendered
        impermeable. Other possibilities include inconel, titanium or
        graphitic foams. </p>
      <p><b>2. Water Purification System</b> </p>
      <p>The collected water is filtered in several treatment stages,
        which can be arranged in a purification train. The first stage
        involves filtration of particulates from the exhaust condensate
        using material having an appropriate maximum pore size (e.g.,
        from about 0.1 to about 10 microns, preferably from about 2 to
        about 10 microns), for example, glass fiber paper having a pore
        size of from about 1 to about 10 microns. Millipore micron
        filters with 0.1 micron average pore size made, for example, of
        Teflon.RTM. can also be used. These will have a slower flow rate
        than the glass fiber paper filters. </p>
      <p>The second stage involves adsorption of organics and some
        inorganics onto a bed of activated carbon. The carbon can be
        either granular activated carbon (GAC), activated carbon fibers,
        or composites of activated carbon granules and/or activated
        carbon fibers. Another form of carbon may be a composite or
        block of activated carbon containing granular or powdered carbon
        with a binder. Yet another option is to utilize an activated
        carbon fiber composite containing powdered activated carbon
        immobilized within the structure. These materials will prevent
        bed movement during operation. Examples of such carbon materials
        are disclosed in PCT Published Application No. WO 00/04977,
        Jagtoyen et al., published Feb. 3, 2000, incorporated herein by
        reference. </p>
      <p>The activated carbon adsorbent is an important component of the
        present invention. The main portion of the acidic compounds and
        other organic compounds are removed by the activated carbon.
        "The carbon must have a wide range of pore size distribution;
        one way to do that is by using two different adsorbent
        carbons."One carbon is, for example, a coal-based granular
        activated carbon sold commercially for water treatment. The main
        porosity is due to pores having an average pore size of from
        about 6 to about 20 .ANG.. The second carbon bed contains wide
        pores (mesopores) to remove large organics. This carbon has some
        narrow micropores in the range of from about 6 to about 12
        .ANG., and significant mesoporosity with pores of from about 17
        to about 40 .ANG., and some wider mesopores in the about 40-120
        .ANG. range. These numbers are based on pore size distribution
        analysis by N2 adsorption using the Density Functional Theory
        (DFT). This carbon can be, for example, a wood-based carbon made
        by phosphoric acid activation. "A carbon found to be useful in
        the present invention is a Westvaco carbon that was treated so
        that it does not release too much phosphorus into the water." </p>
      <p>An alternative would be to use an activated carbon fiber
        composite for the water treatment instead of the coal-based
        carbon. This material has an open and permeable structure and
        can be produced in single pieces to a given size and shape. The
        activated composite can be made from isotropic pitch-derived
        carbon fibers and exhibits novel properties including rapid rate
        of adsorption and desorption, the ability to form specific
        shapes of high permeability and strength. </p>
      <p>The open structure of the composites combined with the
        presentation of the reactive surfaces for adsorption or
        catalysis in the form of narrow diameter fibers allows direct
        access of the contacting fluid with minimal mass transfer
        limitations, and very high rates of adsorption, desorption and
        reaction. The contaminant removal is better than commercially
        available filters for many compounds, particularly small organic
        compounds, and the activated carbon filter also is uniquely
        effective in that it removes waterborne pathogens with
        efficiencies of 99.99% or better. This filter is described in
        PCT Published Application WO 00/04977,Jagtoyen, et al.,
        published Feb. 3, 2000. The carbon filters generally have a
        minimum surface area of at least about 1000 m.sup.2 /g. </p>
      <p>Another form of carbon may be a composite or block of activated
        carbon containing granular or powdered carbon with a binder or
        resin-based carbons. Yet another option is to utilize an
        activated carbon fiber composite containing powdered activated
        carbon immobilized within the structure. There will be no bed
        movement during operation for the composites, hence no loss of
        fines, degradation and potential for increased pressure drops in
        the system over time. </p>
      <p>Yet another type of carbon can be a surface-treated carbon
        particularly optimized to remove polar organics from water. </p>
      <p>In a preferred embodiment, an effective amount of sodium
        bicarbonate is added to the condensate to counteract its
        acidity. This may be done at any point in the process but is
        preferably done prior to the carbon filtration step. The sodium
        bicarbonate acts to buffer the water and to improve its taste. </p>
      <p>The third stage is filtration through a bed of ion exchange
        resin. A mixed bed of cation and anion resins can be used to
        remove the inorganic contaminants, remaining organic compounds
        that are polar in nature, acids, nitrates and metals. The ion
        exchange resin bed removes all the detectable inorganic and
        metal contaminants to below detectable limits. The resin is
        preferably a mixed bed of strongly acidic and strongly basic
        type 1 ion-exchange resins. They are of the ultimate purity in
        terms of organics leaching and particulate contaminants. A
        preferred ion exchange resin is Amberlite UP6040.RTM.,
        commercially available from Rohm &amp; Haas. In sample runs, the
        flow rate through the resin was about 217 ml/min, which is about
        42 bed volumes per hour. It is preferred that the flow rate
        through the water purification system be from about 30 to about
        50 bed volumes/hr. </p>
      <p>A particulate filter is optionally added at the end of the
        purification train to capture any carbon fines created during
        filtration. Optionally, the water can be filtered through
        another activated carbon fiber composite filter. Moreover, the
        ion exchange resin can be sandwiched between two layers of
        activated carbon filter composite material utilizing the
        structural integrity of the composite to support the ion
        exchange resin to prevent channeling and abrasion forming a
        monolithic cartridge. Another option is to add a polymeric
        pre-filter to remove oily compounds. Addition of sodium
        hydroxide or sodium bicarbonate (or other non-toxic basic salts)
        before any filtration in order to neutralize the water is a
        possibility. Zeolites or clays or activated alumina can be used
        to remove some acids and inorganics. After the purification is
        complete, the water is stored in a 5-15 gallon container which
        may or may not contain disinfectants Conventional disinfectants
        (such as chlorine or mixed oxidants like the MIOX system) can be
        used at their art-established levels. </p>
      <p>The water produced by the present invention is potable,
        satisfying the following maximum impurity levels: TOC of no
        greater than 2 ppm, and EPA drinking water standards for all
        organic and inorganic compounds and metals. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLES</b> </p>
      <p>The following examples illustrate the process and apparatus of
        the present invention. </p>
      <p>Exhaust condensate was produced while driving a 1994
        civilian-equipped Hummer, modified to practice the present
        invention, using an intercooler coated with Heresite as heat
        exchanger in combination with a chiller to condense water from
        the exhaust. Data from different water production runs are shown
        in Table 1. The average condensate yield was about 0.5 gallons
        per gallon of fuel. A large sample of condensate which was
        produced while driving at 60 mph, and had a TOC of 58.6 mg/L,
        was used as the raw water for the water purification studies
        reported below. </p>
      <p>An example of a water purification train consisted of
        particulate filters, two different granular carbons and one ion
        exchange resin filter. </p>
      <p>The condensate was first filtered through laminated glass fiber
        paper (maximum pore size 2 micron) which removed on average 55
        ppm of solids. A 0.1 micron filter was used for polishing,
        although this may not be required. Refiltering one batch through
        a 0.1 micron filter removed less than 0.01 ppm solids. </p>
      <p>C33 (Coal-based GAC): This bed was made using coal-based
        activated carbon from the Calgon Corporation. The condensate was
        run through the column at a flow rate of 20 ml/min or 3.7 column
        volumes per hour. After 0.7 gallons, the TOC was reduced to 8.1
        mg/L. The TOC remained between 7 and 8 mg/L, up to 9.4 gallons.
        At 10.8 gallons, the TOC increased to 9.9 mg/L. After another
        1.4 gallons, the TOC had dropped to 5.3 mg/L and remained low
        for the rest of the treatment. </p>
      <p>C34 (Wood-based GAC): After the water was purified through the
        C33 bed, it was ran through the wood-based GAC bed at 13 ml/min
        or 2 bed volumes per hour. When this carbon was used after the
        Calgon carbon (C33), it dropped the TOC down to 3.0 mg/L after
        1.3 gallons. When C34 was used after a combination of C33, R11
        and R12 (discussed later), the TOC was reduced from 3.2 to 1.5
        mg/L after 0.5 gallons and 2.4 mg/L after 0.8 gallons. </p>
      <p>R11 (Ionac A-554 resin from Sybron Chemicals, Inc.): This resin
        is designed to remove nitrogen compounds. When used after C33,
        this resin actually increased the TOC from 5.3 mg/L to 7.4 mg/L
        after only 1.3 gallons. But when used after C33 and C34, it had
        no effect on the TOC (the beginning TOC was 3.0 mg/L and the
        ending TOC was 2.8 mg/L). </p>
      <p>R12 (Resin from Rohm &amp; Haas): This resin, when used after
        the carbon filtration (with or without R11), removes the
        remaining contaminants from the condensate. The column height
        was 24" and column diameter 1". The flow rate through the bed
        was 218 ml/min or 42 bed volumes per hour. The optimum flow rate
        for the resin can range from about 1-50 bed volumes per hour. </p>
      <p>When R12 was used after the C33-C34 combination, it dropped the
        TOC from 3.0 mg/L to less than the detection limit of 0.5 mg/L
        (estimated to be 0.1 mg/L by the instrument). When R12 was used
        again after the combination of C33C34R12C34, it reduced the TOC
        to 0.6 mg/L. After the combination of C33C34R11, the TOC was
        reduced to less than the detection limit of 0.5 mg/L (estimated
        to be 0.3 mg/L by the instrument). </p>

      <p>Good results were achieved by using a combination of the two
        carbon beds and the Rohm &amp; Haas ion exchange resin column,
        C33OC34DR12E (referred to as C33E herein). This sample had a TOC
        of only 0.1 ppm, a pH of 6.8 and conductivity of only 6.1, Table
        2. The other sample was purified through both carbon beds and
        both resin beds, and had a TOC of 0.3 ppm (C33C from now on). It
        is likely that the second resin bed gave off TOC to the water.
        The pH of the water is close to neutral at 6.8 and the
        conductivity is very low, 7.5 .mu.S/cm. There appears to be a
        correlation between small amounts of TOC and conductivity. Based
        on these preliminary data, it is believed that conductivity can
        be used as a sensor for water purity, as well as an indicator of
        breakthrough on the ion exchange resin bed. </p>

      <p>The highest purity sample C33E was submitted for trace organics
        analysis (Chemir Labs, Saint Louis, Mo. and EDG, Lexington,
        Ky.), to identify the nature of the 0.1 ppm of organic compounds
        left in the water. </p>
      <p>ESI MS and GC/MS: The first analytical technique used was
        Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (ESI MS) in both the
        positive and negative ion modes. Positive ion ESI MS produced an
        ion series consistent with the presence of a small amount of
        polymer with a separation between the ions of 76 amu. Negative
        ion ESI did not produce any ions above background. </p>
      <p>The second technique used was GC/MS, using a solid phase
        microextractor (SPME) probe to concentrate the analytes before
        injection. The analysis indicates the presence of toluene
        (retention time .about.3.2 min) and 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (5.25
        min). These compounds are present when the sample analysis is
        compared to a blank consisting of Millipore purified water. The
        components are present in very small amounts, and appear to be
        present in smaller quantities than were observed for the
        previous analysis. </p>
      <p>GC/MS Analysis: This resolves the sample components based on
        volatility, and MS detects and identifies the components. Sample
        components that interact less with the stationary phase spend
        less time in the chromatographic column. In MS, the resolved
        sample components are ionized and separated in a mass analyzer.
        The fragmentation pattern of a sample component and its computer
        library match enables sample identification. </p>

        <b>Abstract ---</b> A process for recovering potable water from
        the exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine is disclosed.
        In this process the exhaust gases are cooled causing water to
        condense out, and the water formed is passed through particulate
        filters, activated carbon filters and ion exchange resin
        filters. In this process, the water is treated to reduce the
        levels of nitrates, sulfates, acidic and other organic
        components therein (for example, by passing it through a flow
        through capacitor) before the water is passed through the ion
        exchange resins. The apparatus for practicing this process is
        also disclosed. </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b> </p>
      <p>[0003] The present invention relates to an apparatus and method
        for the recovery and purification of water from the exhaust
        gases of internal combustion engines, such as those used in land
        transit vehicles. More particularly, an on-board, portable
        device produces potable water from vehicle exhaust gases. More
        particularly, the present application deals with the
        purification of the water formed using a flow through capacitor
        to assist in the removal of metals, inorganics and TOC. </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0004] The present invention allows for the recovery of water
        from exhaust gases of internal combustion engines, such as those
        found in military vehicles, cars, jeeps and all-terrain
        vehicles. The goal is to provide a source of water for drinking
        and for other uses, for example, for army troops in the field or
        campers in a wilderness area. The composition of engine exhaust
        emissions vary as a function of fuel type and content, as well
        as the fuel:air ratio, the type of engine and mode of its
        operation, and factors such as ignition timing, cylinder design
        and fuel additives. Although the relative concentrations of
        various exhaust components may change depending on the mode of
        engine operation, generally the nature and content of exhaust
        remains within a predictable range. It would be useful to be
        able to capture the water vapor found in engine exhaust and turn
        it into drinkable water, particularly for military operations or
        travel in hostile environments (e.g., desert areas). </p>
      <p>[0005] The concentration of water vapor in exhaust gases of
        either gasoline or diesel engines or turbines ranges up to about
        10% by volume. Upon cooling the exhaust gases below its dew
        point, i.e., about 100.degree. F., water begins to condense from
        the exhaust. Some gases present in the exhaust, such as oxygen,
        nitrogen and hydrogen, do not condense. The other exhaust
        components, such as hydrocarbons, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
        oxides, carbon dioxide and particulates and suspended solid
        matter, and other dissolved organic and inorganic matter
        (including metals), contaminate the condensed water by
        dissolving in or condensing with the water vapor and must be
        removed to obtain a potable water product. The treatment
        apparatus for the recovery of potable water from the engine
        exhaust must condense the water vapor, remove the particulates,
        and purify the water produced therefrom, and do this in an
        efficient and effective way. </p>
      <p>[0006] Vehicle exhaust gases and the condensed water produced
        therefrom are very corrosive. The untreated water that is
        recovered from exhaust gases generally has a pH of from about 1
        to about 3 and, in a high temperature environment, corrosion
        easily occurs in pits and crevices of heat exchangers, ducting
        and ancillary equipment used to condense it, as well as the
        various materials, such as the ion exchange resins, used to
        purify the water. High exhaust temperatures and the elevated
        ambient temperatures that prevail under desert/arid conditions
        exacerbate the rates of chemical attack on materials. Hence, the
        selection of appropriate materials for the
        condensation/purification components can be extremely important.
      </p>
      <p>[0007] A method and apparatus for recovering potable water from
        the exhaust gases of an internal combustion engine is described
        in our earlier International Patent Application WO 02/059043 A2,
        published Aug. 1, 2002, and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,581,375, Jagtoyen
        and Kimber, issued Jun. 24, 2003, both incorporated herein by
        reference. The method disclosed comprises the steps of: </p>
      <p>[0008] (a) cooling said exhaust gases so as to cause water to
        condense from them (for example, utilizing heat exchangers); </p>
      <p>[0009] (b) passing said water through one or more particulate
        filters having a maximum pore size of from about 0.1 to about 10
        microns; </p>
      <p>[0010] (c) passing said water through one or more activated
        carbon beds or monolithic activated carbon (a preferred one
        sequentially combining a wood-based carbon having a majority of
        pores in the range of from about 17 to about 40 .ANG., with a
        coal-based water-treatment carbon having an average pore size of
        from about 6 to about 20 .ANG.--the wood-based carbon preferably
        made by phosphoric acid activation and treated to minimize the
        amount of phosphorous released into the water); and </p>
      <p>[0011] (d) passing said water through one or more ion exchange
        resin beds (preferred resins being a mixed bed of highly acidic
        and strongly basic Type 1 ion exchange resins and/or mixed bed
        resins exhibiting ultra-low leaching of organics, such as those
        made for the semiconductor industry, with low organics and
        particulate contaminants having high cation and anion exchange
        capacity). The order in which steps (c) and (d) are carried out
        can also be reversed. </p>
      <p>[0012] The present invention provides an improvement on the
        process and apparatus disclosed in that patent application. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>

        cooling the exhaust gases so as to cause water in said gases to
        condense; a means for collecting said water and channeling it to
        a purification system which comprises one or more particulate

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>[0021] The present invention is an improvement over the process
        (and apparatus) described in International Patent Application WO
        02/059043, published Aug. 1, 2002, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,581,375,
        Jagtoyen and Kimber, issued Jun. 24, 2003, both incorporated
        herein by reference. In that process, the exhaust gases from the
        internal combustion engine are cooled so as to cause the water
        vapor contained in those gases to condense; the water formed is
        passed through one or more particulate filters having a maximum
        pore size of from about 0.1 to about 10 microns; the water is
        passed through one or more ion exchange resin beds; and the
        water is passed through one or more activated carbon beds. The
        water may also, as a final step, be passed through a polishing
        bed comprising carbon particulate filters. That invention also
        includes an apparatus for recovery of potable water from exhaust
        gases of an internal combustion engine comprising a means for
        connecting said apparatus to the exhaust portal of said engine
        (preferably via the catalytic converter); a means for cooling
        the exhaust gases so as to cause the water in those gases to
        condense; a means for collecting the water and channeling it to
        a purification system which comprises one or more particulate
        filters having a maximum pore size of from about 0.1 to about 10
        microns, one or more activated carbon beds, and one or more ion
        exchange resin beds; and means for collecting the water which
        has passed through said purification system. </p>
      <p>[0022] In the present improvement, the acidic and ionic
        components, such as sulfates and nitrates, as well as metals and
        organics, are removed from the condensed water prior to the time
        that the water is introduced into the ion exchange resins. It
        was found that the presence of sulfates and nitrates in the
        untreated condensate was causing problems over time.
        Specifically, the corrosive nature of the untreated exhaust
        condensate caused oxidation and degradation of the ion exchange
        resins and other components of the purification system, with a
        resulting leaching of organic compounds from the ion exchange
        resin into the treated water. In the process of the present
        invention, ionic components, such as sulfates and nitrates, are
        removed from the condensed water. The process may also remove
        acidic and polar organic compounds. The net result of this
        removal is that the ionic conductivity of the condensed water is
        reduced from about 700-1000 micro S/cm to about 10-50 micro
        S/cm. It is preferred that the treated condensed water have an
        ionic conductivity of from about 10 to about 80, more preferably
        from about 10 to about 50, most preferably from about 10 to
        about 30, micro S/cm. </p>
      <p>[0023] One way of accomplishing the removal of these ionic
        compounds is through the use of a flow through capacitor (FTC).
        Flow through capacitors are known in the art and are
        commercially available from Biosource Inc. They are described,
        for example, in the following U.S. patents, which are all
        incorporated herein by reference: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,192,432,
        Andelman, issued Mar. 9, 1993; 5,196,115, Andelman, issued Mar.
        23, 1993; 5,200,068, Andelman, issued Apr. 6, 1993; and
        5,360,540, Andelman, issued Nov. 1, 1994. Generally, the flow
        rate through the capacitor will be from about 0.1 to about 2 lpm
        (preferably about 500 ml/min), the current in the capacitor is
        from about 7 to about 11 A, and the voltage is between about 1.2
        and about 1.5 V. </p>
      <p>[0024] Another technology that may be useful in treatment of
        the condensate is electrochemical treatment where a voltage of
        12-18 V at 2-4 A is applied to electrodes immersed in the water
        (i.e., an electrochemical cell). Powerful oxidizing agents are
        produced without the addition of chemicals. Most kinds of
        organic contaminants present in aqueous effluents are destroyed
        or oxidatively degraded. BOD, COD, TOC, odor, color,
        microorganisms, or other parameters indicative of the presence
        of organic contaminants can be reduced to the ppb level or
        lower. </p>
      <p>[0025] Reverse osmosis, a process well known in the art, may
        also be used to treat the condensate. </p>
      <p>[0026] The removal of acidic and ionic components from the
        condensate will render the water less corrosive before it enters
        the ion exchange resin bed. By removing the sulfates, nitrates
        and organic acids prior to running it through the ion exchange
        resin bed, corrosion to the bed will be minimized. An additional
        benefit of this process is the potential to remove ionic
        contaminants from surface waters and sea water, allowing the use
        of these as alternative water sources for the purification
        system disclosed herein. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE</b> </p>
      <p>[0027] The following example illustrates the process and
        apparatus of the present invention. </p>
      <p>[0028] The internal combustion engine exhaust utilized in this
        example was produced while driving a 1994 civilian-equipped
        Hummer, modified to practice the present invention, which
        included a heat exchanger to condense the water from the exhaust
        gases (manufactured by NSM Corporation, England). The water
        purification train of the present invention consisted of
        particulate filters, a flow through capacitor, two different
        granular carbon filters and one ion exchange resin filter. </p>
      <p>[0029] The condensate was first filtered through laminated
        glass fiber paper (maximum pore size 2 microns), which acted as
        a particulate filter, removing an average of 55 ppm of solids.
        The glass fiber paper was manufactured by Hollingsworth and
        Vose. </p>
      <p>[0030] The condensate was carbon-treated prior to introduction
        into the flow through capacitor (FTC) to remove neutral organics
        that can foul the membranes and electrodes of the FTC. The
        carbon filter materials utilized were selected based on two main
        criteria: high hardness and wide pore size distribution. In this
        example, two different carbons were used. The first was
        coal-based carbon F300 from Calgon, which has high hardness and
        high density and, as a result, exhibits high capacity for
        organic removal from water. The second carbon utilized has a
        relatively wide pore size distribution and is a wood-based
        carbon, such as RGC from Westvaco. This carbon is used to remove
        large molecular weight organics as well as some polar organics
        that coal-based carbons with less functionality do not remove as
        well. The carbon materials were packed sequentially in a 2-inch
        diameter, 10-inch tall SS bed operating in an up-flow mode. The
        flow rate through the bed was 22 ml/min, which is equivalent to
        about 150-200 ml/min in a full size bed (which would be able to
        treat more than 2 gallons of water/hour). The results of the
        carbon treatment are shown in Tables 1 and 2 and FIG. 1. The TOC
        of the condensate water is lowered by this procedure from a
        starting TOC of about 50-80 ppm to below about 20-30 ppm, i.e.,
        most of the nonpolar organics and some polar organics are
        removed. </p>

      <p>[0032] A flow through capacitor (FTC), produced by Biosource,
        Inc., was used in this example. The flow through capacitor
        consists of two electrodes: one positive and one negative.
        Charged compounds are absorbed on the electrodes, and when the
        capacitor has reached saturation it is discharged. The absorbed
        ions are desorbed and form a waste stream that is discarded. For
        this application, the capacitor should be optimized to have a
        waste stream that comprises less than about 5% of the water
        treated. The FTC can remove impurities like metals and sulfates
        and nitrates from water by flowing it over a charged electrode.
        The capacitor will remove and hold contaminants from influent
        condensate when it is appropriately charged. The effluent
        condensate is thereby purified. At some point during the
        process, depending upon the flow rate and quality of the
        incoming stream, the FTC will saturate with impurities and
        become ineffective. The impurities must then be discharged in a
        separate effluent waste stream by turning off the surface
        charge. The polarity of each electrode can be reversed every
        cycle to prevent fouling of the electrode. A preferred FTC unit
        is one which is self-regulating for time on line and time for
        regeneration of the electrodes in order to obtain water of a
        predefined purity. </p>
      <p>[0033] In this example, Sample W174, exhaust condensate from a
        titanium cross-flow heat exchanger, was treated with the
        Biosource FTC. Because of potential problems with TOC
        accumulating on the capacitor electrode, this condensate was
        treated with carbon (as described above), before it was run
        through the capacitor. The total condensate volume treated for
        W174 was about 3 gallons. The TOC concentration in the purified
        water after different treatment stages is shown in FIG. 1. The
        TOC of the condensate before carbon treatment was 49 ppm. The
        carbon treatment reduces the TOC to 18-34 ppm, by removing all
        nonpolar and some of the polar organics. </p>
      <p>[0034] The next stage is treatment with the Biosource FTC to
        remove nitrates, sulfates, metals, inorganics and polar
        organics. This was achieved by rejecting a waste stream rich in
        the polar contaminants. The water was flowed through the
        capacitor at a flow rate of about 350 ml/min, the voltage was
        about 40 V, and the current varied between about 1 and about 40
        amps. The yield of purified water was 92% in this experiment,
        i.e., about 8% of the water enriched in contaminants was
        rejected. </p>
      <p>[0035] The water was resin treated and carbon treated again at
        the end to remove any organics leaching from the ion exchange
        resin bed. A 1-micron filter was used at the end to filter out
        any fines created during the filtration process. The TOC of the
        final sample ranged from 0.6-2.9 ppm after 3 gallons of
        condensate was purified with polishing beds of carbon and resin
        (see FIG. 1). By using the capacitor, the water yield was
        reduced by 8%, but the size of the water purification canisters
        in the apparatus will also be reduced significantly, and the
        problem of dissolution of the binder in the ion exchange resin
        is avoided as a result of removing the sulfates and nitrates at
        an early stage in the process. </p>
      <p>[0036] A second capacitor with Teflon.RTM. membranes
        (Biosource, Inc.) was tested to determine if it was more
        resistant to the acidic environment of the exhaust condensate
        (flow rate.apprxeq.300 ml/min; capacitor charge=7-10 A and 1.2
        V). Water condensate samples W177 and W185 were both treated in
        this capacitor. The TOC of the starting condensate and the
        purified water are shown in Tables 1 and 2. A total of 2.5
        gallons of W177 were treated. For sample W185, 3 gallons were
        treated. The TOC content of the water was not reduced
        significantly, only 1-2 ppm, using this cell (see Tables 1 and
        2), suggesting that the earlier data where TOC was lowered could
        be partially due to retention on the cell, or that the operation
        of the cell was such that it was not in balance, i.e., too
        little time was allowed for regeneration so that TOC was
        accumulating at the electrodes. </p>
      <p>[0037] The capacitor removed the nitrates, sulfates and metals
        to below detectable limits (BDL), as can be seen in Table 3. The
        nitrate and sulfate content of the raw condensate was 0.6 and 72
        ppm, respectively, and after treatment with the capacitor the
        nitrates were below 0.02 ppm and sulfates were below 0.2 ppm.
        All metals were removed to BDL, except for trace levels of
        sodium, silica, iron and calcium, none of which are hazardous
        and all of which would be removed by the ion exchange resin
        downstream. Since the capacitor is so efficient in removing the
        inorganics and metals, the size of the ion exchange resin bed
        can be significantly reduced. </p>

      <p>[0038] Jet fuel, such as JP8, may be used as a fuel in the
        HMMWV engine. The resulting condensate is more acidic that
        condensates made from commercial diesel fuel with pH ranging
        from 1.7-2.3 for JP8, and 2-2.3 for diesel. This is due to the
        higher sulfur content in JP8. The sulfur content of JP8 fuel can
        be as high as 3000 ppm, while in diesel it is about 500 ppm. In
        the examples given below, the sulfur content was 1620 ppm
        resulting in a condensate pH of 1.7-2.3. The high acidity does
        affect ion exchange resin performance. The resin performance is
        degraded due to the acidic condensate resulting in higher TOCs
        than previously seen in the purified water. </p>
      <p>[0039] Based on previous data, a flow through capacitor was
        designed for exhaust condensate purification. This capacitor was
        optimized to only deliver high quality water of a certain
        conductivity (in the range 20-80 micro S/cm) while maintaining a
        high yield of purified water. The results from water
        purification studies with JP8 fuel have been excellent when
        using the capacitor as part of the water purification. </p>
      <p>[0040] Two different exhaust condensates (W371 and W374) were
        purified with the resin/carbon filtration system, described
        above and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,481,375. In separate runs, the same
        condensates were pretreated with the capacitor prior to the
        resin/carbon treatment. The data from the capacitor runs are
        shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, and the results of the water
        purification study in Table 4. </p>

      <p><b>Description of Capacitor Operation</b> </p>
      <p>[0041] The basic operation of the capacitor in the present
        invention is as follows. The capacitor cycling starts with a
        change in polarity where water is pumped into the spacer. Then
        the concentration cycle starts and lasts for 150 seconds where
        polar compounds are migrating toward the electrode. The current
        starts out at about 30 A and drops to about 5 A during the
        concentration cycle. The voltage stays constant at 1.2 V. The
        pump comes on and diverts high conductivity waste to the waste
        tube and then the polarity is reversed and the pure water starts
        flowing as soon as it meets the required conductivity level. </p>
      <p>[0042] Purification cycle: current=6-10 A; voltage=1.2 V </p>
      <p>[0043] Concentration cycle: current=30 A drops to 5 A;
        voltage=1.2 V </p>
      <p>[0044] Waste cycle: current=6-10 A; voltage=1.2 V </p>
      <p>[0045] In structuring the capacitor cell for use in the present
        invention, the waste water can be recycled for purification in
        order to obtain total water yields of 90-95%. A conductivity
        probe can be used to monitor conductivity in the incoming
        stream, the purified stream and the waste stream, and the waste
        can be rejected only when it exceeds a defined limit set to
        achieve purification yields of 95% or greater. In this way, only
        water that meets a certain conductivity standard would be
        allowed to pass through to the next purification step. After
        treatment of a particular sample by the capacitor, that sample
        had a conductivity of 30-50 microS/cm. The pH of the sample was
        still around 5-6, suggesting that there were still acidic
        organics in the water since all the nitrates and sulfates had
        been removed. In that case, the condensate was treated with a
        base ion exchange resin, for example UP 4000 from Rohm and Haas,
        before treatment with the high purity, low TOC leaching resin,
        in this case UP 6040, from Rohm and Haas (SMT 2001 from
        Mitsubishi gives similar results). The condensate may then be
        carbon treated. The final TOC content of the samples varied from
        0.2 ppm to as high as 5 ppm. </p>
