      A University of Alberta research team has discovered that
      technology commonly used to decontaminate food industry equipment
      can also rid meat processing plants of lethal microbial material
      responsible for the human version of the ailment Mad Cow disease.<br>
      <br>
      U of A microbiology professors Mike Belosevic and Norm Neumann and
      engineering professor Mohamed Gamal El-Din demonstrated that
      infectious proteins found in the brain matter of cattle can be
      eradicated from water treated with ozone.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery could have applications in decontaminating
      wastewater in settings such as slaughterhouse effluents where
      infected neural material known as prions may be present.<br>
      <br>
      Cases of human transmission of infectious prions through surgical
      equipment have also been documented. The ozone decontamination
      procedure can potentially be used to sterilize instruments used
      for neurosurgery, and prevent the transfer of infectious prions
      during surgical procedures.<br>
      <br>
      Prions have been identified as source of Mad Cow and Chronic
      Wasting disease in animals. The human variants or these conditions
      are Creutzfeld-Jakob disease and Alzheimer's disease. Prions are
      found in the brain and spinal cord tissue of infected animals and
      are a grave health risk in human and animal settings.<br>
      <br>
      Prions are able to destroy and can still be infectious after being
      incinerated at heats of 850°C. In the wild, soil contaminated by a
      carcass of a deer that died of Chronic Wasting Disease can remain
      a source of infection for many years.<br>
      <br>
      The U of A research team's technique of using water treated with
      ozone to destroy prions is an improvement on current prion
      decontamination methods.<br>

      (Edmonton) When it comes to infectious agents, it doesn’t get much
      worse than prions. These misfolded proteins are highly resistant
      to a wide variety of extreme disinfectant procedures. They have
      been identified as the culprits behind mad cow disease and chronic
      wasting disease in animals and humans, and are also implicated in
      Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other prion-related disorders.<br>
      <br>
      But an interdisciplinary University of Alberta research team has
      come a step closer to finding a way of inactivating these highly
      infectious proteins.<br>
      <br>
      The team, lead by environmental health professors Mike Belosevic
      and Norm Neumann from the School of Public Health and engineering
      professor Mohamed Gamal El-Din from the Department of Civil and
      Environmental Engineering, have demonstrated for the first time
      that prions are highly susceptible to molecular ozone.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery could have implications for decontaminating medical
      and dental surgical instruments or treating water and wastewater
      in settings where prions might appear, such as in slaughterhouse
      waste.<br>
      <br>
      “Although we know that they have a very high-level resistance,
      it’s possible that we’ve discovered their Achilles’ heel,” said
      Neumann. “This means there might be simple solutions to dealing
      with contaminated medical instruments and waste products from
      slaughterhouses.”<br>
      <br>
      Human transmission of these devastating infectious agents through
      patient exposure to surgical equipment and blood transfusions has
      been documented. If these proteins can be neutralized, the result
      will be improved patient care.<br>
      <br>
      “Because ozone is already commonly used in the hospital
      environment, the technology for this disinfection process already
      exists,” says Neumann. “It is possible to take a medical
      instrument, put it in an ozone bath and very quickly destroy
      99.99% of the prions that are there.”<br>
      <br>
      However, there is still much work to do. “The only proof of final
      inactivation is to actually infect animals, and it may take years
      for the animal to start demonstrating the behavioural changes
      associated with these diseases caused by prions,” says Neumann.
      “We need more research in this area to increase our understanding
      of the relationship between ozone and all types of prions,
      including bovine spongiform encephalopathy or BSE, and that’s what
      we’re working on now.”<br>
      <br>
      The interdisciplinary nature of the research proved to be crucial
      to the success. “Nobody has really taken the biological
      diagnostics and methods and then applied them in the engineering
      context, and that’s what we did here,” Neumann said.<br>
      <br>
      The importance of the interdisciplinary approach to this research
      is echoed by Gamal El-Din. “We have the expertise in microbiology
      and engineering to make a difference. The ultimate goal is to
      protect the health of people as well as the environment.”<br>
      <br>
      The research was funded in part by the Alberta Prion Research
      Institute, PrioNet Canada and the Natural Sciences and Engineering
      Research Council of Canada and published in the February issue of
      the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology.<br>
