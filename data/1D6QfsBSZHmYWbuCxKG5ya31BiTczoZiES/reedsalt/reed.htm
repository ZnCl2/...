      <br>
      LIVERMORE, Calif. — With the exception of lasers and free-electron
      lasers, there hasn’t been another fundamental way to produce
      coherent light for close to 50 years.<br>
      <br>
      But a group of researchers from Lawrence Livermore National
      Laboratory and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
      found a new source of coherent optical radiation that is distinct
      from lasers and free-electron lasers.<br>
      <br>

      This figure shows the emission of coherent light at 22 THz from a
      molecular dynamics simulation of shocked NaCl (table salt). The
      left panel shows the emission of the light as a function of time
      while the shock is propagating. The right panel shows the
      generated radiation as a function of location within the shocked
      crystal indicating the 22 THz coherent signal is generated at the
      shock front (between the white dotted lines).<br>
      <br>
      Applications for this research are numerous, but the most
      immediate result may be a new diagnostic tool to determine the
      properties of shock waves, said Evan Reed, an E.O. Lawrence
      postdoctoral fellow at Lawrence Livermore and lead author of a
      paper that appears in the Jan. 13 edition of Physical Review
      Letters.<br>
      <br>
      Through a series of theoretical calculations and experimental
      simulations, scientists generated a mechanical shock wave inside a
      dielectric crystalline material, in this case kitchen salt (NaCl).
      One might expect to see only incoherent photons and sparks from
      the shocked crystal.<br>
      <br>
      But what they found was so much more. Weak yet measurable coherent
      light was seen emerging from the crystal. The emission frequencies
      are determined by the shock speed and the lattice make-up of the
      crystal.<br>
      <br>
      The team found that measurable coherent light can be observed
      emerging from the crystal in the range of 1 to 100 terahertz
      (THz).<br>
      <br>
      “To our knowledge, coherent light never has been seen before from
      shock waves propagating through crystals because a shocked crystal
      is not an obvious source to look for coherent radiation,” Reed
      said. “The light and radiation was in a portion of the
      electromagnetic spectrum that is not usually observed in these
      types of experiments.”<br>
      <br>
      Coherent light is very narrow bandwidth radiation; it is useful
      for interferometry (the measurement of two or more waves coming
      together at the same time and place, such as optical and shock
      waves) and is usually associated with lasers.<br>
      <br>
      The invention of the laser in 1958 as a source of coherent light
      enabled a wide range of applications including medical
      technologies and energy production because of the coherence of the
      light they generate. However, producing coherent light from a
      source other than a laser can serve as a diagnostic for
      understanding shock waves, specifically providing information
      about shock speed and the degree of crystallinity, Reed said.<br>
      <br>
      In the computational experiments, the researchers observed the
      light generated by a shocked polarized material by performing
      molecular dynamics simulations of shock waves propagating through
      crystalline NaCl. The simulations solved the classical equations
      of motion for atoms that are subject to interaction, thermal
      effects and deformation of the crystal lattice. The intensive
      computer simulations were made possible by utilizing LLNL’s
      Thunder parallel computer.<br>
      <br>
      Other Livermore authors include Richard Gee of LLNL’s Chemistry
      and Chemical Engineering Division.<br>
      <br>
      LLNL’s Laboratory Directed Research and Development program is
      funding an experiment to observe coherent radiation in the
      laboratory. Reed, Michael Armstrong (a Chemistry and Materials
      Science postdoctoral researcher) and researchers from Los Alamos
      National Laboratory (LANL) will collaborate on the project, which
      will be conducted at LANL experimental facilities.<br>

      We predict that coherent electromagnetic radiation in the 1–100
      THz frequency range can be generated in crystalline materials when
      subject to a shock wave or solitonlike propagating excitation. To
      our knowledge, this phenomenon represents a fundamentally new form
      of coherent optical radiation source that is distinct from lasers
      and free-electron lasers. The radiation is generated by the
      synchronized motion of large numbers of atoms when a shock wave
      propagates through a crystal. General analytical theory and NaCl
      molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate coherence lengths on
      the order of mm (around 20 THz) and potentially greater. The
      emission frequencies are determined by the shock speed and the
      lattice constants of the crystal and can potentially be used to
      determine atomic-scale properties of the shocked material.<br>

      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Physicists at MIT and Livermore National Lab
      have discovered a new source of coherent radiation distinct from
      traditional lasers and free-electron lasers; they propose to build
      a device in which coherent photons are produced by sending shock
      waves through a crystal. The result would be coherent light
      resembling the radiation issuing from a laser; but the mechanism
      of light production would not be stimulated emission, as it is in
      a laser, but rather the concerted motion of row after row of atoms
      in the target crystal.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The passing shock front, set in motion by a
      projectile or laser blast, successively excites a huge density
      wave in the crystal; the atoms, returning to their original places
      in the matrix, emit light coherently, mostly in the Terahertz
      wavelength band. Although sources of coherent light in this part
      of the electromagnetic spectrum have developed in recent years, it
      is still a difficult task.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next step will be to carry out an
      experimental test of the shock-wave light production. This work
      will be performed at two national labs -- Livermore and Los
      Alamos. According to Evan Reed (who moved from MIT to Livermore,
      reed23@llnl.gov) the first likely application of coherent
      radiation will be as a diagnostic for understanding shock waves.
      The radiation should provide information about shock speed and the
      degree of crystallinity.<br>

      Could laser-like light be squeezed from salt?Could laser-like
      light be squeezed from salt&nbsp; model suggests that shocking a
      crystal will produce synchronized light.<br>
      <br>
      Physicists in the United States have discovered a way to make what
      is essentially laser light, without using a laser. All you need to
      do, they say, is give a crystal of table salt a sharp knock.<br>
      <br>
      It was previously assumed that this would do nothing more than
      squeeze sparks and ordinary light out of the crystal. But Evan
      Reed of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California
      and his co-workers say that the shock will also generate a small
      amount of 'coherent' light1, the stuff that comes from lasers.<br>
      <br>
      This unexpected source of laser-like light is not just an academic
      oddity. The new work shows that the coherent light coming from
      shocked salt should be in a fequency band called terahertz
      radiation, which cannot be generated by ordinary lasers, says
      Marin Soljacic, one of Reed's collaborators.<br>
      <br>
      Terahertz radiation, with wavelengths of about a millimetre to
      tens of micrometres, is increasingly in demand for biomedical and
      technological applications. In particular, the radiation can peer
      through human flesh to image the anatomy beneath, without harming
      tissues the way X-rays do.<br>
      <br>
      You might not get much of this kind of light out of a grain of
      salt, the team notes. But it could also provide a useful
      diagnostic tool for studying the effects of shock waves on
      crystalline materials, says Soljacic, who is based at the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).<br>
      <br>
      <b>The light fantastic</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      “The big difficulty is detecting it.”<br>
      <br>
      Light is composed of packets of energy called photons, each of
      which can be described as a wave with a particular frequency and
      wavelength. In ordinary (incoherent) light, like that from a light
      bulb, these waves rise and fall independently of one another. In
      coherent light, on the other hand, the waves are all synchronized,
      rather like a group of soldiers marching in step.<br>
      <br>
      It is this characteristic that gives laser light its special
      properties. The beam stays bright and does not spread out, for
      example, enabling the fine focus necessary in CD and DVD players.<br>
      <br>
      Making coherent light in lasers is a feat of coordination: all the
      photons are released together thanks to a positive feedback
      process through which one photon stimulates the release of
      another. This process gives 'laser' its name: it's an acronym of
      Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Reed and colleagues say that the coherence of light emitted from a
      shocked crystal comes instead from the way that a shock wave
      passing through the material can induce the regular rows of atoms
      to move in synchrony. This motion produces an electromagnetic wave
      - in other words, light.<br>
      Look and you shall find<br>
      <br>
      Countless experiments have investigated the effects of shock waves
      on materials; the Lawrence Livermore lab is one of the world
      leaders in this area. But Reed's team says that coherent light
      emission has never been seen before, simply because no one thought
      to look for it.<br>
      <br>
      His team tested their idea in a computer model, which predicted
      how sodium chloride (common salt) should behave when exposed to
      the kind of shock wave produced by an explosion or a bright laser
      pulse. The result was spikes of radiation emitted at
      extreme-infrared (terahertz) frequencies, corresponding to bands
      of coherent emission.<br>
      <br>
      So much for the theory; will it work in practice? Reed says he is
      hoping to find out, in an experimental collaboration between the
      Livermore lab and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.
      "The big difficulty is detecting the coherent signal. It'll be
      relatively weak," explains his MIT colleague John Joannopoulos. <br>

      &nbsp;An optical modulator includes a crystal structure that
      exhibits polaritonic or excitonic behavior. A shock wave
      propagates through the crystal structure so as to corehently
      generate, convert or modulate electomagnetic radiation from the
      terahertz to the x-ray ranges.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>PRIORITY INFORMATION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims priority from provisional
      application Ser. No. 60/551,127 filed Mar. 8, 2004, incorporated
      herein in its entirety.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to the field of optical modulators,
      and in particular to a method of modulating light utilizing shock
      waves in a crystal structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There are very few ways to generate and manipulate coherent
      radiation. The generation of coherent radiation is imperative for
      interferometry and other important optical techniques. Existing
      practical sources of coherent radiation are quantum lasers and
      free electron lasers. The technology presented in accordance with
      the invention represents a new source of coherent radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Uses for terahertz radiation range from the new field of
      THz spectroscopy, to fundamental studies of phonon <br>
      dynamics, to an alternative to harmful x-rays in medical imaging
      to security screening devices able to penetrate clothing to detect
      explosives or other weapons. However, the generation of narrow
      bandwidth radiation in the terahertz regime has proven to be a
      difficult task. While substantial progress has been made, existing
      sources of THz radiation have substantial shortcomings that limit
      their practical use.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Generally, existing techniques are limited to 1-10
      microwatt power outputs, requiring long exposure times for
      probing. Quantum cascade lasers can be used to generate narrow
      bandwidth coherent THz radiation, but must be cooled below room
      temperature and are limited to frequencies above about 2 THz.
      Photoconductive approaches can generate only broad bandwidth THz
      radiation up to around 2 THz and require cooling the
      photoconductive element below room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Nonlinear frequency downconversion approaches can provide
      coherent radiation but are also limited in their efficiency,
      providing power outputs in 1-10 microwatt range.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0007] According to one aspect of the invention, there is provided
      an optical modulator that includes a crystal structure that
      exhibits polaritonic or excitonic behavior. A shock wave
      propagates through the crystal structure so as to optically
      modulate and manipulate a light signal propagating in the crystal
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] According to another aspect of the invention, there is
      provided an optical isolator that includes a crystal structure
      that exhibits polaritonic or excitonic behavior. A shock wave
      propagates through the crystal structure so as to optically
      modulate and manipulate a light signal propagating in the crystal
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] According to another aspect of the invention, there is
      provided a method of modulating a light signal. The method
      includes providing a crystal structure that exhibits polaritonic
      or excitonic behavior. Also, the method includes propagating a
      shock wave through the crystal structure so as to optically
      modulate and manipulate a light signal propagating in the crystal
      structure.<br>

      <b> </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0017] The invention relates to how light can be modulated and
      manipulated when coupled to polaritonic and excitonic phenomena in
      materials containing a shock wave or shock-like propagating
      excitation. Theoretically predicted effects include the conversion
      of an applied static electric or magnetic field to coherent
      terahertz or optical frequency radiation and anomalous
      Doppler-like frequency shifts that are orders of magnitude larger
      than the usual Doppler shift and can be used for coherent
      frequency conversion.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The coherence arises in a classical fashion, in distinction
      to the quantum origin of coherence present in lasers. This
      technology represents a fundamentally new form of coherent light
      source. The frequency shifts are of a linear nature,
      distinguishing them from the usual nonlinear approaches to
      frequency conversion. The linearity results in intensity
      independent conversion efficiencies. This disclosure also details
      how light of optical or terahertz frequencies can be used to
      resolve and probe dynamical atomic scale phenomena. A nanoscale
      optical isolator can be constructed using this technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Utilizing the invention, one can show that coherent
      terahertz and optical radiation can be generated when a shock wave
      or shock-like excitation propagates through a crystal of classical
      polarizable electric dipoles. Many materials exhibiting
      polaritonic or excitonic behavior are examples of such a system.
      Coherent terahertz or optical frequency radiation can be generated
      under certain circumstances. An existing terahertz or optical
      frequency signal can be coherently converted to another frequency
      through an anomalously large Doppler-like effect. This frequency
      conversion effect is orders of magnitude larger than the usual
      Doppler shift from the moving shock wave or shock-like wave. Such
      a shock-like time-dependent effect can be utilized as an
      opto-isolator with physical size orders of magnitude smaller than
      the wavelength of the light on which it operates. Miniaturization
      of optical-isolation systems is one of the biggest challenges to
      optical integration.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] These new predicted effects are observable using a variety
      of experimental techniques. Planar shock waves can be generated
      using high intensity pulsed lasers. Shock fronts generated using
      this technique have been measured to have thicknesses of less than
      a few tens of crystal lattice planes. An application of the new
      physics in this work is the measurement of the shock front
      thickness with precision greater than achievable with current
      x-ray techniques. Such measurement constitutes ultra
      sub-wavelength resolution of dynamical phenomena, resolving atomic
      scale phenomena with light of wavelength orders of magnitude
      longer. Surface plasmons are another excitation that can be
      coupled to light to observe these predicted effects. A variety of
      experimental techniques can be utilized to observe these effects
      in surface plasmon systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] Coherent x-rays are extremely difficult to generate using
      existing techniques. Approaches that do not involve the detonation
      of nuclear weapons (x-ray laser) are extremely inefficient
      (high-harmonic generation). The technology presented in this
      disclosure may be used to produce coherent x-rays.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] To explore the phenomena associated with light scattering
      from a shocked polaritonic or excitonic material, perform
      finite-difference time-domain simulations of Maxwell's equations
      in one dimension, single polarization, and normal incidence. A
      polarizable element [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      Here, [mu]n(t)=vn(t)2 where is the polarizability, v is the volume
      associated with each polarizable element, n(t) is the resonant
      frequency of the nth polarizable element, and is a damping term.
      Equation 1 is solved together with Maxwell's equations in ID,
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      where [Omega] corresponds to the pre-shock state, is the shift in
      across the shock front 2 [beta] and vs is the shock speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The observation of some effects can be demonstrated in
      computer simulations of the model given above. Generation of
      coherent radiation can be generated from a zero frequency input
      signal (constant electric or magnetic field) in an insulator or by
      flowing a current through a metal. Consider a shock wave that
      propagates through an insulator. As the shock compresses the
      material, the resonant frequency of polarizable elements within
      the material can either increase or decrease depending on the
      material and the particular polarizable elements. In this
      scenario, one can consider a system where the resonance frequency
      of the polarizable elements increases upon shock compression. The
      resonant frequency of the polarizable elements in this scenario is
      depicted in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIG. 1 shows a schematic diagram of a shock wave moving to
      the right which increases the resonant frequency of the
      polarizable elements as it propagates. The resonant frequency of
      the polarizable dipoles is on the low frequency side of the
      polaritonic bandgap. Suppose a constant electric or magnetic field
      is applied throughout the material while the shock wave is
      propagating. This uniform field induces some moment in the
      polarizable elements that is emitted as multiple coherent higher
      frequencies when the resonant frequency of the polarizable
      elements is increased by the shock.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] FIG. 2 shows results of an FDTD simulation for the scenario
      in FIG. 1 when the shock propagates with a speed of
      vs=3.3*10&lt;-5 &gt; c/a which is a typical shock speed of about
      10 km/sec. The resonant frequency of the polarizable dipoles
      ranges from 0.15*10&lt;-4 &gt; c/a in front of the shock to
      1.15*10&lt;-4 &gt; c/a behind the shock and the loss
      parameter=10&lt;-5 &gt; c/a. The polarizability a/v=4.4*10&lt;3
      &gt; in front of the shock and a/v=76 behind the shock. The shock
      front thickness is 20a. FIG. 2 shows the absolute value of the
      Fourier transform of the magnetic field H over the time interval
      t=7.5*10&lt;5 &gt; a/c. During this time interval, the shock front
      is located is located in the vicinity of x/a=125 and travels a
      distance of approximately 25a.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Transmitting boundary conditions exist on the left and
      right sides of the computational cell at x/a=0 and x/a=200. There
      are several finite elements with no polarizability (vacuum) at the
      edges of the computational cell. A small amount of emitted light
      may be reflected from the dielectric mismatch at this interface
      and propagate back toward the shock as would occur under
      experimental conditions. A current source at x=9a with zero
      frequency is slowly turned on at the start of the simulation
      (before the time interval for the Fourier transform of FIG. 2
      begins.) This source generates a constant magnetic field
      throughout the computational cell.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] As the polarizable elements are moved up in frequency by
      the shock compression, radiation is re-emitted at multiple
      discrete frequencies. The emitted radiation is of a coherent
      nature if the input signal is coherent. Since the input frequency
      is zero in this case, long time coherence of the input signal is
      trivial to realize. The number of frequencies emitted from the
      shock depends an a variety of factors which include the shock
      front thickness, the polarizability, the magnitude of the resonant
      frequency shift of the polarizable elements, and the amount of
      absorption in the polarizable elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIG. 2 corresponds to an experimentally realizable
      situation. For example, if the lattice constant a=10 A. The
      polarizable dipoles vary in frequency from 4.5 THz in front of the
      shock to 35 THz behind the shock. The generated radiation has
      frequencies of 10 and 20 THz. The frequency of the generated
      radiation can be varied by using a crystal with a different
      periodicity or sound speed because the frequencies generated in
      this case are approximately generated [omega]generated=vs/a 1,
      where 1 is a positive integer. Shock front thicknesses of tens of
      lattice units or less are readily achievable experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] A remarkable property of this frequency generation effect
      is that the efficiency is independent of the amplitude of the
      input signal. This is a result of the fact that this is a linear
      system, distinguishing it from the usual methods of optical
      frequency conversion involving the use of materials with a
      nonlinear optical response. In these systems great care must be
      taken to ensure input intensities are high enough and phase
      matching constraints are achieved to obtain sufficient conversion
      efficiency. The intensity of emitted radiation can potentially be
      quite high because of the ease with which large polarization
      fields are created at small frequencies. If the area of the shock
      wave is 100*100 [mu]m an each polarizable element contains an
      energy of about 0.1 eV, the shock can generate radiation with an
      power up to 103 Watts. The efficiency of the effect increases with
      increasing polarizability, decreasing losses and decreasing
      initial lower bandgap edge.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] This technology also represents a fundamentally new way to
      study crystallography. Crystallography is currently studied with
      x-rays. The technology presented here enables the study of crystal
      structure by monitoring the spatial and frequency dependence of
      emitted THz radiation when a shock or soliton propagates through
      the crystal.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] One can consider a scenario where the input signal has a
      non-zero frequency. A material is utilized where the polarizable
      elements of an insulating material move down in frequency when
      compressed by the shock wave, as in FIG. 3. Consider radiation
      incident from the right (in the pre-shock region.) As the shock
      wave propagates, this radiation couples into the polarizable
      elements and moves down in frequency until it escapes to the right
      at a lower frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 4 shows a computer simulation of the scenario in FIG.
      3. The absolute value of the Fourier transform of the magnetic
      field for is shown. The shock wave moves through about x/a=25
      during the Fourier transform time interval. The resonant frequency
      of the polarizable dipoles (green dotted line) is on the low
      frequency side of the polaritonic bandgap. Radiation incident from
      the right resonantly couples into the polarizable dipoles which
      move down in frequency before re-emitting the radiation. The
      magnitude of the frequency shift in this reversed Doppler effect
      is several orders of magnitude larger the normal Doppler shift
      from an object moving at the shock speed. The re-radiated
      radiation is coherent if the input signal is coherent. A similar
      scenario can occur if the frequency of the polarizable dipoles
      increases upon compression.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In FIG. 4, the resonant frequency of the polarizable
      elements decreases from 3.5*10&lt;-4 &gt; c/a in front of the
      shock to 2.5*10&lt;-4 &gt; c/a behind the shock and the loss
      parameter y=10&lt;-5 &gt; c/a . The polarizability is a/v =8 in
      the pre-shock region and v=16 in the post-shock region. The shock
      propagates with a speed of vs=3.3*10&lt;-5 &gt; c/a which is a
      typical shock speed of about 10 km/sec. The shock front thickness
      is 20a.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Moreover, FIG. 4 shows the absolute value of the Fourier
      transform of the magnetic field H over the time interval t=7.5*105
      a/c. During this time interval, the shock front is located is
      located in the vicinity of x/a=125 and travels a distance of
      approximately 25a. Transmitting boundary conditions exist on the
      left and right sides of the computational cell at x/a=0 and
      x/a=200. A small amount of emitted light can be reflected from the
      dielectric mismatch at this interface and propagate back toward
      the shock as would occur under experimental conditions. A current
      source at x=191a with frequency v=3*10&lt;-4 &gt; c/a is slowly
      turned on at the start of the simulation (before the time interval
      for the Fourier transform of FIG. 4 begins.) FIG. 5 shows the
      absolute value of the Fourier transform of the polarization field
      P for the simulation of FIG. 4. The shock wave moves through about
      x a=25 during the Fourier transform time interval. The resonant
      frequency of the polarizable dipoles is on the low frequency side
      of the polaritonic bandgap. Radiation incident from the right
      resonantly couples into the polarizable dipoles which move down in
      frequency before re-emitting some of the radiation. Losses
      decrease the magnitude of the polarization as the polarizable
      dipoles move down in frequency. FIG. 6 shows a simulation where
      multiple frequencies are reflected by the shock. This simulation
      is similar to that shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] FIG. 6 shows the absolute value of the Fourier transform of
      the magnetic field H over the time interval t=7.5*10&lt;5 &gt;
      a/c. During this time interval, the shock front is located is
      located in the vicinity of x/a=125 and travels a distance of
      approximately 25a. Transmitting boundary conditions exist on the
      left and right sides of the computational cell at x/a=0 and
      x/a=200. A small amount of emitted light may be reflected from the
      dielectric mismatch at this interface and propagate back toward
      the shock as would occur under experimental conditions. A current
      source at x=191a with frequency v=3.5*10&lt;-4 &gt; c/a is slowly
      turned on at the start of the simulation (before the time interval
      for the Fourier transform of FIG. 6 begins.)<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In FIG. 6, the resonant frequency of the polarizable
      elements decreases from 4*10&lt;-4&gt; c/a in front of the shock
      to 0 (metallization) behind the shock and the loss parameter
      [gamma]=2*10&lt;-5 &gt; c/a . The polarizability is [alpha]/v=6.2
      in the pre-shock region. The shock propagates with a speed of
      vs=3.3*10&lt;-5 &gt; c which is a typical shock speed of about 10
      km/sec. The shock front thickness is 20a.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The simulations in the figures in this section are
      experimentally realizable. For example, in FIG. 6 if the lattice
      constant a=10 A, the dipoles vary have frequency of 120 THz in the
      unshocked material. The generated radiation has frequencies
      separated by 10 THz. The loss parameter in this simulation has the
      property that [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      0.05 which is typical of an excitonic or polaritonic excitation.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The lack of a sufficiently miniaturized technique for
      optical isolation presents one of the biggest challenges to
      optical integration. One can show how a propagating soliton-like
      pulse in the polarization resonance frequency can be utilized as
      an optical isolator. Light that is incident from the right is
      allowed to propagate through the device with some degree of
      attenuation, while light incident from the left is completely
      absorbed by the device. The physical size of the solitonic pulse
      required for such a device is orders of magnitude smaller than the
      wavelength of the light and is ideal for optical integration.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] FIGS. 7A-7B show schematic diagrams of the frequency of the
      polaritonic or excitonic bandgap as a function of position. As the
      soliton propagates, it changes the resonant frequency of the
      polarizable elements. The pulse propagates to the right. FIG. 7A
      shows how light of some input frequency incident from the right
      can be transmitted through the soliton by coupling into and back
      out of the resonant elements. FIG. 7B shows how light of the same
      frequency incident from the left will be couple into the
      polarizable elements and never couple back out. The light in this
      case is absorbed by losses in the polarizable elements. This
      system represents a nanoscale optical isolator because the soliton
      can be of atomic spatial dimensions and light is only allowed to
      propagate from left to right through the system.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The lowest frequency of the soliton must be within a few
      vs/a of the incident frequency to prevent re-emission of the
      absorbed radiation to the left. The incident frequency must be
      within vs/a of the bottom of the bandgap to ensure that the
      radiation from the left is absorbed instead of being re-emitted to
      the left. Some losses occur in the transmission scenario in the
      top figure. If the optical system is not sensitive to frequencies
      sufficiently different from the input frequency, these frequency
      criteria are not required. These losses are expected to depend on
      the spatial dimensions of the soliton, amount of intrinsic loss in
      the polarizable elements, and shock speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In a practical device, a means of repetitive generation of
      such solitonic pulses is also required, which would likely be the
      largest component of the system and the key factor in the
      suitability for optical integration. Solitonic pulses of the type
      discussed here can be generated using ultrashort pulsed lasers.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The new physical phenomena presented herein can all be
      understood within the context of several analytical theories and
      qualitative arguments.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The effects predicted are observable in materials that are
      not perfect crystals. In polycrystalline materials, additional
      frequency components are expected to be within the emission
      spectrum. In any real crystalline material, defects exist that
      diminish the crystalline properties. It is believed that the
      presence of defects will result in emission at frequencies other
      than those at which the perfect crystal emits. In liquids or
      amorphous materials, non-coherent emission in a broad bandwidth
      may occur. If the frequency shift of the polarizable elements is
      sufficiently large, the bandwidth of emitted radiation in this
      case is limited by the shock front thickness and rate of damping
      of the polarizable elements. This property could be used as a
      diagnostic tool for determination of the shock front thickness in
      shock wave experiments.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Atomic scale resolution of the front thickness can be
      determined to a degree better than is possible with current x-ray
      technology. It can be possible to measure the temperature of a
      material behind the shock front by measuring the emission from
      thermally populated polarizable elements as a second shock wave
      propagates through the material behind the first shock wave. This
      technology also represents a new diagnostic tool for the study of
      material solitons.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Dispersion in phonon bands can be neglected in polaritonic
      systems because the shock speed is considerably faster than
      optical phonon speeds. This may not hold in excitonic systems, but
      no bands are expected to exist in sharp shock fronts where the
      frequencies of polarizable elements are sufficiently different to
      prevent exciton transport. The effects presented in this
      disclosure are expected to be observable when the shock wave
      propagates off-axis to the crystal. This scenario is not a ID
      scenario. Thermal effects can also diminish coherence properties,
      but the polarization due to the electromagnetic radiation can be
      made considerably larger than polarization due to thermal effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] An additional embodiment of this invention is to utilize
      surface plasmons as the polarizable elements. Surface plasmons are
      charge density waves that propagate at the interface between a
      metal and a dielectric material. The resonant frequency of surface
      plasmons can be varied in a shock-like fashion by modulating the
      dielectric of the dielectric material in a shock-like fashion,
      either by sending a physical shock through the dielectric or
      through other means of modulation. It is also likely possible to
      observe the effects presented here in systems that do not involve
      physical shock waves. For example, the generation and manipulation
      of coherent x-rays may be possible if the resonant frequency of
      the polarizable dipoles can be changed by a pulse of light
      propagating through a material. In this case, the generated
      frequencies are on the order of 10&lt;4 &gt; eV if v c and a
      1[deg.]A. Atomic core electronic states may be utilized as the
      polarizable elements in this scenario. Coherent x-rays are
      extremely difficult to generate using existing techniques.
      Approaches that do not involve nuclear weapons (x-ray laser) are
      extremely inefficient (high-harmonic generation). The technology
      described here can be utilized to generate coherent phonons, which
      can be used for a variety of purposes including nanoscale imaging.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Although the present invention has been shown and described
      with respect to several preferred embodiments thereof, various
      changes, omissions and additions to the form and detail thereof,
      may be made therein, without departing from the spirit and scope
      of the invention.

      </b><b>PRIORITY INFORMATION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims priority from U.S. provisional
      patent application Ser. No. 60/464,006 filed on Apr. 18, 2003, and
      is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No.
      10/412,089 filed on Apr. 11, 2003.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The invention relates to the field of photonics and, in
      particular, to photonic crystals. Photonic crystals are a
      promising and versatile way to control the propagation of
      electromagnetic radiation. Nevertheless, very little attention has
      been given to the effects of non-stationary photonic crystals on
      electromagnetic radiation propagation. It has been shown that the
      frequency of light can be changed across a bandgap in a photonic
      crystal which is physically oscillating. However, the frequency of
      oscillation is required to be of the order of the bandgap
      frequency in the photonic crystal. Such oscillation frequencies
      are impossible for light of 1 [mu]m wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] There is no known non-quantum mechanical way to
      significantly narrow the bandwidth of a wavepacket by an arbitrary
      amount and change the frequency of light to an arbitrary amount
      with high efficiency. Acousto-optical modulators can change the
      frequency by a part in 10&lt;-4&gt; , but larger changes in
      frequency are desirable for most applications. Non-linear
      materials can be used to produce large changes in light
      frequencies with less than perfect efficiency. For example, if
      light of frequencies [omega]1 and [omega]2 is shined into a
      non-linear material, light of frequencies [omega]1+[omega]2 and
      ¦¦[omega]1-[omega]2¦¦ may be produced. In addition to the less
      than perfect conversion efficiencies of these techniques, the
      frequencies produced are still limited by the range of input
      frequencies. Production of an arbitrary frequency is not possible
      unless an arbitrary input frequency is available. Furthermore,
      great care must be taken in the design of the device to ensure
      momentum conservation, which is required for high efficiency.
      Additionally, high intensities are required, and the frequencies
      produced are still limited by the range of input frequencies and
      phase-matching constraints. Using such prior art systems,
      production of an arbitrary frequency shift in a given system is
      not possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Of additional interest in optical applications is the
      ability to trap and manipulate pulses of light. Few technologies
      exist to trap 100% of the energy of a pulse of light for a period
      of time which is determined while the light is trapped. Existing
      approaches for trapping light for a pre-specified amount of time
      require the use of large lengths (kilometers) of optical fiber.
      The time required for light to propagate through the fiber is a
      function of the length. A number of large reels of fiber of varied
      lengths are required to delay light pulses for a range of times,
      and even then the delay time cannot be determined in real time.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Photonic crystals have been shown to be a versatile way to
      control the propagation of electromagnetic radiation. However,
      very little attention has been given to the effects of
      non-stationary photonic crystals on electromagnetic radiation
      propagation.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Whatever the precise merits, features, and advantages of
      the above-mentioned approaches, they fail to achieve or fulfill
      the purposes of the present invention's system and method for
      trapping light for a controlled period of time via shock-like
      modulation of the photonic crystal dielectric.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0032] Although the present invention has been shown and described
      with respect to several preferred embodiments thereof, various
      changes, omissions, and additions to the form and detail thereof
      may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of
      the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] The effects on electromagnetic radiation propagating in a
      shocked photonic crystal (consisting of alternating dielectric
      layers along a particular direction) are considered. Finite
      difference time domain (FDTD) simulations of Maxwell's Equations
      in one dimension, single polarization, and normal incidence for a
      system described by a time-dependent dielectric [epsilon](x,t) are
      used to explore the phenomena associated with light scattering
      from a shock-wave, or shock-like wave, in a photonic crystal.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A typical shock wave profile is depicted in FIG. 1. It
      corresponds to the dielectric function given by [mathematical
      formula - see original document] where [nu] is the shock speed and
      [alpha] is the period of the pre-shocked crystal. The photonic
      crystals on both sides of the shock front have periodic variations
      of [epsilon] ranging from 1 to 13. The thickness of the shock wave
      front is given by [gamma]&lt;-1&gt; , which is 0.05. FIG. 1
      describes this shock wave propagating to the right (leaving a
      compressed lattice behind) in the dielectric described by Equation
      (1) as a function of position for three equally-spaced instants of
      time t1&lt;t2&lt;t3. Arrows follow the shock front and material
      paths, which move at different speeds. The shocked lattice is
      identical to the original but with a smaller lattice constant. In
      this case, the shock wave compresses the lattice by a factor of 2.
      The interface moves at the shock speed [nu] and the material
      behind also moves uniformly at a slower speed-known as the
      particle speed. In this case, the particle speed is [nu]/2. This
      scenario can roughly be thought of as two different lattice
      constant photonic crystals moving toward each other.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The shock wave profile of the dielectric constant in the
      photonic crystal can be generated by a variety of means. One
      method includes launching a physical shock wave into the photonic
      crystal using explosive loading, high-intensity lasers or other
      means. Another method involves the generation of the shock wave
      profile through the use of materials which change the dielectric
      constant under an applied electric field or applied change in
      temperature. Some of these materials can be modulated at GHz
      frequencies with 1% changes in the refractive index. A generalized
      idea of a shock wave can be adopted as a dielectric modulation
      which is steady in a reference frame moving at the shock speed. A
      time-dependent shock wave profile may be realized by
      time-dependent modulation of the local dielectric at all points in
      the system. In addition to a constant shock velocity, a
      propagation velocity which is time-dependent may provide better
      results for a particular application. The thickness of the shock
      wave front may also be varied for desired effect. Other possible
      ways of producing similar effects in photonic crystals may involve
      the simultaneous interaction of light with a spinning disk and an
      object fixed in the laboratory frame. However, the means for
      producing such shockwaves should not be used to limit the scope of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As an illustrative example, the specific case is considered
      wherein the shock wave compresses the lattice constant behind the
      shock by a factor of 2. Additionally, the shock front has a
      thickness on the order of, or less than, a single lattice
      constant, as depicted in FIG. 1. The bandgaps for the crystals
      which exist in front of and behind the shock front are depicted in
      FIG. 2. It should be noted that there is a complete gap which
      extends over the entire crystal from frequency [omega]1 to
      [omega]2.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] First, the effect of electromagnetic radiation in the
      photonic crystal is considered. Electromagnetic radiation is
      shined into the crystal in the opposite direction of shock
      propagation (or in a direction that not necessarily the same as
      that of the direction of shock propagation) just below the second
      gap at [omega]1 (e.g., indicated by arrow 202 for [omega]1=0.37)
      on the right side of FIG. 2. This radiation is converted up in
      frequency to [omega]2 (e.g., indicated by arrow 204 for
      [omega]2=0.44), where it propagates away from the shock and can be
      extracted from the system near the input. Arrows 206 and 208
      indicate the adiabatic evolution of the modes for the lowest two
      bands.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] It should be noted that specific bandgaps (i.e., 1&lt;st
      &gt; bandgap, 2&lt;nd &gt; bandgap, etc.) are used for
      illustration <br>
      purposes only and the present invention equally applies to the use
      of other bandgaps. Hence, specific bandgaps should not be used to
      limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] FIG. 3 illustrates four moments in time in a computer
      simulation of the shock in FIG. 1. For example, FIG. 3 shows the
      magnetic field for a simulation where the shock front (dashed
      line) propagates to the right, with [nu]=3.4*10&lt;-4 &gt; c. It
      should be noted that the shock front location is indicated by the
      dotted line 302. The panels in FIG. 3 are obtained by Fourier
      transforming the magnetic field over windows of time ([Delta]t=200
      [alpha]/c) centered at the times shown in the upper right corners.
      Light is initially spatially contained in a Gaussian distribution
      centered around x/[alpha]=40 at the band edge frequency. As the
      Gaussian distribution moves and broadens to the left, most of the
      incident light is trapped in a localized state at the shock front
      in the overlapping bandgap frequency region of the two photonic
      crystals. While it is trapped, it evolves up in frequency through
      the pre-shocked bandgap and is released to the right of the shock,
      with about 20% change in frequency in this case. More
      specifically, the light begins the simulation below the gap in the
      unshocked material at [omega]1=0.37 (indicated by arrow 304) and,
      as the light begins to propagate to the left, most of it is
      trapped at the shock front until it escapes to the right at
      [omega]1=0.44 (indicated by arrow 306).<br>
      <br>
      [0041] It should be noted that the amount of frequency shift in
      this example can be tuned by adjusting the size of the bandgap of
      the pre-shocked crystal and, hence, such frequency shift amounts
      should not be used to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The shock wave propagates about 0.5[alpha] in FIG. 3, and
      this frequency conversion process is observed once for every
      lattice unit the shock wave traverses, resulting in a pulsed
      output for a continuous wave input. The pulse rate can be
      controlled with the shock speed. Qualitatively similar effects
      were observed for a slower shock velocity of v=3.4*10&lt;-5 &gt;
      c.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] An additional consequence of this scenario is the
      localization of light for a controlled period of time. If the
      speed at which the shock-like interface moves can be controlled,
      then the light can be confined in the gap region for a time that
      is determined by that shock speed. It should be noted that the
      propagation speed of light is near zero while trapped at the shock
      front, which has useful applications in telecommunications or
      quantum optics.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] FIG. 4 contains results of a simulation similar to that in
      FIG. 3, but with a faster moving shock front of [nu]=3.4*10&lt;-3
      &gt; c. The frequencies are separated by 2 [pi][nu]/[alpha].
      Similar to the example in FIG. 2, light enters at [omega]=0.37
      (shown by arrow 402) below the bandgap and is converted up in
      frequency at the shock front and propagates away as discrete
      frequencies around [omega]=0.45 (shown by arrow 404). Light in
      this simulation starts out as a Gaussian centered at x/[alpha]=220
      with the bandgap edge carrier frequency. The Fourier transform of
      magnetic field which produced this figure utilized a longer time
      period ([Delta]t=6000[alpha]/c) than that of FIG. 3 and shows the
      entire upconversion of light from below the gap to the top of the
      gap as the shock front passes through several lattice periods. The
      light trapped at the shock front appears to exist in discrete
      frequencies and escapes at the top of the gap in such frequencies.
      This discretization can be loosely interpreted as a result of
      repeated bounces of the light between the moving material on the
      left and the fixed material on the right and is commensurate with
      the periodic nature of the pulsed output. The interpretation of
      the output light in FIGS. 3 and 4 as equally-spaced discrete
      frequencies or pulses is a matter of frequency resolution in the
      detection apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The frequency of the localized state at the shock front
      observed in FIG. 3 is well defined in the limit of a slowly
      propagating shock where [mathematical formula - see original
      document] However, for shock speeds sufficiently fast for this
      condition to break down, the localized mode possesses an effective
      bandwidth which is on the order of the bandgap frequency width.
      FIG. 4 is approaching this regime, where it is almost more
      appropriate to think of the light continuously moving up through
      the bandgap rather than in a pulsed fashion as in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Additionally, the shock-like dielectric modulation of FIG.
      1 is used to narrow the bandwidth of a pulse of light. This is
      accomplished by confining the light between the moving shock front
      on the left and a reflecting surface of the right (indicated by
      arrow 500). FIG. 5 illustrates the results of such a simulation
      (with the dotted lines 502 and 504 indicate the shock front),
      where the bandwidth of input light is reduced by a factor of 4
      (bandwidth of input light=[Delta][omega]=0.01 and bandwidth of
      output light=[Delta][omega]=0.0025). In this specific example, the
      shock is moving, with [nu]=10&lt;-4 &gt; c and [gamma]&lt;-1&gt;
      =2. The narrowing process can become more effective for slower
      shock velocities, larger simulation cells, and narrower initial
      bandwidths.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Changing the thickness of the shock front has an effect on
      the frequencies produced and the degree of continuity of the
      frequency-converted electromagnetic radiation. Continuous
      frequency conversion is accomplished with a shock wave possessing
      a front thickness much larger than the lattice spacing. This is
      depicted in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 6 illustrates a frequency versus position graph of a
      broad shock wave propagating to the right of a photonic crystal.
      The shock front width is much larger than the lattice constant. A
      signal input at [omega]1 from the right (arrow 602) is coherently
      converted up in frequency to [omega]2 and output to the left
      (arrow 604). It is also envisioned that coherency may be
      maintained for small frequency shifts for narrow shocks. It should
      be noted that running the shock wave in reverse has a frequency
      lowering effect for light input from the right at [omega]2, which
      is complimentary to the frequency increasing effect described
      here.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] While there are numerous ways to increase the bandwidth of
      a wave packet, there are currently no classical (non-quantum
      mechanical) ways to decrease the bandwidth. This can be
      accomplished through the addition of a photonic crystal mirror on
      the right side of the system in FIG. 2. If electromagnetic
      radiation of a range of frequencies below [omega]1 is shined into
      the system, it will be confined between the shock front and the
      mirror on the right side. As the shock propagates, all this
      radiation is shifted up in frequency until the lower band edge in
      the pre-shocked material is reached; then the radiation is shifted
      up in frequency through the total system gap and can be extracted
      on the right side.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Many other methods are envisioned to reduce or increase the
      bandwidth of a pulse of light based upon this configuration. Some
      of these are related to the frequency dependence of the Doppler
      shift and the frequency dependence of the adiabatic evolution of
      the modes. The rate of adiabatic frequency shift of the modes in
      the pre-shocked material is a function of frequency. Modes close
      to the bottom of the gap change frequency more slowly than those
      away from the gap due to the high density of modes there. This may
      have bandwidth altering applications. It is also possible to vary
      the frequency width of the bandgap as a function of position in
      the crystal to control the density of states, as in FIG. 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 7 illustrates a schematic of a shock wave compressing
      a material with a spatially dependent bandgap. All light which
      exists between [omega]1 and [omega]2 is converted to [omega]2 and
      escapes on the right side. This will decrease the distance the
      shock wave must travel to convert all the energy in a given
      bandwidth.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Thus, the use of photonic crystals as frequency-dependent
      mirrors allows for the confinement of light of certain
      frequencies, while others are allowed to escape. If the geometry
      of the photonic crystals is sufficiently slowly altered that the
      confined light changes frequency slowly, it will all escape at the
      edge of the confining frequency nearly monochromatically. It
      should be noted that this effect cannot be accomplished with
      metallic mirrors due to their lack of significant frequency
      dependence and rapid absorption of electromagnetic energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In addition to frequency changes, the shocked photonic
      crystal has the capability of trapping light for a period of time
      in a defect state located at the shock front, as in FIG. 3. While
      the light is being shifted up in frequency through the gap, it is
      trapped at the shock front. If the speed of the shock wave can be
      controlled, then the light in the localized defect state can be
      trapped there for a controlled time. The light can be released by
      running the shock forwards or backwards. In the forward case, the
      light is released at the top of the pre-shocked material gap. In
      the reverse case, the light is released at the original frequency
      that it was input. This scheme is an optical pulse delay, which
      can delay pulses of light "on the fly" by adjusting the shock
      velocity.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] FIG. 8 illustrates a schematic showing how the present
      invention is used to delay and alter the form of electromagnetic
      signals. The electromagnetic trapping effect observed in the shock
      wave scenario can be generated by a variety of other means. The
      most obvious is to actually change the distance between two
      photonic crystals using piezoelectric materials or other means, as
      in FIG. 1. Another means of generating the appropriate
      time-dependent effects is through the use of materials which
      change the dielectric constant under an applied electric field or
      applied change in temperature. Some of these materials can be
      modulated at GHz frequencies with 1% changes in the refractive
      index. Other possible ways of producing similar effects in
      photonic crystals may involve the simultaneous interaction of
      light with a spinning disk and an object fixed in the laboratory
      frame.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The incorporation of crystal defects and defect bands into
      the shocked photonic crystal can also have useful properties. For
      example, consider electromagnetic energy which is shined into a
      defect band, as depicted in FIG. 9. The shock is propagating to
      the right and converts all the energy in the defect band up in
      frequency if the highest group velocity is less than the shock
      wave speed. If the group velocity of the energy in the defect band
      is less than the shock speed, then 100% of the energy will be
      converted in frequency, and can be extracted out the left side in
      the post-shocked material.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In addition, if the shock wave changes the amount of
      dispersion in that band, the frequency bandwidth can be changed by
      the shock wave. For example, if the shock is run in reverse, it
      will move the crystal defects apart as it propagates. This
      decreases the amount of dispersion in the defect band and forces
      all the light in that band to occupy a narrower bandwidth. Slow
      separation of the defects to infinity will force all of the light
      into a single frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] These ideas apply to any system which is described well by
      tight-binding. For example, efficient frequency conversion can be
      achieved in this fashion in a series of coupled inductor-capacitor
      resonators. If the frequency of the resonators is changed more
      quickly than the group velocity of the energy in the system, then
      100% of the input energy will be converted.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] There has been recent interest in nonlinear effects in
      light trapped in localized states in photonic crystals. The
      conversion of light from frequency [omega] to 3[omega] can be
      accomplished more efficiently than usual through the use of such
      localized states which do not have a well-defined momentum.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] It is possible to achieve large amplitudes localized at the
      shock front. These large amplitudes are a result of the adiabatic
      compression of an extended state to a localized state. These
      amplitudes increase with the size of the system and increase as
      the shock velocity decreases. Amplitudes of several orders of
      magnitude higher than the amplitude in the pre-shock region are
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] If the intensity of electromagnetic radiation in the defect
      state at the shock front is sufficiently high that non-linear
      material effects become important, then light of frequency
      3[omega] may be generated, where w is the frequency of the defect
      state. In this case, as the frequency of the light in the defect
      state changes, so will the 3[omega] generated by nonlinearities.
      If 3[omega] is a frequency which coincides with allowed modes of
      the system, this light will be able to escape the shock front and
      propagate away.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] In addition to large frequency changes and bandwidth
      narrowing, it is possible to observe other novel effects in
      photonic crystals which are modulated in a shock-like pattern. For
      example, a reverse Doppler shift from a moving boundary in a
      photonic crystal can be observed using a dielectric of the form
      [mathematical formula - see original document] This is shown in
      FIG. 10.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] FIG. 10 illustrates a graph of the dielectric as a function
      of position for three equally-spaced instants of time,
      t1&lt;t2&lt;t3. Arrows follow the shock front and material paths,
      which move at different speeds. In this case, a moving interface
      exists between a photonic crystal and a uniform dielectric medium
      and the photonic crystal does not move relative to the uniform
      medium, but movement of the interface causes an expansion or
      growth of the crystal region.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] FIG. 11 shows the effect of this dielectric on a Gaussian
      pulse, which propagates toward the moving interface from the
      uniform dielectric region. The light is at a frequency where it is
      completely reflected by the bandgap region of the crystal, and a
      negative Doppler shift is observed. Here, [gamma]&lt;-1&gt; =1.8,
      and [nu]=0.125c. A similar simulation was performed for a Gaussian
      pulse around [omega]=0.19, in which a zero Doppler shift was
      observed. A positive Doppler shift was observed for incident
      frequencies between about 0.19 and the top of the reflecting
      bandgap.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] It is also possible to make light of a single frequency
      split into multiple discrete frequencies. This is illustrated in
      FIG. 12. This simulation is similar to that in FIG. 11 except the
      dielectric in the crystal region has additional high spatial
      frequency components. The dielectric is [mathematical formula -
      see original document] with shock front thickness parameter,
      [gamma]&lt;-1&gt; =0.013 and [nu]=0.025 c.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The Gaussian pulse incident from the right in FIG. 11 is
      split into evenly spaced frequencies upon reflection. Some of the
      light is reflected with no frequency shift. The intensity of each
      of the reflected frequency components can be controlled by
      adjusting the form of the dielectric in the crystal region. As in
      the cases of FIGS. 3 and 4, the interpretation of the reflected
      light as evenly-spaced discrete frequencies or as a periodic
      modulation of a single frequency is a matter of experimental
      timescale resolution.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The phenomena observed in FIGS. 3 and 4 can be largely
      understood by considering the time-evolution of the various
      allowed modes as the shock propagates. Each time the shock wave
      propagates through one lattice unit, the crystal on the right in
      FIG. 2 is reduced in length by one lattice unit and the crystal on
      the left is increased by one lattice unit. Since the number of
      allowed values of k in a band is equal to the number of lattice
      periods in the crystal (ignoring polarization degeneracy) each
      time the shock wave passes over one lattice unit, the number of
      states in each band in the pre-shocked crystal must decrease by
      one and increase by one in the post-shocked crystal. This transfer
      process is indicated by the mode movement arrows in FIG. 2 for the
      lowest two bands. It should be noted that to accomplish this in
      the case of the second band, it is necessary for a mode to move up
      through the overlapping gap formed by the second bandgap in the
      preshocked region and the first bandgap in the postshocked region.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Indeed, the large frequency changes in FIGS. 3 and 4 are a
      direct result of the adiabatic evolution of the light through this
      overlapping bandgap. The light is essentially trapped in a cavity
      which is "squeezed" as the shock compresses the lattice, thereby
      increasing the frequency. This occurs once each time the shock
      propagates through a lattice unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] While a significant change in the frequency of
      electromagnetic radiation through mechanical means usually
      requires the interaction with objects that are moving at a
      significant fraction of the speed of light, the adiabatic approach
      does not have this requirement. The adiabatic nature of the
      evolution of the radiation up in frequency through the total
      system bandgap has the property that it can be arbitrarily slowly
      completed with the same large shifts in frequency. This key
      physical mechanism liberates the shocked photonic crystal from the
      impossible task of interface propagation near the speed of light.
      Finally, it should be noted that a time-reversed, frequency
      lowering effect also occurs in this adiabatic picture.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The adiabatic picture is valid as long as the scattering
      processes involved with the incident light reflecting from the
      shock wave do not introduce frequency components that are
      significantly outside the original input pulse bandwidth.
      Therefore, the more time the incident light spends interacting
      with the shock front, the more likely it is for this condition to
      hold. This condition is satisfied for the systems exemplified in
      FIGS. 3 and 5, mostly satisfied for the system shown in FIG. 4,
      and completely invalid for the systems in FIGS. 11 and 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] To develop a non-adiabatic theory, a scenario is provided
      where the incident light is at a frequency that falls within the
      gap of the compressed crystal. However, the systems depicted in
      FIGS. 1 and 10 must be treated slightly differently. Let us begin
      with the case in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Far away from the shock front, the electric field in the
      pre-shocked photonic crystal is given by E(x,t)=E0e&lt;ikx&gt;
      wk,n(x)e&lt;-i[omega]t&gt; , (4) where k and n denote the
      translational and band indices, and wk,n(x) has the periodicity of
      the lattice, wk,n(x+[alpha])=wk,n(x).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Since the frequency of the incident light lies within the
      bandgap of the compressed photonic crystal, an effective model of
      the shock front is a mirror with a space-dependent E field
      reflection coefficient, R(x), where x is the mirror position. R
      has the property that R(x)=1, since the incident light reflects
      from the bandgap of the post-shocked crystal. In general, R has
      some frequency dependence, but the bandwidth of the incident light
      is considered sufficiently small to neglect it. If the shock front
      is stationary, the boundary condition in terms of incident and
      reflected light is E1e&lt;ik&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;x&gt;
      wk1,n(x)e&lt;-i[omega]&gt; &lt;1&gt; &lt;t&gt; =E0R(x)e&lt;ik&gt;
      &lt;0&gt; &lt;x&gt; wk0,n(x)e&lt;-i[omega]&gt; &lt;0&gt; &lt;t&gt;
      , (5) where ko and kl correspond to the incident and reflected
      states, respectively, and E0 and E1 are constants.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] For light near the band edge at k=0, the frequency has the
      form [omega]=[omega]0+[alpha]k&lt;2&gt; . This substitution can be
      made without loss of generality because the condition near any
      band edge can be obtained by considering k-&gt;k-kedge and a
      redefinition of the function wk,n(x). If an assumption is made
      that the shock is moving sufficiently slowly that the reflected
      light has the form of a single Bloch state, then a substitution
      can be made, x-&gt;xo-[nu]t, to obtain a relation for the boundary
      condition at the shock front. This gives [mathematical formula -
      see original document] where El(t) now has some amplitude
      time-dependence due to the term in brackets.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] It can be shown that, near a band edge where k is small,
      [mathematical formula - see original document] where un(x) has the
      periodicity of the lattice and is independent of k. Equation (6)
      can be further simplified by noting that when [mathematical
      formula - see original document] and, likewise for ko, the term in
      brackets in Equation 6 is unity, and El(t) is time-independent.
      Since small k is near the Brillouin zone center, this should be
      the case most of the time. If R(x)=-1 as for a metallic mirror,
      the time-dependence of Equation 6 must satisfy, [alpha]k1&lt;2&gt;
      -[alpha]k0&lt;2&gt; +(k1-k0)[nu]=0. (8) This gives a frequency
      shift of [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The last relation is given in terms of the group velocity
      defined by [mathematical formula - see original document] The
      relation between incident and reflected group velocities can be
      expressed as [nu]g,l=2[nu]-[nu]g,o. If [nu]&lt;0 and [nu]g,o&lt;0,
      the mirror is moving to the right and incident light propagates to
      the left.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] There are two remarkable features of Equation 9. The first
      is that, in the slow velocity limit where [mathematical formula -
      see original document] the Doppler shift 2[nu]ko is much smaller
      in magnitude than the usual vacuum Doppler shift [mathematical
      formula - see original document] near the Brillouin zone center.
      The second notable feature is that for [nu]&lt;0, above the
      bandgap where [alpha]&gt;0 the Doppler shift is positive, whereas
      below the bandgap where [alpha]&gt;0, the Doppler shift is
      negative. Therefore, incident light is Doppler shifted away from
      the bandgap region on both sides of the bandgap.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] It is interesting to note that the term in brackets in
      Equation (6) changes phase slowly except when [mathematical
      formula - see original document] when the phase can change very
      rapidly. This indicates that the reflected frequencies are very
      sensitive to the position of the reflector in these special
      regions for light where [mathematical formula - see original
      document] This property could be useful in resolving the motion of
      objects which have oscillation amplitudes much smaller than the
      wavelength of the light they are reflecting, or for mechanical
      modulation of optical signals.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Considering the case of FIG. 10 where the pre-shocked
      material is completely uniform; light in the uniform region that
      reflects from the photonic crystal region can be endowed with an
      anomalous Doppler shift, as in FIG. 11, and be split into multiple
      frequencies, as in FIG. 12.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] It should be noted that it is not possible to observe these
      effects by simply translating a photonic crystal through a uniform
      medium because the reflection coefficient for the photonic crystal
      in that case is constant, as in the case of a metal mirror. The
      new key physical phenomena that appear in this section result from
      the fact that the photonic crystal region "grows" into the uniform
      region, and not merely translates.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] As a simple description of the phenomena in FIGS. 11 and
      12, the photonic crystal boundary is represented as a
      space-dependent reflection coefficient. The reflected light can be
      expanded in the plane wave solutions of the uniform medium,
      [mathematical formula - see original document] where R(x) can be
      written R(x)=[Sigma]G[beta]Ge&lt;-iGx &gt; which is the most
      general form with the property R(x)=R(x+[alpha]). The reciprocal
      lattice vectors G are [mathematical formula - see original
      document] where q is an integer. This substitution and letting
      x-&gt;x0-[nu]t yield a relation required by the time dependence of
      Equation (10) of, [omega]G+kG[nu]=[omega]0+k0[nu]-G[nu] (11) where
      the j index has been replaced with the reciprocal lattice vector
      index G. The reflected frequencies in the non-relativistic limit
      are, [omega]G-[omega]0=(2k-G)[nu]. (12) The reflected light has
      frequency components that differ from the usual Doppler shift by
      the amount G[nu]. For light near the first bandgap frequency,
      G[nu] is on the order of or larger than the Doppler shift from a
      metal mirror. The amplitude of each of these components is,
      EG=[beta]G¦¦E0. (13)<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The reverse Doppler shift scenario in FIG. 11 corresponds
      to the case where the only dominant component of
      R(x)=[Sigma]G[beta]Ge&lt;--iGx &gt; is the one corresponding to
      [mathematical formula - see original document] Equation (12)
      indicates that the reflected light should have a single frequency
      with a negative shift if [nu]&lt;0, ko&lt;0, and [mathematical
      formula - see original document] which is the case in FIG. 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The multiple reflected frequencies of FIG. 12 are also
      represented by Equation 12. In this case R(x) has several spatial
      frequency components, which result from the high spatial frequency
      components in [epsilon](x) for the crystal given by Equation 3.
      Furthermore, the incident light in the simulation in FIG. 12 has
      wavevector [mathematical formula - see original document] which is
      coincident with a value of G for the crystal. Therefore, some of
      the reflected light has the same frequency as the incident light.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] Equation (12) is based on the assumption of a very sharp
      shock front. FIG. 10 was produced with a relatively broad shock
      front width greater than [alpha], which has the effect of
      suppressing multiple reflected frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] Consider the non-adiabatic model associated with the
      scenario of FIG. 1. With the limit [nu]-&gt;0, the non-adiabatic <br>
      model reduces to the adiabatic limit and provides some new
      physical insight. As was previously discussed, the adiabatic limit
      is achievable by increasing the time the incident light spends
      interacting with the shock front. Therefore, the adiabatic limit
      is taken by considering the effect of repeated bounces of the
      light from the slowly moving reflector where each bounce is
      described by Equation (6). It is envisioned that the light bounces
      between the slowly moving reflector and a fixed reflector
      positioned a distance L&gt;&gt;[alpha] in the crystal. Let
      R(x)[identical to]e&lt;i[theta](x)&gt; , and let the term in
      brackets in Equation 6 be denoted by e&lt;iP(x&gt; &lt;0&gt;
      &lt;-[nu]t)&gt; . Assigning unit magnitude for the term in
      brackets in Equation (6) is acceptable for all time in the limit
      of small v where kl-&gt;ko. Then, the time dependence of Equation
      (6) requires, [alpha]k1&lt;2&gt; +k1[nu]=[alpha]k0&lt;2&gt;
      +k0[nu]+[theta]'(x0-[nu]t0)[nu]+P'(x0-[nu]t0)[nu], (14) where
      [theta] and P have been linearized about t0, which is valid in the
      limit [nu]-&gt;0. Primes denote derivatives. Then, after p bounces
      off the light between the stationary and moving reflectors,
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The number of bounces of the light p that occur during a
      time [alpha]/[nu] when the reflector moves through one lattice
      constant is [mathematical formula - see original document] The
      variation of [nu]g over this time can be neglected in the limit
      L&gt;&gt;[alpha].<br>
      <br>
      [0109] Taking the limits [nu]-&gt;0 (p-&gt;[infinity]) and
      L&lt;&lt;[alpha] give, [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The periodicity of the crystal gives the property that
      [theta](x+[alpha])-[theta](x)=2[pi]l, and the periodicity of wk,n
      gives the property that P(x+[alpha])-P(x)=2[pi]m, where l and m
      are integers. This substitution and some simplification gives the
      final result for the adiabatic change in k during the propagation
      of the shock over one lattice constant, [mathematical formula -
      see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0111] The integer m is related to the particular bandgap around
      which wk,n describes states. It can be shown that for a sinusoidal
      dielectric, m=-1 above and below the first bandgap, m=-2 above and
      below the second bandgap, and so on. The integer l is also related
      to the particular bandgap from which light is reflecting. For a
      sinusoidal dielectric, l=1 for the first bandgap, l=2 for the
      second, and so on for the higher bandgaps. While quantum numbers
      are preserved in an adiabatic evolution, the k values referred to
      here change during an adiabatic evolution because they are
      convenient labels, not quantum numbers.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] When Equation (17) is applied to the scenario in FIG. 2,
      l+m=1-2=-1, which indicates that the k quantum number of light
      will adiabatically decrease one k quantum for each lattice
      constant the shock wave moves. This is consistent with the
      adiabatic picture presented above which shows that one mode of the
      system must move up through the total system gap per lattice unit
      the shock traverses in FIG. 2. Furthermore, the invariance of the
      adiabatic picture to the details of crystal structure provides a
      general proof that the above statements about m and l hold for all
      crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0113] Another interesting case is when the shock interface
      separates two crystals of differing bandgap sizes such that light
      near the first bandgap in the pre-shocked crystal reflects from
      the first bandgap of the post-shocked crystal. In this case,
      l+m=1-1=0, indicating there is no net Doppler shift for small
      shock velocities. This absence has been observed in FDTD
      simulations.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] While there are numerous ways to increase the bandwidth of
      a wave packet, there are, to our knowledge, currently no
      non-quantum mechanical ways to decrease the bandwidth. An
      important implication of this adiabatic evolution of light is that
      the bandwidth of a pulse of light can be modified in a controlled
      fashion while bouncing between the moving shock wave and a fixed
      reflecting surface, as in FIG. 5. Equation (17) indicates the
      width of a wavepacket in crystal momentum space [delta]k should be
      preserved after many bounces because every k state moves by the
      same amount. The dispersion relation near a band edge indicates
      the bandwidth [delta][omega] for a wavepacket of width [delta]k is
      a function of k near the band edge,
      [delta][omega]=2[alpha]k[delta]k. Therefore, the bandwidth of a
      pulse will be altered as it evolves through k-space during the
      bouncing. This fact enables the compression of the bandwidth of a
      pulse of light to a vanishing amount in the limits of a large
      separation between the two reflecting surfaces and slowly moving
      shock front.<br>
      [0115] In FIG. 5, a wavepacket of mean wavevector k is shifted up
      in frequency toward the band edge, causing the bandwidth to
      decrease. The bandwidth is modified without a very large change in
      average frequency. However, if the wavepacket reaches the band
      edge, it will be trapped at the shock front and converted up in
      frequency until it is expelled at the frequency of the top of the
      bandgap. In this case, there is a large average frequency shift in
      addition to a narrowing in bandwidth. Both of these effects may
      have useful applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] These new technologies have a wide variety of possible
      applications. The ability to change the frequency of
      electromagnetic radiation over a wide frequency range (typically
      20% or more) with high efficiency is of significant value in the
      telecommunications industry. This industry utilizes a frequency
      range of about 3%.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] The capacity to delay a pulse of light for an amount of
      time which is determined while delaying has applications in the
      telecommunications industry. The capacity to reorder portions of
      optical signals can also have applications in the
      telecommunications industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] The capacity to convert a relatively broad bandwidth of
      frequencies to a nearly single frequency may have applications for
      the harnessing of solar energy. Current solar cells do not have
      the capacity to harness all frequency regions of the solar
      spectrum with high efficiency. A material with an electronic
      optical bandgap of a given frequency must be fabricated to harness
      the solar energy in the region of that frequency. Fabrication of
      such materials is currently not possible for the entire solar
      spectrum. The devices presented here allow the conversion of parts
      of the solar spectrum which may not be utilized by solar cells to
      a frequency which is efficiently converted to electricity. It is
      envisioned that this results in considerable increases in
      efficiency of solar cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The perfect absorption of a portion of the electromagnetic
      spectrum using these devices may be suited to applications where
      electromagnetic absorption is important.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] Some of the new physical phenomena presented in this paper
      are most pronounced for light close to the edge of a bandgap where
      group velocities are small. Group velocities two orders of
      magnitude less than that in air have been experimentally realized
      in photonic crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The generalized shock-like profiles of the dielectric
      discussed here could be generated by a variety of means. Materials
      which undergo a change in the dielectric constant under an applied
      electric field or applied change in temperature are promising
      candidates. Such an approach might make possible the control of
      the shock velocity and shock front thickness through
      time-dependent control of the local dielectric at all points in
      the system. It is also possible to launch a physical shock wave
      into the photonic crystal using explosive loading, high-intensity
      lasers, or other means. The phenomena in FIGS. 11 and 12 should be
      observable using this approach. Although large compressions are
      used to illustrate the phenomena in FIGS. 3 and 4, it should be
      noted that it is possible to observe the same phenomena with
      compressions of a few percent or less by considering the use of
      deliberately designed defect bands or overlapping bandgaps formed
      by higher frequency bandgaps in the pre- and post-shocked
      crystals.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Additionally, although this disclosure describes shock-like
      dielectric modulations, the observed phenomena can be observed in
      two and three dimensions and using other types of dielectric
      modulation. MEMS devices provide an avenue for the generation of
      time-dependent effects in photonic crystals. For example, the
      adiabatic transfer of light between the bottom and top of a
      bandgap may be accomplished by varying the air spacing between two
      photonic crystals of differing lattice constants in an oscillatory
      fashion. As another example, consider a rotating disk containing a
      spiral photonic crystal pattern. Small millimeter diameter MEMS
      disks have been made to rotate at millions of RPM in microengines.
      Light reflecting from the edge of such a disk will see a
      dielectric modulation identical to that of FIG. 10 as viewed in a
      reference frame where the shock front is stationary. Hence,
      various embodiments are envisioned using variations on this
      approach. Finally, small time-dependent changes in the dielectric
      can also be generated using non-linear materials. As examples of
      specific applications, an optical switch based on the present
      invention and a method for electromagnetic wave modulation and
      control through time-dependent photonic crystals are described
      below.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] FIG. 13 illustrates a device comprising two different
      photonic crystals which shifts light upwards in frequency. FIG. 14
      illustrates a device which shifts light down in frequency, wherein
      the device is designed so that the light does work on the photonic
      crystal on the right. If the photonic crystal on the right acts
      like an oscillation in position, energy is transferred to this
      oscillator as the conversion process proceeds. In principle, this
      energy can be extracted through the use of piezoelectric materials
      or other means.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] While the force felt by a reflecting surface reflecting a
      beam of light is ordinarily very small, this force is enhanced by
      many orders of magnitude in devices utilizing the teachings of the
      present invention. It is estimated that the forces supplied by
      light are of sufficient magnitude to displace a typical MEMS
      device on the order of 10% of the wavelength of 1.55 [mu]m light
      for intensities in the 10 milliwatt range. This allows for the
      possibility to control the geometry of MEMS devices with light.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] FIG. 15 represents a combination of FIGS. 13 and 14. Light
      of frequency [omega]0 is shined into the system from <br>
      right and left. When the center photonic crystal moves to the
      left, the light on the right is shifted down in frequency and the
      light on the left is shifted up in frequency. The system is
      designed so that the force supplied by the light on the right is
      greater than the force on the left. As a consequence of this, more
      energy must be extracted from the light which is shifted down than
      put into the light which is shifted up if the right and left
      inputs are of the same intensity. If the center crystal is mounted
      on an effective spring, it will return to and past its original
      position and the conversion process will begin again.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] As a consequence of the ability to change the geometry of
      MEMS devices with light using our technology, an all optical
      switch can be produced. FIG. 16 gives a schematic of a possible
      all optical switch. The input and output waveguides are coupled
      with a high Q cavity. The resonant frequency of the cavity can be
      controlled by changing the geometry. If the resonant frequency is
      close to the frequency of the input light, resonant tunneling can
      occur and 100% transmission can be achieved. This has been
      previously demonstrated in photonic crystal systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] If light which is shined into the gate waveguide gets
      trapped in a high-pressure state, the high Q cavity geometry may
      be altered. It is thus possible to turn the device on using only
      light. If the gate light source disappears, the device may still
      remain in the on configuration if light is still trapped in the
      high pressure state. The length of time the device stays in the on
      configuration will depend on the device design and the intensity
      of the initial gate pulse and the absorption coefficient of the
      photonic crystal material and the Q of the high pressure state.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] As mentioned above, another example as the present
      invention's application is a method for electromagnetic wave
      modulation and control through time-dependent photonic crystals.
      FIG. 17 illustrates the effects of a strategically placed moving
      reflecting surface in a photonic crystal on the electromagnetic
      radiation inside.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] There exist special places in a photonic crystal near a
      band edge where the phase of reflected light is a strong function
      of the velocity of the reflecting surface. These special locations
      exist in the neighborhood of places where dH/dx=0, where H is the
      magnetic field. If a reflecting surface, such as a mirror or
      another photonic crystal, is moved in the vicinity of these
      locations, an unusually large frequency shift of the reflected
      light may be observed. The presence of extra frequencies in the
      reflected signal is a form of modulation.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] FIG. 17 presents a 1-dimensional schematic of the
      utilization of this phenomenon. As the mirror 1702 on the left
      moves, light incident from the right is modulated as it is
      reflected. Hence, light which is incident from the right at a
      frequency just below the bandgap in the photonic crystal is
      reflected from the mirror. If the mirror is moving, a large
      Doppler shift is observed in the reflected light. This frequency
      shift or broadening is a modulation of the reflected light. This
      device allows the resolution of changes in location of the mirror
      on the left much less than the wavelength of the light shined in
      from the right in FIG. 17. FIG. 18 presents a specific example of
      how a signal can be transferred from one wavelength to another
      using a thin reflecting film as an intermediary. A signal on the
      left modulates the displacement of the thin film which modulates
      the light of a different frequency on the right side. This
      scenario is identical to FIG. 17 with the exception of the
      electromagnetic signal incident from the left which can be a
      source of modulation of the reflecting surface through photon
      pressure. The device of FIG. 18 allows for modulating a signal
      with another of different frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Applications which require resolution of reflecting objects
      which move length scales much less than the wavelength of the
      probe light can benefit from this technology. Miniaturized motion
      detectors for MEMS devices could be constructed. Additionally,
      this method of modulation is not bandwidth limited. The direct
      modulation of optical frequencies with signals that have a broad
      bandwidth can be accomplished using our invention. This can be
      very difficult to accomplish using electronics.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Hence, the present invention's devices allow the generation
      of an arbitrary frequency, which is tunable by adjusting the size
      of a bandgap. Generation of an arbitrary frequency through
      existing means is difficult and costly. The strong interaction of
      light and matter through the high pressure modes outlined here
      provides an alternating to nonlinear material effects which
      require high intensities and electronics which translate optical
      signals into mechanical effects. Frequency conversion can be
      accomplished through the present invention's devices without any
      supplied power or electronics. The perfect absorption of a portion
      of the electromagnetic spectrum using these devices may be suited
      to applications where electromagnetic absorption is important. The
      conversion of electromagnetic energy directly into mechanical
      energy may have applications in the solar power industry.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] FIG. 19 shows another approach in utilizing moving photonic
      crystals to achieve highly efficient frequency conversion of
      electromagnetic radiation. In particular, FIG. 19 shows a material
      2 having a nonlinear dielectric response, and a material 6 having
      a linear response. Electromagnetic radiation of frequencies
      [omega]1 and [omega]2 are shined in opposite directions. This
      creates a moving periodic modulation or moving grating of the
      dielectric, or moving photonic crystal 4, within the nonlinear
      region. Electromagnetic radiation to be frequency converted is
      shined from the linear region at a frequency [omega]3. The
      frequencies [omega]1 and [omega]2 are chosen so that [omega]3
      coincides with a bandgap frequency region of the moving photonic
      crystal in the nonlinear material. The input signal [omega]3
      signal has an exponentially decaying spatial dependence into the
      nonlinear region and is reflected from the moving photonic crystal
      and propagates away to the right at frequency [omega]4.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Note [omega]3 falls within one of the bandgaps of the
      moving photonic crystal 4. The efficiency of this conversion in a
      phase matched system is 100% for light of bandwidths below the
      bandgap size of the moving photonic crystal, which can be about
      10&lt;-3&gt; [omega]0 in practice. This method of frequency
      conversion can be performed on arbitrarily weak input signals. In
      addition to efficient frequency conversion, this technology may
      also have useful applications for quantum information processing
      due to the capability to manipulate low intensity signals combined
      with the preservation of signal bandwidth.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] This embodiment of the invention is a special case of
      4-wave mixing where the input signal exhibits an exponentially
      decaying spatial dependence in the nonlinear region.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] FIG. 20 shows the dielectric at three equally-spaced
      instants in time, t1&gt;t2&gt;t3. The arrows show the movement of
      the photonic crystal 4 in the nonlinear material 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] If the nonlinear material 2 utilized possesses a
      nonlinearity with a timescale fast enough to respond to the
      frequency [omega]1-[omega]2 but slow enough to average over
      [omega]1+[omega]2 then the interference of the pump beams [omega]1
      and [omega]2 produces a grating of lattice constant. [mathematical
      formula - see original document] with moving velocity
      [mathematical formula - see original document] where n is the
      refractive index of the nonlinear material, assumed to be
      independent of frequency in this case. The input frequency
      [omega]3 must satisfy, [omega]3 l[omega]2 Eq. 20 where l is a
      positive integer that corresponds to the particular bandgap from
      which the incident light reflects. This is an approximate relation
      because the photonic crystal bandgap has some non-zero width in
      frequency space. For this input frequency, the output frequency
      is, [omega]4 l[omega]1 Eq. 21 The amount of frequency shift is
      given by [mathematical formula - see original document] When l=1
      (input signal light reflects from the lowest frequency bandgap),
      the pump frequencies are equivalent to the input signal and output
      signal frequencies. The amount of frequency shift relative to the
      input frequency is given by, [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      <br>
      [0143] Analytical theory predicts that there is only one reflected
      frequency in the limit of a narrow photonic crystal bandgap. This
      fact enables 100% efficiency in the conversion process. In
      practice, the small bandgap in the nonlinear material is well into
      the single reflected frequency regime.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The previous results were derived using Galilean
      relativity, which holds correct when v&lt;&lt;c. Relativistic
      effects can be derived and shown to result in the production of
      extra reflected frequency components.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] FIG. 21 shows results of a computer simulation illustrating
      operation of the device. Light is incident to the left at
      frequency [omega]=0.01. The linear-nonlinear interface is at
      x=30a, where a is the lattice constant of the photonic crystal.
      Light is reflected from the interface and propagates to the right
      at multiple frequencies. The number of reflected frequencies will
      be 1 in the limit of a small photonic crystal bandgap, as will
      exist in practical setups. The simulations reported here utilize
      time-dependent modulations of the index in the nonlinear region,
      removing lo the need for the pump beams in the simulations. The
      simulations also possess perfect phase matching, i.e. the
      dielectric constant exhibits no frequency dependence.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] Under certain conditions, [Delta][omega]/[omega] in Eq. 23
      can be made infinite. In this case the input frequency is zero
      (i.e. a constant electric field). Computer simulation of this
      scenario is shown in FIG. 22. In FIG. 22, a constant electric
      field is applied in the linear region. This is upconverted to
      multiple equally spaced frequencies of similar intensity. Here the
      dielectric used is given in FIG. 20, and the velocity has been
      chosen to make the denominator of Eq. 23 is zero. Maximum
      frequency produced in this scenario is extremely sensitive to the
      bandwidth of the input signal in this case. It is also sensitive
      to the frequency dependence of the dielectric which can have an
      effect on the degree of phase matching.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] This scenario requires the grating to be moving at the
      speed of light in the nonlinear material, so only one pump
      frequency [omega]1 is required in this case. A fast nonlinear
      response can be required to produce a periodic index modulation
      that is sufficiently fast to observe nonlinear effects in this
      case. Nonlinear response times on the femtosecond time scale exist
      in AiGaAs and other materials with a non-resonant excitation. This
      timescale is fast enough to observe the effects.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] In this embodiment of the invention, it is described in 1D,
      but higher spatial dimensions can be exploited. For example, the
      input frequency [omega]3 can be shined on the linear-nonlinear
      interface at an angle. Since the bandgap frequency of the photonic
      crystal in the nonlinear material is a function of this angle, the
      angle can be varied to obtain high conversion efficiency rather
      than vary the frequencies of [omega]1 and/or [omega]2.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] The bandwidth region where 100% frequency conversion is
      obtained depends on the power of the beams used to generate the
      moving grating in the nonlinear material. The typical bandwidth
      where 100% conversion efficiency can be obtained with the new
      approach can be up to 10&lt;-3 &gt; [omega]0, where [omega]0 is
      the average frequency to be converted. These bandwidths are
      determined by the degree of material nonlinearity and the
      intensity of the light used to generate the moving grating.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The exponentially decaying nature of the converted light
      within the photonic bandgap frequency region in the photonic
      crystal in FIG. 19 results in a small device. The localization
      length of light in the photonic crystal is typically between
      10&lt;3&gt; [lambda] to 10&lt;4&gt; [lambda] where [lambda] is the
      wavelength of light to be converted. Some existing approaches to
      nonlinear frequency conversion require the use of kilometer
      lengths of fiber to obtain reasonable efficiencies. This
      exponentially decaying spatial dependence of light in the
      nonlinear region may also decrease the importance of any phase
      mismatches that can prevent efficient conversion.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] Although the present invention has been shown and described
      with respect to several preferred embodiments thereof, various
      changes, omissions and additions to the form and detail thereof,
      may be made therein, without departing from the spirit and scope
      of the invention.<br>
