          A remarkable scene took place in the legislature of Arizona
          this spring when the lawmakers enthusiastically voted for the
          parole of a certain convict in the State penitentiary,
          granting him a leave of absence for 30 days and by means of
          private contributions raising a fund to defray his expenses to
          Washington DC and return.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The prisoner, Roy J. Meyers,
          is serving a 3-1/2 year sentence, but in spite of the fact
          that he bears the stigma of a convicted lawbreaker, he has
          demonstrated that a convict can be a useful member of society.
          During his imprisonment he perfected an electrical device of
          such original character as to arouse feelings of wonder and
          skepticism until experts had seen it in actual operation. It
          is a device to draw electricity from the atmosphere for light
          and power, and the 30-day parole was granted in order that the
          inventor might protect his rights through the patent office at
          Washington.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">With the acquiescence of the
          legislature, Governor Hunt granted the parole and the prisoner
          was allowed to go free without any guard or any assurance but
          his word of honor that he would return. Two days before the
          period had elapsed, Meyer again presented himself before the
          governor, having accomplished his mission, and then returned
          to the penitentiary at Florence, where he continues to serve
          his sentence.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This, in brief, is the
          picturesque story which has called attention of the civilized
          world to a newly discovered electrical genius, and to another
          feature of the case which is of equal importance and human
          interest; namely, the enlightened policy pursued by our
          youngest State in its treatment of convicts...</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before entering the prison,
          Meyer had already applied for various patents, among them one
          for an improved trolley wheel head which prevents the trolley
          wheel from jumping the wire. Meyers had a conference with
          Superintendent Sims and Parole Clerk Sanders, and it was to
          these gentlemen that the inventor first explained the
          principles of his new device for securing electrical energy
          from the air. The officials were willing to give the man the
          opportunity to develop his plan and a little wooden building
          outside the walls was turned over to Meyers and was fitted up
          as a workshop and a laboratory. The first demonstration of the
          new apparatus was made shortly thereafter, the electricity
          drawn from the atmosphere being used to spark the gas engines
          of the pump house, and although the device was crude yet it
          did the work, and removed the doubts of his friends. Furtter
          development of the "absorber" followed, and his second model
          was constructed, and developed 8 volts. The machine came to
          the attention of the remarkable woman who brought his name
          before the legislature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This was Miss Kate Barnard,
          State Commissioner of Charities and Corrections of Oklahoma,
          who was a guest of Mr. Sims, while studying prison conditions.
          She saw the machine at work, became familiar with the facts of
          Meyers' case, and was impressed by his rather blunt and
          unaffected personality, for Meyers has nothing of the polish
          or glibness of the poseur. He is a simple, earnest student of
          mechanical problems and not the sort of man to make a
          sentimental appeal for sympathy because of any grace of person
          or manner. Therefore it was the value of Meyers' invention,
          together with his essential integrity (in spite of his lapse)
          which so strongly impressed Miss Barnard that when she
          appeared before the Arizona legislature not long afterwards,
          addressing that body on the need of enlightened legislature
          along the line of her own work, she told the story of Roy
          Meyers and his epoch-making invention.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, early in May, Meyers set
          out for Washington, unaccompanied.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In his own words: "When I
          arrived in Washington and laid my plans before the patent
          office experts, they merely smiled and told me that I would
          have to build a model and demonstrate my claims --- that it
          seemed strange that I, unknown as I am in the electrical
          world, should have accomplished the things for which Edison,
          Tesla and other experts have been striving for years.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"They could grasp the
          meaning of my drawings nor the explanation I tried to make to
          them. There was little time to spare, as I had only 20 days
          left of my leave, but I set to work in a few days was able to
          take a crude model around to the patent office to make a
          demonstration.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"Arriving at the patent
          office I telephoned to a friend who had been so kind as to
          introduce me and aid me in reaching the proper officials. The
          absorber was hoisted on two short poles and made to work.
          While they were as yet unable to understand the principles
          involved and hardly willing to believe their eyes, they were
          forced to admit that I had something new and different, and
          they told me that there would be no further objection; that I
          might file my application without further delay.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"I hope to construct my
          first large machine right here in Phoenix. I feel grateful; to
          Governor Hunt and others for what they have done for me and to
          the help they have given in securing protection I might not
          otherwise have had, and I am desirous of demonstrating this
          gratitude. I am going back to Florence today to resume the
          serving of my sentence, which will expire in 10 months. Then,
          here in Phoenix, I will begin the work of making my machines."</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">While there are some details
          of the device which the inventor refuses to make public, yet
          there are many general features that may be explained. It is
          planned that the machine, to be set up in Phoenix, will
          generate sufficient power to light the city, and will consist
          of a 200 foot tower upon which is placed the "absorber". The
          latter consists of a series of magnetized steel plates set in
          a circle (the manner of preparing them is kept secret) and
          this mechanism attracts the electricity from the atmosphere.
          This is carried by wires to a transformer in the engine house
          below and thence is applied to produce either power or light
          after the usual manner.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an authorized statement
          Meyers says: "The flow of electricity is constant. When it
          emerges into the transformer it is in the form of a direct
          current. It will absorb the electricity day and night and will
          work whenever the wireless will work. I can put up a plant to
          supply such a building as the Adams Hotel for about $1500, and
          one of the principal items of the expense is the cost of the
          towers, the wires, the magnetizing of one set of plates, which
          is part of the secret of the treatment which makes it respond
          to the accumulations of the atmosphere.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"For use in the case of an
          electrical storm I have made what I call a modified form of
          circuit breaker, such as is commonly used as a lightning
          arrester on telegraph lines. In case of a storm the
          accumulator would suddenly become overcharged, possibly, and
          as the electricity would not of itself flow back into the air,
          the result might be disastrous. So I send it down into the
          ground, whenever the voltage rises above a certain amount."</font>

      <p>Working quietly in the heart of Baltimore for weeks on an
        invention which some critics say will revolutionize the method
        of converting electricity to practical use has been Roy J.
        Meyers, who like Benjamin Franklin, extracts the electric
        current from the air. </p>
      <p>Mr Meyers invention was made last summer while he was confined
        in the penitentiary at Florence, Arizona. His first finished
        apparatus was made in Baltimore. </p>
      <p>A practical, unlettered electrician, Mr Meyers, while in
        Arizona, was arrested on a comparatively minor charge and sent
        to the penitentiary. There he was placed in charge of the prison
        electrical plant, and there he says he made his discovery that
        the current which the civilized world is beginning to use most
        extensively for light and power could be transformed from the
        atmosphere without the aid of moving machines or batteries. </p>
      <p>Miss Kate Barnard, Commissioner of Charities and Corrections,
        of Oklahoma, hearing of Meyers’ invention and of his desire to
        have it patented, appeared before the Arizona Legislature to
        make an appeal in behalf of the young convict. As a result a
        special bill was passed which granted Meyers a month’s leave of
        absence on parole. He went unaccompanied to Washington, filed
        his patent applications and returned to the penitentiary. Since
        then he has been indefinitely paroled. </p>
      <p>He came to Baltimore as the place where he could easily obtain
        the mechanical parts needed to make a more nearly perfect
        machine than the crude model he has fashioned in the
        penitentiary workshop, and is making his headquarters here while
        working on his invention. With him is W.E. Chenot, who has been
        his assistant in assembling and testing the machine and who says
        that he has bought Meyers’ patent rights for Germany. </p>
      <p>They have proved beyond doubt that the invention is practical
        and that when finally brought to a state of perfection it will
        introduce a new epoch in the industrial use of electricity. By
        Westinghouse meters they tested the strength of the current
        gathered from the air, and with the use of only two of the four
        rectifying transformers the voltmeter recorded four and one-half
        volts, and the ammeter, which had the capacity of recording 75
        amperes, was broken by the force of the current. </p>
      <p>The machine itself is simple. It is in reality a transformer,
        which is familiar to anyone knowing anything at all about
        electricity in its practical uses. On a high tripod, which
        resembles somewhat the framework of a windmill tower, is the
        transformer, which Mr Meyers calls his ‘absorber’. It is made up
        of an iron core, wrapped with copper wire. The secret of the
        invention is the manner in which the disks composing this
        ‘absorber’ are magnetized, and this secret Meyers says he found
        by accident while at work in prison. </p>
      <p>What the machine, when finally perfected, will do is yet to be
        seen. Its inventor claims that it will greatly reduce the cost
        of making electricity. No batteries of any kind are needed, he
        says, and not a part of the machine turns upon the other. It is
        as durable, apparently, as an electric light pole. One of these
        machines, says Meyers, when perfected may be placed on a vehicle
        and transform enough electricity to give motive power, be that
        vehicle a locomotive or an automobile. He declared it can be
        placed on a building to furnish electric lights or power, and
        that the only wear will be upon the machinery which its current
        runs. </p>
      <p>Meyers is 34 years old and he gained his knowledge of
        electricity by working in shops along the Pacific Coast. The
        depths of the mysteries of electricity he has not explored, but
        he is certain that he has found the means of absorbing it from
        the air and of converting it to the use of mankind. </p>

      <p> <b>Abstract ~ </b>Vapour apparatus, arrangements of. - A
        rectifier for use with apparatus for producing electricity from
        the earth consists of mercury- vapour lamps constructed and
        arranged as shown in Fig. 4. Each lamp comprises two wires
        6&lt;1&gt;, 7&lt;1&gt; wound around a steel tube 15 surrounding
        a mercury tube 11 preferably of copper. The coil 6&lt;1&gt; is
        connected between the electrode 14 and the terminal 18, and the
        coil 7&lt;1&gt; between the terminals 19, 5. The coils
        6&lt;1&gt;, 7&lt;1&gt; are preferably composed of soft iron.
        Reference has been directed by the Comp- troller to
        Specifications 16,709/87, 14,033/99, and 5457/11, [all in Class
        53, Galvanic batteries], and 15,412/06. </p>
      <p>This invention relates to improvements in apparatus for the
        production of electrical currents, and the primary object in
        view is the production of a commercially serviceable electrical
        current without the employment of mechanical or chemical action.
        To this end the invention comprises means for producing what I
        believe to be dynamic electricity from the earth and its ambient
        elements. </p>
      <p>I am, of course aware that it has been proposed to obtain
        static charges from upper strata of the atmosphere, but such
        charges are recognized as of widely variant potential and have
        thus far proved of no practical commercial value, and the
        present invention is distinguished from all such apparatus as
        has heretofore been employed for attracting static charges by
        the fact that this improved apparatus is not designed or
        employed to produce or generate irregular, fluctuating or other
        electrical charges which lack constancy, but on the other hand I
        have by actual test been able to produce from a very small
        apparatus at comparatively low elevation, say about 50 or 60
        feet above the earth’s surface, a substantially constant current
        at a commercially usable voltage and amperage. This current I
        ascertained by repeated tests is capable of being readily
        increased by additions of the unit elements in the apparatus
        hereinafter set forth, and I am convinced from the constancy of
        the current obtained and its comparatively low potential that
        the current is dynamic and not static, although, of course, it
        is not impossible that certain static discharges occur and, in
        fact, I have found occasion to provide against the damage which
        might result from such discharge by the provision of lightning
        arresters and cut-out apparatus which assist in rendering the
        obtained current stable by eliminating sudden fluctuations which
        sometimes occur during conditions of high humidity from what I
        consider static discharges. The nature of my invention is
        obviously such that I have been unable to establish
        authoritatively all of the principles involved, and some of the
        theories herein expressed may possibly prove erroneous, but I do
        know and am able to demonstrate that the apparatus which I have
        discovered does produce, generate, or otherwise acquire a
        difference of potential representing a current amperage above
        stated, or varied therefrom at the will of the operator
        according to the uses which the current is to be subjected. </p>
      <p>The invention comprises generically means for producing
        electrical currents of serviceable potential substantially
        without the employment of mechanical or chemical action, and in
        this connection I have been able to observe no chemical action
        whatever on the parts utilized although deterioration may
        possibly occur in some of the parts, but so far as I am able to
        determine such deterioration&nbsp; does not add to the current
        supply but is merely incidental to the effect of climatic
        action. </p>
      <p>The invention more specifically comprises the employment of a
        magnet or magnets and a co-operating element, such as zinc
        disposed adjacent to the magnet or magnets and connected in such
        manner and arranged relative to the earth so as to produce
        current, my observation being that current is produced only when
        such magnets have their poles facing substantially to the north
        and south and the zincs are disposed substantially along the
        magnets. </p>
      <p>The invention also comprehends other details of construction,
        combinations and arrangements of parts as will hereinafter be
        fully set forth and claimed. </p>

      <p>Referring to the drawing by numerals, 1,1 indicates magnets
        connected by a magnetic substance 2, preferably an iron wire.
        The magnets 1 are arranged in pairs, one pair being spaced
        beneath the other, and interposed between the magnets are zinc
        plates 3,3 connected by an iron wire conductor 4. Suitable
        insulating supports 5 are arranged for sustaining the respective
        magnets 1 and plates 3,3. Each plate 3 is preferably bent
        substantially into V form, as clearly seen in Figure 1, and the
        V1 of one of the plates opens or faces toward the north and the
        V of the other plate to the South. I have determined by
        experimentation that it is essential that the plates 3 be
        disposed substantially north and south with their flat faces
        approximately parallel to the adjacent faces of the co-operating
        magnets, although by experience I have not discovered any
        material difference in the current obtained when the plates are
        disposed slightly to one side of north and south, as for
        instance when the plates are disposed slightly to one side of
        north and south, as for instance when disposed in the line of
        the magnetic polarity of the earth. The same is true with
        respect to the magnets 1, the said magnets being disposed
        substantially north and south for operative purposes, although I
        find that it is immaterial whether the north pole of one of the
        magnets is disposed to the north and the south pole to the
        south, or vice versa, and it is my conviction from experience
        that it is essential to have the magnets of each pair connected
        by magnetic material so that the magnets substantially become
        one with a pole exposed to the north and a pole exposed to the
        north. In Figure 1, I have indicated in full lines by the
        letters 8 and N the respective polarities of the magnets 1, and
        have indicated in dotted lines the other pole of those magnets
        when the connection 2 is severed. I have found that the magnets
        and zinc plates operate to produce, whether by collection or
        generation I am not certain, electrical currents when disposed
        substantially north and south, but when disposed substantially
        east and west no such currents are produced. I also find that
        the question of elevation is by no means vital, but it is true
        that more efficient results are obtained by placing the zincs
        and magnets on elevated supports. I furthermore find from tests
        that it is possible to obtain currents from the apparatus with
        the zincs and magnets disposed in a building or otherwise
        enclosed, although more efficient results are obtained by having
        the said elements arranged in the open. </p>
      <p>While in Figures 1, 2, and 3, I have shown the magnets and the
        zinc plates as superimposed, it will be apparent, as hereinafter
        fully set forth, that these elements may be juxtaposed in
        horizontal planes, and substantially the same results will be
        secured. Furthermore, the magnets 1 with the interposed zincs 3,
        as shown in Figures 1, 2 and 3 merely represent a unit which may
        be repeated either horizontally or vertically for increasing the
        current supply, and when the unit is repeated the zinc plates
        are arranged alternating with the magnets throughout the entire
        series as hereinafter indicated. </p>
      <p>A conductor 6 is connected in multiple with the conductors 2
        and a conductor 7 is connected with conductor 4, the conductor 6
        extending to one terminal of a rectifier which I have indicated
        by the general reference character 8, and the conductor 7
        extending to the other terminal of said rectifier. The rectifier
        as seen in diagram in Figure 1 may assume any of several well
        known embodiments of the electrical valve type and may consist
        of four asymmetric cells or Cooper-Hewitt mercury vapor lamps
        connected as indicated in Figure 1 for permitting communication
        of the positive impulses from the conductor 6 only to the line
        conductor 9 and the negative impulses from conductor 6 on only
        to the line conductor 10. The current from this rectifier may be
        delivered through the conductors 9 and 10 to any suitable source
        for consumption. </p>
      <p>While the said rectifier 8 may consist of any of the known
        types, as above outlined, it preferably consists of a specially
        constructed rectifier which also has the capacity of
        intensifying the current and comprises specifically the elements
        shown in detail in Figures 4, 5, and 6 wherein I have disclosed
        the detail wiring of the rectifier when composed of four of the
        rectifying and intensify in elements instead of asymmetric cells
        or simple mercury vapor valves. As each of these structures is
        an exact embodiment of all the others, one only will be
        described, and the description will apply to all. The rectifying
        element of each construction consists of a mercury tube 11 which
        is preferably formed of glass or other suitable material, and
        comprises a cylinder having its end portions tapered and each
        terminating in an insulating plug or stopper 12. Through the
        upper stopper 12 is extended the electrode 13 which extends well
        into the tube and preferably substantially one-half the length
        thereof to a point adjacent the inner end of an opposing
        electrode 14 which latter electrode extends thence downwardly
        through the insulation 12 at the lower end of the tube. The tube
        11 is supplied with mercury and is adapted to operate on the
        principle of the mercury vapor lamp, serving to rectify current
        by checking back impulses of one sign and permitting passage of
        impulses of the other. To avoid the necessity for utilizing a
        starter, as is common with the lamp type of electrical valve,
        the supply of mercury within the tube may be sufficient to
        contact with the lower end of the electrode 13 when current is
        not being supplied, so that as soon as current is passed from
        one electrode to the other sufficiently for volatilizing that
        portion of the mercury immediately adjacent the lower end of
        electrode 13, the structure begins its operation as a rectifier.
        The tube 11 is surrounded by a tube 15 which is preferably
        spaced from tube 11 sufficiently for allowing atmospheric or
        other cooling circulation to pass the tube 11. In some
        instances, it may be desirable to cool the tube 11 by a
        surrounding body of liquid, as hereinafter indicated. The tube
        15 may be of insulating material but I find efficient results
        attained by the employment of a steel tube, and fixed to the
        ends of the of the tube are insulating disks 16, 16 forming a
        spool on which are wound twin wires 6^1 and 7^1, the wire 6^1
        being connected at the inner helix of the coil with the outer
        end of the electrode 14, the lower portion of said electrode
        being extended to one side of the tube 11 and passed through an
        insulating sleeve 17 extending through the tube 15, and at its
        outer end merging into the adjacent end of the wire 6^1. The
        wire 7^1 extends directly from the outer portion of the spool
        through the several helices to a point adjacent the juncture of
        the electrode 14 with wire 6^1 and thence extends in mechanical
        parallelism with the wire throughout the coil, the wire 6^1
        ending in a terminal 18 and the wire 7^1 ending in a terminal
        19. For the sake of convenience of description and of tracing
        the circuits, each of the apparatus just above described and
        herein known as an intensifier and rectifier will be mentioned
        as A, B, C and D, respectively. Conductor 6 is formed with
        branches 20 and 21 and conductor 7 is formed with similar
        branches 22 and 23. Branch 20 from conductor 6 connects with
        conductor 7^1 of intensifier B and branch 21 of conductor 6
        connects with the conductor 7^1 of intensifier C, while branch
        22 of conductor 7 of intensifier C, while branch 22 of conductor
        7 connects with conductor 7^1 of intensifier D. A conductor 27
        is connected with terminal 19 of intensifier A and extends to
        and is connected with the terminal 18 of intensifier C, and a
        conductor 7 connects with conductor 7^1 of intensifier D. A
        conductor 27 is connected with terminal 19 of intensifier A. and
        extends to and is connected with terminal 18 of intensifier C,
        and a conductor 28 is connected with the terminal 19 of
        intensifier C and extends from the terminal 19 of intensifier B
        to the terminal 18 of intensifier D to electrode 13 of
        intensifier B.&nbsp; Each electrode 13 is supported on a spider
        13^1 resting on the upper disk 16 of the respective intensifier.
        Conductors 31 and 32 are connected with the terminals 18 of
        intensifiers A and B and are united to form the positive line
        wire 9 which co-operates with the negative line wire 10 and
        extends to any suitable point of consumption. The line wire 10
        is provided with branches 35 and 36 extending to the electrodes
        13 of intensifiers C and D for completing the negative side of
        the circuit. </p>
      <p>Thus it will be seen that alternating currents produced in the
        wires 6 and 7 will be rectified and delivered in the form of a
        direct current through the line wires 9 and 10, and I find by
        experiment that the wires 6 and 7 should be of iron, preferably
        soft, and may of course be insulated, the other wiring not
        specified as iron being of copper or other suitable material. </p>
      <p>In carrying out the operation as stated, the circuits may be
        traced as follows: A positive impulse starting at the zincs 3 is
        directed along conductor 7 to branch 23 to conductor 7^1 and the
        winding of the rectifier of intensifier B through said rectifier
        to the conductor 6^1, through the winding thereof to the contact
        18, conductor 32 and to the line wire 9. The next or negative
        impulse directed along conductor 7 cannot find its way along
        branch 23 and the circuit just above traced because it cannot
        pass across the rectifier of intensifier B but instead the
        negative impulse passes along conductor 22 to conductor 7 of
        intensifier A and the winding thereof to the contact 19 and to
        conductor 27 to contact 18 of intensifier C, to the winding of
        the wire 6^1 thereof to the electrode 14 through the rectifier
        to the of the electrode 13 and conductor of intensifier A,
        electrode 14 thereof and conductor 6^1 to contact 18 and wire 31
        to line wire 9. Obviously the positive impulse cannot pass along
        the wire 20 because of its inverse approach to the rectifier of
        intensifier B. The next impulse or negative impulse delivered to
        conductor 6 cannot pass along conductor 21 because of its
        connection with electrode 13 of the rectifier of intensifier A,
        but instead passes along conductor 20 to the wire 7^1 and its
        winding forming part of intensifier B to the contact 19 and
        conductor 29 to contact 18 and the winding of wire 6^1 of
        intensifier D to the electrode 14 and through the rectifier to
        the electrode 13 and conductor 35 to line wire 10. Thus the
        current is rectified and all positive impulses directed along
        one line and all negative impulses along the other lie s that
        the potential difference between the two lines will be maximum
        for the given current of the alternating circuit. It is, of
        course, apparent that a less number of intensifiers with their
        accompanying rectifier elements may be employed with a sacrifice
        of the impulses which are checked back from a lack of ability to
        pass the respective rectifier elements, and in fact I have
        secured efficient results by the use of a single intensifier
        with its rectifier elements, as hereinafter set forth. </p>
      <p>Grounding conductors 37 and 38 are connected respectively with
        the conductors 6 and 7 and are provided with the ordinary
        lightning arresters 39 and 40 respectively for protecting the
        circuit against high tension static charges. </p>
      <p>Conductors 41 and 42 are connected respectively with the
        conductors 6 and 7 and each connects with an automatic cutout 43
        which is grounded as at 4. Each of said automatic cutouts is
        exactly like the other and one of the same is shown in detail in
        Figure 7 and comprises the inductive resistance 45 provided with
        an insulated binding post 46 wit which the respective conductor
        6 or 7 is connected, said post also supporting a spring 48 which
        sustains an armature 49 adjacent to the core of the resistance
        45. The helix of resistance 45 is connected preferably through
        the spring to the binding post at one end and at the other end
        is grounded on the core of the resistance, the said core being
        grounded by ground conductor 44 which extends to the metallic
        plate 52 embedded in moist carbon or other inductive material
        buried in the earth. Each of the conductors 41, 42 and 44 is of
        iron, and in this connection I wish it understood that where I
        state the specific substance I am able to verify the accuracy of
        the statement by the results of tests which I have made, but of
        course I wish to include along with such substances al
        equivalents, as for instance, where iron is mentioned its
        byproducts, such as steel, and its equivalents such as nickel
        and other magnetic substances are intended to be comprehended.
        The cutout apparatus seen in detail in Figure 7 is employed
        particularly for insuring against high tension currents, it
        being obvious from the structure shown that when potential rises
        beyond the limit established by the tension of the spring
        sustaining the armature 40, the armature will be moved to a
        position contacting with the core of the cutout device and
        thereby directly close the ground connection for line wire 41
        with conductor 44, eliminating the resistance of winding 45 and
        allowing the high tension current to be discharged to the
        ground. Immediately upon such discharge the winding 45 losing
        its current will allow the core to become demagnetized and
        release the armature 49 whereby the ground connection is
        substantially broken leaving only the connection through the
        winding 45 the resistance of which is sufficient for insuring
        against loss of low tension current. </p>
      <p>In Figure 8 I have illustrated an apparatus which though
        apparently primitive in construction and arrangement comprehends
        the first successful embodiment which I produced in the course
        of discovery of the present invention, and it will be observed
        that the essential features of the invention are therein
        disclosed. The structure delineated in said figure consists of
        horseshoe magnets 54, 55, one facing north and the other south,
        that is, each opening in the respective directions indicated and
        the two being connected by an iron wire 55 which is uninsulated
        and wrapped about the respective magnets each end portion of the
        wire 55 being extended from the respective magnets to and
        connected with, as by being soldered to, a zinc plate 56, there
        being a plate 56 for each magnet and each plate being arranged
        longitudinally substantially parallel with the legs of the
        magnet and with the faces of the plate exposed toward the
        respective legs of the magnet, the plate being thus arranged
        endwise toward the north and south. An iron wire 57 connects the
        plates 56, the ends of the wire being preferably connected
        adjacent the outer ends of the plates but from experiment I find
        that the wire may be connected at practically any point to the
        plate. Lead wires 58 and 59 are connected respectively with the
        wires 55 and 57 and supply an alternating current at a
        comparatively low tension, and to control such current the wires
        58 and 59 may be extended to a rectifier or combined rectifier
        and intensifier, as above set forth. </p>
      <p>The tests which I have found successful with the apparatus seen
        in Figure 8 were carried out by the employment first of
        horseshoe magnets approximately 4 inches in length, the bar
        comprising the horseshoe being about one inch square, the zincs
        being dimensioned proportionately and from this apparatus with
        the employment of a single intensifier and rectifier, as above
        stated, I was able to obtain a constant current of 8 volts. </p>
      <p>It should be obvious that the magnets forming one of the
        electrodes of this apparatus may be permanent or may be
        electromagnets, or a combination of the two. </p>
      <p>While the magnets mentioned throughout the above may be formed
        of any magnetic substance, I find the best results obtained by
        the employment of the nickel chrome steel. </p>
      <p>While the successful operation of the various devices which I
        have constructed embodying the present invention have not
        enabled me to arrive definitely and positively at fixed
        conclusion relative to the principles and theories of operation
        and the source from which current is supplied, I wish it to be
        understood that I consider myself as the first inventor of the
        general type hereinbefore described capable of producing
        commercially serviceable electricity, for which reason my claims
        hereinafter appended contemplate that I may utilize a wide range
        of equivalents so far as concerns details of construction
        suggested as preferably employed. </p>
      <p>The current which I am able to obtain is dynamic in the sense
        that it is not static and its production is accomplished without
        chemical or mechanical action either incident to the actual
        chemical or mechanical motion or incident to changing caloric
        conditions so that the elimination of necessity for the use of
        chemical or mechanical action is to be considered as including
        the elimination of the necessity for the use of heat or varying
        degrees thereof. </p>
      <p>Having now particularly described and ascertained the nature of
        my said invention, and in what manner the same is to be
        performed, I declare that what I claim is: --- [Claims not

        3. Demo model at Patent Office was elevated on short poles. <br>
        4. The model planned to power Phoenix AZ would be elevated 200

        6. "[T]he magnetizing of one set of plates... is part of the

      <p>From British Patent # 1098 (1913): </p>
      <p>"I have been able... to produce from a very small apparatus at
        comparatively low elevation, say about 50 or 60 feet above the
        earth’s surface, a substantially constant current at a

      <p>"This current... is capable of being readily increased by

      <p>Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the magnet poles are connected N-S by a
        thick iron rod (thick compared to the lines used for wires in
        the drawings). </p>
      <p>No angle is specified for the V-shaped zinc plates. The article
        (but not the patent) states that the plates are magnetized
        (obviously not zinc). Zinc-galvanized steel? Will a thin film of
        Zn work? Or, powdered Zn in a binder (more surface area)? Or,
        zinc-galvanized iron wire in a coil? </p>
      <p>The Palmer Craig device ( www.rexresearch.com/craig/craig.htm )
        is powered by the terrestrial magnetic field, and employs a thin
        film of bismuth to capture the energy as diamagnetism. Perhaps
        this can be integrated with Meyers’ device. </p>
      <p>Figure 8 (the demonstration of principle) show uninsulated iron

        wound around the Bloch wall area of the horseshoe magnets.
        Perhaps Coler-type windings around the poles could be used here
        ( See: www.rexresearch.com/coler/coler.htm ). Coler used copper
        plates as "condensers" in his device. Could copper plates be
        used for the Meyers device? Perhaps flat (Tesla non-inductive)
        coils could be integrated here. </p>
      <p>"It is essential that the plates 3 be disposed substantially N
        and S with their flat faces approximately parallel to the
        adjacent faces of the co-operating magnets.... </p>
      <p>"I find that it is immaterial whether the N pole of one of the
        magnets is disposed to the N and the S pole to the S, or vice
        versa". </p>
      <p>"[T]he magnets and zinc plates... produce electrical currents
        when disposed... N and S, but when disposed... E and W no such
        currents are produced". </p>
      <p>"[E]levation is by no means vital, but... more efficient
        results are obtained by placing the zincs and magnets on
        elevated supports". </p>
      <p>"The elements may be disposed in horizontal planes [or
        vertically]...". </p>
      <p>The "zinc plate 56... [is] arranged longitudinally
        substantially parallel with the legs of the magnet and with the
        faces of the plate exposed toward the respective legs of the
        magnet, the plate being thus arranged endwise toward the north
        and south". </p>
      <p>The first model used "horseshoe magnets approximately 4 inches
        in length, the bar comprising the horseshoe being about one inch
        square, the zincs being dimensioned proportionately and from
        this apparatus with the employment of a single intensifier and
        rectifier, as above stated, I was able to obtain a constant
        current of 8 volts... [T]he magnets... may be permanent or may
        be electromagnets, or a combination of the two... I find the
        best results obtained by... nickel chrome steel". </p>
      <p>Comments &amp; Questions: </p>
      <p>The rectifier is described as a preferred embodiment, but other
        designs also work. The Ed Gray capacitor design comes to mind (
        www.rexresearch.com/evgray/1gray.htm ). The Tate Ambient Power
        Module also might apply ( www.rexresearch/tate/tate.htm ). </p>
      <p>Would non-ferrous magnets work? Is there a frequency involved
        (oscilloscope tests)? Coler found that ferromagnetism has a
        resonant frequency about 180 KHz. Can the components be made
        adjustable for RLC-resonance? </p>
