      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"> There are three conventional
        ways to transfer heat: Conduction, Convection, and Radiation.
        Now there is a fourth way, Electrostatic Cooling (ESC), that has
        been discovered and patented by Oscar C. Blomgren (Sr. &amp;
        Jr.) and others. Negative ion probes are placed near a heated
        object, which is grounded. When high voltage is applied, there
        is a dramatic drop in temperature. This extremely simple system
        reduces or eliminates the need for other methods, and it uses
        very low power and is very efficient. It also facilitates
        heating when applied in reverse!</font><br>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Inter-Probe of North Chicago
          has patented an electrostatic cooling system that can cause
          red-hot metal to cool perceptibly. The system uses negative
          terminal probes placed near the heated object, the positive or
          ground terminal being attached to the nozzle of the burner.
          When high voltage is applied, a stream of ions flows from the
          probes towards the heated object and reduces its temperature.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electrostatic cooling
          phenomena has not yet been fully understood. One speculation
          for this sudden high rate of heat transfer is that the
          resulting ion flow causes surface turbulence, which in turn
          breaks down the insulating surface layer between the heated
          object and the surrounding air. Another theory is that, since
          energy is required to extract electrons from the heated
          material, there should be cooling when thermions are emitted.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Fire in a mine is always a
          deadly peril. Explosions and cave-ins may block the work of
          fire-fighting brigades equipped with ordinary apparatus.
          Therefore mine officials watched with unusual interest the
          experiments of Bernard Lewis, physical chemist at the
          Pittsburgh, PA station of the US Bureau of Mines, who recently
          demonstrated that he could put out a flame with electricity.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Lewis lit a gas flame in a
          glass tube. The he brought near it, from each side, a piece of
          wire gauze charged with high voltage electricity. The flame
          vibrated convulsively, dwindled, and went out. Burning carbon
          monoxide gas, and gaseous carbon-and-hydrogen compounds like
          the dreaded "fire-damp" of miners, were successfully
          extinguished.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electrically-charged
          pieces of gauze, Lewis told Popular Science Monthly, literally
          tear the flame to pieces. When an inflammable gas burns, the
          hot flame throws off particles of negative electricity,
          leaving the products of combustion charged with positive
          electricity. His high voltage electric field draws negatively
          charged electrons to one electrode and positively charged
          particles to the other, breaking up the flame. Whether the
          same thing may be done outside the laboratory, and if so on
          how large a scale, remains to be seen.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In an attempt to describe my
          technical work in the context of my criminal case I have met
          with a lot of criticism. At times the criticism has turned to
          outright ridicule. I have been accused of everything from
          making wild claims to not knowing my physics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My work in heat transfer has
          many significant uses in military, industrial, and
          communications applications. A point that I had made to the
          science editor of <i>Der Speigel</i> magazine during a
          interview was that the F-111 plane built by General Dynamics
          was in service because of technology that I was attempting to
          describe as part of the basis for some of my work. The science
          editor and his researchers claimed that they had never heard
          of any of these concepts, and could not locate the references
          that I claimed existed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Finally, in September of
          1998 I received a partial copy of the <i>Design News</i>
          article on the wing pin cooling and the <i>Popular Science</i>
          article on electrostatic cooling that review the heat transfer
          technology that I had been attempting to describe.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What is significant in these
          articles is that:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) the electrical power
          used to cool the wing pin is an extremely low amount. So much
          so that there appears to be a Second Law violation;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(2) the determination that
          an "electric wind" is responsible for the instantaneous
          electrostatic cooling fails to account for the speed and the
          amount of the observed heat flow in the wing pin welding
          process and other demonstrations;</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(3) the article on the wing
          pin understates the importance of the electrostatic cooling
          process in the production of the F-111 wing pins. The early
          versions of the F-111 were grounded because of a series of
          crashes attributed to the structural failure of conventional
          methods using clamp cooling bars and periodic shutdowns to
          cool the pins during the welding process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">General Dynamics had
          explored every possible manufacturing technique for
          fabricating the wing pins in an effort to save the F-111
          project. In desperation, as a last resort, General Dynamics
          allowed the electrostatic cooling to be demonstrated on a
          actual wing pin. General Dynamic scientists, engineers, and
          executives were astounded by the structural tests on the
          sample wing pin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(4) The <i>Popular Science</i>
          article does not go into any detail on the capability of the
          electrostatic cooling process to thermally stabilize high
          power laser components.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The PS article only makes a
          vague reference to "infrared optics". Neither of these
          articles make any mention of the capability of electrostatic
          cooling to control heat in "all" types of explosives, or the
          control of heat in electrical power fuses. Electrostatic
          cooling has enabled a whole new class of tactical explosive
          systems and high energy electric power systems.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The claims made for
          electrostatic cooling appear to be lifted from the pages of a
          science fiction story. I am using the F-111 project as a
          concrete, real world example of the capabilities of
          electrostatic cooling since the project would have more than
          likely been scrapped had it not been for the application of
          electrostatic cooling to the wing pin welding process.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Similar dramatic successes
          have been realized in the MIRACL, COIL, TEXS, and ETC weapons
          programs. None of these programs could be a workable reality
          without the application of proprietary electrostatic cooling
          techniques. The practical application of the underlying
          thermodynamic concepts of electrostatic cooling to ergodicity
          and entropy in high performance data communications systems
          has only recently become apparent to the computer industry.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The thermodynamic concepts
          behind electrostatic cooling have a impact on the "transport
          properties" of the message entropy of data signals over large
          networks.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The analysis and
          understanding of the electrostatic cooling effect was
          accomplished by starting with a series of obvious experimental
          measurements in order to lead to the complex mathematical
          physics principles that were anything but obvious.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The initial analysis of the
          numbers for the operation of the wing pin welding process
          (less the 20 watts power to the electrostatic probes) would
          lead one to suspect a violation of the second law of
          thermodynamics is being claimed here. The control of such a
          large amount of thermal energy in and around the weld zone and
          throughout the bulk of the wing pin, with less than 20 watts
          of electrical power, is a very fantastic claim. However, it is
          no less fantastic than the postulated explanation given by Dr.
          Kibler, the senior scientist for General Dynamics, attributing
          this phenomenal rate of heat transfer to a "electric wind".</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some experiments were
          conducted using a Schlieren optical system and an infrared
          thermograph. A Schlieren optical system is capable of
          detecting regions or streaks in a transparent medium that have
          density and a refractive index differing from that of the bulk
          of the surrounding medium. This enables pressure and/or
          temperature gradients to be detected by photographing a beam
          of light propagating transversely through the medium. The
          Schlieren optical system displayed the thermal boundary layer
          present at the surface of the heated wing pin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Infrared thermograph
          displayed the overall thermal profile of the wing pin during
          the entire welding process. Application of the low power
          electrostatic field was clearly seen to instantaneously break
          up the thermal boundary layer that was present over the heated
          wing pin surface area.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The wing pin could be made
          to attain a new thermal equilibrium anywhere in a temperature
          range of a few degrees lower than initial conditions to over
          500 degrees F lower, just outside the weld zone throughout the
          surrounding area. This new equilibrium was attained in a
          matter of mere seconds throughout the entire bulk of the wing
          pin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The application of external
          chill bars and/or an "electric wind" is a surface phenomenon.
          Careful experimental analysis of the boundary layer thermal
          transfer effect confirmed that heat transfer was indeed
          substantially enhanced when the electrostatic field disrupted
          the boundary layer. The boundary layer was found to act as an
          effective thermal impedance to both radiative and convective
          thermal transfer from the surface of the wing pin.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The disruption of the
          thermal boundary layer by the electrostatic field yielded
          approximately a 4:1 increase in the rate of thermal transfer
          from the surface of the wing pin. I conducted an experiment on
          a batch of wing pins welded with chill bars. In this series of
          experiments I applied a film of electronic grade heat transfer
          compound to the wing pin surface/chill bar interface. This had
          the effect of inhibiting the thermal impedance presented by
          the thermal boundary layer.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The results in this series
          of experiments were nearly a 4:1 increase in total thermal
          transfer from the surface of the wing pin to the chill bars
          during the welding process. This comparable to the rate
          increase in surface heat flow found when the wing pins were
          welded in the presence of the electrostatic field, but without
          the bulk cooling effect and nearly instantaneous thermal
          re-equilibration properties of electrostatic cooling.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was a major DOD/DARPA
          interest in the capability to athermalize the materials in
          high power laser optical components. This is the reason that
          most of my proof of principle research was conducted with
          laser grade optical materials.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">One of the first thoughts
          that struck me when experimenting with the wing pin welding
          process was that the bulk thermal transport effects appeared
          to violate Joule's law of heat flow. This prompted me to
          obtain a large slab of IR-TRAN-2 laser glass. For experimental
          purposes I had numerous thermocouples imbedded throughout the
          bulk of the glass slab. I placed this slab of glass on the
          surface of a laboratory type hot plate. The heating top of
          this hot plate was only one inch thick.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I had it drilled out to
          place numerous thermocouples throughout its' bulk. I also took
          the heating coil element from a kitchen type hot plate and
          mounted it in a custom case. This case had provisions for the
          use of both contact thermocouples and a view port on the
          underside for the thermograph. Both of the hot plates were
          powered through an isolation transformer, and the temperature
          regulated by a Variac.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A series of experiments were
          conducted with different electrode configurations and
          grounding arrangements. It was determined experimentally that
          by "appropriate modulation" of the high voltage field that the
          electrostatic heat transfer effect could be enhanced by
          several orders of magnitude. The voltage and current inputs to
          the hot plate and the voltage and current supplied to the
          electrostatic cooling probes were monitored during all the
          experiments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The uniformity of the bulk
          cooling effect was immediately confirmed by repeated
          experimental demonstrations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Measurements of radiated and
          convected heat flow away from the glass slab did not come
          anywhere near accounting for the BTU loss required for the
          temperature drop of the slab. The total heat dissipation
          actually measured in the experimental set-ups could not be
          immediately reconciled with the Second Law of thermodynamics,
          Joule's Law and Fourier's theorems on heat flow, and the
          Conservation laws of physics.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Additional theoretical work
          had to be performed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Admiral Al Renkin (Retired),
          and myself demonstrated this heat transfer phenomenon to
          scientists from the various national laboratories. As amazed
          as they were, none of the scientists or engineers could
          accurately characterize the underlying physics of the
          experimentally observed phenomenon in our demonstrations. At
          this point the Office of Naval Research proposed that the
          experimental set-up be changed.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Oscar Blomgren Jr. had
          succeeded in cooling spots on the filament of a long display
          case type lightbulb. I was asked if it were possible to cool
          the entire length of the filament simultaneously, to the same
          degree as the sections of the filament had been. The answer
          was yes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then ONR wanted to see the
          numbers on probe energy versus the electrical energy input and
          thermal and convective heat flow around the filament.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Vacuum and inert gas
          backfilled lightbulbs were used for this set of experiments.
          The experimental results were immediately classified and all
          hell broke out around our project. I suddenly had immense
          resources in money and personnel made available to our project
          through DARPA, ONR, and USAF PRAM Project Office.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This R&amp;D continued for 3
          years until it was disrupted by the murder of Paul Morasca.
          When I realized that Paul Morasca was terminated by the US
          Government, I folded up the project at Hercules, Cabazon, and
          Sonoma Engineering.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The research data and
          equipment from the entire project went into storage. I have
          effectively been on the run since I shelved the project in
          1984.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My work on this project
          started with a heat transfer phenomenon that had been
          accidentally discovered by Oscar Blomgren Jr. I succeeded in
          completely reconciling the observed experimental results with
          the apparent violations of the laws of physics. The work that
          I completed can be summarized as mathematical modeling and
          numerical simulation with application of the boundary value
          problems of thermodynamics based on second order partial
          differential equations derived from elliptic functions. The
          mathematical principles and physical laws that cover this work
          are as follows:</font> </p>

      <p>I tried the basic approach mentioned in the welding patent
        which was to attach only the positive high voltage electrode.
        This was mostly because my ionizer only has a positive output.
        It is a 7kV constant DC voltage which is effectively what the
        circuit accomplishes with the diodes aver the coil. My device is
        capable of running on 9V to 14V I was running it on 9V which
        means it was generating about +4KV. </p>
      <p>My control bar set was two bars of aluminum 1/2" thick X 12"
        long X 1.5" wide. Each one weighs about 1 pound. They where
        heated in an oven to 160F and then placed on an insulated nylon
        surface. The temperature probes where taped to the surface of
        the electrode. The +HV source was taped to on bar while the
        other was untreated. The charge level was sufficient to give
        noticeable not particularly painful shocks when any part of the
        bar was touched. Ambient was 65F @ 43% RH. </p>
      <p>I took several measurements over a time series but exactly 1
        hour after they where removed from oven the bar with the
        electrode had cooled to 71.3 while the control bar was only at
        100.1. Both started at 160F so there is definitely a cooling
        effect going on but it is not as extreme as shown in the
        patents. </p>
      <p>I left both bars in place for another hour and at the end of
        that hour both bars had cooled to ambient and the temperatures
        had stabilized. I suspect that the bar with the High voltage
        would not go below ambient even if left connected for several
        hours. </p>
      <p>My next test series will use the high voltage source running at
        13V input which should increase the available voltage and
        increase the cooling ratio. The one after that will be to ground
        one end and put high voltage into the other end. If I have time
        I will hook up an oscillator to turn on the high voltage source
        for 1/10 second and off for 9/10 of second to see how it affects
        the results. </p>
      <p><i>Note:&nbsp;</i> If I can find a strong negative voltage
        source I will use it to generate a stream of negative ions
        directed over the surface of positively charged bar. I suspect
        that this will give dramatically better performance since it
        would give us a larger number of ions impacting the surface. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> To improve the coefficient of heat transfer
        between trhe surfaces and the heat exchange media of heat
        exchangers, such as automobile radiators, steam condensers, and
        steam boilers. Conductive probes or conductors are energized
        with a low power, low current high DC potential and spaced from
        the surfaces a distance slightly greater than the distance at
        which arcing occurs while the surfaces are grounded to generate
        an electrostatic field. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> Electrostatic cooling apparatus with a
        needle emitter insulated along the shank thereof except for a
        sharp needle tip. The insulated needle emitter is supported
        along the axis of a funnel tube so as to augment the velocity of
        the ionic wid generated by the needle emeitter. The needle
        emitter is axially adjusted within the funnel tube to tune the
        resonant cavity formed by the needle emitter and funnel tube to
        just below the space charge oscillation frequency. <br>
