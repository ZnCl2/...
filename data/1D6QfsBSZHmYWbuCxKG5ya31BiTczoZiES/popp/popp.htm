      <br>
      A UK woman has disclosed how she cured her cancer with the holiday
      herb mistletoe after declining chemotherapy treatment. Joan van
      Holsteijn obtained injections of a medicine made from mistletoe
      berries, the plant associated in popular culture with
      Christmas-time kisses. This treatment has apparently brought Joan
      a cure to her cancer, as the tumors have disappeared. Joan had
      been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma after doctors
      discovered a tumor the size of an egg in her leg. Within 18 months
      of initiating the mistletoe treatment the tumor was gone and scans
      showed no further trace of the cancer. Joan is pleased that she
      made the decision to refuse chemotherapy due to the debilitating
      effects of chemotherapy drugs and their role in depleting the
      immune system, the very system the body needs functioning well to
      use its own resources for healing cancer.<br>
      <br>
      Joan now keeps springs of mistletoe in her home, not to invite
      holiday kisses but to invite others to hear about her wonderful
      experience of recovery from lymphoma using this herbal treatment.
      This treatment is well-known in Europe, while Americans are
      unlikely to have heard of it. Even those who are aware of this
      herbal therapy may not know about some surprising research that
      explains how mistletoe seems to help the body clear away cancers.
      This research comes from the work of Dr. Fritz-Albert Popp, who is
      a pioneer in research on biophotons and their role in cellular
      communication. Dr. Popp discovered that changes in the body's
      biophoton emissions are associated with cancer and other
      illnesses. Biophotons are photons of light emitted in living
      systems. Popp found that carcinogenic chemicals can be recognized
      by their property of disrupting biophoton emissions and the
      coherence of light waves. Based on this, he surmised that there
      may be compounds which have the opposite effect of helping restore
      healthy biophoton emissions and resuming coherent light patterns.
      Of all the alleged cancer-busting substances Popp tested, only
      mistletoe was able to return the biophoton emissions of cancer
      cells back to normal. When this happened the cancers went into
      remission.<br>
      <br>
      In Popp's view, health is a state of perfect subatomic
      communication, and ill health is a state of communication
      breakdown. We are ill when our waves are out of synch. Popp
      believes that our cells and DNA use electromagnetic spectrum waves
      to communicate and transfer information. Substances that disturb
      or enhance the transmission of these waves in varying frequency
      ranges (wavelengths) can influence our health. In cancer patients,
      Popp found that natural cycles of light emission were disrupted,
      light waves were losing coherence, and thus the cancer cells were
      out of attunement to the rest of the body. Scientists have long
      known that photorepair allows damaged cells to regenerate. This
      process of light being used to restore life to cells functions
      best within a certain frequency range. This frequency range falls
      within the ultraviolet light portion of the electromagnetic
      spectrum. Not surprisingly, Popp had discovered that known
      carcinogens (cancer causing chemicals) act to disrupt the
      transmission of light in that range.<br>
      <br>
      Mistletoe appears to assist cancer patients due to the subtle
      energetic properties it contains. Vibrational medicine is a key
      frontier in the healing arts, and this herb is one example of how
      research in natural therapies and vibrational energy can help us
      find ways to restore health and bring balance and harmony to our
      lives. The next time you see a sprig of mistletoe, you may want to
      ponder this miracle healing herb and its life-giving properties...<br>

      I get lots of suggestions for stories, and I really appreciate
      them. But some of them are too good to be true. An example of this
      was a story of a giant human skeleton -- maybe 40 feet tall --
      that was discovered by a Russian archaeological team. The story
      had photos and links accompanying it and looked promising. But
      when the links were researched they went in a circle. Each link
      used the other link as the source. Finally the elements of the
      photos turned up and we recognized a good Photoshop job had fooled
      everyone.<br>
      <br>
      I had this same experience this week when I was sent an article
      where a Russian (again) scientist, Pjotr Garjajev, had managed to
      intercept communication from a DNA molecule in the form of
      ultraviolet photons -- light! What's more, he claimed to have
      captured this communication from one organism (a frog embryo) with
      a laser beam and then transmitted it to another organisms DNA (a
      salamander embryo), causing the latter embryo to develop into a
      frog!<br>
      <br>
      But this was just the beginning. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Garjajev claims that this communication is not something that
      happens only inside the individual cells or between one cell and
      another. He claims organisms use this "light" to "talk" to other
      organisms and suggested that this could explain telepathy and ESP.
      It was like human beings already had their own wireless internet
      based on our DNA. Wow!<br>
      <br>
      I tried to find a scientific journal that had this experiment. All
      I could find were blogs and other websites that carried the same
      story, word for word, without any references. That is until I
      stumbled on the work of Fritz-Albert Popp [right]. Then everything
      I had just read seemed very plausible.<br>
      <br>
      Fritz-Albert Popp thought he had discovered a cure for cancer. I'm
      not convinced that he didn't.<br>
      <br>
      It was 1970, and Popp, a theoretical biophysicist at the
      University of Marburg in Germany, had been teaching radiology --
      the interaction of electromagnetic (EM) radiation on biological
      systems. Popp was too early to worry about things like cellphones
      and microwave towers which are now commonly linked with cancers
      and leukemia. His world was much smaller.<br>
      <br>
      He'd been examining two almost identical molecules:
      benzo[a]pyrene, a polycyclic hydrocarbon known to be one of the
      most lethal carcinogens to humans, and its twin (save for a tiny
      alteration in its molecular makeup), benzo[e]pyrene. He had
      illuminated both molecules with ultraviolet (UV) light in an
      attempt to find exactly what made these two almost identical
      molecules so different.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Why Ultra-violet light?</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Popp chose to work specifically with UV light because of the
      experiments of a Russian biologist named Alexander Gurwitsch who,
      while working with onions in 1923, discovered that roots could
      stimulate a neighboring plant's roots if the two adjacent plants
      were in quartz glass pots but not if they were in silicon glass
      pots. The only difference being that the silicon filtered UV
      wavelengths of light while the quartz did not. Gurwitsch theorized
      that onion roots could communicate with each other by ultraviolet
      light.<br>
      <br>
      All vibrations of energy are part of the electro-magnetic
      spectrum. These include electrical energy, heat, sound, light,
      radio waves and radioactive waves. UV light is merely a small
      portion of the spectrum of EM energy with a very short wavelength.<br>
      <br>
      What Popp discovered was that benzo[a]pyrene (the cancer producing
      molecule) absorbed the UV light, then re-emitted it at a
      completely different frequency -- it was a light "scrambler". The
      benzo[e]pyrene (harmless to humans), allowed the UV light to pass
      through it unaltered.<br>
      <br>
      Popp was puzzled by this difference, and continued to experiment
      with UV light and other compounds. He performed his test on 37
      different chemicals, some cancer-causing, some not. After a while,
      he was able to predict which substances could cause cancer. In
      every instance, the compounds that were carcinogenic took the UV
      light, absorbed it and changed or scrambled the frequency.<br>
      <br>
      There was another odd property of these compounds: each of the
      carcinogens reacted only to light at a specific frequency -- 380
      nm (nanometres) in the ultra-violet range. Popp kept wondering why
      a cancer-causing substance would be a light scrambler. He began
      reading the scientific literature specifically about human
      biological reactions, and came across information about a
      phenomenon called 'photorepair'.<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      It is well known from biological laboratory experiments that if
      you blast a cell with UV light so that 99 per cent of the cell,
      including its DNA, is destroyed, you can almost entirely repair
      the damage in a single day just by illuminating the cell with the
      same wavelength at a much weaker intensity. To this day,
      scientists don't understand this phenomenon, called photorepair,
      but no one has disputed it.<br>
      <br>
      Popp also knew that patients with xeroderma pigmentosum [right]
      eventually die of skin cancer because their photorepair system
      can't repair solar damage. He was also struck by the fact that
      photorepair works most efficiently at 380 nm -- the same frequency
      that the cancer-causing compounds react to and scramble.<br>
      <br>
      This was where Popp made his logical leap. If the carcinogens only
      react to this frequency, it must somehow be linked to photorepair.
      If so, this would mean that there must be some kind of light in
      the body responsible for photorepair. A compound must cause cancer
      because it permanently blocks this light and scrambles it, so
      photorepair can't work anymore. It seemed logical, but was it
      true?<br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
      Popp was freaked out by this. He wrote about it in a paper and a
      prestigious medical journal agreed to publish it.<br>
      <br>
      Not long after that, Popp was approached by a student named
      Bernhard Ruth, who asked Popp to supervise his work for his
      doctoral dissertation. Popp told Ruth he was prepared to do so if
      the student could show that light was emanating from the human
      body.<br>
      <br>
      This meeting was fortuitous for Popp because Ruth happened to be
      an excellent experimental physicist. Ruth thought the idea was
      ridiculous, and immediately set to work building equipment to
      prove Popp's hypothesis wrong.<br>
      <br>
      Within two years, Ruth had constructed a machine resembling a big
      X-ray detector which used a photomultiplier to count light, photon
      by photon. Even today, it is still one of the best pieces of
      equipment in the field. The machine had to be highly sensitive
      because it had to measure what Popp assumed would be extremely
      weak emissions.<br>
      <br>
      In an old documentary film taken in the laboratory at the
      International Institute of Biophysics, Dr. Popp opens a chamber
      about the size of a bread box. He places a fresh cutting from a
      plant and a wooden match in a plastic container inside the dark
      chamber and closed the light proof door. Immediately he switches
      on the photomultiplyer and the image shows up on a computer
      screen. The match stick is black while the green, glowing
      silhouette of the leaves is clearly visible.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Popp exclaims, "We now know, today, that man is essentially a
      being of light."<br>
      <br>
      In 1976, they were ready for their first test with cucumber
      seedlings. The photomultiplier showed that photons, or light
      waves, of a surprisingly high intensity were being emitted from
      the seedlings. In case the light had to do with an effect of
      photosynthesis, they decided that their next test -- with potatoes
      -- would be to grow the seedling plants in the dark. This time,
      when the seedlings were placed in the photomultiplier, they
      registered an even higher intensity of light. What's more, the
      photons in the living systems they'd examined were more coherent
      than anything they'd ever seen.<br>
      <br>
      Popp began thinking about light in nature. Light was present in
      plants and was used during photosynthesis. When we eat plant
      foods, he thought, it must be that we take up the photons and
      store them.<br>
      <br>
      When we consume broccoli, for example, and digest it, it is
      metabolised into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water, plus the light
      stored from the sun and photosynthesis. We extract the CO2 and
      eliminate the water, but the light, an EM wave, must be stored.
      When taken in by the body, the energy of these photons dissipates
      and becomes distributed over the entire spectrum of EM
      frequencies, from the lowest to the highest.<br>
      <br>
      This energy is the driving force for all the molecules in our
      body. Before any chemical reaction can occur, at least one
      electron must be activated by a photon with a certain wavelength
      and enough energy. <br>
      <br>
      The biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Lehninger mentions in his
      textbook that some reactions in the living cell happen quite a lot
      faster than what corresponds to 37C temperature. The explanation
      seems to be that the body purposely directs chemical reactions by
      means of electromagnetic vibrations (biophotons).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Photons (Light) control
        everything in the cell</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Photons switch on the body's processes like an orchestra conductor
      bringing each individual instrument into the collective sound. At
      different frequencies, they perform different functions. Popp
      found that molecules in the cells responded to certain
      frequencies, and that a range of vibrations from the photons
      caused a variety of frequencies in other molecules of the body.<br>
      <br>
      This theory has been supported by Dr. Veljko Veljkovic who now
      heads the Center for Multidisciplinary Research and Engineering,
      Institute of Nuclear Sciences Vinca. She dared to ask the question
      that has forever puzzled cellular biologists: What is it that
      enabled the tens of thousands of different kinds of molecules in
      the organism to recognize their specific targets? Living processes
      depend on selective interactions between particular molecules, and
      that is true for basic metabolism to the subtlest nuances of
      emotion. It's like trying to find a friend in a very big very
      crowded ballroom in the dark.<br>
      <br>
      The conventional picture of a cell even now is that of a bag of
      molecules dissolved in water. And through bumping into one another
      by chance -- random collisions -- those molecules that have
      complementary shapes lock onto to each other so the appropriate
      biochemical reactions can take place. This 'lock and key' model
      has been refined to a more flexible (and realistic) 'induced fit'
      hypothesis that allows each molecule to change shape slightly to
      fit the other better after they get in touch, but the main idea
      remains the same.<br>
      <br>
      It is supposed to explain how enzymes can recognize their
      respective substrates, how antibodies in the immune system can
      grab onto specific foreign invaders and disarm them. By extension,
      that's how proteins can 'dock' with different partner proteins, or
      latch onto specific nucleic acids to control gene expression, or
      assemble into ribosomes for translating proteins, or other
      multi-molecular complexes that modify the genetic messages in
      various ways. But with thousands -- or even hundreds of thousands
      of reactions happening each second in just one cell this seems
      pushing the "mechanical" concept a bit too far.<br>
      <br>
      What has been proposed is that somehow each molecule sends out a
      unique electromagnetic field that can "sense" the field of the
      complimentary molecule. It's as if there is a "dance" in the
      cellular medium and the molecules move to the rythm. The music is
      supplied by the biophoton.<br>
      <br>
      "Veljkovic and Cosic proposed that molecular interactions are
      electrical in nature, and they take place over distances that are
      large compared with the size of molecules. Cosic later introduced
      the idea of dynamic electromagnetic field interactions, that
      molecules recognize their particular targets and vice versa by
      electromagnetic resonance. In other words, the molecules send out
      specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves which not only
      enable them to 'see' and 'hear' each other, as both photon and
      phonon modes exist for electromagnetic waves, but also to
      influence each other at a distance and become ineluctably drawn to
      each other if vibrating out of phase (in a complementary way)." --

      <br>
      "There are about 100,000 chemical reactions happening in every
      cell each second. The chemical reaction can only happen if the
      molecule which is reacting is excited by a photon... Once the
      photon has excited a reaction it returns to the field and is
      available for more reactions... We are swimming in an ocean of
      light."<big><big><big><big><br>
            </big></big></big></big><br>
      These 'biophoton emission', as Popp called them, provided an ideal
      communication system for the transfer of information to many cells
      across the organism. But the single most important question
      remained: where was the light coming from?<br>
      <br>
      A particularly gifted student talked him into another experiment.
      It is known that when ethidium bromide is applied to samples of
      DNA, it insinuates itself in between the base pairs of the double
      helix, causing DNA to unwind. The student suggested that, after
      applying the chemical, they measure the light coming from the
      sample. Popp found that the greater the concentration of ethidium,
      the more the DNA unravelled, but also the stronger the intensity
      of light. Conversely, the less he used, the less light was
      emitted.<br>
      <br>
      He also found that DNA could send out a wide range of frequencies,
      some of which seemed to be linked to certain functions. If DNA
      stored this light, it would naturally emit more light on being
      unzipped.<br>
      <br>
      These and other studies proved to Popp that one of the most
      essential sources of light and biophoton emissions was DNA. DNA
      was like the master tuning fork of the body. It would strike a
      particular frequency and certain molecules would follow. It was
      also possible, he realised, that he had stumbled upon the missing
      link in current DNA theory that could account for perhaps the
      greatest miracle of all in human biology -- how a single cell can
      turn into a fully formed human being.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">How cells "talk" to each other</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      When you get a cut or scratch on your skin, the cells that are
      injured somehow signal the surrounding healthy cells to begin
      reproducing copies of themselves to fill in and mend the opening.
      When the skin is back to normal, a signal is sent to the cells to
      tell them to stop reproducing. Scientists have wondered exactly
      how this works.<br>
      <br>
      With biophoton emissions, Popp believed he had an answer to this
      question. This phenomenon of coordination and communication could
      only occur in a holistic system with one central orchestrator.
      Popp showed in his experiments that these weak light emissions
      were sufficient to orchestrate the body's repairs. The emissions
      had to be low intensity because these communications took place on
      a very small, intracellular, quantum level. Higher intensities
      would have an effect only in the world of the large and would
      create too much "noise" to be effective.<br>
      <br>
      The number of photons emitted seemed to be linked to the
      organism's position on the evolutionary scale -- the more complex
      the organism, the fewer photons were emitted. Rudimentary animals
      and plants tended to emit 100 photons/cm2/sec at a wavelength of
      200-800 nm, corresponding to a very-high-frequency EM wave well
      within the visible range, whereas humans emit only 10
      photons/cm2/sec at the same frequency.<br>
      <br>
      In one series of studies, Popp had one of his assistants -- a
      27-year-old healthy young woman -- sit in the room every day for
      nine months while he took photon readings of a small area of her
      hand and forehead. Popp then analysed the data and discovered, to
      his surprise, that the light emissions followed certain set
      patterns -- biological rhythms at 7, 14, 32, 80 and 270 days --
      and similarities were also noted by day or night, by week and by
      month, as though the body were following the world's biorhythms as
      well as its own.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cancer is a loss of coherent
        light</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      So far, Popp had studied only healthy individuals and found an
      exquisite coherence at the quantum level. But what kind of light
      is present in those who are ill? <br>
      <br>
      Popp tried out his machine on a series of cancer patients. In
      every instance, these patients had lost those natural periodic
      rhythms as well as their coherence. The lines of internal
      communication were scrambled. They had lost their connection with
      the world. In effect, their light was going out.<br>
      <br>
      Just the opposite is seen with multiple sclerosis: MS is a state
      of too much order. Patients with this disease are taking in too
      much light, thereby inhibiting their cells' ability to do their
      job. Too much cooperative harmony prevented flexibility and
      individuality -- like too many soldiers marching in step as they
      cross a bridge, causing it to collapse. Perfect coherence is an
      optimal state between chaos and order. With too much cooperation,
      it is as though individual members of the orchestra are no longer
      able to improvise. In effect, MS patients are drowning in light.<br>
      <br>
      Popp also examined the effects of stress. In a stressed state, the
      rate of biophoton emissions goes up -- a defence mechanism
      designed to restore the patient's equilibrium.<br>
      <br>
      Popp now recognized that what he'd been experimenting with was
      even more than a cure for cancer or Gestaltbildung. Here was a
      model which provided a better explanation than the current
      neo-Darwinist theory for how all living things evolve on the
      planet. Rather than a system of fortunate but ultimately random
      error, if DNA uses frequencies of every variety as an information
      tool, this suggests instead a feedback system of perfect
      communication through waves that encode and transfer information.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">"Good vibes" means coherent light</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Popp came to realize that light in the body might even hold the
      key to health and illness. In one experiment, he compared the
      light from free-range hens' eggs with that from penned-in, caged
      hens. The photons in the former were far more coherent than those
      in the latter. <br>
      <br>
      Popp went on to use biophoton emissions as a tool for measuring
      the quality of food. The healthiest food had the lowest and most
      coherent intensity of light. Any disturbance in the system
      increased the production of photons. Health was a state of perfect
      subatomic communication, and ill health was a state of
      communication breakdown. We are ill when our waves are out of
      synch. <br>
      <br>
      Bio Photon emission detection is currently used commercially in
      the food industry. Agricultural science is looking at Bio-photon
      emissions to determine plant health for the purposes of food
      quality control. Biophotonen is a company working for development
      and practical applications of biophotonics. The work is based on a
      variety of patents. "Biophotonen" solves practical problems of
      food industry, environmental industry, cosmetics, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Off-shoots of Dr. Popp's discovery<br>
      In the 1970s Dr. Veljko Veljkovic, who now heads the Center for
      Multidisciplinary Research and Engineering, Institute of Nuclear
      Sciences Vinca, also discovered a method for predicting which of
      the hundreds of new chemicals made by the rapidly expanding
      chemical industry were carcinogenic, by calculating certain
      electronic, biophotonic properties of the molecules. This method
      was soon found equally applicable to predicting organic chemicals
      that were mutagenic, or toxic, and even those that were
      antibiotic, or cytostatic (anticancer). Veljkovic's institute in
      Belgrade has since teamed up with other European laboratories to
      apply the same method to drug discovery, especially against AIDS
      disease. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Biophoton Therapy</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Biophoton therapy is the application of light to particular areas
      of the skin for healing purposes. The light, or photons, that are
      emitted by these units are absorbed by the skin's photoreceptors
      and then travel through the body's nervous system to the brain,
      where they help regulate what is referred to as our human
      bio-energy. By stimulating certain areas of the body with specific
      quantities of light, biophoton therapy can help reduce pain as
      well as aid in various healing processes throughout the body.<br>
      <br>
      The theory behind biophoton therapy is based on the work of Dr.
      Franz Morell and has been expanded by the work of Doctors L.C.
      Vincent and F.A. Popp, who theorized that light can affect the
      electromagnetic oscillation, or waves of the body and regulate
      enzyme activity. <br>
      <br>
      It took some 25 years for Popp to gather converts from among the
      scientific community. Slowly, a few select scientists around the
      globe began to consider that the body's communication system might
      be a complex network of resonance and frequency. Eventually, they
      would form the International Institute of Biophysics, composed of
      15 groups of scientists from international centres around the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      Popp and his new colleagues went on to study the light emissions
      from several organisms of the same species, first in an experiment
      with a type of water flea of the genus Daphnia. What they found
      was nothing short of astonishing. Tests with a photomultiplier
      showed that the water fleas were sucking up the light emitted from
      each other. Popp tried the same experiment on small fish and got
      the same result. According to his photomultiplier, sunflowers were
      like biological vacuum cleaners, moving in the direction of the
      most solar photons to hoover them up. Even bacteria swallowed
      photons from the media they were put in.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Communication between organisms</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Thus, it dawned on Popp that these emissions had a purpose outside
      of the body. Wave resonance wasn't only being used to communicate
      inside the body, but between living things as well. Two healthy
      beings engaged in 'photon sucking', as he called it, by exchanging
      photons. Popp realised that this exchange might unlock the secret
      of some of the animal kingdom's most persistent conundrums: how
      schools of fish or flocks of birds create perfect and
      instantaneous coordination. Many experiments on the homing ability
      of animals demonstrate that it has nothing to do with following
      habitual trails, scents or even the EM fields of the earth, but
      rather some form of silent communication that acts like an
      invisible rubber band, even when the animals are separated by
      miles of distance.<br>
      <br>
      For humans, there was another possibility. If we could take in the
      photons of other living things, we might also be able to use the
      information from them to correct our own light if it went awry.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Death Transmission via the
        Paranormal "Light" Channel</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Some extremely interesting experiments were performed by V.P.
      Kaznacheyev et al regarding the paranormal transmission of death
      by light inter-organism communication. <br>
      <br>
      Briefly, two groups of cells were selected from the same cell
      culture and one sample placed on each side of a window joining two
      environmentally shielded rooms. The cell cultures were in quartz
      containers. One cell culture was used as the initiation sample and
      was subjected to a deadly mechanism - virus, germ, chemical
      poison, irradiation, ultraviolet rays, etc. The second cell
      culture was observed, to ascertain any transmitted effects from
      the culture sample being killed.<br>
      <br>
      When the window was made of ordinary glass, the second sample
      remained alive and healthy. When the window was made of quartz,
      the second sample sickened and died with the same symptoms as the
      primary sample. <br>
      <br>
      The experiments were done in darkness, and over 5,000 were
      reported by Kaznacheyev and his colleagues. The onset of induced
      complementary sickness and death in the second culture followed a
      reasonable time -- say two to four hours -- behind sickness and
      death in the primary culture. <br>
      <br>
      The major transmission difference between window glass and quartz
      is that quartz transmits both ultraviolet and infrared well, while
      glass is relatively opaque to ultraviolet and infrared. Both
      quartz and glass transmit visible light. Thus glass is a
      suppressor of the paranormal channel, while quartz is not. <br>
      <br>
      In 1950, Western researchers found that cells could be killed in
      darkness with ultraviolet radiation, kept shielded from visible
      light for twenty-four hours or longer, and then if radiated with
      visible light the cells would start reviving by hundreds of
      thousands even though they had been clinically dead. <br>
      <br>
      Specifically, every cell emits mitogenetic radiation in the
      ultraviolet range twice: when it is born and when it dies. The UV
      photon emitted at death contains the exact virtual state pattern
      of the condition of the cell at death. The healthy cells are
      bombarded with death messages from those that are dying, and this
      diffuses the death pattern throughout the healthy culture,
      eventually kindling into the same death pattern there. <br>
      <br>
      [V.P. Kaznacheyev et al, "Distant Intercellular Interactions in a
      System of Two Tissue Cultures," Psychoenergetic Systems, Vol. 1,
      No. 3, March 1976, pp 141-142.] <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Popp had begun experimenting with such an idea. If cancer-causing
      chemicals could alter the body's biophoton emissions, then it
      might be that other substances could reintroduce better
      communication. Popp wondered whether certain plant extracts could
      change the character of the biophoton emissions from cancer cells
      to make them communicate again with the rest of the body. He began
      experimenting with a number of non-toxic substances purported to
      be successful in treating cancer. In all but one instance, these
      substances only increased the photons from tumour cells, making
      them even more deadly to the body.<br>
      <br>
      The single success story was mistletoe, which appeared to help the
      body to 'resocialise' the photon emissions of tumour cells back to
      normal. In one of numerous cases, Popp came across a woman in her
      thirties who had breast and vaginal cancer. Popp found a mistletoe
      remedy that created coherence in her cancer tissue samples. With
      the agreement of her doctor, the woman stopped any treatment other
      than the mistletoe extract and, after a year, all her laboratory
      tests were virtually back to normal.<br>
      <br>
      To Popp, homoeopathy was another example of photon sucking. He had
      begun to think of it as a 'resonance absorber'. Homoeopathy rests
      upon the notion that like is treated with like. A plant extract
      that at full strength can cause hives in the body is used in an
      extremely diluted form to get rid of it. If a rogue frequency in
      the body can produce certain symptoms, it follows that a high
      dilution of a substance which can produce the same symptoms would
      also carry that frequency. Like a resonating tuning fork, a
      suitable homoeopathic solution might attract and then absorb the
      abnormal oscillations, allowing the body to return to normal
      health.<br>
      <br>
      Popp thought that electro-magnetic molecular signalling might even
      explain acupuncture. According to Traditional Chinese Medicine,
      the human body has a system of meridians, running deep in the
      tissues, through which flows an invisible energy the Chinese call
      ch'i, or the life force. The ch'i supposedly enters the body
      through these acupuncture points and flows to deeper organ
      structures (which do not correspond to those in Western biology),
      providing energy (or the life force). Illness occurs when this
      energy is blocked at any point along the pathways. According to
      Popp, the meridian system transmits specific energy waves to
      specific zones of the body.<br>
      <br>
      Research has shown that many of the acupuncture points have a
      dramatically reduced electrical resistance compared with the
      surrounding skin (10 kilo-ohms and 3 mega-ohms, respectively).
      Orthopaedic surgeon Dr Robert Becker, who has done a great deal of
      research on EM fields in the body, designed a special electrode
      recording device that rolls along the body like a pizza cutter.
      His many studies have shown electrical charges on every one of the
      people tested corresponding to the Chinese meridian points.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Light in human consciousness</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      I mention this latest work for those who may wish to explore the
      boundaries of photon research and theory. In a ground-breaking
      paper with the lengthy title of "Orchestrated Objective Reduction
      of Quantum Coherence in Brain Microtubules: The 'Orch OR' Model
      for Consciousness" by Stuart Hameroff and Roger Penrose, the brain
      is described as a quantum computer whose main architecture are the
      cytoskeletal microtubules and other structures within each of the
      brain's neurons. <br>
      <br>
      If you examine a neuron, you will see that there are many hollow
      tubes surrounding the axon. These microtubules have been thought
      of as a kind of scaffold to support the nerve fiber. But they are
      now getting a second look as the possible architecture of our
      consciousness.<br>
      <br>
      The particular characteristics of microtubules that make them
      suitable for quantum effects include their crystal-like lattice
      structure, hollow inner core, organization of cell function and
      capacity for information processing. According to the researchers,
      their size appears perfectly designed to transmit photons in the
      UV range.<br>
      <br>
      [Above:] Schematic of central region of neuron (distal axon and
      dendrites not shown), showing parallel arrayed microtubules
      interconnected by MAPs. Microtubules in axons are lengthy and
      continuous, whereas in dendrites they are interrupted and of mixed
      polarity. Linking proteins connect microtubules to membrane
      proteins including receptors on dendritic spines.<br>
      <br>
      "Traditionally viewed as the cell's 'bone-like' scaffolding,
      microtubules and other cytoskeletal structures now appear to fill
      communicative and information processing roles. Theoretical models
      suggest how conformational states of tubulins within microtubule
      lattices can interact with neighboring tubulins to represent,
      propagate and process information as in molecular-level 'cellular
      automata' computing systems." -- Hameroff and Watt, 1982;
      Rasmussen et al, 1990; Hameroff et al, 1992<br>
      <br>
      In their paper, Hameroff and Penrose present a model linking
      microtubules to consciousness using quantum theory. In their
      model, quantum coherence emerges, and is isolated in brain
      microtubules until a threshold related to quantum gravity is
      reached. The resultant self-collapse creates an instantaneous
      "now" event. Sequences of such events create a flow of time, and
      consciousness. <br>
      <br>
      Don't worry if you can't understand this. It's heavy reading but
      it does show that the existence of internal photons -- inner light
      -- is very real and is the basis of virtually all human cellular
      and systemic function.<br>
      <br>
      Could the Russian scientists really have changed a salamander
      embryo into a frog with lasers? I prefer to wait until the actual
      details of the experiment are published and reviewed -- but I am
      much less apt to dismiss this as fiction now that I know about our
      inner lights. <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Mistletoe
      chitin-binding lectin in the form of a homo-dimeric protein
      consisting of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of
      10.8 kDa, is new. Also claimed is a process for producing the
      lectin by extraction from plant material followed by
      chromatography.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a novel lectin, chitin, a process for its
      preparation and its use.<br>
      <br>
      The lectins of mistletoe (Viscuin album) in the last two decades
      have become increasingly important.<br>
      <br>
      Known mistletoe lectins consist of two disulfide-linked chains (A
      and B), and work in low concentrations of both immunostimulatory
      and cytotoxic effects on different cell systems.<br>
      <br>
      For the A-chain has been determined that it inhibits the RNA
      N-glycosidase activity, the protein synthesis; realizes the
      B-chain with carbohydrate binding activity of the cell contact.<br>
      <br>
      Detailed studies have shown that leaves and other tissues of the
      mistletoe lectins contain three (H. Franz (1991) in Advances in
      Lectin Research, Franz, H., ed) vol.<br>
      4, 33-50, Springer Verlag Berlin Heidelberg New York).<br>
      <br>
      Mistletoe lectin I (ML I) is a dimer with two [ASSB] pairs, lectin
      II (ML II) and lectin III (ML III), however, monomeric RIP in the
      second type are<br>
      At present, the use of mistletoe lectin I is preferred.<br>
      <br>
      The standardization of therapeutically used mistletoe extracts has
      previously not possible.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, now another lectin was found, which can be
      classified due to its structure and specificity in the group of
      chitin plant lectins.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, a new chitin agglutinin.<br>
      It is called Viscum album agglutinin or VisalbCBA chitin, which
      was isolated from the European mistletoe.<br>
      <br>
      The novel lectin is a dimeric protein composed of two identical
      subunits of 10.8 kDa.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly, it differs totally from the other previously
      described lectins ML I, ML II and ML III.<br>
      <br>
      So it has carbohydrate-binding specificity to oligomers of
      acetylglucosamine and shows sequence homology to chitin plant
      proteins, such as the Bohnenchitinase, the Nessellektin domain 1
      or similar.<br>
      <br>
      The new lectin is characterized by the N-terminal amino acid
      sequence of IDH RCGRE ATPPG KLCND GRCCS QWS.<br>
      <br>
      The isolation and purification of new chitin lectin by known
      methods by a combination of classical protein extraction
      techniques and affinity chromatography.<br>
      In a first step, the type 2 RIP lectins ML I, ML II and ML III are
      separated, and subsequently carried out by affinity chromatography
      on a Chitinsäule the final cleaning of the novel lectin.<br>
      <br>
      The thus prepared lectin is not glycosylated, soluble in water and
      acetic acid.<br>
      Furthermore, it is an extremely stable protein at pH values
      ??between 1 and 12 and is characterized by heat resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Due to its high stability, VisalbCBA suitable for use in medical
      preparations.<br>
      <br>
      The invention therefore also concerns the use of new chitin
      lectin.<br>
      It is particularly appropriate as cytotoxic agent used with
      conventional pharmaceutical excipients and additives.<br>
      <br>
      It was also found that the lectin affects the immune system, where
      it exerts a direct effect, but also indirectly through
      interactions were with the immunomodulator ML I. Thus, in
      combination with ML I found synergistic, additive or antagonistic
      effects.<br>
      <br>
      Then the invention of exemplary embodiments will be explained in
      more detail:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Isolation of a chitin mistletoe lectin<br>
      <br>
      1 kg leaves and twigs of mistletoe (Viscum album L.) are
      homogenized in 10 l of 20 mM acetic acid with a Waring blender.<br>
      <br>
      The homogenate was filtered and centrifuged (8,000 g for 10
      minutes), the supernatant is decanted and filtered through glass
      wool (to remove the floating particles).<br>
      <br>
      After addition of 1.5 g / l CaCl 2 with 1N NaOH, the extract is
      adjusted to a pH 9.0 and held for 3 hours at 2 ° C.<br>
      <br>
      The precipitate is separated by centrifugation (3,000 g for 10
      min) removed and the clear extract is adjusted with 1 N acetic
      acid to pH 3.0.<br>
      <br>
      After standing overnight in a cold room, the extract was
      centrifuged again (3,000 g for 10 minutes) and the supernatant is
      filtered through filter paper (Whatman 3MM).<br>
      <br>
      The filtrate is dissolved in an equivalent amount of distilled
      water and applied to a cation exchange column (10 cm x 5 cm, 200
      ml volume) of S Fast Flow (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden)
      equilibrated with 20 mM acetic acid.<br>
      <br>
      After loading the proteins, the column with 2 liters of 20 mM
      sodium formate (pH 3.8) is washed and the bound proteins were
      eluted with 500 ml of 0.5 M NaCl in the same buffer.<br>
      <br>
      To eliminate the type 2 RIP lectins ML I, ML II and ML III, the
      desorbed protein mixture is subjected to the S Fast Flow column
      following affinity chromatography on a galactose-Sepharose 4B and
      fetuin-Sepharose 4B.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the partially purified protein fraction with 1 N NaOH to pH
      7.4 and is set to a column (10 cm x 2.6 cm, about 50 ml) with
      galactose-Sepharose 4B applied, which is eliminated in ML-I.<br>
      <br>
      After passing through the protein fraction of the column with 200
      ml of PBS (phosphate buffered saline).<br>
      <br>
      The ML-I-free fraction and the washed solution to a
      fetuin-Sepharose 4B column (10 cm x 2.6 cm, about 50 ml) was added
      for removal of ML II and ML III.<br>
      <br>
      The unbound proteins (which are free of ML II, ML II and ML III)
      are the first 200 ml of PBS wash solution and combined on a chitin
      column (20 cm x 2.6 cm, approximately 100 ml - Type C-7170, Sigma
      brought).<br>
      <br>
      Unbound proteins are removed by washing the column with PBS until
      the A280 fell below 0.01.<br>
      <br>
      At the end of the lectin was desorbed with 20 mM acetic acid and
      then either dialyzed against PBS and stored at -20 ° C until his
      use or dialyzed against water and lyophilized.<br>
      <br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Analytical gel filtration of the purified lectin<br>
      <br>
      The analytical gel filtration of the purified lectin, called
      VisalbCBA is, as on a Pharmacia Superose 12 column, the 10 mg / ml
      of a mixture of N-acetylglucosamine oligomers (to prevent binding
      of the lectin to the column), using PBS running buffer carried
      out.<br>
      <br>
      Since the analogue of chitin lectins hevein domain are composed of
      the M r of the new mistletoe lectin using wheat germ agglutinin
      (34 kDa) and Nessellektin (M r 8.5 kDa) was determined as marker
      proteins.<br>
      <br>
      In the following, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of chitin
      VisalbCBA and some vegetable proteins, composed of the
      corresponding domains are compared.<br>
      <br>
      Cysteine ??residues (found in italics) were not identified, and
      that is positive, since this instability on underivatized PTH-cys
      are due.<br>
      <br>
      However, dehydroalanine, a typical beta-elimination product of
      cystine was observed in all the relevant compounds.<br>

      <br>
      Agglutination<br>
      <br>
      The specific Agglutinationsaktivität was determined using
      untreated and treated rabbits and human (type A) erythrocytes.<br>
      The agglutination assays were held in small glass vessels with a
      final volume of 0.1 ml containing a 1% suspension of red blood
      cells and 10 mu l cross or Lektinlösungen extracts.<br>
      The agglutination was visually inspected after one hour at room
      temperature.<br>
      VisalbCBA agglutinated untreated and trypsin-treated red blood
      cells of rabbits at concentrations between 2.5 mu g / ml and 10 mu
      g / ml.<br>
      When using human erythrocytes, the value was 3 times as high (5 mu
      g / ml and 30 mu g / ml).<br>
      <br>
      The carbohydrate-binding specificity of lectin was determined
      using the agglutination of Haptenhemmungsassays
      Kaninchenerythrocyten with glycoproteins, such<br>
      As thyroglobulin, fetuin, asialofetuin and ovomucoid and series of
      simple sugars.<br>

      Stability testing<br>
      <br>
      To evaluate the stability of chitin lectin VisalbCBA the effects
      under adverse conditions and some proteolytic enzymes were
      investigated.<br>
      <br>
      The use of proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin do not
      affect the activity of the lectin. It was completely stable in a
      pH range of 1 to 12. Moreover, it proved to be extremely resistant
      to heat. About 50% of Agglutinationsaktivität remained after
      cooking the Lektinlösung in PBS for 5 min.<br>
      <br>
      Example 6<br>
      <br>
      Cytotoxicity<br>
      <br>
      Investigations of the cytotoxicity of the new lectin in comparison
      to ML I, ML II and ML III were performed using Molt-4 cells.<br>
      <br>
      The result is shown in Table 2 below:<br>

      Survival rate of all cells in% Lektinkonzentration (ng / ml)<br>
      EMI7.1<br>
      <br>
      As Table 2 indicates, the novel lectin VisalbCBA has a toxic
      effect at concentrations above 100 ng / ml, this is lower than
      that of ML I, ML II and ML III, but it can thus certainly be
      regarded as a cytotoxic agent.<br>
