      <b>ABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE </b><br>
      <br>
      In a heat engine where heat is applied to a working fluid
      contained in a chamber to expand the fluid, removing the heat
      source while allowing the fluid to expand further, applying
      cooling while compressing the working fluid and removing the
      cooling while further compressing the fluid, said fluid during
      said expansion being applied to utilization means to perform work,
      the improvement therein comprising: having at least two chambers
      which contain a liquid and a gas section; hot and cold lines
      connecting 20 the liquid sections to the gas sections, including
      pumping means, heating and cooling means in the respective lines;
      forward and return flow passages communicating; between said
      liquid sections across one-way valves which allow flow into the
      forward flow passage and out of the return 25 flow passage, and a
      work area in series between the forward and return passages; and,
      timer means coupled to said hot and cold lines to sequentially
      allow hot and cool liquid to flow from liquid to gas sections to
      cause gas expansion and compression resulting in a flow of liquid
      out 30 of at least one chamber into said forward passage and/or
      out of said return passage into at least one chamber across said
      work area.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a differential heat engine and
      more particularly to a closed cycle heat engine which has
      controllable rate and duration of the heat input and rejection
      processes with few moving parts.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The fundamental concept of a heat engine is based upon the
      so-called "Carnot cycle" named after Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot.
      Carnot's work in the early nineteenth century was continued by
      Diesel and indeed, Diesel's early versions of his now famous
      diesel engine was based upon the teachings of Sadi Carnot. It is
      significant that heretofore, although "Carnot cycle" engines were
      known, they exist only in textbooks and as scientific 50
      curiosities (C. Osborn Mackey et al., Engineering Thermodynamics,
      John Wiley &amp; Sons, page 255) without any application in
      practice as industrial machines. The present invention concerns an
      industrial machine based on the teachings of Sadi Carnot and
      avoiding the pitfalls which befell Diesel, Stirling and others.<br>
      <br>
      A heat engine converts heat into work by adding heat to a working
      fluid, usually a gas, so that the fluid expands and exerts
      pressure on a piston or on turbine blades. Although steam and air
      are the most common working 60 fluids, in theory any gas can serve
      as the medium for this kind of energy conversion. The efficiency
      of the process, according to Carnot, does not depend on the choice
      of medium, but obviously some gases have more convenient
      properties than others. 65 The usual Carnot cycle engine described
      in textbooks is a one-cycle engine with a piston. In an ideal
      Carnot 2 cycle engine, at the start of the cycle, a large heat
      reservoir is in contact with the cylinder head, and beat flow ing
      from it into the working fluid causes the fluid to expand
      isothermally, that is, without an increase in temperature. Next,
      the heat source is removed and the cylinder head is insulated, the
      working fluid continues to expand 14 Claims with the expansion
      being adiabatic, that is, without the flow of heat to or from the
      fluid. The temperature of the fluid therefore drops. Then the
      piston must be driven back, compressing the fluid before it.
      During this compression the cylinder head is placed in contact
      with a cooler heat reservoir so that as the compression process
      occurs, heat flows from the fluid to the cold body such that the
      temperature of the fluid remains constant and the compression is
      isothermal. Finally, the cold body is re placed by insulation and
      the piston is returned to the starting position by adiabatic
      compression. The energy generated by the piston's work raises the
      temperature of the working fluid to its original level, thereby
      completing the cycle.<br>
      <br>
      It is significant that the previous workers in the field, e.g.,
      Brayton, Otto, Diesel, were not able to successfully construct a
      practical engine which operated on the Carnot cycle even though
      serious attempts were made to do so.<br>
      <br>
      In particular, the requirement of isothermal expansion has not
      been possible to meet in engines where air is the working fluid
      and its oxygen is used for combustion within the cylinder. Also,
      when combustion occurs in the cylinder, the combustion products
      must be removed and fresh air brought in. Therefore, in an
      internal combustion engine, the system must be an open one.<br>
      <br>
      Attempts have been made by other workers in the field to eliminate
      the troublesome piston. Typical of these at tempts is the one
      described in the T. Y. Korsgren, Sr., U.S. Pat. No. 3,183,662.
      However, in this patent, mechanically coupled fluid displacers are
      used which limit the cycle to that defined by Stirling. Also, the
      working cycle of the engine is closely coupled to the hot and cold
      cycle which hinders the usefulness of the engine in practice.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention, on the contrary, relates to a Carnot cycle
      closed loop system. It uses a heat transfer process which has a
      controllable duration and heat transfer rate in and out of the
      expansion chamber. This allows the tailoring of the cycle to meet
      isothermal or other requirements.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, although the components shown and de scribed herein
      appear in a compact configuration, the various component sections
      can be separated, elongated, and extended so as to occupy almost
      any type of space provided.<br>
      <br>
      This makes the engine particularly suitable for use where
      packaging is important, e.g., as a boat or airplane engine.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Generally speaking, the present invention provides for an engine
      preferably having at least two insulated chambers. Although these
      are shown one alongside the other in the drawing, they can be
      widely separated. Each chamber contains a gas and a liquid. The
      expansion and contraction of the gas in these chambers force the
      liquid to pass in and out through one-way valves connected to exit
      and return lines. These valves may be simple passive spring loaded
      check valves, or in some cases, they may be positive acting
      externally controlled valves. On expansion, fluid passes out of
      one chamber through a work flow chamber, which extracts work from
      the fluid and passes into the second chamber causing compression
      of its gas. Some of the liquid is also pumped separately from the
      liquid sections through two lines, one which is heated and the
      other cooled. During this heating and cooling, a phase change may
      or may not occur, e.g., it may form a gas upon heating. Heat is
      transferred to or from the gas at will by sequentially pumping hot
      or cold fluid to the gas section of the chamber. The amount,
      duration and 10 timing of the heat transfer is controlled by a
      distributor timer connected to the hot and cold lines. The fluid
      pumped into the gas section flows down to the liquid section to
      close its cycle.<br>
      <br>
      It is also possible to operate with only one chamber and 1,5 a
      reservoir, instead of the second chamber.<br>
      <br>
      The invention, as well as the objects and advantages thereof will
      be more apparent from the following detailed description, when
      taken in connection with the accompanying drawing in which:<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Shown in FIG. I is a differential heat engine 10, having a first
      insulated expansion chamber 12 and a second insulated expansion
      chamber 14. Each chamber is outwardly in the form of an elongated
      narrow rectangle and is divided generally into a gas section 16,
      16a and a liquid section 18, 18a. Advantageously, a layer of solid
      insulation 19 can be disposed to float over the liquid between the
      two sections. Connected to the output side or bottom of each
      chamber is a Y-connection 22 leading to a work flow chamber 24,
      wherein is located an output motor. a From the work flow chamber
      24 are first and second return lines 26, 28 to the first and
      second oil expansion chambers 12, 14. Each arm of the Y-
      connection 22 has an out-going check valve 30, 32. Each return
      line 26, 28 likewise has an in-feeding check valve 34, 36, i.e.,
      50 these are inflow valves. Each expansion chamber has a hot
      injection line 40, 40a and a cold injection line 42, 42a going
      from the liquid section to the gas section in each chamber. These
      lines respectively pass through heating means 44, 44a and cooling
      means 46, 46a. There is 55 also a pump 48a, 48b, 48c, 48d in each
      line. Each line is connected to a timer 52, which can alternately
      act on a hot injection line and a cold injection line in each
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SIMPLE OPERATING SEQUENCE </b><br>
      <br>
      The engine operates as follows:<br>
      <br>
      The hot line for one chamber and the cold line for the other
      chamber are acted on by the distributor timer. Liquid is pumped by
      the respective pumps and ejected 65 out of nozzles from the hot
      and cold lines. As the hot liquid is injected into the chamber by
      the nozzle, it is broken up into many fine particles which
      together present a large surface area to the gas. The gas expands
      pressing down on the liquid. Other means of creating small
      droplets 70 may also be used. The liquid flows through the one-way
      valve into one leg of the Y-connection into the work flow chamber.
      The work flow chamber has a turbine arrangement with an output
      shaft. As the liquid flows through the chamber, it causes the
      shaft to turn. The liquid then 4 goes into the return paths.
      During this time, the cold liquid also is injected into the other
      chamber, removing heat and contracting the gas. During this second
      portion, i.e., the adiabatic portion of the compression cycle, the
      inertia of the liquid in the chamber assists in the gas
      compression. Thus, liquid flows up the return path leading to the
      other chamber past the one-way valve and into the chamber. On the
      next cycle, the cold line of the first chamber and the hot line of
      the other chamber are acted upon. This time the liquid flow is
      down the other leg of the Y-connection, but again passes through
      the work flow chamber in the same direction continuing the
      rotation of the turbine. It is to be observed that the pumps do
      not pump the liquid across the turbine, but merely pump liquid
      from the bottom of the liquid section to the top of the gas
      section and the pressure of the gas is changed by the fact that a
      mist or droplets of hot or cold liquid hits the gas. Thus, the
      pumps do not see the turbine counter force. As for the turbine,
      all that the turbine sees is the liquid passing through the work
      flow chamber going from the Y-connection to the return lines.<br>
      <br>
      <b>HOT LIQUID AND WASTE HEAT RECOVERY</b><br>
      <br>
      In the operating sequence just described, the hot liquid supplied
      into the chamber by the nozzle should be metered, since if
      excessive liquid is thrown into the chamber, the heat produced by
      this excessive liquid is just wasted. Thus, only enough hot liquid
      for optimum operation is thrown into the chamber and no more. The
      simplicity of operation and efficiency may be greatly enhanced by
      recovering the hot liquid and also recovering the waste heat. The
      hot liquid recovery is shown in FIG. la, where only one of the
      insulated chambers is shown. In the chamber 13 is a hot liquid
      nozzle 15 having a multitude of small vertical apertures for
      spraying the liquid horizontally across the chamber. Opposite to
      hot liquid spray nozzle 15, is a hot liquid recovery vessel 17
      disposed below the level of the spray nozzles to recover the hot
      droplets sprayed across the chamber. Floating in the chamber 15 is
      a loose fitting block of insulation 19a, which will permit cold
      liquid to pass through to the lower chamber, and yet act as a
      thermal barrier to help maintain the isothermal and adiabatic
      portions of the cycle. Disposed at the top of the chamber is a
      cold liquid nozzle 15a which will spray cold liquid downwards.
      Below this cold liquid spray nozzle is the block of insulation
      19a. The cold liquid spray is not recovered, but on the contrary,
      is sprayed downwards towards the main body of liquid. From the
      bottom of the hot liquid recovery vessel 17, to the spray nozzle,
      is a feed forward line 21 having a pump 48e, a heating means 44b
      and a parallel by-pass line 23. The recovery vessel 17 and the
      by-pass line 23 have one-way valves 34a, 36a, which are active
      valves operated by a timing device 25. The by-pass line is
      necessary to provide a continuous oil flow during the cold cycle
      of the chamber 13, and thus, reduce the acceleration required
      during the start and stop portion of the injection cycles. The
      waste heat recovery is shown in FIG. lb. The heating means 44c is
      heated by a burner 45 having a fuel input section 47. The heat
      flows from the burner 45 to the heating means 44c and from there
      to an absorbent refrigeration system 49 and then is finally
      exhausted. The absorbent refrigeration system 49 is coupled to the
      cooling means 46b. The cold liquid from the bottom of the chamber
      passes through a pre-cooler, then to cooling means and is injected
      into the chamber from the top of the chamber and sprayed downwards
      vertically, as described. The hot liquid is recovered from the
      bottom of the recovery vessel, passes across the feed forward line
      to the spray nozzle, and is sprayed across the chamber
      horizontally.<br>
      <br>
      <b>WORKING EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      The theoretical device just described illustrates the 75
      principles of operation of the invention herein contemplated. A
      more practical engine based on these theoretical principles is
      shown in FIGS. 2 to 4. Thus, there are the two chambers 112 and
      114 made from an elongated, narrow, rectangular frame 113. The
      chambers 112 and 114 are defined by an insulated wall 115 within
      the frame. Each chamber has an upper gas section 116, 116a and a
      lower liquid section 118, 118a. Instead of the Y connection shown
      in FIG. 1, there is a straight forward passage 122 defined in the
      base of the frame. This forward passage 122 runs alongside both
      chambers on one side of the frame. Separating the forward passage
      from the chambers are reed valves 130. These reed valves are one-
      way valves allowing liquid to go out of the chambers into the
      forward passage, but not from the forward passage into the
      chambers. At one end of the engine is the 15 work flow chamber
      124, having a turbine and an output shaft 125. Along the other
      side of the frame is a return passage 128, similar to the forward
      passage, also connected to the work flow chamber 124, and again,
      this return passage is separated from the chambers by reed valves
      134. As best shown in FIG. 3, these reed valves 134 permit one-way
      flow into the chambers. Each chamber has a hot and a cool flow
      line 140, 142. Each line has a pump 148a, 148b and the hot flow
      lines have a heater 144, while the cool flow lines have a cooling
      coil 146. Each chamber has a suitable liquid, such as silicon
      fluoride oil, in the liquid section and a suitable gas, such as
      argon gas, in the gas section. The working embodiment just
      described works just like the theoretical machine previously
      described. There is a distributor timer 152, shown greatly
      magnified in the drawing. This can either be a mechanical cam or
      solid state electronic timer. The timer acts on one hot and one
      cold line simultaneously spraying hot and cold liquid in the
      respective chambers. The gas accordingly expands in the one
      chamber and contracts in the other, forcing liquid out of the
      chamber into the forward passage and bringing liquid into the
      other chamber from the return passage across the work flow
      chamber. Preferably, the feed to the work flow chamber is across
      auxiliary lines 154, which can properly guide the fluid flow
      across the chamber. If necessary, a whirling impeller can be used
      in the gas section to enhance the breaking up of the injected
      fluid. However, a good spray nozzle, such as a sonic spray nozzle,
      may be mounted in the outlet part of the lines into the gas
      chamber which sprays droplets of oil into the chamber in which
      case no whirling impeller is needed.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2a, the efficiency of the engine can be enhanced
      by providing a simulated flywheel effect. This is accomplished by
      using active valves with enabling means, e.g., solenoid actuated
      electro- magnetic valves. Thus, valves 130a and 134a are opened
      and closed by means of a solenoid 135 connected to the timer 152.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be observed, therefore, that the -present invention
      provides for an engine having at least two chambers 12, 14; 112,
      114, each chamber having a gas and a liquid section 16, 18; 116,
      118. Hot and cold pump lines which include appropriate pumps, and
      heating and cooling means, e.g. , 40, 42; 140, 142 are disposed to
      pump liquid from the liquid section to the gas section, either of
      the same chamber, or of another chamber. Connected to each liquid
      section across one-way valves outwards and inwards is a forward
      passage and a return passage 22, 122; 28, 128 with a work flow
      chamber 124 inbetween. A distributor timer 52, 152 is connected to
      each pump line to sequentially pump liquid across a hot or cold
      line from the liquid section to the gas section of the chambers,
      the expansion and contraction of gas in these chambers -forcing
      oil to pass out through the forward passage across the work flow
      chamber and back to another chamber through the return line.<br>
      <br>
      Should the pumps for one chamber fail to function, the engine will
      still operate, however with reduced efficiency. In other words,
      the second chamber acts as a reservoir.<br>

      According to the present inventive concept, hot oil 20 mist (or
      other suitable material) is injected at a controlled rate to
      obtain essentially isothermal, i.e., constant temperature
      expansion. The hot gas continues to expand approximately
      adiabatically, i.e., no heat in or out, in a insulated chamber.
      Then, cold oil mist is injected at a controlled rate to obtain
      isothermal compression. The gas is then compressed adiabatically.
      The advantages of this arrangement are several. Oil mist is used
      for heat transfer. Thus, there is a large surface area of a rapid
      heat transfer without loss of working volume. Also, the
      arrangement allows remote location of heat exchange units, i.e.,
      the heating and cooling units. This also means external
      combustion, rather than internal combustion. In order to obtain
      isothermal expansion and compression, there is a controlled heat
      rate input. Furthermore, other appropriate working curves for the
      system can be defined and controlled. The oil piston allows the
      use of fluid mist for the heat transfer without complicated oil
      recovery methods and also allows the use of insulated expansion
      chambers. There is no mechanical sliding surface internal to the
      engine. The production cost for the engine is greatly reduced with
      a greatly increased reliability and operating life of the engine.
      No rigid mechanical power transmission system is required. The oil
      output can be readily controlled and simple hydraulic feed lines
      can be placed where needed. Furthermore, the system lends itself
      to a low cost, reliable, silent, hermetically sealed engine that
      can operate on any heat source. This allows external combustion
      and fuels, in the case of a boat, truck, or automobile, which can
      greatly reduce undesirable pollution.<br>

        <b>PUMP HAVING MAGNETICALLY DRIVEN RECIPROCATING PISTONS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): ROESEL J <br>
      <br>
      A pump wherein the pumping takes place in an elongated chamber
      having first and second magnetic material piston members therein,
      at least one member being moveable and at least said one moveable
      member having check valve means therein so that liquid is flowed
      through the check valve means as the members are separating and
      the relative movement towards each other of the sections closes
      the check valve means. A unidirectional flow outlet between the
      members allows the liquid to be pumped out by the relative
      movement of the piston members. Facing each other on the outside
      of the chamber are first and second horseshoe electromagnets with
      first and second coils around each horseshoe. Connected to the
      first set of coils is an AC to DC converter to supply DC power to
      the coil, whereas the second coil has a line for connection to an
      AC source. The first coil, the converter and the second coil are
      in series so that the first horseshoe magnet presents alternating
      North and South poles, while the second horseshoe magnet has fixed
      North and South poles. When plugged into a line, the fixed poles
      are alternately presented with a similar and a different opposed
      pole. This causes the moveable piston members to be attracted to
      the poles on one cycle and be attracted to each other on the next
      cycle by virtue of the tendency of the pistons to move in the
      direction of maximum magnetic flux linkage, thus pumping the
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a pump, and more particularly to
      a pump which can be readily controlled, can work under various
      temperature conditions, and is small, sealed, and compact, so as
      to be fitted into a small space.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART</b><br>
      <br>
      Magnetically driven pumps usually have a spring return. Since
      about one-half of the magnetic force is used to store energy in a
      spring, the efficiency of such pumps is low, and the piston return
      is dependent on the spring force.<br>
      <br>
      Because of government incentives in the last few years,
      considerable efforts have been exerted by inventors to develop
      anti-pollution engines. Many of these engines are based on the
      so-called "Carnot Cycle" and derivatives thereof, such as the
      concepts of Diesel, Stirling, Brayton, Otto, and others. An
      example of such an engine is that described in the John F. Roesel,
      Jr., U. S. Pat. application No. 29,601, filed Apr. 17, 1970. Many
      of these engines require a pumping arrangement between phases, and
      in some cases, the pump may have to pump in succession a hot and a
      cold fluid. Heretofore, pumps for this type of work were of a
      laboratory type. However, if these engines are to be of any
      practical use, the pumps must be equal to the task and be long
      lasting. Furthermore, such pumps must be able to operate on a
      regularly available power source, such as a 60 cycle line or an
      automobile alternator. Because of the low efficiency of magnetic
      pumps, these pumps do not seem to be the type desired.<br>
      <br>
      Although attempts may have been made to provide such a magnetic
      pump, none, as far as I am aware, have been very successful in
      practice. Yet, the present invention is directed to a high
      efficiency magnetic pump free of the foregoing defects.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Briefly stated, the present invention contemplates a pump wherein
      the pumping takes place in an elongated chamber having first and
      second magnetic material piston members therein, at least one
      member being moveable and at least said one moveable member having
      check valve means therein so that liquid is flowed through the
      check valve means as the members are separting and the relative
      movement towards each other of the sections closes the check valve
      means. A unidirectional flow outlet between the members allows the
      liquid to be pumped out by the relative movement of the piston
      members. Facing each other on the outside of the chamber are first
      and second horseshoe electromagnets with first and second coils
      around each horseshoe. Connected to the first set of coils is an
      AC to DC converter to supply DC power to the coil, whereas the
      second coil has a line for connection to an AC source. The first
      coil, the converter and the second coil are in series so that the
      first horseshoe magnet presents alternating North and South poles,
      while the second horseshoe magnet has fixed North and South poles.
      When plugged into a line, the fixed poles are alternately
      presented with a similar and a different opposed pole. This causes
      the moveable piston members to be attracted to the poles on one
      cycle and be attracted to each other on the next cycle by virtue
      of the tendency of the pistons to move in the direction of maximum
      magnetic flux linkage, thus pumping the fluid.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      <b>Theoretical Device</b><br>
      <br>
      Shown in the drawing is an elongated chamber 11 of non-magnetic
      material containing sealingly reciprocating paramagnetic piston
      members 13 and 15 at both longitudinal ends. These metal members
      are made of a magnetic material and have an aperture with a check
      valve 17, 19 therein. Towards the center of the chamber 11 is an
      output port with a check valve 23. At the ends of the chamber 11
      are input ports 21a and 21b. On one side of the chamber 11 is a
      first laminated electromagnet assembly 25a with a coil 27a with
      poles 29a and 31a extending to both sides of the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      Opposite electromagnet 25a is a second laminated electromagnet
      assembly 25b substantially identical to electromagnet 25a. Second
      electromagnet 25b also has a coil 27b and poles 29b and 31b.
      Interposed between one end each of coils 27a and 27b is a diode
      bridge 33 consisting of four diodes 33a, 33b, 33c, 33d. The output
      sides of diodes 33a and 33b each face a common midpoint 35a,
      whereas the input sides of diodes 33c and 33d each receive an
      input from a common midpoint 35c. Diodes 33a and 33d are poled in
      the same direction across a common midpoint 35d connected to the
      input side of diode 33a and the output side of diode 33d.
      Likewise, diode 33b and 33c are poled in the same direction across
      a midpoint 35b, connected to the input side of diode 33b and the
      output side of diode 33c. Coil 27b is connected between midpoints
      35a and 35c. The inner end of coil 27a is connected to the
      midpoint 35d. One side 37 of the AC line voltage is connected to
      outer end of coil 27a. The other side 39 of the AC line voltage is
      connected to midpoint 35b.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OPERATION OF THE PUMP</b><br>
      <br>
      As sides 37 and 39 are plugged into a 60 cycle AC line, voltage in
      magnetic 25a alternates at 60 cycles and poles .sqroot.a, 31a
      change in polarity. Meanwhile voltage flowing in magnet 25b is
      pulsating DC voltage, since it has been rectified in diode bridge
      33. Therefore, the poles 29b and 31b in magnet 25b remain fixed
      while the polarity of poles 29a and 31a change in polarity. Thus,
      for example on one-half cycle of the 60 cycle AC North pole faces
      North pole and South pole faces South pole, while on the next
      one-half cycle the situation is reversed and North pole faces
      South pole, while South pole faces North pole. While applicant
      does not wish to be limited by the following analysis, it is
      theorized that since metal piston members 13 and 15 are
      paramagnetic, when the poles 29a and 29b, and 31a and 31b are
      aligned North-South and South-North respectively, the metal
      members tend to align themselves with the poles by virtue of lines
      of magnetic force being aligned generally between adjacent poles.
      When the pairs of opposite poles 29a and 29b, and 31a and 31b are
      the same polarity, the paramagnetic piston members tend to be
      attracted to each other by virtue of the lines of magnetic force
      being aligned generally between laterally spaced-apart poles,
      e.g., poles 29a and 31a, and 29b and 31b. The check valves 17, 19
      on metal members 13, 15 allow fluid to flow towards the central
      output port 23 as the pistons 13 and 15 reciprocate, but not
      towards the inlet ports 21a, 21b. Thus, fluid is pumped between
      the inlet ports 21a, 21b through outlet port 23.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PRACTICAL EMBODIMENT</b><br>
      <br>
      A practical embodiment of the inventive concept is depicted in
      FIG. 2. Here, the part numbers are in the hundred series, but
      generally the part number in the hundred series correspond to
      those in the tens series of FIG. 1. Thus, the cylindrical
      elongated chamber 111 of FIG. 2 corresponds to elongated chamber
      11 of FIG. 1. Fluid, e.g., water is fed to both ends of chamber
      111 by a pipe 112 connected to one inlet port 121a, which in FIG.
      2 is above the chamber end. Pipe 112 is fastened to inlet port
      121a by a joint or union 114. Also, fluid is carried to the other
      inlet port 121b by a curved duct 116 from the first inlet port.
      Within the cylindrical elongated non-magnetic chamber 111 are
      cylindrical paramagnetic piston members 113 and 115. These piston
      members 113 and 115 each have a fast acting check valve
      arrangement which consists of a non-paramagnetic drum section 118
      having peripheral apertures 120. Thus, fluid entering inlet port
      121a will flow through these apertures 120. On the inner side of
      the drum section 118 is a disk shim 119 mounted on a central axle
      (not visible) and held by a stop 117. As the pistons 113 and 115
      move toward one another fluid trapped on the inner side between
      the pistons push the shim 119 against the apertures 120 thereby
      effectively providing for positive displacement of fluid outwardly
      through check valve 123. As the pistons 113 and 115 move away from
      one another fluid on the outer side will push through the
      apertures 120 against the shim 119 pushing the shim away from the
      apertures 120 thereby allowing fluid on the outward side of the
      pistons to flow inwardly thereof providing an intake stroke in
      preparation for the inward discharge stroke of pistons 113 and
      115. On the inner side of paramagnetic piston members is a second
      paramagnetic drum section 122, also with apertures 124
      corresponding somewhat to apertures 120 but shim 119 can not seat
      against apertures 124 on the intake stroke because of stop
      shoulder 117, see FIG. 4. However, much more important is the
      peculiar comb-like construction of second drum section 122. This
      drum is made of individual laminations 126, which may be made by
      slotting the solid pieces, and is tied to the drum base with air
      gaps in between and a vertical aperture 126a at the outer end. The
      slotting or lamination is to increase the magnetic permeability of
      this paramagnetic drum section so as to properly align this
      section up with the poles 129a and 131a, and 129b and 131b of the
      electromagnets 125a and 125b respectively. The vertical aperture
      126a allows the pumped fluid to rapidly enter the pump outlet.
      These horseshoe electromagnets 125a, 125b, have each of their two
      poles 131a and 131b encircled by a pair of coils 127a, and a pair
      of coils 127b respectively. The poles 131a, 131b having a curved
      pole face 128 whose radius of curvature corresponds to the outer
      wall of chamber 111. The laminar electromagnets 125a and 125b are
      held together in assembled relation by bracket pieces 130 and
      screws 132 and the cylindrical chamber 111 is sealed with end
      walls 134, only one of which is shown held to the chamber wall by
      screws 136, only one of which is shown. The end walls 134 have
      springs 138 tending to impel the metal members 113, 115 inwards.
      The object of these springs is 0merely to keep the metal members
      from striking and possible sticking to the chamber closures 134.
      The pump outlet is through a central pipe 140 having a check valve
      123 therein. This check valve 123 can be similar to that shown in
      FIG. 3. Thus, in practice, the check valve is a free floating disk
      guided by a cylindrical section through a center aperture in the
      disk of such length as to allow surface movement from the seating
      surface to a stop which restricts the disk movement to a designed
      maximum open position. The seating surface of the disk is on a low
      friction, self lubricating guide containing appropriate passages
      for fluid flow contained within the outer periphery of the disk.<br>
      <br>
      Also, as hereinbefore pointed out, magnetically driven spring
      return pumps cannot supply a pumping pressure equal to the
      magnetic force, as approximately one-half of the force is used to
      store energy in a spring to return the piston to the starting
      position for the next magnetically driven stroke. However, the
      maximum pressure available in the pump herein described, which is
      limited only by the magnetic flux that can be produced, is
      approximately twice the pressure that is available in a pump where
      the piston or diaphram is returned by spring action.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in the alternate embodiment of FIG. 5, the two check
      valves 217a and 219a can allow passage in the same direction.
      Thus, the input is at one end and the output at the other end of
      the chamber 111a.<br>
