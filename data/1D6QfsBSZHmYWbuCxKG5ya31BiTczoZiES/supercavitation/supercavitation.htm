      <div align="center"><big><b>Supercavitation</b></big><br>
      </div>
      <b> </b> <br>
      Supercavitation is the use of cavitation effects to create a
      bubble of gas inside a liquid large enough to encompass an object
      travelling through the liquid, greatly reducing the skin friction
      drag on the object and enabling achievement of very high speeds.
      Current applications are mainly limited to projectiles or very
      fast torpedoes, and some propellers, but in principle the
      technique could be extended to include entire vehicles. This
      phenomenon can also be produced by the very fast strike of the
      appendages of the crustacean mantis shrimp Odontodactylus
      scyllarus, that uses it to attack and kill its prey.[1]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Physical principle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In water, cavitation occurs when water pressure is lowered below
      the water's vapour pressure, forming bubbles of vapour. That can
      happen when water is accelerated to high speeds as when turning a
      sharp corner around a moving piece of metal such as a ship's
      propeller or a pump's impeller. The greater the water depth (or
      pressure for a water pipe) at which the fluid acceleration occurs,
      the lesser the tendency for cavitation because of the greater
      difference between local pressure and vapour pressure. (The
      non-dimensional cavitation number is a measure of the tendency for
      vapour pressure bubbles to form in a liquid, calculated as the
      difference between local pressure and vapour pressure, divided by
      dynamic pressure.) Once the flow slows down again, the water
      vapour will generally be reabsorbed into the liquid water. That
      can be a problem for ship propellers if cavitation bubbles implode
      on the surface of the propeller, each applying a small force that
      is concentrated in both location and time, causing damage.<br>
      <br>
      A common occurrence of water vapour bubbles is observed in a pan
      of boiling water. In that case the water pressure is not reduced,
      but rather, the vapour pressure of the water is increased by means
      of heating. If the heat source is sufficient, the bubbles will
      detach from the bottom of the pan and rise to the surface as
      steam. Otherwise if the pan is removed from the heat the bubbles
      will be reabsorbed into the water as it cools, possibly causing
      pitting or spalling on the bottom of the pan as the bubbles
      implode.<br>
      <br>
      A supercavitating object is a high speed submerged object that is
      designed to initiate a cavitation bubble at the nose which (either
      naturally or augmented with internally generated gas) extends past
      the aft end of the object, substantially reducing the skin
      friction drag that would be present if the sides of the object
      were in contact with the liquid in which the object is submerged.
      A key feature of the supercavitating object is the nose, which may
      be shaped as a flat disk or cone, and may be articulated, but
      which likely has a sharp edge around the perimeter behind which
      the cavitation bubble forms.[2] The shape of the object aft of the
      nose will generally be slender in order to stay within the limited
      diameter of the cavitation bubble. If the bubble is of
      insufficient length to encompass the object, especially at slower
      speeds, the bubble can be enlarged and extended by injection of
      high pressure gas near the object's nose.[2]<br>
      <br>
      The great speed required for supercavitation to work can be
      achieved temporarily by a projectile fired under water or by an
      airborne projectile impacting the water. Rocket propulsion can be
      used for sustained operation, with the possibility of tapping high
      pressure gas to route to the object's nose in order to enhance the
      cavitation bubble. An example of rocket propulsion is the Russian
      Shkval supercavitating torpedo.[3][4] In principle, maneuvering
      may be achieved by various means such as drag fins that project
      through the bubble into the surrounding liquid[5] (p. 22), by
      tilting the nose of the object, by injecting gas asymmetrically
      near the nose in order to distort the geometry of the cavity, by
      vectoring rocket thrust through gimbaling for a single nozzle, or
      by differential thrust for multiple nozzles.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Applications</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In 1960, the USSR started developing a project under the codename
      Squall run by NII-24 (Kiev) to develop a high-speed torpedo, an
      underwater rocket, four to five times faster than traditional
      torpedoes capable of combating enemy submarines. Several models of
      the device were made, the most successful – M-5 – was created by
      1972. In 1972 to 1977, over 300 test launches were made (95% of
      them on Issyk Kul lake), by 29 November 1972 VA-111 Shkval was put
      into service with mass production started in 1978.<br>
      <br>
      In 2004, German weapons manufacturer Diehl BGT Defence announced
      their own supercavitating torpedo, Barracuda, now officially named
      "Superkavitierender Unterwasserlaufkörper" or "supercavitating
      underwater running body" (English translation). According to
      Diehl, it reaches more than 400 kilometres per hour (250 mph).[6]<br>
      <br>
      In 1994, the US Navy began developing a sea mine clearance system
      invented by C Tech Defense Corporation, known as RAMICS (Rapid
      Airborne Mine Clearance System), based on a supercavitating
      projectile stable in both air and water. These have been produced
      in 12.7 millimeters (0.50 in), 20 millimetres (0.79 in), and 30
      millimetres (1.2 in) diameters.[7] The terminal ballistic design
      of the projectile allowed it to cause explosive destruction of sea
      mines as deep as 45 meters (148 ft) underwater with a single
      round.[8] In 2000, these projectiles were used to successfully
      destroy a range of live underwater mines when fired from a
      hovering Sea Cobra gunship at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. RAMICS is
      currently[when?] undergoing development by Northrop Grumman for
      introduction into the fleet. The darts of German (Heckler &amp;
      Koch P11) and Russian underwater firearms,[9] and other similar
      weapons are also supercavitating.<br>
      <br>
      In 2005, DARPA announced the 'Underwater Express program', a
      research and evaluation bid to establish the potential of
      supercavitation. The program's ultimate goal is a new class of
      underwater craft for littoral missions that can transport small
      groups of Navy personnel or specialized military cargo at speeds
      up to 100 knots. The contracts were awarded to Northrop Grumman
      and General Dynamics Electric Boat in late 2006.[citation needed]
      In 2009, DARPA announced progress via a new class of submarine.<br>
      <br>
      The submarine's designer, Electric Boat, is working on a
      one-quarter scale model for sea trials off the coast of Rhode
      Island. If the trials are successful, Electric Boat will begin
      production on a full scale 100-foot submarine. Currently, the
      Navy's fastest submarine can only travel at 25 to 30 knots while
      submerged. But if everything goes according to plan, the
      Underwater Express will speed along at 100 knots, allowing the
      delivery of men and materiel faster than ever."[10]<br>
      <br>
      Iran claimed to have successfully tested its first supercavitation
      torpedo on 2 April and 3 April 2006. Some sources have speculated
      it is based on the Russian VA-111 Shkval supercavitation torpedo,
      which travels at the same speed.[11] Russian Foreign Minister
      Sergei Lavrov denied supplying Iran with the technology.[12] Iran
      called this weapon the Hoot (Whale).<br>
      <br>
      A prototype named the Ghost, designed for stealth operations by
      Gregory Sancoff of Juliet Marine Systems, uses supercavitation to
      propel itself atop two struts with sharpened edges. The vessel
      rides smoothly in choppy water and has reached speeds of 29
      knots.[13]<br>
      <br>
      Artist rendering of a supercavitating propeller in action<br>
      <br>
      The supercavitating propeller is a variant of a propeller for
      propulsion in water, where supercavitation is actively employed to
      gain increased speed by reducing friction. They are being used for
      military purposes and for high performance boat racing vessels as
      well as model boat racing. The supercavitating propeller operates
      submerged with the entire diameter of the blade below the water
      line. Its blades are wedge-shaped to force cavitation on the whole
      forward face, starting at the leading edge, in order to reduce
      water skin friction. As the cavity collapses well behind the
      blade, the supercavitating propeller avoids the spalling damage
      due to cavitation that is a problem with conventional propellers.<br>
      Alleged applications<br>
      <br>
      The Kursk submarine accident was rumored to have been due to a
      faulty Shkval torpedo,[14] though later evidence points to a
      faulty 65-76 torpedo - see Kursk submarine disaster.<br>

      Deagel.com reported on August 18, 2013:<br>
      <br>
      The Shkval, 'Squall' in English, is a nuclear-capable underwater
      anti-ship missile designed for use by nuclear-powered submarines
      against large surface ships such as aircraft carriers. It
      comprises a rocket-assisted propeller, which allows a top speed of
      220 mph and a maximum range of 6 nautical miles, and a torpedo
      warhead. The super-cavitating Shkval is considered silent and
      fast, up to 3-to-4 times over existing torpedoes. The underwater
      rocket produces a high-pressure stream of bubbles from its nose
      and skin, which coats the torpedo in a thin layer of gas and forms
      a local envelope of super-cavitating bubbles achieving low drag.
      It is not clear whether the lack of a guidance system or, if
      exists, how it works. Due to its unique characteristics, Shkval is
      deemed as one of the most advanced naval weapon systems currently
      deployed worldwide. The torpedo is assembled at the Dastan Torpedo
      Plant in Kyrgyzstan.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the Russian Navy, the Shkval rocket-assisted
      torpedo has been sold to India, Iran and Ukraine. In 2008 it was
      said that Iran may use the Shkval underwater rocket to target the
      US Navy's aircraft carriers in the Persian Gulf. According to some
      reports they may use small fast boats as launch platforms. Russia
      claims that Ukraine sold five brand-new Shkval underwater missiles
      to Georgia prior to August 2008 conflict. Its development started
      in times of the Soviet Union and was completed by Russia after
      2000. This missile system has been pointed out as the source of
      the fatal accident that shrunken the Russian Navy's Kursk
      nuclear-powered boat in August 2000. Apparently, the missile was
      undergoing tests aboard the doomed submarine.<br>

      PURPOSE: To enhance the efficiency at low speeds without degrading
      the supercavitating section performance at high speed by providing
      hybrid blades in which cavitation is not caused in the radially
      inner section of each blade and supercavitation is caused in the
      radially outer section thereof. CONSTITUTION: In the body 11 of a
      plurality of propeller blades 10 supported by a hub 12, the sharp
      edge 38 functions as the front edge during rotation, and the edge
      40 functions as the rear edge; and arc-shaped suction and
      pressurization side surfaces 24, 26 are formed so that the
      cavitation is not caused in the radially inner section 18 at the
      time of high speed rotation. Further, arc-shaped suction and
      pressurization side surfaces 34, 36 are formed so that the
      radially outer section 28 causes supercavitation. In other words,
      supercavitation is caused in each blade 10 at high speed, however,
      in addition to the outer section 28 where subcavitation is caused
      at low speed, the inner subcavitation section 18 is provided.
      Thus, the operation under the subcavitation of both sections in
      each propeller blade is enabled without impairing the function of
      the supercavitation sections at high speed, so that the efficiency
      at low speed can be improved.<br>

      The present invention is one kind of water-jetting propulsion
      system utilizing supercavitation in realizing vapor-liquid two

      supercavitation impeller with vanes designed based on Tulin
      supercavitating foil principle can operate normally under
      cavitation and supercavitation condition. Both the vapor phase and
      the liquid phase in the back of the impeller are converted in the
      kinetic energy converter before being jetted via the thruster to
      produce thrust in the outlet of the thruster. The kinetic energy
      converter can guide the flow of both the vapor phase and the

      A supercavitation ventilation control system is disclosed and
      includes a vehicle body having a fore end and an aft end. A
      cavitator is fit to the fore end of the vehicle body, the
      cavitator generating a gas cavity around the vehicle body. A
      cavity control ring is slidably positioned at the aft end of the
      vehicle body, the cavity control ring selectively adjusting a
      terminal end of the cavity formed by the cavitator. A stop ring is
      adjustably positioned on the vehicle body forward of the cavity
      control ring for managing a reentrant jet generated by the cavity
      control ring. Each of the stop ring and cavity control ring are
      moveable by separate actuators and a single control system.<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      A method and apparatus for propelling a surface vehicle through
      the water comprised of a submerged portion, including both a stern
      propulsion unit and a bow propulsion unit. Either unit may be a
      pumpjet, the bow unit may include a counter-rotating nose hub
      having attached spirally wound, twin centrifugal propeller blades.
      The foremost bow propeller is dedicated to stealth and the
      next-in-line bow propeller is dedicated to supercavitation.
      Specially-designed vortex loops that connect the pressure side to
      the intake side of a propulsion unit may be included in the
      blades, shroud or hub areas. Further, slightly diverged jet
      exhaust and variable special surface texturing reduce surface
      friction drag on the vehicle body.; The submarine propulsion
      system is used to power a surface vessel, supported by two or more
      hydrofoils which combine a submerged midcraft foil with a
      wave-piercing variety. The surface craft has the capability of
      submerging and maneuvering.<br>

      </div>
      <b> </b><br>
      A jet propulsion system for a submersible vehicle, such as a
      submarine includes a propulsion unit mounted away from the stem of
      the submersible. Generally, the propulsion system consists of a
      set of blades secured to a hub within a shroud. Combining such a
      propulsion system with a surface texture treatment greatly reduces
      overall drag while improving the submersible's efficiency.
      Further, such an arrangement contributes to the submersibles
      stealthy characteristics. An additional hub and set of high-speed
      blades capable of generating a supercavity may be added to achieve
      supercavitation. The propulsion system can be varied to include a
      pumpjet and/or a centrifugal force blade system.<br>

      A projectile is provided that includes a body having a front tip
      portion and a rear end portion. A combustion chamber base plate is
      operatively arranged with the rear end portion of the body and
      defines a combustion chamber. At least one radial discharge
      aperture is partially defined by the combustion chamber base plate
      and is arranged in fluid communication with the combustion
      chamber. A gas generated by igniting a combustible material is
      discharged through the at least one radial discharge aperture. The
      discharged gas impinges against a wall of a cavity formed by the
      moving projectile to form a reactive force that stabilizes the
      projectile thereby reducing the occurrence of tail-slap.<br>
