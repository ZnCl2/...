        b. April 4, 1920; d. Nov. 27, 2010, Forsyth Rosebud County

      He was a 50 year member "The International Union of Operating
      Engineers" (IUOE)<br>
      <br>
      He engineered and implemented many HV high power transmission
      lines and other advanced projects. He designed, tested and helped
      to install (As well as "Worked out the bugs" of the 1Million volt
      transmission line going along the west coast of USA. (For decades
      this was the highest voltage transmission line operating on the
      planet earth). <br>
      <br>
      He was a child prodigy working on electrical motors from before he
      went to school.&nbsp; At grade three he built and demonstrated his
      first over unity, self running motor, to the amazement of his
      teachers and classmates and many others.<br>
      <br>
      He totally rebuilt his first car at 12 years of age. He bought it
      from a junk yard for $11. In less than one month, he rebuilt the
      engine, the transmission, the body, everything! <br>
      <br>
      He entered the military WWII underage using altered birth data.
      His genius was recognized early on. He was promoted numerous
      times. It was not long before he was teaching electrical
      engineering to 1000s of other enlisted men. He quickly rose to the
      top. He was recruited to work at the right hand of Nikola Tesla on
      the infamous "Philadelphia Experiment" The Radar invisibility and
      Optical Invisibility Project. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Being the militaries top Electrical Engineer (There were NO
      Electronic Engineers at that time), they placed Ron at the right
      hand of Nicola Tesla. (There have been a number of movies made
      about the events that transpired at this time. For those
      interested in the true story. See the free video classes at
      witts.ws/archives. There are several different classes that cover
      the Philadelphia Experiment, and what ACTUALLY transpired, and how
      to repeat it yourself, if you have the time and resources.) &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In the 1970s, Ron built a 90 mpg carburetor. It was forcibly
      shelved by the US Government<b> :</b><br>

      He was aware of Volcheck that drove an engine with unusual freon
      type expansion properties as the motivating power. He sent a can
      of Flourinert to me and I, Buster Anderson, did a search and found
      3M had a similar freon type fluid called Performance Fluid. In a
      simple test with ammonia in sealed ¼ inch pipes with diesel glow
      plugs, pressure gauges with equal wattage, the ammonia was about 2
      psi for about 12 psi with the Performance Fluid.<br>
      <br>
      Along these lines, The engineers at Witts.ws did an project with a
      heat/cold turbine engine and refrigerant and were able to drive
      the car with just from the heat off the road as the power source.
      No fuel was consumed. I Buster supplied the double headed piston
      pump for that experiment and paid for the turbine and shipping
      back to Canada when they needed storage room. <br>
      <br>
      Ron used surplus military electronics with higher .9 ratings that
      tapped zero point energy by switching between battery packs. Those
      trying to replicate it with commercial lower grade electronics
      have not yet achieved consistent over unity yet that I am aware
      of. Ron was more polar of the dipolar and parapolar fields so his
      auric field helped to influence overunity. That is why so many
      have overunity effects but the device goes under unity when they
      are not around. I myself am dipolar so that when I walked up to an
      operating Joseph Newman machine in an overunity unshielded mode,
      it started slowing down when I was about 10 feet away. <br>

      is just one example.<br>
      <br>
      Tesla was working with Brandt on this Tesla switch initially
      during the preparation during off time for the Philadelphia
      Expirement and the name then became the Tesla Brandt switch.<br>
      <br>
      For balanced &amp; stable over-unity, what I have learned from
      www.witts.ws is that regular electricity needs to be balanced
      between different types of sub atomic particles, fields and
      flows.&nbsp; It appears electrons are NOT the only things that
      flow thru wires!&nbsp; Keep the energies balanced or the
      components burn out.&nbsp; Consult further with them for more
      knowledge. <br>

      Page 11 &amp; 12 information published on the internet about Ron's
      over-unity perm-mag motor that Ron Brandt was demonstrating to
      various people and audiences.<br>
      <br>
      As I understand it, there were several vehicles that Ron ran
      overunity. The most famous was during the 60's and 70's. The
      photos I have of one vehicle is a later modified car of several.<br>
      <br>
      Be aware that fractions that don’t want these technologies out
      hire trolls to post disinformation and skepticism.<br>
      <br>
      Also other inventors &amp; groups use that angle as a cover story
      as to why they don’t have over-unity and unfortunately many people
      have lost life savings and even their home by dishonest greedy
      people. (See Dirty Tricks list and Best Energy links with caveats
      list, for your protection).<br>
      <br>
      The plans for his Perm-Mag Motor that I have are for 2 basic
      designs that tested up to 60 hp (1 hp per pound of weight
      approximately not counting the controller) and by adding the
      mirror to the shaft is 120 hp. Ron first thought that it would be
      10 hp when designing it. The larger design is 250 hp and by adding
      the mirror was up to 500 hp tested on a dynamometer (Prony brake).
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Initially the efficiency was 400% from reports. However
      efficiencies continued to improve as the engineers involved did
      more engineering and more fine tuning with over 4 controllers
      built. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      In the best result that was reported, the input was less than 1
      amp in for 60 hp out on the 60 hp model. At 48 volts in, that
      would be a COP of 932x. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      That compares with the dyno test of Joseph Newman done at Lawrence
      Technological University were the efficiency went up as the
      voltage increased:<br>
      <br>
      1,076 vinput&nbsp; .151 hp out 118% efficiency<br>
      <br>
      1,426 vinput&nbsp; .495 hp out 327% efficiency<br>
      <br>
      1,729 vinput&nbsp; 1.14 hp out 700% efficiency <br>
      <br>
      In Joseph Newman’s 7th edition book, he also shows oscilloscope
      readings where extra power was coming in what some call dominant
      energy. When I tried to buy the 8th edition, the building that
      published the books had burnt down. It is now online at:<br>

      We should all thank all these men for their tireless work bringing
      solutions to mankind, to fix the problems at hand, worldwide!
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      We should also thank Joseph Newman, for turning down any offer he
      chose when they wouldn’t promise to put it into production. And
      open sourcing the technology with the dyno test, validations
      including Dr. Roger Hastings principle physicist for Sperry Univac
      acting on his own behalf. He also shows oscilloscope readings on
      the extra energy coming in on the harvested back emf. That dyno
      test has opened up doors such as talking with Eugene Fischer (with
      over 200 various patents himself) that was head of IBM research
      before it was IBM. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      And Eugene in turn, connected me with Sir Timothy Thrapp, current
      Spokesman of World Improvement Ministries [ http:// www.witts.ws ]<br>
      <br>
      Sir T is a master EE as well as a master of all the various
      "electrical-like" fields and flows, as well as highly proficient
      at all types of engineering. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      He has MANY very real demos on the internet, including you tube,
      demonstrating SELF RUNNING motors and generators. (This is NOT a
      typo. They clearly show COP of infinity!) Thousands of independent
      engineers, myself included, have seen these demos first hand and
      been invited to check for anything unscrupulous. <br>
      <br>
      Every engineer that has seen these demos have unanimously
      concluded that these demos are 100% real. and exactly as
      presented! <br>
      <br>
      I (Buster Anderson) visited Ron Brandt June 7-17, 2010. He was
      generous enough to be very reasonable in allowing me to enter his
      lab building, see his huge lab was filled with machining tools,
      parts, incomplete units, book shelves of technical books, and
      photostat machine drawing and the schematics’ for one of his
      controllers, photostat his blank circuit board and give me two
      lamination rings for the 60 hp, three lamination rings for the 120
      hp motor and one magnet. He wound the one 120 hp lamination with
      colored yarn and black marker pen on the one lamination to show
      how it was wound. The simple 1 page signed agreement between us
      was that I would be allowed to open source it if there was no
      other way to get it out.<br>
      <br>
      The estate was purchased by 2 individuals who parted out and sold
      off various assets such as the buildings, land, machine tools and
      equipment. They retained Ron Brandt’s motors, controllers &amp;
      documentation that had several hundred thousand dollars of
      investment primarily by witts.ws. <br>
      <br>
      I was able to make contact finally with the one partner in May
      2016 but when he wouldn’t give me a starting figure to negotiate,
      I then let him know I am open sourcing it. And they can let me
      know what they will decide to do in the future. <br>
      <br>
      The documentation now released on Ron Brandt’s conference
      demonstrations by www.witts.ws in their archives show #300 with
      the first 15 minute sessions of the split out total hour starting
      at 45:49 to 1 hour is also a huge help. <br>

      hp overunity self running BLDC motors that fits inside a 2ft x 2ft
      x 2ft box with controller. He was boy genius working on electrical
      motors in grade 3 and with Nikola Tesla on the Philadelphia
      Experiment. He continued Joseph Newman's overunity permanent high
      voltage motors with electronic control switching increasing the
      power output per lb by 500x<br>

      There are such BLDC builders as DIAZ showing on youtube of their
      building very similar motors. So far, they haven't incorporated
      the overunity controller. Posted there is gerber files not quite
      yet complete and links to several better 1 stop pcb board
      manufacturers in a word doc.<br>
      <br>
      A patent has been applied for in Canada in order to help protect
      from some large corporation from patenting first with the threat
      of stopping others. Those that desire to have a joint venture in
      developing the controller to higher voltage up to 2,000 volts
      micro amps current so they can run on little 5 volt batteries in
      series like Joseph Newman did on one version, can contact me. An
      assignment of patent for their country can be signed giving them
      more incentive to develop faster. What is nice is the modular
      build of this motor with lamination packs that can bolted in and
      out along with conventional controllers or replacing with
      overunity controllers instead. The market for such a compact high
      power BLDC alone is significant.<br>
      <br>
      I highly recommend downloading and mirroring the google drive to
      share with others as I was threatened within 4 months of
      contacting Joseph Newman for trying to raise $500,000 capital in
      order to become a Alberta manufacturer and distributor back in
      1996 with having my wife taken hostage. For those that think this

      <b>Brandt Closed Loop Optically Coupled BLDC Motor Drive System
        Operational Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Brushless DC (BLDC) Motors are used in a number of applications
      where low noise, highly efficient operation is desired. These
      motors compare favorably to other DC and AC motors. These motors
      are controlled by adjusting the field winding voltage/current
      typically in conjunction with monitoring the rotor position by
      means of position sensors and tachometers. Although, these motors
      are very efficient (&gt; 90% in some cases) they do require
      external power sources to drive the control circuitry and have
      losses. The losses are mechanical, primarily frictional, and
      electromagnetic. Frictional losses may be harnessed to aid in
      cooling the motor; however, electromagnetic losses are typically
      unaddressed.<br>
      <br>
      The Brandt Closed Loop Optically Coupled BLDC Motor Drive System
      is designed to harvest the unused electromagnetic energy. The
      system employs Hall sensors for position sensing, optical switches
      for phase excitation and a high performance controller IC equipped
      with top and bottom driver outputs, programmable oscillator,
      position sensor decoder. The system separates itself from other
      drivers by the use of a feedback circuit that captures
      electromagnetic energy from the field windings. The captured
      energy is converted to DC and added to the motor power improving
      the motor’s output and increasing its efficiency.<br>

      I purchased the estate of Ron Brandt, the inventor of the Tesla
      switch, this past summer. Items include a number of his Tesla
      switches, perm-mag motors, diagrams, vidoes and audio tapes of
      experiements and various mock ups. Wondering what I should do with
      these items.&nbsp; -- <b>Rhett Spencer </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Back in 1992 or 1991 Ron Brandt spent a few weeks with me and we
      ran his transistor switched circut using 4 batteries 6 transistors
      and a few other components.&nbsp; we uses a signal generator to
      adjust the switching freq for maximum output to the load. we used
      4 car headlights for the load on the switching unit and 1 on each
      of the baseline batteries.&nbsp; we had 2 extra batteries we used
      as baselines.&nbsp; to start off we charged all batteries using an
      astron 50 amp powersupply. all batteries were new.<br>
      <br>
      We measured the SG of the electrolite and also the battery voltage
      4 hours after charging before we began testing.&nbsp; each of the
      baseline batteries with 1 headlight attached lasted I believe 7
      hours before reaching 7 volts, our cutoff point.&nbsp; the 4
      batteries being switched ran for 73 hours before reaching the 7
      volt mark.<br>
      <br>
      We would check the frequency every hour or so longer intervals at
      night maybe 4 hours to keep it at maximum output to the
      load.&nbsp; somewhere around 900 to 1100 Hz if i remember
      correctly.<br>
      <br>
      After the first test all batteries were recharged with the power
      supply and we calculated the total recharge power we used to get
      the sg and voltage back to where we started. the 4 switching
      batteries required the same recharge time as the baseline
      batteries to reach our full charge state.<br>
      <br>
      The second and 3rd test seemed to go about the same. but on the
      4th test when trying to recharge the 4 switching batteries
      something strange happend.&nbsp; the 4 switching batteries had 50
      amps at 15 volts pumping into them but no bubbles, the battery
      temp was below room temp, and nothing was going on other than my
      powersupply getting a good workout.&nbsp; it stayed like this for
      over 3 days then all at once it started to bubble and the recharge
      cycle began and the battery came back to life. This happened to
      all 4 batteries. we ran the test again pretty much same results
      and again the batteries would not recharge for 3 days. we stopped
      after this as it was taking way to long and we had lost all the
      net gain we had achieved in the first tests.<br>
      <br>
      Ron told me that when he was running his electric car his
      neighbors car had a bad battery and he removed one from his
      electric car and gave it to them. the alternator on the neighbors
      car went up in smoke after an hour of driving.&nbsp; it was more
      than likely running at full field trying to charge the battery.<br>
      <br>
      We did not use a motor and i believe that is the secret to getting
      it to self charge. Ron told me he ran his car for months without
      charging the batteries.<br>
      <br>
      He also told me a strange story that after running the car for a
      few hours when setting at a stop light the other cars around him
      all stopped running.&nbsp; he called it some sort of energy field
      he thought it was creating. he also told me that his neighbor
      could not get out of her mobile home one day when he had the motor
      running and the car in idle for a few hours in is driveway, she
      yelled for help and when he went to help her it was like walking
      through air as thick as sand and it took almost all his energy to
      get to her.<br>
      <br>
      After that he stopped the project to think about what was
      happening.<br>
      <br>
      It will be interesting if anyone else will have the same battery
      non charging event happen to them.<br>
      <br>
      When the estate was purchased he had developed 3 perm-mag motors
      all in different sizes. The last one was a working model on a
      bench motor weighs about 100lbs. Each perm-mag motor has a switch
      with it. It looked like Ron was building a 4th motor identical to
      the 3rd motor but much bigger. The design on the 4th was exactly
      the same as the 3rd motor. the 3rd motor, biggest motor mounted to
      a work bench was actually hooked up to 2 different banks of
      battery's and his switch.<br>
      <br>
      He had so much paperwork and diagrams starting back to his days in
      Oregon it's hard to organize it all. It appears he had worked with
      John Bedini in the late 70's and early 80's. I can't find any
      collaboration with anyone with the motors and switches he
      developed before his death, looks like he was working alone on
      these.<br>
      <br>
      All of his audio tapes have been snapped I guess for security
      reasons. Need to take them to a professional have them&nbsp; and
      have rewound to listen. The way his shop was configured he was a
      man in hiding for sure, very strange.<br>

      Overunity up to 500 hp Perm Mag Motor. It is with all due
      deference to Joseph Newman’s 700% dynamotor tested motor, about
      500x more cost effective per net watt out.<br>
      <br>
      A very special thank you to Joseph Newman who turned down any
      amount because "they" would not agree to manufacture it for the
      world.<br>
      <br>
      My challenge to you is what are you going to do now with this
      information?<br>
      <br>
      Joseph Newman’s 1 hp motor was about 400 pounds in weight for less
      than 1 hp net out. Ron’s motor is about 400 pounds weight for both
      the motor and controller yielding up to 500 hp. The cost is about
      the same at about $30,000 plus or minus depending on various
      factors.<br>
      <br>
      In summary, if you feel it is too much, it likely is. I do not
      want to receive money from those that cannot afford it.<br>
      <br>
      Returns are not accepted due to not only to lost fees each way but
      also due to agents that can use those problems as an additional

      </b><b>MORE DETAILS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ron Brandt was a child prodigy, working on electrical motors in
      grade 3, had an overunity motor by grade 8 and totally rebuilt a
      car from ground up at age 11. He worked with Nikola Tesla during
      WWII as a young man on the Philadelphia Experiment. Later when the
      5th speaker of the ministry organization that Michael Faraday had
      set up was killed prematurely in WWII, he was trained in a rush to
      be the 6th speaker.&nbsp; Timothy Thrapp IQ 172 of www.witts.ws
      became the 7th speaker. Ron had a vehicle running overunity in the
      60’s and there after using various technologies such as the Tesla
      Brandt switch using switching on 4 -12 volt batteries that Tesla
      and he worked on their spare time in the Philadelphia experiment.
      Over the years he made connections to various other intelligent
      skilled people working on various versions of overunity technology
      such as Ecklin, Thrapp, Newman, Bedini, Grey.<br>
      <br>
      Joseph Newman built a number of oveunity motors using the basic
      principle of pulsing high voltages into long turns of wire with a
      magnet turning inside the windings. Then collecting the back emf
      energy into capacitors and recycling that energy. He was blocked
      from obtaining a US patent despite the patent office's own expert
      testifying for him. His 7th edition book came out with the 700%
      efficient dynamometer test done at Lawrence Technological
      University 10-6-94 witnessed by 4 individuals and the basic
      details of his 4 foot long motor with the center rotating magnets
      with the large number of turns of fine wire collecting the back
      emf onto capacitors and recycling the energy. Then the printing
      press was burnt down. His posted book online doesn't have that
      dyno test or the basic details thus as posted here. I really
      respect Joseph for turning down (Name Your Amount) for not selling
      out when they wouldn't agree to manufacture his motor for the
      benefit for the world and instead open sourced the information. He
      used commutator switching.<br>
      <br>
      Ron Brandt then went the next step further using electronic
      switching and because the magnets flew off the rotor at higher
      speeds and when the motor got hot, designed the motor with the
      magnets rotating on the inside of a tube with the windings being
      on the inside. There was several hundred thousand dollars spent.
      Also Timothy Thrapp EE IQ 172 hard working, diligent and very
      observant along with 3 other EE/electronics specialists built 4
      generations of controllers to obtain up to COP (Coefficient of
      Performance) 932.&nbsp;&nbsp; The one controller whiz had his son
      kidnapped and tortured for a year trying to stop them before
      miracles sly, the father got his son back. Back in 1998 a Chinese
      company was given the information on his basic motor which started
      the manufacturing of his motor design around the world but not
      including the overunity controller as far as I am aware.<br>
      <br>
      Ron was kind and generous in order to receive a very reasonable
      amount June 17, 2010 allowing the machine drawings for the 10 hp
      (at 13,000 rpm yields 60 hp on a prony brake due to hp going up 4x
      for the rpm doubling approximately and 120 hp if the mirror is
      joined) &amp; 40 hp (yielded 500 p on a prony braked at 8,000 rpm
      with the mirror joined) motors plus the latest 4rth generation of
      controller be photostated in order to be open sourced.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;The Tesla Car Company is worth $30B needing the batteries to
      be recharged with one of their motors 150 hp less. Conservatively
      at 10x this technology is worth $300B or more. This information is
      going around the world including various Chinese Controller &amp;
      BLDC manufacturers. Imagine what being on the ground floor will be
      for them?<br>
      <br>
      Already, one company on ebay.com is selling 17 inch fans using
      only 6.5 watts that are less than 1/5 of the energy of
      conventionally produced fans I believe for $10 including postage
      to Canada. They are not using any controller but very well
      designed windings for the correct impedance and emf field
      intersections.<br>
      <br>
      Toy drone BLDC motors can be also be bought on ebay.com for visual
      personal purposes by taking the snap out the end to show others
      for $10 postage included.<br>

      They make him seem like a kook for not letting them look inside.
      He wasn’t granted a patent despite spending over $2M and the
      patent’s office own expert testifying on his behalf along with 6
      or 7 congressman. It came out in South Africa and Mexico. Others
      argue he was claiming a physics principle and couldn’t do
      that&nbsp; I highly respect him for turning down (Name your
      amount) when they wouldn’t agree to manufacture it. So he wasn’t
      protected from showing the switching secrets on a device worth
      billions. it is very unfortunate for humanity and the earth's
      ecology that the PTB have continued their suppression going as far
      back as when Nikola Tesla had his lab burnt down before 1900 for
      turning down a buy out offer from JP Morgan (front man for who
      when over 90% of his estate went to who?)<br>

          Geoffrey Miller of EnergyBat Labs -- Historic and Recent&nbsp;
          &nbsp;</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Energybat Labs Geoffrey Miller is easily the in the forefront of
      understanding, replicating, improving on, and being in a position
      to bring forward Joseph Newman's motor technology. For those not
      familiar with the Newman Motor claims, to put it simplistically,
      it is a large motor that is powered by pulsing from a few 9-volt
      batteries, which puts out tremendous power, including enough to
      loop back to keep the 9-volt batteries topped off. Geoff was the
      first to replicate the technology back in the 1980s, for which
      accomplishment he was given a license to the technology. So far,
      Geoff has built six versions, all of which work, three of which
      have Geoff's improvement on them. I alluded to that key component
      in yesterday's story about Geoff's overunity replication of the
      Keppe motor, and I put forth the challenge to our audience to see
      if they could figure out what that key is. No one, yet, has
      guessed what it is. No one yet has put forth any guess. In
      retrospect, when someone guesses it and we do an article about it,
      you're going to be amused at how obvious it is; and you're going
      to be grateful at how open Geoff is in sharing it, in an open
      license manner.<br>

      <b>World Improvement Through The Spirit Ministries</b> [ <a
        href="http://www.witts.ws"><b>http://www.witts.ws</b></a> ] is
      showing a delay line generator motor starting with a pack of 9
      volt batteries in series. It shows the voltage rising from 713
      volts to 728 volts after starting with approximately .05 amps
      average current or 35 watts being generated &amp; utilized. The
      meter used for the current measurements is one designed
      specifically for measuring pulsed current accurately. A
      conventional generator motor would be dropping the voltage in the
      battery pack after starting. The video then shows a capacitor
      being added and the batteries are disconnected totally so that the
      delay line generator motor is self-generating, self-turning, as
      well as supplying electricity to the fluorescent tubes. The device
      is over 23 years old and as such provided the basis for higher
      output more sophisticated devices such as the - Self-Running 900
      Watt Fuel less Electrical Generator. There is no harmful radiation
      and it is converting zero point energy with no external power
      source needed after starting! See DIAZ youtube video’s showing
      their building BLDC motor almost identical to Ron's 10/60 hp motor

      Ron originally came up the design of the magnets on the inside of
      a rotating tube after magnets would fly off of a central rotor at
      higher speeds due to centrifugal forces plus when they over heated
      weakening the glue. Ron Brandt met with some Chinese in 1998 and
      gave them the details on the motor. That I believe was the start
      of those BLDC motors spreading out to the world today. I don’t
      think they got the controller details plus the controller has been
      upgraded with several hundred thousand dollars over 4 generations
      since 1998&nbsp; to 2007. Now it has been upgraded to digitalized
      gerber files...<br>
      <br>
      1. In overunity electrical devices as I understand it primarily
      from www.witts.ws, the electrical fields need to be balanced
      polar, dipolar &amp; parapolar. If the polar is too much, the
      energies build up and components burn out over time depending on
      the power and imprinting. If the dipolar builds up, the energies
      drop and the unit becomes underunity. I saw that as my auric field
      is dipolar so when I approached a Joseph Newman running overunity
      motor, it started slowing down when I was about 12 feet away from
      it. That explains why John Bedini, Richard Willis and others can
      have units working overunity in their presence but to underunity
      when they leave the room or are sold. And why so many try
      replicating John's circuits and fail.&nbsp; It is well worth
      donating for consulting to witts.ws for further information.<br>
      <br>
      2. The longer the wire length, the higher the efficiency. Joseph
      Newman used 100 to 1,000x plus the normal lengths of wire in his
      motors.<br>
      <br>
      3. The higher the rpm, the higher the efficiency between linear
      and exponential. At 300 rpm highly polar charged, it can be over
      COP &gt; 1, if normal nuetral, it might be 3,000 to 4,000 rpm or
      higher depending on wire length&nbsp; &amp; voltage before it over
      COP &gt; 1. The 10hp Ron Brandt BLDC ran at 20,000 rpm was about
      COP 650 yielding 60 hp on a prony brake due to the hp going up
      approximately 4x for a doubling of the rpm over original design
      specs. The longer wire length in the 40 hp motor mirrored yielded
      500 hp on a prony brake at less rpm like 10,000 rpm.<br>
      <br>
      4. The higher the voltage, the higher the efficiency increased
      between linear and exponential. On Joseph Newman's 700% dyno test,
      it shows at 1076 volts 118% efficiency. At 1729 volts, it was 700%
      efficient. The currrent was in micro amps so that 192 9 volt
      batteries in series would provide the current &amp; voltage. In
      other motors, Joseph used 5 volt watch batteries in series.<br>
      <br>
      Joseph had the hypothesis that electricity and magnetism had
      gyroscopic properties. That helps to explain the right hand rule
      used in the direction of forces and reactions between electrical
      and magnetic fields. I have the hypothesis that electricity has
      more the properties of a wave the higher the voltage more like
      light and less of particles. That helps draw in energy from the
      ether, zero point or the vaccume of space or whatever name is
      agreeable in aiding the explaining and understanding.<br>
      <br>
      Electrical components need to be higher quality with the diodes
      being almost instantaneous under 10 nanoseconds reaction times.<br>
      <br>
      Ron Brandt was able to get overunity on the Tesla Brandt Battery
      Switch Technology that they worked on in their spare time during
      the Philidelphia Expirement by using military surplus electronics
      with higher .9s. Others have added their names like Bedini later
      but as far as I know haven't got as good results as Ron so far.<br>
      <br>
      When Ron's estate was sold, original motors, controllers and
      documentation ended up in other parties possession so I don't have
      access to the exact numbers, reports, etc.<br>

      When you read into the environmental destruction like oxygen
      levels dropping, fish dying in the oceans along with whales,
      dolphins down to the starfish down to the phytoplankton which
      create over 75% of the oxygen, do you want to just sit on face
      book or watching news having your brains microwaved and altered in
      mush like I used to do when I was younger?<br>
      <br>
      Do you want a better world for yourself &amp; your children and
      grandchildren?<br>
      <br>
      Do you want to combine making a better world with one of the best
      money making opportunities with an easier sell of all that I have
      found or studied into for over 40 years?<br>

      Also send this link to BDLC controller companies, BLDC companies,
      wind &amp; solar farms, larger users of electricity, starting with
      the smaller companies as they are generally more flexible and less
      likely to have minority control by the Rockefellers or similar
      family dynasties with majority control.<br>

      <div align="center"><b>THE TESLA SWITCH</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      We used as a starting point for our experiments, the switching
      device John Bedini had built for the Tesls Symposium. Our goal was
      to upgrade this switching device for ordinary car or motorcycle
      batteries.<br>
      <br>
      Because we had already learned that the efficiency will go up the
      more we load the circuit, we decided to load this Tesla circuit
      also.<br>
      <br>
      We found that when we connected a second lamp, the first lamp
      instantaneously became brighter.<br>
      <br>
      Each time we disconnected and connected one of the light bulbs or
      other loads in the circuit, we saw a spark about a half inch long.
      The light of this spark was noticeably different from the light of
      sparks observed when experimenting with high voltages. We
      discovered that in addition to X-rays we were also generating
      scalar waves. These were detecting using a scalar wave detector
      built by John Bedini, which was based on a plan furnished by Tom
      Bearden.<br>
      <br>
      John Bedini was invited to speak at the Tesla Centennial Symposium
      in Colorado Springs, CO, on August, 11, 1984, The symposium
      honored the 100th anniversary of the arrival of Nikola Tesla in
      the USA, and was sponsored by the Tesla Committee, by the
      Institute for Electronic and Electrical Engineers (IEEE), Pikes
      Peak Section, and by the Ford Aerospace&amp; Communications
      Corporation,Colorado Springs Operation.<br>
      <br>
      At the symposium, Bedini demonstrated an inexpensive, cigar-box
      sized Tesla-type converter witch he had recently built. Throughout
      the demonstration, which lasted a full 24 hours during the
      symposium, a constant load was being drawn out of the system to do
      work, Nevertheless, the converter kept the nickel-cadmium
      batteries fully charged!<br>
      <br>
      The concept, witch had been originated by Nikola Tesla, was given
      to John Bedini by Ronald Brandt, who was a personal friend of
      Nikola Tesla. Brandt is reputed to have a similar converter which
      he has used for years without loosing the battery charge. Bedini
      presented the schematic diagram showing how to build the
      solid-state device, and then released copies of the schematic
      diagram.<br>
      <br>
      This Diagram Was used by John Bedini to test the Tesla Switch<br>
      <br>
      WARNING: BATTERY COULD EXPLODE IF YOU HAVE FAULTY CONNECTIONS.
      BUILD AT YOUR OWN RISK.<br>
      <br>
      Good Luck<br>

      </div>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Ron Brandt is the inventor of the perm-mag motor. He is now of
      retirement age.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      When Brandt was a young man, he invented a 90-mpg carburetor. He
      was paid a visit by a man from Standard Oil, another man, and two
      men wearing US Marshal uniforms. They told him that if he ever
      made another carburetor, they would kill him, his wife, and two
      young children. He was quickly persuaded that his life wasn't
      worth a "damn" carburetor. He happened to think to memorize the
      badge numbers of the two US Marshals and so had an attorney in
      Washington, DC check with the US Marshal's office. They had no
      record of the two badge numbers... <br>
