      </center>
      <p>The Wang Shum Ho Prototype Electricity Generator was reportedly
        demonstrated to five Chinese Officials on Jan 15, 2007. </p>
      <p>Lawrence Tseung, a colleague of the inventor, has said the plan
        is to initially build four 5kW working units. One of these will
        be located in Beijing, another in Hong Kong and the third one at
        the United Nations in New York The fourth unit is to serve as a
        portable demonstration device. All will be made available to
        universities for academic validation. </p>
      <p>Then, 200 more will be produced. They intend to present one of
        these to each member country of the United Nations, as a gift
        from China. Mass production may begin in 2008. </p>
      <p>Tseung has written: "Devices of this nature are converting the
        electromagnetic wave energy that surrounds us all the time. Some
        call this Zero Point Energy. That energy is due to the
        rotational motion of the electrons. Unless the electrons stop
        spinning and fall into the nucleus, that electromagnetic energy
        exists.” </p>
      <p>Tseung states: “The World Energy Crisis is effectively over.” </p>

      <p>"We are actually immersed in electromagnetic waves. When
        electrons rotating around the nucleus change orbits, they give
        rise to electromagnetic waves. Light is only one form of
        electromagnetic waves. We emit and receive electromagnetic waves
        all the time. Unless the electrons stop rotating and fall into
        the nuclei, there will be electromagnetic waves. Thus we are
        never in a CLOSED system. We are always in an OPEN system with
        energy interchanges. For example, we were in calm waters and
        good sunshine. If we did not know how to use solar panels, we
        might conclude that we were in a CLOSED system. We should use
        our muscle power to row the boat. The Lee-Tseung Patent
        information (PCT/IB2005/000138) states that Energy can be
        extracted (Lead Out, Lead Out, and Lead Out with Pulse Force)
        from Energy Fields via oscillation, vibration, rotation or flux

        Comment Time Sep 16th 2006 </p>
      <p>If you had followed the various threads or read the information
        from the main website (http://www.energyfromair.com), you might
        have learned that we already signed a contract with a Chinese
        Government Concern. The contract essentially says that if our
        prototypes passed the certification process at Tsing Hua
        University, we could lay our hands on RMB$300 million
        (US$33m)development funds.
        (http://www.energyfromair.com/beijing/lettertseung.doc ) </p>
      <p>We intend to benefit the entire world. The main Patent Holding
        Company in China will be 51% owned by the Chinese People and
        Government. There will be a subsidary patent holding company in
        every country which will be 51% owned by its People. The Cosmic
        Energy Products sold in country A will pay royalty to the patent
        holding company in country A. Thus every country and citizen
        will benefit. </p>
      <p>There will be product companies that will be licensed to
        produce specific products. These products have not been
        announced yet as the types of products are in the thousands. It
        is possible for you and your group to participate in the
        licensing of producing these products. However, we are in no
        hurry to enter into a deal as almost all our prototypes are not
        ready to be sold as a product. In addition, if we sell a product
        as an electricity generator, we have to pass a 6 month no
        failure test in China. </p>
      <p>However, we are interested in World Publicity right now.
        Discussion of a license and an offer will stimulate additional
        interest. Whether the deal actually materialize is not that
        important to me at present. Lee Cheung Kin, myself and the key
        inventors (60 in China) are almost guaranteed to be
        multi-millionaires already. </p>
      <p>A wise Chinese Monk in Taiwan told me - just think about
        contributing to the World. Ignore your personal fame, wealth,
        ego, etc. The venture will succeed. Angels will come down to
        help you. </p>

      <p>(1) The Theory is now completed. The emphasis is on - all
        objects are immersed in Electromagnetic Waves. They are
        interchanging EM with surroundings constantly. They are not in
        closed energy systems. The analogy is - boat in calm water and
        good sunshine. This theory will be circulated to all
        Universities, Colleges and other Academic Institutions. Some top
        physicists will take it up and publish it in top scientific
        journals. Textbooks will be re-written. </p>
      <p>(2) My focus will be on the Patent Information. The promoting
        of the Lead Out concept will continue. Energy can be extracted
        (Lead Out, Lead Out and Lead Out with Pulse) from Energy Fields
        via Oscillation, Vibration, Rotation or Flux Changes. Energy
        Fields include gravity, magnetic, electric, electromagnetic
        fields. Energy from Still Air is an indirect way of using
        Gravitational Energy. The Patent Offices around the World will
        have no choice but change their policy on Perpetual Motion
        Machines and the use of the Law of Conservation of Energy as the
        Roadblock to inventions. </p>
      <p>(3) The Experimental prototypes that can be implemented readily
        include the Energy From Air systems, the simple Gravity Wheel
        (Bessler Wheel), the Wang Shum Ho Wheel, the Steorn Toy and the
        Pulse Machine. The details will be fully published. They are the
        spearhead of the Cosmic Energy Development but are very
        primitive from the theoretical point of view. They will have
        very short commercial success even if introduced into the Market
        Place. Steorn has generously announced their licensing plans. We
        shall follow that generosity to benefit the entire Human Race. </p>
      <p>(4) The Wang Shum Ho 5KW Electricity Generator has been
        assembled and demonstrated in front of 5 Chinese Officials. The
        chance of having 4 prototypes ready for academic tests; 200 as
        gifts to every nation and then producing products (including a
        DIY version) is good. The product is likely to be introduced via
        the United Nations. Even the most undeveloped Country will have
        working products to learn from and to adopt the technology. We
        shall ensure that multiple groups can produce the device. We
        would like to introduce the concept of Mutual Credits to ensure
        an orderly creation and distribution of this technology and the
        generated new wealth. </p>
      <p>(5) The further technical developments include the Flying
        Saucer, the non-rotating 4th generation machines and the 5th
        generation IC machines. This is likely to include an
        International Alternative Energy Conference chaired by Steorn
        after their successful validation. They already have a group of
        top scientists from different parts of the World validating
        their device. Hopefully, the Conference will be an International
        Cooperation Event. We are confident that the 6th, 7th generation
        machines will come out in the foreseeable future. The World
        Energy Crisis is effectively over. </p>
      <p>(6) There will be development of Model Farms, Model Villages,
        Model Cites, etc. Multiple Models will be built. This will
        greatly speed up the development of less wealthy Countries.
        Cities in the sky or cities under the sea will no longer be
        fiction. People will have Flying Saucers as personal transport
        complete with office, communication, health, entertainment
        devices, etc. Country borders will be blurred. Central authority
        would be replaced by Central guidance. </p>
      <p>(7) Like it or not, there will be military development of this
        technology. With this technology, the troops would never run out
        of fuel, food, ammunition, etc. They can fly anywhere including
        outer space. All existing planes, missiles, submarines, tanks
        will be obsolete. We hope to make all these developments open so
        that no single Nation can dominate. If there is military balance
        and fear of retaliation resulting in destruction of Planet
        Earth, there might be less temptation to start wars. This
        technology will allow a small nation to have vast destructive
        powers. The possibility of the Doomsday Bomb with matter and
        anti-matter would be obvious to any physicist. </p>
      <p>(8) We shall openly discuss and promote the new order.
        Nationalism will slowly be replaced by Internationalism. The
        less developed Countries will catch up quickly as copying is
        always faster than inventing. There will be enormous new wealth
        generated especially if concepts such as Mutual Credits and
        Meaningful Economic Activities are adopted. Such new wealth will
        be available to and will benefit all. There is no need to rob
        other Nation’s land, oil or resources. Competition will be
        friendly and non-destructive. </p>
      <p>The end for now. </p>
      <p>Lawrence Tseung </p>
      <hr width="62%">
      <p>As we discussed previously, the overall situation is as
        follows: </p>
      <p>(1) The Chinese Government will NOT allow the development of
        military products by a Commercial Company in China. They will do
        it themselves with no information revealed to the General
        Public. (I believe almost all Countries have similar policy.) </p>
      <p>(2) However, they are aware of the theory, the patents and the
        prototypes from us. They also bought some EBM units from
        Hungary. This means some decision makers are willing to risk
        some money and time to seriously investigate these Over Unity
        Devices. We believe we may be able to develop non-military
        products with their blessing. </p>
      <p>(3) As in all Countries, not all Officials are of one mind.
        Some Officials in China are still doubtful. One who sat on and
        drove the Dr. Liang car said to me, "I cannot get myself to
        believe this Over Unity Device. Energy must come from somewhere.
        It cannot be created nor destroyed." I tried to explain our
        theory from the simple pendulum with the pulse force. He said,
        "I know how a pendulum works. All the energy comes from your
        push. That is a fact. I want no more of this nonsense." </p>
      <p>(4) While the Chinese Officials are in the debate, we charge
        ahead with the limited resource we have. This forum helped me to
        consolidate my ideas and presentations. If I had thought of the
        boat in calm waters and good sunshine when I was talking to that
        Official, the outcome might have been different. </p>
      <p>(5) I found that the most convincing presentation is to start
        with the boat in calm waters and good sunshine. Thus my updated
        presentation has it. See

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- The invention extracts energy from gravity
        based on the corrected theory of the pendulum. When the pendulum
        is pushed, it will ‘lead out’ gravitational energy at the same
        time. If a source of pulse force (F) is applied to the pendulum
        at resonance, it will keep ‘lead out gravitational energy. This
        gravitational energy can be extracted by techniques such as
        allowing the metallic wired pendulum to cut across the lines of
        magnetic force to generate electricity. The swinging motion of
        the pendulum will be slowed down because the mechanical energy
        is converted to electrical energy. However, such slowing down is
        speed up via pulse force (F). The swinging motion can be changed
        into a constant rotational motion for more efficient operation.

      <p><b>1. Technical Field</b> </p>
      <p>This invention is related to the extraction of energy from
        gravity. Such energy is virtually limitless and is available
        everywhere including on the moon. </p>
      <p><b>2. Background Art</b> </p>
      <p>Mankind has played with the swing for centuries. They do not
        realize that when they push the swing, they get Energy from
        Gravity at the same time. Many people, especially little boys,
        have deliberately allowed the swing (or the punch bag) to knock
        them after pushing the swing a couple of times. They all
        suspected that the force knocking them was much more than the
        energy they supplied in the couple of pushes. </p>
      <p>However, the existing textbooks do not consider the Energy from
        Gravity term and attribute the force to resonance only. They
        assume that all the energy must come from the couple of pushes.
        This misunderstanding has prevented scientists and engineers to
        design methods or devices that Extract Energy from Gravity for
        centuries. However, they did not have the theoretical basis to
        justify their inventions. Many of these inventions were
        classified as impossible perpetual motion machines and were
        rejected by scientists and many Patent Offices worldwide. </p>
      <p><b>3. Disclosure of Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The theoretical breakthrough needed is the understanding and
        the deriving of the underlying formulae related to the swing or
        the pendulum systems. </p>
      <p>The steps involved in extracting Energy from Gravity are: </p>
      <p>1. Push the pendulum with a Pulse Force at resonance. </p>
      <p>2. The swinging of the pendulum will ‘lead out’ the
        Gravitational Force. </p>
      <p>3. Some of the commercially available swinging toys already use
        an integrated circuit to provide the Pulse Force. The swinging
        toys can use batteries or photoelectric cells. </p>
      <p>4. If the string of the swinging toy or pendulum is replaced by
        a copper wire and placed between two magnets, the copper wire
        will cut the magnetic lines of force and generate electricity.
        The swinging motion will be slowed down --- kinetic energy
        turning into electrical energy. </p>
      <p>5. If the swinging motion is speeded up again via the pulse
        force, we can repeat step 4 and get a primitive Electricity
        Generator that extracts energy from Gravity. </p>
      <p><b>Mathematics behind Extracting Energy from Gravity</b> </p>
      <p>Let us consider the situation of a ball suspended by a string
        (pendulum) in Figure 1. In Figure 1, a small ‘pulse force’ F is
        applied to the ball (mass – M) with a displacement d. </p>
      <p>The physical laws demand that there should be an acceleration
        equal to A where F = MA. The energy imparted will be equal to
        Force multiplied by Displacement (Fd). The final velocity
        acquired should be v (where v is determined by the energy
        equation Fd = 1/2 Mv^2 ). If there were no string, no friction,
        no gravity, no air resistance, etc., the ball should acquire the
        velocity v and continue along a straight line forever. </p>
      <p>With the presence of the string and Gravity, the ball acquires
        the position X in Figure 1. </p>
      <p>In Figure 2, we view the situation using the concept of
        circular motion. The ball is moved up and to the left because of
        the centripetal force C. We can treat the centripetal force C as
        made up of two components: </p>
      <p>1. Component C1 is the vertical direction. It acts against
        gravity and lifts the ball upwards. Work is done and energy is
        spent. </p>
      <p>2. Component C2 is in the horizontal direction opposite to the
        motion of the ball. It acts on the ball and slows it down until
        the velocity is zero. Work is done and energy is spent. </p>
      <p>C1 can be thought of as contributing to the work done by the
        string to lift the ball against gravity. In other words, this
        energy is the non-obvious Energy from Gravity. Once we start or
        push the pendulum, work will be done against gravity by the
        string. This energy must be conserved. </p>
      <p>Here are effectively two energy components acting on the
        system. One is the pulse energy supplied to start or maintain
        motion. The other is the energy supplied by the string to lift
        the ball against gravity! This means we ‘lead’ the gravitational
        energy into the system when we push or swing the pendulum! </p>
      <p>The correct energy relationship of the pendulum (assume no
        energy loss) should be: </p>
      <p>Energy In = Energy Out <br>
        Energy In = Energy from Pulse + Energy from Gravity <br>
        Energy Out = Potential Energy (MGH) + Kinetic Energy (1/2 Mv^2 )
      </p>
      <p>Previously, scientists did not take into account the Energy
        from gravity term and thought that all the energy must come from
        Energy from Pulse! Thus they did not tell the engineers to
        design systems to extract Energy from Gravity directly. The
        above simple theoretical correction will lead to many devices
        that extract Energy from Gravity directly. We shall disclose 3
        sample embodiments in this application. Dozens ore more along
        the same line are possible. </p>
      <p><b>Embodiment 1: Use of the Simple Pendulum</b> </p>
      <p>Use a copper wire to suspend the pendulum. Put the pendulum in
        between two magnets and let the swinging motion cut the magnetic
        field. Use the generated electricity to do work and to supply
        the periodic horizontal pulse energy. This is the simplest and
        the most obvious solution. However, the electrical current
        generated will vary from zero to a certain maximum and will
        change direction. Sophisticated integrated circuit control is
        needed to provide a smooth, practical electricity generator. If
        the purpose is just to demonstrate the principle such as
        lighting a light bulb, it may be good enough. </p>
      <p><b>Embodiment 2: Use a Constant Speed Rotating Wheel</b> </p>
      <p>Conceptually, we can spring the pendulum in a complete circle
        without violating the theory. In pracice, we replace the
        pendulum with metallic rods arranged in the form of a wheel. The
        generating of electric current will slow down the motion of the
        rotating wheel but the pulse circuits will ‘lead out’ additional
        gravitation l energy to accelerate the motion. If properly
        controlled, the rotational speed can be kept constant and the
        generation of Electric Current will be steady and in one
        direction only. This effectively is a Direct Current Electricity
        Generator. The secret of success lies in the positioning and
        control of the various magnets or pulse circuits. The energy
        extracted from gravity per revolution can be as much as 2MGR
        where R is the length of the pendulum string (or radius of the
        wheel in this embodiment). This value may be less if some of the
        pulse circuits supply the vertical force/energy. However, so
        long as gravitational energy enters into the system, we get free
        Energy from Gravity. </p>
      <p><b>Embodiment 3: Use of Water in a Double Wheel</b> </p>
      <p>We can also use water in a vertical spinning double wheel to
        extract Energy from Gravity. If there were no gravity, the water
        should be uniformly distributed at the outer side of the wheel.
        However, because of gravity, the distribution of water will not
        be uniform. There will be a wider path at the up moving side and
        a narrower path at the down moving side (This is because water
        travels slower on the up moving side because of gravity). We can
        use a central shaft with fins to extract energy from the up
        moving water or we can use an off center shaft with fins to
        extract energy from the down moving water. </p>
      <p><b>4. Brief Description of Drawings</b> </p>
      <p>Figure 1 shows the operation of the simple pendulum. A short
        duration Pulse Force F is applied to push the ball (Mass = M)
        for a short distance d. If there were no string, no air
        resistance and no gravity, the ball should accelerate with
        acceleration A (F = MA) until a velocity v (Fd = 1/2 Mc^2) is
        reached. The ball should then move along a straight line with
        velocity v forever according to Newton’s Laws of Motion.
        However, with the presence of the string and gravity, the ball
        moves to position X. </p>
      <p>Figure 2 shows the resolution of the Centripetal Force C into
        two components C1 and C2. C1 lifts the ball up against gravity
        and does work. The resulting energy goes into the pendulum
        system. This is the Energy from Gravity. C2 is in the opposite
        direction of the pulse force F and does work in slowing the ball
        from velocity v to zero. C1 can be much greater than C2 as
        judged by the parallelogram of forces. This means that if we
        want to get more Energy from Gravity, we should apply small but
        more often the Pulse Force F. </p>
      <p><b>5. Best Modes of Carrying Out the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>The best mode of carrying out the invention is embodiment 2
        (use of a constant speed rotating wheel) as described in Section
        3. If the invention were used to generate electricity only, we
        can draw electrical energy out directly by placing the rotating
        wheel in a magnetic field. The rotating mechanical energy will
        be converted into electrical energy directly. The rotating speed
        will decrease but the pulse circuits will ‘lead out’ more
        gravitational energy to replenish the speed. If more electricity
        is required, we can increase the rotating speed or increase the
        number of pulses per revolution. </p>
      <p><b>6. Prior Art or Patents</b> </p>
      <p>We are aware that many scientists are working in the energy
        field. Some of them are also using Energy from gravity. One
        known patent from China is 02113293.3 granted on August 13,
        2003. This patent uses the vibration energy when a vehicle
        travels over an uneven ground to generate electricity. It can
        supplement or recover some of the lost energy from an electric
        car but cannot be the prime source of its energy. Our theory can
        be applied to swinging resonance systems as well as to vibrating
        resonance systems. Our invention is superior because we can be
        the prime source of energy of the electric car. </p>
      <p>Another known patent from Chine is 01123526.8 granted on March
        5, 2003. This patent uses a rotating cylinder and extracts the
        gravitational energy from the central shaft to drive a car. It
        describes one very good mode of operation (Thus we leave out
        this mode of operation --- the use of the central shaft in our
        claims). However, the inventor did not fully understand the
        theory. In his marketing literature, he explained his
        understanding of the phenomenon using a mixture of Chinese
        philosophy, Western science, and mysterious cosmic forces. He
        did not realize that the theory was a simple ‘leading out’ of
        the gravitational force from the swinging motion of a pendulum.
      </p>
      <p>In our explanation of the corrected theory of the pendulum, we
        have effectively removed the mysterious source of energy in the
        prior art. The same theory can be used to explain the extraction
        of energy from magnetic fields, etc.<br>

        1. Open Letter to the Chinese Government*</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Dear Sirs,<br>
      <br>
      I have done a great deal of research into the field of Cosmic
      Energies and I am convinced that their use will solve the Energy
      Crisis. Cosmic Energies include air, water, gravitational,
      magnetic, electric fields and others. Such energy sources are
      non-polluting, abundant and inexpensive. <br>
      <br>
      I, together with Mr. Lee Cheung Kin and others, have applied for
      Patents in this field. For example, the PCT patent application
      (PCT/IB05/00138) titled "Extracting Energy from Gravity" and the
      equivalent China Patent Application passed the preliminary
      examinations. Some experiments that can be performed by the
      average secondary school student are ready. These experiments
      conclusively demonstrate that we can extract energy from the
      pendulum systems.&nbsp; Some Chinese Inventors developed working
      cosmic energy machine models before our theory was out.&nbsp;
      Unfortunately, without the solid, theoretical explanations, many
      working inventions were classified as impossible perpetual motion
      machines. These should be rescued. With the right resources and
      proper development, China can solve the World Energy Crisis, solve
      the poverty problem of its Farmers, generate phenomenal Modern
      Wealth and lead the World into the Wisdom Society.<br>
      <br>
      The difficulties we are facing include objections from established
      interests, lack of Government support, lack of funds and
      resources. There are disputes amongst the researchers on when
      would be the proper time to inform the Government and the General
      Public.&nbsp; As requested, I am presenting my personal opinion
      here.<br>
      <br>
      Lawrence Tseung in Hong Kong<br>
      <br>
      March 18, 2006<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. The Development History of the
        Cosmic Energy Inventions</span><br>
      <br>
      My development started from an experiment on Fluid Mechanics in
      May 2004 at the Tai Po office of Mr. Peter Chan.&nbsp; Mr. Henry
      Ku and I were performing an experiment to compare the
      characteristics of water under push and pull conditions. Some air
      accidentally leaked into the apparatus.&nbsp; Water and air
      bubbles spurted out from the testing tubes for over 20
      minutes.&nbsp; It was obvious to us that such an effect could not
      be attributed to the difference in density columns alone.&nbsp; We
      then started the research on the characteristics of air and water
      column mixtures.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Peter Chan introduced us to his friend Mr. Kwan who wrote a
      book on Perpetual Motion Machines. In the book, Mr. Kwan described
      a pump as a proof.&nbsp; I read the book cover to cover 7 times
      and concluded that the most valuable statement in the whole book
      was: ¡§The resulting water contained much oxygen and is suitable
      for fish farming. The pump was not a Perpetual Motion Machine but
      a device that used the Energy from Still Air similar to the Ku
      experiment mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      I worked out the formula to explain the process.&nbsp; Air is not
      a fuel but an energy carrier. The energy carried by air into a
      system can be different from the energy carried out by air from
      the system. The formula is <br>
      <br>
      Energy carried In by air = Pressure In x Volume In<br>
      <br>
      Energy carried Out by air = Pressure Out x Volume Out<br>
      <br>
      The difference can be used to generate electricity. <br>
      <br>
      I then used two simple beach pumps and some one-way valves to
      demonstrate the theory.&nbsp; My friends, the Cheungs, set up the
      demonstration system at Tai Po.&nbsp; Mr. Lee Cheung Kin, a
      retired engineer with missile training from China saw the
      demonstration and agreed with the theory. Mr. Lee also mentioned a
      car from Dr. Liang that required no fuel and obtained a video
      (included on the CD) and the marketing literature.&nbsp; In the
      marketing literature, Dr. Liang used a mixture of Chinese
      philosophy of Yin-Yang and Western Ideas to explain why the car
      required no fuel.<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Lee and I laughed at the explanation and decided to seek new
      explanations. The next morning, Mr. Lee woke me up at 7:30am from
      the Hotel and asked me to rush over. Mr. Lee showed me a pendulum
      toy and his theory. (That early theory was later
      corrected.).&nbsp; Mr. Lee also introduced Professor Woo, a
      retired scientist who helped to develop the first Chinese Atomic
      Bomb. Professor Woo met Dr. Liang personally and was confident
      that the car did work.&nbsp; We then seek the help of the Hong
      Kong Invention Association and had the first Press Announcement on
      Dec 20, 2004 at Tai Po.<br>
      <br>
      The night before the Press Announcement, a Chinese Foreign Trade
      Official, Mr. Au Yang, showed a CD from another Inventor, Mr. Sung
      Tim Fat.&nbsp; Mr. Sung provided an early version of his Invention
      to Dr. Liang. The invention was an electricity generator that
      required no fuel.&nbsp; Mr. Sung thought that the energy came from
      the permanent magnets.&nbsp; He could not explain why that
      creation or replenishing the magnets used x units of energy. The
      machine could then generate much more than x units of energy.<br>
      <br>
      It was clear to me that the above inventors did not have a correct
      theory. I continued to work on the theory. The theory was expanded
      from Oscillation Systems to Rotational Systems; from Gravitational
      to Magnetic Fields; from Rotations to Vibrations; from Vibrations
      to Flux Changes etc.&nbsp; The latest is the fifth generation.<br>
      <br>
      Another major theoretical breakthrough is on the understanding of
      magnetism. I can now explain why that a permanent magnet can help
      to generate much more energy than that to create it.&nbsp;
      Magnetic field is caused by the motion of electrons.&nbsp; The
      permanent magnet is not the source of energy.&nbsp; It induces
      changes in the motion of the electrons ¡V changing their orbits
      and hence energy levels. There can be energy exchanges with the
      surroundings.&nbsp; The energy comes from rearrangement of the
      orbits of the electrons and exchanges with the surrounding such as
      light, heat, etc.&nbsp; There is also evidence that magnetic
      fields can affect the half-life of some radioactive elements. This
      means nuclear forces may even be possible.<br>
      <br>
      I asked a 13 year old student, Miss Wini Woo to help me with the
      PowerPoint file. Miss Woo did a great job and also informed me
      that she could produce a flying machine using the theory of
      equivalent gravitational constant described.&nbsp; (That will be
      the subject of another report.)<br>
      <br>
      Mr. Raymond Ting joined us in January 2006. Within a few weeks, he
      completed many demonstration experiments on the Woo flying
      machine. To his credit, he also designed simple experiments on the
      pendulum systems that conclusively demonstrated that pulse forces
      could ¡§lead out¡¨ gravitational energy.<br>
      <br>
      My plan is to inform the Central Chinese Government as quickly as
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">3. The Indirect use of
        Gravitational Energy (Still Air etc.)*</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The first demonstrable use of Energy from Still Air from me was in
      June 2004. I applied for the PCT patent in July. The theory is as
      follows:<br>
      <br>
      1. Air can be bought into the System carrying in energy E_in<br>
      <br>
      2. Air can be carried from the System carrying out energy E_out<br>
      <br>
      3. Energy E_in can be greater than Energy E_out<br>
      <br>
      4. The difference is Energy supplied by Air<br>
      <br>
      5. The carried out Air can expand and absorb energy back from the
      atmosphere causing global cooling (reversing the effect of global
      warming).<br>
      <br>
      The practical demonstration of the invention is shown in figure
      3.1<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 3.1 Sample Application of
        Energy from Still Air</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">

      In Figure 3.1, 2 shows a HK$300 electric air pump; 4 is the lower
      water tank; 9 is the upper water tank; 3,5,6,7,8,10 are one-way
      valves. The water and air mixture is sent to the upper water tank
      9.&nbsp; The mixture is separated.&nbsp; The total energy input is
      that from the air pump + energy from air E_in . Many engineers and
      scientists previously ignored E_in . Professor Woo and many
      members of the Chinese Academy of Science accepted this
      correction.<br>
      <br>
      The next invention was the ¡§Lightning in a Box¡¨ by Mr. Chan, Mr.
      Kwok and Mr. Bill Fong. The invention uses the energy of the ions
      and/or electrostatic charges in the air.&nbsp; As we all know,
      lightning has much energy.&nbsp; Lightning is caused by the
      meeting of two clouds ¡V one carrying positive charge, the other
      carrying negative charge or via their finding a path to discharge
      via the Earth.&nbsp; The invention uses such energy and is shown
      in Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3<br>

      The above invention was first demonstrated in April 2005 in
      Shenzhen. Many improved versions have been developed. The latest
      models are ready for production.&nbsp; The inventors are seeking
      Venture Capital.<br>
      <br>
      Other inventions include the use of floatation. One technique
      allows an object of density 0.6 to drop down to generate
      electricity and then float back up a tube with two control doors
      at the top and bottom (video available on the CD -
      AVSEQ03.DAT).&nbsp; Another technique allows hollow balls to float
      up and turn a vertical chain with flaps to generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">4.0 The Direct use of
        Gravitational and Magnetic Energy</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Previously, scientists did not realize that they could
      continuously extract Energy from Gravity. In particular, they did
      not realize that the swing or the pendulum system could lead out
      Gravitational Energy.&nbsp; The mathematics is based on the
      Parallelogram of Forces studied in Physics by every secondary
      school student.<br>
      <br>
      The basic steps in Extracting Energy from Gravity are:<br>
      <br>
      1. Push the Pendulum with pulse forces at the right time (more
      scientifically, at resonance)<br>
      <br>
      2. The Pendulum System will lead out gravitational energy due to
      such pulse forces.<br>
      <br>
      3. Many commercial swinging toys already use such pulse force
      mechanisms.&nbsp; Many of these toys use Integrated Circuit or
      Intelligent Chip techniques.<br>
      <br>
      4. If the swinging arm of such a toy were replaced by a copper
      wire and the copper wire were placed in between the two poles of a
      permanent magnet, the swinging motion will generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      5. The swinging motion would slow down as the kinetic energy was
      converted into electrical energy.&nbsp; However, the pulse force
      and the ¡§led out¡¨ additional gravitational force would
      accelerate it again.<br>
      <br>
      The pendulum system with pulse force mechanism can thus ¡§lead
      out¡¨ gravitational energy and become the most primitive form of
      Energy from Gravity Machines.&nbsp; The experiments designed by
      Mr. Raymond Ting illustrated this concept conclusively.&nbsp;
      Figures 4.1 and 4.2 show the details.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.1 shows a pendulum
        system.</span><br>

      The pendulum is first balanced by a weight of 367 gms.&nbsp; There
      was no motion.&nbsp; A Pulse Force of 50 gms was then added.&nbsp;
      The pendulum went up with an increase in Potential Energy of
      367xH.<br>
      <br>
      However, the Energy supplied by the 50gms ¡§Pulse Force¡¨ was only
      50xH.<br>
      <br>
      *(One Time Lead Out of more Energy)*<br>
      <br>
      Previously, scientists did not realize that they could
      continuously extract Energy from Gravity.&nbsp; In particular,
      they did not realize that the swing or the pendulum system could
      lead out Gravitational Energy. The mathematics turned out to be
      very simple and should have been derivable by every secondary
      school student.<br>
      <br>
      The basic steps in Extracting Energy from Gravity are:<br>
      <br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Push the Pendulum with pulse forces at the right
      time (more scientifically, at resonance)<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pendulum System will ¡§lead out¡¨ gravitational
      energy due to such pulse forces (The basic theory will be covered
      in the next section).<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many commercial swinging toys already use such
      pulse force mechanisms.&nbsp; Many of these toys use Integrated
      Circuit techniques.<br>
      <br>
      4.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the swinging arm of such a toy were replaced by
      a copper wire and the copper wire were placed in between the two
      poles of a permanent<br>
      magnet, the swinging motion will generate electricity.<br>
      <br>
      5.&nbsp;&nbsp; The swinging motion would slow down as the kinetic
      energy was converted into electrical energy.&nbsp; However, the
      pulse force and the ¡§led out¡¨ additional gravitational force
      would accelerate it again.<br>
      <br>
      The pendulum system with pulse force mechanism can thus ¡§lead
      out¡¨ gravitational energy and provide the most primitive form of
      Energy from Gravity machines.&nbsp; However, we can easily improve
      the pendulum system to rotating systems with drastically improved
      efficiency.&nbsp; Electricity Generators that can generate over
      20,000 watts and cars that can achieve speed of over 220 km/hr
      have been produced and demonstrated.&nbsp; The inventors did not
      understand the theory at that time.&nbsp; The inventions were
      labeled as impossible perpetual machines.&nbsp; The inventor of
      the car marketed the car as a perpetual motion car. Many
      eyewitnesses even thought that the demonstrations were frauds to
      fool potential investors. <br>
      <br>
      Joseph Newman also demonstrated a similar device in USA on March
      28, 2005.&nbsp; The event was shown on World Television including
      the Disney Discovery Channel.&nbsp; Mr. Newman did not understand
      the true theory and spent over forty years trying to find the best
      device.<br>
      <br>
      The theory is explained here.&nbsp; Patents have already been
      filed.&nbsp; A Company in Shenzhen will produce the working
      electricity generators for factories, villages, and homes etc.
      within the coming months.<br>
      <br>
      The same theory can be applied to magnetic objects swinging or
      rotating in magnetic fields.&nbsp; The vehicles utilizing such
      engines need no fuel and could function even on the Moon and in
      Outer Space.&nbsp; The invention is likely to change the concept
      of space travel.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE BASIC THEORY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The basic theory should have been derivable by every secondary
      school student who studied Physics.&nbsp; Fig. 1 re-explains
      Newton¡¦s First Law of Motion.&nbsp; If the Ball is pushed with a
      Pulse Force F for a displacement d, it will acquire a velocity
      v.&nbsp; If there were no string and no gravity, the Ball would
      move in a straight line with velocity v forever.&nbsp; With the
      presence of the string but no gravity, the Ball would move in a
      circle similar to the Earth moving around the Sun.&nbsp; With the
      presence of the string and gravity, the Ball would acquire the
      familiar swinging motion.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.2 shows a nearly
        balanced position. </span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 273px; height:
          205px;" alt="" src="image020.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The pendulum was pulled close to the middle position.&nbsp; In
      this position, half of the force is from the tension of the String
      S and half is from the Pulse Force B.<br>
      <br>
      The tension of the String can be attributed to Gravity.&nbsp; This
      shows:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Continuous Lead Out of
        Gravitational Energy by the Pulse Force B</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.2a&nbsp; Parallelogram
        of Forces.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 276px; height:
          175px;" alt="" src="image022.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      This is the most important theoretical diagram.&nbsp; It uses the
      Parallelogram of Forces taught in all secondary schools around the
      World.&nbsp; I simply applied it to the Pendulum after learning it
      50 years ago!<br>
      <br>
      In Figure 4.2a, the force and energy imparted by the Pulse Force B
      and the String S are analyzed by decomposing them into the
      vertical and horizontal components.<br>
      <br>
      B Force (horizontal) = S Force(horizontal) but in opposite
      direction<br>
      <br>
      B Force (vertical) + S Force(vertical) = mg<br>
      <br>
      B Energy (horizontal) = B Force(horizontal) x horizontal
      displacement<br>
      <br>
      S Energy (horizontal) = S Force(horizontal) x 0<br>
      <br>
      (displacement not in direction of force but energy is stored ¡V
      ready to be used on swinging back)<br>
      <br>
      B Energy(vertical) = B Force(vertical) x vertical
      displacement&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      (* height raised)<br>
      <br>
      S Energy(vertical) = S Force(vertical) x vertical
      displacement&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      (* height raised)<br>
      <br>
      Since S Force(vertical) can be much higher than B Force(vertical),
      a small Pulse Force can Lead Out a large quantity of Gravitational
      Energy,&nbsp; Thus the theory can be proved mathematically and
      verified experimentally.<br>
      <br>
      Once we understand that the Pendulum System with Pulse Force can
      Lead Out gravitational energy, we can easily extend that to
      rotational systems.&nbsp; The following Figures 4.3 to 4.6
      illustrate this very well.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pulse Force</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.3 shows the pendulum
        system with a Pulse Force.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      From the previous Figures 4.1, 4.2 and the descriptions, we know
      that the pendulum system with Pulse Force can Lead Out
      gravitational energy.<br>
      <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.4 shows the swing of the
        pendulum extended to 360 degrees.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      Instead of the oscillation motion, we now have a circular motion.
      However, the same theory of Extracting Energy from Gravity via
      Pulse Force is still valid.&nbsp; The Pulse Force needs to be
      stronger.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.5 shows replacing the
        string with a rod type setup.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      The oscillation is now around the center of the rod.&nbsp; The
      same theory of Extracting Gravitational Energy via Pulse Force is
      still valid.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.6 shows a complete wheel
        replacing the simple pendulum.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 271px; height:

      </div>
      <br>
      A complete wheel with spoke setup can totally replace the pendulum
      system to extract Gravitational Energy with Pulse Force.&nbsp;
      This setup is much more efficient as the wheel can rotate at a
      high speed. <br>
      <br>
      The use of the Wheel or Cylinder type setup is much more efficient
      than the simple pendulum.&nbsp; The energy that can be extracted
      per revolution is 2mgr where m is the mass of the wheel (if all
      the mass were at the rim),<br>
      g is the gravitational constant and r is the radius of the Wheel.<br>

        (Extract Energy via cutting Earth¡¦s Magnetic Field)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The First Generation Cosmic Energy Electricity Generator was the
      machine from Mr. Sung Tim Fat.&nbsp; It consisted of 3 cylinders
      spinning with the axis in the vertical direction.&nbsp; Each
      cylinder has magnetic and magnetic shielding material.&nbsp; The
      rotation essentially cut the horizontal component of the magnetic
      field of the Earth.&nbsp; The first cylinder generated enough
      energy to supply the pulse force to drive the second
      cylinder.&nbsp; The second cylinder generated enough energy to
      supply the pulse force to drive the third cylinder.&nbsp; The
      third cylinder generated 400 watts ¡V enough to supply the pulse
      force to drive the first cylinder and more.<br>
      <br>
      The file AVSEQ02.DAT shows both the first and the second
      generation electricity generators in a demonstration in
      2000.&nbsp; A separate starting motor was used.&nbsp; The first
      generation was relatively bulky. See the China Patent Office
      Website at http://www,sipo.gov.cn/sipo/default.htm Patent Number
      99126283.2 for details.<br>

        (Extract Energy via Gravity)</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      The Second Generation Cosmic Energy Electricity Generator was also
      a machine from Mr. Sung Tim Fat. It essentially was the First
      Generation set up in the horizontal direction.&nbsp; The axis of
      rotation was horizontal.&nbsp; This effectively uses both the
      vertical component of the magnetic field of the Earth and the
      gravitational field of the Earth. The output was 20,000
      watts.&nbsp; Figures 4.7 and 4.8 show the differences between the
      First and Second Generation.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Figure 4.7 shows the First

      <br>
      Mr. Sung produced the video in February 2000.&nbsp; The video
      showed that the Generator could support a lamp, a fan and an
      electrical drill.<br>

      <br>
      The Second Generation could generate 20,000 watts. Unfortunately,
      Mr. Sung went out of funds and borrowed from the Black Market. The
      consequence was that he ended up in heavy debt and had to hide
      from the moneylenders.<br>

        of Intelligent Chips)</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The Third Generation was from Dr. Liang Sing Yan.&nbsp; Dr. Liang
      got the Generator from Mr. Sung and improved it. He used
      Intelligent Chips (a step better than Integrated Circuits)&nbsp;
      to provide the pulse force. The car could provide 188 horsepower
      and was demonstrated in 2003.&nbsp; Figures 4.9 and 4.10 show the
      details.<br>

      Dr. Liang made a major mistake in his raising of funds. He
      authorized many agents to help him.&nbsp; Many of these agents
      made false promises to investors. When Dr. Liang tried to present
      his inventions in Dec 2004, many angry investors filed lawsuits
      against him and his agents. The show was cancelled.<br>
      <br>
      I believe that Dr. Liang should be rescued. His invention and ours
      will create phenomenal wealth for China and the World. See China

        (Extract Energy via Changes of Magnetic Flux)*</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      After we understood the use of rotation to extract energy from
      gravitational or magnetic fields, we started to investigate
      whether we could use vibration or no vibration at all.&nbsp; The
      answer to both questions were yes.&nbsp; The demonstration of a
      vibration device was from Taiwan using ocean waves.&nbsp; The
      demonstration of a non-vibrating device came from US patent
      6,326,718.&nbsp; The non-vibrating device used changes in magnetic
      flux as the pulse force.&nbsp; Figures 4.11 and 4.12 show the

      S supplies power to 1 which provides AC current via G to coils A
      and B. 3 is a permanent magnet to provide added magnetic flux to 2
      and then to coils E and F.&nbsp; E and F provide AC power via D to
      1.&nbsp; The output power from E and F is higher than that from A
      and B<br>
      <br>
      The advantage of this technique is that the size of the Generator
      can be very small. However, the development is in early stages and
      much more effort is required to turn it into a usable product.<br>

      <br>
      The Fifth Generation came as a flash of brilliance from Mr. Lee
      Cheung Kin. We were trying to solve the slope-climbing problem of
      the Dr. Liang car. With pure gravitational force as source of
      power, the power decreases when the car climbs up a steep
      slope.&nbsp; If the outer cylinder of the Dr. Liang engine were
      replaced by a magnetic field and the Intelligent Chips in the
      inner rotating cylinder changed polarity at the highest and lowest
      positions, the problem would be solved with great increase in
      power at the same time.&nbsp; Figures 4.13 and 4.14 show the

      (PCT/IB05/00138)<br>
      <br>
      This invention uses the corrected theory of the pendulum to
      extract energy from gravitational fields. A pulse force applied to
      a pendulum can lead out gravitational energy.&nbsp; The energy can
      be changed into electrical energy such as allowing the metallic
      string of the pendulum to cut a magnetic field.&nbsp; The
      oscillation motion will slow down but the pulse force will lead
      out gravitational energy to speed it up again. The oscillation
      motion can be changed into a rotational motion for a more
      efficient operation.&nbsp; The same technique can be applied to
      magnetic or electrical fields.<br>
      <br>

      </a><br>
      Thank you for reporting the work of my team (Lawrence Tseung et
      al) in the past.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Now we have something more concrete and interesting to demonstrate
      to the World.&nbsp; We now have a Pulse Motor that has been
      demonstrated to over 25,000 persons in two Open Shows in Hong Kong
      (InnoCarnival09 in November 2009 and Inno Design Tech Expo in
      December 2010.)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The Pulse Motor Wheel was developed by Mr. Tong Po Chi with my
      guidance using the Lead-Out Energy Theory.&nbsp; The Wheel had a
      60 cm rotor with 16 equally spaced magnets.&nbsp; There were 15
      corresponding air coils that could be configured as a Drive Coil
      or as a Collector Coil. The remaining position was used by a
      Proximity Switch.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The operation is as follows:<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Input Power comes from a 12 V battery.<br>
      <br>
      2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once switched on, the Wheel might start to
      rotate by itself or by hand if it happened to stop at one of the
      “dead positions”.<br>
      <br>
      3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Proximity Switch was set so that when a
      magnet on the rotor passed next to it, it would pass current via a
      relay to the Drive Coils.&nbsp; It would stop passing current when
      the magnet moved away.<br>
      <br>
      4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Proximity Switch could be adjusted so
      that the current passed through the Drive Coils when the magnets
      moved slightly passed the center of these Coils.&nbsp; These Coils
      became temporary magnets repelling the magnets to provide the
      Pulse Force.<br>
      <br>
      5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Coils would show no magnetic properties
      as soon as the magnets moved away as they were AIR coils.<br>
      <br>
      6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Drive Coils were connected in parallel
      and the Collector Coils were connected in series.<br>
      <br>
      7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Input Power was measured with DC
      Voltmeters and amp meters across the Drive Coils.<br>
      <br>
      8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Output Power was measured after
      converting the AC to DC across the Collector Coils.<br>
      <br>
      9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When 10 Drive Coils and 5 Collector Coils
      were used, the Output Power as measured from the meters was
      greater than the Input Power.&nbsp; The actual COP (Output/Input)
      varied with the external load (1-3 3 watt lamps or a 47 Ohm
      resistor) and Proximity Switch tuning.&nbsp; The value varied from
      1.8 to 4.2!<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      We now openly invite independent experts to verify the
      experimental results in Hong Kong.&nbsp; The Tong Wheel is now at
      the Office of Dr. James Wong of the Institute of Energy (IOE) of
      Hong Kong.&nbsp; You can email me to arrange for a suitable time.<br>

      Innovation – The Story of Lawrence Tseung (3.3 Mb; doc) - Author:
      Lawrence C. N. Tseung; Editor: Miss Forever Yuen; Draft on Sept 4,
      2008(The file is a draft review copy of a coming book.)<br>
      <br>
      "In the Cosmic Energy Machines, we are NOT trying to create
      energy. We are using a Pulse Force to Lead Out energy. The
      layman’s analogy is using a bucket to pour water from a large tank
      at the top of a hill. The energy of water flowing down the hill is
      NOT the muscle energy. The energy of water flowing down the hill
      is mainly the potential energy of water already available."
      Itseung888<br>
      <br>
      "The Lee-Tseung theory predicts that both gravitational and
      electron motion energy can be lead out via pulse force at
      resonance on oscillating, vibrating, rotating or flux change
      systems. The ideal pulse force for a simple pendulum can be
      thought of as the pull applied perpendicular to the arc of motion
      when the pendulum bob is at the maximum displaced position. The
      detailed mathematical proof is via the analysis of the simple
      pendulum during the application of the ideal pulse force. The
      pulse force increases the tension of the string and leads out
      gravitation energy. For a horizontal pulse force, two parts of
      pulse energy can lead out approximately one part of gravitational
      energy. This gives a Coefficient of Performance (COP or output
      energy/input energy) of 1.5 during the application of the pulse.
      Some forum members did not appreciate the qualifying statement of
      “during the application? and thought that the pulsed pendulum was
      a COP =1.5 system as a whole.<br>
      <br>
      This misunderstanding is corrected here:<br>
      <br>
      (1) Let the time at which pulse force is applied be T pulse<br>
      <br>
      (2) Let the time of oscillation of the pendulum be T oscillation<br>
      <br>
      (3) Let Tpulse be 1/100 of T oscillation. This represents the real
      case of pushing a swing and then let go. Most of the swinging time
      has NO pulse force.<br>
      <br>
      (4) Let the system during the NO pulse force period be very
      efficient. Assume the COP is 1.0.<br>
      <br>
      (5) The overall COP for such a system is not 1.5 and should be
      calculated as follows: 1.0 + (1.5 –1)*1/100 (Spreading the higher
      efficiency over the total time) = 1.0 +0.005 = 1.005<br>
      <br>
      (6) In the real world, the pendulum has COP less than 1 during the
      NO pulse force period. Thus the net result of the real pulsed
      pendulum is less than 1.<br>
      <br>
      (7) In order to get the real pulsed pendulum to exceed 1, we have
      to do one or more of the following:<br>
      <br>
      Increase the number of pulses per unit time<br>
      Increase the pulse period<br>
      One practical way is to change the pulsed oscillation of the
      pendulum to the pulsed rotation of a cylinder.<br>
      With a pulse- rotating cylinder, we can increase the number of
      pulse points; increase the rotational speed; increase the mass at
      the rim; and increase the diameter of the cylinder to lead out the
      larger amount of gravitational energy. <br>
      <br>
      The gravitational energy is not created but lead out. Patent
      offices, scientists and many inventors have not understood this
      lead out energy source in the past. Use of this lead out energy
      does not violate the law of conservation of energy."&nbsp; <br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overunity Pulse Motor by Mr. Tong
        and Dr. Lawernce Tseung</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      "The secrets of making an overunity pulse motor: To bring your
      pulse motor into overunity mode there is a subtle balance between
      the shape and sizes of coils and magnets, size of the wheel, speed
      of the wheel, timing of the pulses, and the ratio of generator
      coils compared to motor coils. This unit has 16 magnets, 1 of the
      magnets is passing the sensor, 10 of the magnets are passing motor
      coils (connected in parallel), and 5 of the magnets are passing
      generator coils (connected in series). The input is around 1.8
      Watts DC, and the output (after rectification) is around 2.3 Watts
      DC.<br>
      <br>
      As you can see this design is very simple and was just made as a
      proof of concept. Major improvements are underway.<br>
      Two hints for those trying to build their own pulse motors: 1.
      High speeds are not necessarily better. 2. A smooth running wheel
      is certainly not better. It is the jerkiness between generator
      mode and when the drive pulse hits the magnets that allows for the
      overunity potential of the electromagnetic fields to be extracted.<br>
      <br>
      Please help support the brilliant work of Mr. Tong and Dr. Tseung.
      If your local University would like to purchase a simple overunity
      demonstration kit, we can send you the parts and the complete set
      up procedures. The set up process is very important and must be
      done in a careful way." (YouTube; February 04, 2010) <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Circuit explained</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      "Oops, I made a mistake. Of course the sensor goes directly to the
      pulsing unit and the battery goes directly to the meters. The
      pulsing unit allows current to pass from the battery to the coils.
      The output goes through the meters and to a 3KW light. There is a
      little Back EMF being picked up by the drive coils before they
      fire which can be seen by the meter when you switch it to AC.
      However this is just being discarded for now. Those green laser
      sensors with the rainbow wires are not being used at this time."

      When a sideward pull is applied to a simple pendulum, the lead out
      gravitational energy is equal to The vertical component of the
      tension of the string times the vertical component of the
      displacement.<br>
      So long as there is tension on the string, gravitational energy
      will be Lead Out.<br>
      The ideal Lee-Tseung Pull is when the direction of pull is

      Force Considerations in using Gravitational Energy<br>
      Displacement Consideration<br>
      General<br>
      Work = Force x Displacement<br>
      Work = Force x Displacement (vector)<br>
      Hori work = F x Lsin(a)<br>
      Vert work = Mg x L(1- cos(a))<br>
      Hori work is done by the externally supplied force F<br>
      Vert work is done by gravity via the tension of the string.<br>
      <br>
      Substituting the actual values<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      Assume M=60Kg, g=9.8m/s/s. L=1m. F=1/6 of Mg. Angle a = 9.46
      degrees, T1=Mg/cos(a), we get:<br>
      Horizontal work done by F (horizontal energy) = 16.10728 Joules<br>
      Vertical work done by Gravity through String<br>
      = 8.0069 joules<br>
      The ratio&nbsp; hori energy/vert energy is thus = 16.10728/8.0069<br>
      = 2.014<br>
      * Approximate 2 parts Horizontal Energy Lead Out 1 part Vertical
      Energy<br>
      <br>
      Summary of discussion so far<br>
      When we pull the pendulum with a horizontal force, work is done.<br>
      Tension in the string also does work!<br>
      This work is done by Gravity via the String<br>
      This work is stored as energy in the pendulum system<br>
      This is the Lead Out energy...<br>
