        <br>
        <div style="text-align: left;">We are all well aware of
          plastic’s “rap-sheet.” It has been found guilty on many
          counts, including the way its production and disposal raises
          resource issues and lets loose extremely negative
          environmental impacts.<br>
          <br>
          Typically made from petroleum, it is estimated that 7% of the
          world’s annual oil production is used to produce and
          manufacture plastic. That is more than the oil consumed by the
          entire African continent.<br>
          <br>
          Plastic’s carbon footprint includes landfilling and
          incineration, since sadly, its recycle rate is dismally low
          around the globe.<br>
          <br>
          Plastic trash is also polluting our oceans and washing up on
          beaches around the world. Tons of plastic from the US and
          Japan are floating in the Pacific Ocean, killing mammals and
          birds. Perhaps this tragedy is best captured in the TED
          presentation by Capt. Charles Moore of the Algalita Marine
          Research Foundation.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Using less, or use it better?</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Thankfully, there are those who fully appreciate that plastic
          has a higher energy value than anything else commonly found in
          the waste stream. A Japanese company called Blest created a
          small, very safe and easy to use machine that can convert
          several types of plastic back into oil.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          "If we burn the plastic, we generate toxins and a large amount
          of CO2. If we convert it into oil, we save CO2 and at the same
          time increase people’s awareness about the value of plastic
          garbage. " — Akinori Ito, CEO of Blest.<br>
          <br>
          Though Japan has much improved its “effective utilization”
          rate over the years to 72% in 2006, that leaves 28% of plastic
          to be buried in landfills or burned. According to Plastic
          Waste Management Institute data, “effective utilization”
          includes not just the 20% that is actually recycled, but also
          52% that is being incinerated for “energy recovery” purposes,
          i.e., generating heat or electric power.<br>
          <br>
          “If we burn the plastic, we generate toxins and a large amount
          of CO2. If we convert it into oil, we save CO2 and at the same
          time increase people’s awareness about the value of plastic
          garbage,” says Akinori Ito, CEO of Blest.<br>
          <br>
          Blest’s conversion technology is very safe because it uses a
          temperature controlling electric heater rather than flame. The
          machines are able to process polyethylene, polystyrene and
          polypropylene (numbers 2-4) but not PET bottles (number 1).
          The result is a crude gas that can fuel things like generators
          or stoves and, when refined, can even be pumped into a car, a
          boat or motorbike. One kilogram of plastic produces almost one
          liter of oil. To convert that amount takes about 1 kilowatt of
          electricity, which is approximately ¥20 or 20 cents’ worth.<br>
          <br>
          The company makes the machines in various sizes and has 60 in
          place at farms, fisheries and small factories in Japan and
          several abroad.<br>
          <br>
          “To make a machine that anyone can use is my dream,” Ito says.
          “The home is the oil field of the future.”<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps that statement is not as crazy as it sounds, since the
          makeup of Japanese household waste has been found to contain
          over 30 % plastic, most of it from packaging.<br>
          <br>

          and Architects, Detailed Sorting and Measuring of Household
          Waste, Kyoto 1998.<br>
          <br>
          Continually honing their technology, the company is now able
          to sell the machines for less than before, and Ito hopes to
          achieve a product “that any one can buy.” Currently the
          smallest version, shown in the videobrief, costs ¥950,000 (US
          $9,500).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Changing how we think</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          But it is the educational application of the small model of
          the machine that Ito is most passionate about. He’s taken it
          on planes on many occasions as part of a project that began
          some years ago in the Marshall Islands. There he worked with
          local government and schools to teach people about recycling
          culture and the value of discarded plastic, spreading the
          Japanese concept of mottainai, the idea that waste is sad and
          regrettable.<br>
          <br>
          In such remote places, the machine also serves as a practical
          solution to the plastic problem, much of it left behind by
          tourists: the oil produced is used for tour buses or boats,
          Ito says.<br>
          &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          Plastic’s carbon footprint includes landfilling and
          incineration, since sadly, its recycle rate is dismally low
          around the globe.<br>
          <br>
          “Teaching this at schools is the most important work that I
          do,” Ito reflects. In Japan too, he visits schools where he
          shows children, teachers and parents how to convert the
          packaging and drinking straws leftover from lunch.<br>
          <br>
          If we were to use only the world’s plastic waste rather than
          oil from oil fields, CO2 emissions could be slashed
          dramatically, he says.<br>
          <br>
          “It’s a waste isn’t it?” Ito asks. “This plastic is every
          where in the world, and everyone throws it away.”<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">A mountain to climb down</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          The wonderful invention of plastics has spawned a huge problem
          that we are struggling to solve. With peak oil looming, things
          are set to change, but we find ourselves on top of an oil and
          plastic mountain, and the only way forward is down.<br>
          <br>
          So while many solutions like this are not without hiccups or
          detractors, they are a step forward in coming to terms with
          our oil and plastics dependence and help raise awareness of
          the carbon footprint of its production and use. Somehow we all
          know that plastics is a habit we need to kick. But that
          doesn’t seem to make it any easier.<br>
          <br>
          Perhaps the best thing you can do is to look more deeply into
          this issue. A good place to start is the 2008 Addicted to
          Plastic documentary from Cryptic Moth productions. You can
          watch the trailer online and maybe request it at your local
          video rental store.<br>
          <br>
          According to the blurb, “the film details plastic’s path over
          the last 100 years and provides a wealth of expert interviews
          on practical and cutting edge solutions to recycling, toxicity
          and biodegradability.”<br>
          <br>
          Next it is just a matter of taking action to break our love
          affair with plastic.<br>

          <br>
          [0001] The present invention, relates to an apparatus for
          converting plastic back to oil.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED
            ART</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0002] In recent years, along with rapid increase in global
          population and economic growth in many countries,
          environmental problems have been discussed as issues of global
          scale, the problems being, for example, insufficiency of
          natural resources for a rapidly increasing energy demand,
          global warming due to large consumption of fossil fuels, and
          disposal of garbage, scraps and various consumed products.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] Therefore, recycling technologies are becoming much
          more important among the technologies for effectively
          utilizing the resources.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] In the recycling technologies, there is known a
          small-sized apparatus for obtaining oil from waste plastic,
          for example, the apparatus comprising a hopper, a cylindrical
          melting unit having a lead screw mounted therein, a
          cylindrical decomposing unit for vaporization-decomposing
          plastic melted by the melting unit, and heaters wound around
          the melting unit and the decomposing unit, wherein the plastic
          is heated by the heater and vaporized, and the vaporized
          plastic gas is made to pass through a catalyst and cooled in a
          condenser to be liquefied, and the resultant liquid is taken
          out as oil, while residue is collected in a residue takeout
          unit (Patent Document 1).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</span><br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Problem to be Solved by the
            Invention</span><br>
          <br>
          [0005] However, in order to efficiently treat a large quantity
          of and variously mixed plastics and to practically operate the
          apparatus for converting plastic to oil, such conventional
          apparatus needs more to be improved.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] The present invention is pursued to solve such problem
          and an object of the present invention is to provide an
          apparatus for conversion-to-oil capable of efficiently
          treating plastic.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Means for Solving the Problem</span><br>
          <br>
          [0007] The apparatus for conversion-to-oil according to the
          present invention comprises a melting unit for melting plastic
          by heating, and a decomposing unit for vaporizing and
          decomposing the molten plastic melted by the melting unit by
          further heating. The decomposing unit is inclined upward,
          having a lead screw therein and provided on its upper end
          portion with a catalyst cylinder directing upward and a
          residue takeout unit directing downward. The decomposing unit
          has a prevention means for preventing the molten plastic gas
          from flowing down to the residue takeout unit.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] In an aspect, the prevention means for preventing the
          molten plastic gas from flowing down may be an open/close
          valve located at a takeout port of the residue takeout unit
          for taking out the residue. Further, close to the open/close
          valve may be arranged a heater for heating the inside of the
          residue takeout unit.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] In another aspect, the prevention means for preventing
          the molten plastic gas from flowing down may be a suction unit
          located at a gas takeout port of the catalyst cylinder for
          taking out the molten plastic gas and for sucking the molten
          plastic gas.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] In the other aspect, the prevention means for
          preventing the molten plastic gas from flowing down may be a
          cylinder valve, which connects to the lower side of the
          decomposing unit and has a spiral member rotatable so as to
          extrude the residue.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] In the catalyst cylinder of the conversion-to-oil
          apparatus of the invention may be contained synthesis zeolite
          composed of silicon oxide and alumina.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] Further, the conversion-to-oil apparatus of the
          invention may have a residue pot for collecting and heating
          the residue, located close to the end portion of the
          decomposing unit, the residue pot having an open/close lid.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Furthermore, the melting unit of the conversion-to-oil
          apparatus of the invention may be constructed to melt the
          plastic fed from the hopper by frictional heating due to the
          rotation of the screw in its cylinder and a heat applied from
          the heater.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] In another aspect of this invention, the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus may comprise a melting unit for
          melting and feeding crushed plastic, and a decomposing unit
          for decomposing and vaporizing the molten plastic melted by
          the melting unit, wherein the melting unit and the decomposing
          unit have, respectively, lead screws rotated by motors, and
          the melting unit and the decomposing unit are respectively
          heated by heaters. The conversion-to-oil apparatus has a
          diesel-powered generator driven by bubbling-treated oil, which
          is obtained by subjecting the oil produced by the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus to bubbling treatment for removing
          gasoline content. By the power from this generator operate the
          electric driven units such as the heaters and motors.<br>
          <br>
          [0015] In still another aspect of this invention, the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus may comprise a melting unit for
          melting and feeding crushed plastic, and a decomposing unit
          for decomposing and vaporizing the molten plastic melted by
          the melting unit, wherein the melting unit and the decomposing
          unit have, respectively, lead screws rotated by motors, and
          the melting unit and the decomposing unit are respectively
          heated by heaters. The conversion-to-oil apparatus has a
          diesel-powered generator driven by blended oil, which is
          obtained by blending the oil produced by the conversion-to-oil
          apparatus with food oil.<br>
          <br>
          [0016] In the other aspect of this invention, the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus may comprise a melting unit for
          melting and feeding crushed plastic, and a decomposing unit
          for decomposing and vaporizing the molten plastic melted by
          the melting unit, wherein the melting unit and the decomposing
          unit, respectively, have lead screws rotated by motors, and
          the melting unit and the decomposing unit are respectively
          heated by heaters. In this conversion-to-oil apparatus, the
          generator is powered by an off-gas generated during the
          liquefaction of plastic and the oil produced by the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus. This produced oil is the
          bubbling-treated oil, of which gasoline content is removed by
          bubbling treatment.<br>
          <br>
          [0017] In the other aspect of this invention, the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus may comprise a melting unit for
          melting and feeding crushed plastic, and a decomposing unit
          for decomposing and vaporizing the molten plastic melted by
          the melting unit, wherein the melting unit and the decomposing
          unit, respectively, have lead screws rotated by motors, and
          the melting unit and the decomposing unit are respectively
          heated by heaters. The conversion-to-oil apparatus has a
          diesel-powered generator driven by off gas generated during
          the liquefaction of plastic and the oil produced by the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus. The produced oil is blended with
          food oil.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect of the Invention</span><br>
          <br>
          [0018] According to the present invention, since a prevention
          means (fan for pressure control, valves of residue takeout
          unit, etc.) for preventing the vaporized gas from coming into
          the residue takeout unit and being liquefied to cause
          non-decomposed oil is provided around the catalyst cylinder of
          the decomposing unit, such non-decomposed oil could not be
          stored in the residue tank and thus plastic can be efficiently
          treated.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] Further, the conversion-to-oil apparatus of the
          invention has a diesel-powered generator, and in the case of
          using the bubbling-treated oil obtained by removing gasoline
          content from the produced oil or the blended oil obtained by
          blending the produced oil with food oil, the generator can be
          smoothly and efficiently operated and therefore plastic can be
          efficiently treated.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Furthermore, if a dual fuel engine is employed for the
          generator, it is possible to make good use of off-gas as an
          energy. Thus plastic can be efficiently treated.<br>

            CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight:
            bold;">
          <br>
          [0061] Hereafter, embodiments of the present invention will be
          described in detail with reference to the drawings.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">First Embodiment</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0062] In FIG. 1, a conversion-to-oil apparatus M1 according
          to a first embodiment of the present invention comprises a
          gel-forming unit 1 for melting crushed plastic pieces into
          plastic gel, and a decomposing unit 2 for thermally
          decomposing the plastic gel melted by the gel-forming unit 1.
          The gel-forming unit 1 is provided with a feeding unit 3 for
          feeding the crushed plastic pieces to a hopper 7. The feeding
          unit 3 has a feeding pipe 4, in which a known spiral member
          (not-shown) is mounted. By rotation of the spiral member, the
          plastic is continuously fed to the hopper 7. The feeding unit
          3 has a hanging member 6 held by a holding hook 5.<br>
          <br>
          [0063] The hopper 7 is fixed to a frame body 9, and a cylinder
          8 extends horizontally from the frame body 9. In the cylinder
          8 is mounted a screw 11, which rotates in a space hole 12, and
          a vertical hole 13 extends downward from the end of the space
          hole 12.<br>
          <br>
          [0064] The screw 11 rotates by means of a motor 10 mounted to
          the frame body 9. A wall of the space hole 12 is heated an
          electrical heater (not shown) installed in the cylinder 8.<br>
          <br>
          [0065] The gel-forming unit 1 melts the plastic pieces fed
          from the hopper 7 by frictional heating due to the rotation of
          the screw 11 in the cylinder 8 and the heat applied by the
          heater not shown, thus forming the plastic gel. Specifically,
          the plastic pieces in the hopper 7 are continuously fed into
          the cylinder 8 and fed through in the space hole by the
          rotation of the screw 11 and at the same time the plastic
          pieces are being melted into plastic gel by the frictional
          heating due to the feeding force of the screw 11 and the heat
          from the heater not shown. Thus, by using the forcible feeding
          action of the screw, the problem that the cylinder 8 is liable
          to be clogged by some kind of plastic, PET for example, having
          an increasing moisture content and a high melting point, and
          the viscosity of which increases as the plastic pieces are
          melted solely by the heat from the heater can be solved. Here,
          as the forcible feeding means may be employed a means such as
          used in the extrusion forming method and the injection forming
          method for forming plastic.<br>
          <br>
          [0066] The decomposing unit 2 is inclined upward and has a
          lead screw LS (FIG. 2) in it. Namely, the bottom end of the
          vertical hole 13 is connected to the lower portion of the
          cylindrical decomposing unit 2, in which the lead screw LS is
          mounted. The lead screw LS is comprised of a shaft 15 and
          blades 15a disposed around the shaft 15. By the lead screw LS,
          the plastic gel and the vaporized plastic gas (vaporized gas
          or molten plastic gas) are guided in a spiral fashion. The
          upper end of the lead screw LS is connected to a motor 14.
          Around the cylindrical body of the decomposing unit 2 are
          mounted belt-like heaters 16, 16 . . . 16 at a predetermined
          intervals, the heaters 16 being covered with heat insulator
          (not shown).<br>
          <br>
          [0067] At the upper end portion of the decomposing unit 2 is
          provided a residue takeout unit directed downward. Concretely,
          as shown in FIG. 2, the residue takeout unit R is located at
          the lower side of the upper portion of the cylindrical body of
          the decomposing unit 2. The residue takeout unit R has a
          cylindrical valve 17 connected to the lower side surface of
          the cylindrical body of the decomposing unit. The cylindrical
          valve 17 is one of the prevention means for preventing the
          molten plastic gas from flowing down to the residue takeout
          unit R.<br>
          <br>
          [0068] The cylindrical valve 17 has a spiral member, which
          rotates to extrude the residue. Concretely, in the cylindrical
          valve (spiral valve) 17 is mounted a spiral member 42, which
          rotates slowly by a motor 40 so as to prevent the vaporized
          gas from directly coming into a residue pipe 18. By this
          prevention for the vaporized gas from directly coming into the
          residue pipe 18, the vaporized gas and the residue can be
          reliably separated from each other to thereby enhance the
          efficiency of recovering oil.<br>
          <br>
          [0069] In addition, downwardly from the lower side of the
          upper portion of the cylindrical valve 17 extends the residue
          pipe 18, in which an open/close valve 41 is mounted. The
          open/close valve 41 is closed to completely shut off the gas
          flowing to a residue tank, while the open/close valve 41 is
          periodically opened so as to discharge the residue. The
          open/close valve 41 is also one of the prevention means for
          preventing the molten plastic gas from flowing down to the
          residue takeout unit R. Namely, the open/close valve 41
          serving as the prevention means for preventing the molten
          plastic gas from flowing down is located to be opened and
          closed at the residue takeout port of the residue takeout unit
          R, and adjacent to the open/close valve 41 is arranged a
          heater 70 for heating the inside of the residue takeout unit
          R.<br>
          <br>
          [0070] Further, around the cylinder including the spiral
          member 42 and the pipe including the open/close valve 41 are
          arranged heaters 70, 70 . . . 70 for heating the vaporized gas
          existing above the cylindrical valve 17 and the open/close
          valve 41, the heaters serving to prevent the vaporized gas
          from being liquefied. In particular, the heater 70 around the
          pipe including the open/close valve 41 protects the function
          of the open/close valve 41 from being degraded, because the
          function of the open/close valve would be damaged if the
          residue is cooled to be a solid block (the open/close valve 41
          would be no longer closed due to such block of the residue,
          with the result that the vaporized gas would flow into the
          residue takeout unit R, for instance). With the open/close
          valve 41 effectively operated, the vaporized gas and the
          residue can be reliably separated from each other so that the
          efficiency of recovering oil is improved. In addition, with
          the arrangement of the heaters 70 substantially from the
          connecting portion between the cylindrical valve 17 and the
          residue pipe 18 to the open/close valve 41, the open/close
          valve 41 can be much more efficiently operated.<br>
          <br>
          [0071] Furthermore, a means for introducing nitrogen 71 from
          the upper end of the residue pipe 18 may be employed for
          preventing the vaporized gas from flowing-down. This is also
          one of the prevention means for preventing the molten plastic
          gas from flowing down to the residue takeout unit R. Namely,
          this means serves to prevent the flow-down of the gas
          vaporized from the decomposing unit 2 to the residue takeout
          unit R by way of increasing the pressure on the side of the
          residue takeout unit R.<br>
          <br>
          [0072] At the upper end portion of the decomposing unit 2 is
          provided a catalyst cylinder 19 extending in the upward
          direction. Specifically, at a position downwardly apart from
          the cylinder valve 17 is located the catalyst cylinder 19, in
          which a catalyst composed of zeolite 44 is contained via a
          detachable cage C. Around the outer periphery of die catalyst
          cylinder 19 are attached a heater 45 for thermal control and a
          water-cooling jacket 46, by which the catalyst in the cylinder
          19 is thermally controlled. The catalyst cylinder 19 has an
          upper flange detachably mounted by a flange of an enlarged
          portion of a guide pipe 22 and a clamp 20. By this
          configuration, the cage C for the catalyst is detachable so
          that the catalyst can be changed after having been used for a
          predetermined time. The catalyst may be of synthesis zeolite
          preferably having an effective fine diameter of 9 to 10 mm and
          having a ratio of 2.5 times SiO2 to Al2O3, and of spherical
          piece having a size of 2.4 to 4.7.<br>
          <br>
          [0073] A quantity of the catalyst may correspond to the
          quantity of the plastic pieces to be treated. For instance,
          nearly 10 kg catalyst is required for treating 10 kg plastic
          pieces per hour, that is, substantially the quantity of the
          plastic pieces to be treated and that of the catalyst
          correspond to each other by 1:1 in weight.<br>
          <br>
          [0074] In other words, with a less quantity of the catalyst,
          the plastic pieces could not completely be decomposed, causing
          non-decomposition oil, while an excessive quantity of the
          catalyst would unfavorably cause a flow resistance to
          increase.<br>
          <br>
          [0075] At the guide pipe 22 serving as a molten plastic gas
          takeout portion of the catalyst cylinder 19 is provided a
          suction unit 23 having a fan 43, by which the vaporized gas is
          sucked to cause a negative pressure so that the vaporized gas
          can smoothly pass through the catalyst cylinder without
          flowing into the residue pipe 18. Thus, this unit is also one
          of the prevention means for preventing the molten plastic gas
          from flowing down to the residue unit R. In addition, as the
          prevention means for preventing the molten plastic gas from
          flowing down to the residue takeout unit R, two or more of the
          above-mentioned prevention means may be selectively combined
          to each other. The combination of the plural prevention means
          enhances the function of preventing the molten plastic gas
          from flowing down to the residue takeout unit R.<br>
          <br>
          [0076] Incidentally, it is required to set a distance L
          between the center of a flow inlet of the catalyst cylinder 19
          and the center of the port of the cylinder valve 17 at least
          35 cm and more. With the distance of 45 cm, the quantity of
          the vaporized gas flowing to the residue pipe 18 decreases
          remarkably. Without the cylinder valve 17 but the residue pipe
          18 is directly connected to the cylindrical body of the
          decomposing unit, the center of the port of the residue pipe
          corresponds to the center of a spiral valve 17.<br>
          <br>
          [0077] The guide pipe 22 is, as shown in FIG. 1, connected to
          a water-cooling condenser 24, which has a water inlet pipe 26
          and a discharge pipe 25. From the condenser 24 extends
          downwardly an oil pipe 27 and the oil liquefied in the
          condenser 24 is stored in an oil tank 28. From the oil tank 28
          extend an off-gas pipe 31 for discharging non-liquefied
          off-gas and an oil pipe 29 for taking-out collected oil, the
          oil pipe 29 having a filter 30.<br>
          <br>
          [0078] Next, a power generation system is described with
          reference to FIG. 3.<br>
          <br>
          [0079] The conversion-to-oil apparatus M1 comprising a melting
          unit 1 for melting and feeding crushed plastic, and a
          decomposing unit 2 for decomposing and vaporizing the molten
          plastic melted by the melting unit 1, wherein the melting unit
          and the decomposing unit, respectively, have lead screws
          rotated by motors 10, 14 and the melting unit and the
          decomposing unit are heated by heaters, respectively, further
          comprises, as shown in FIG. 3, a diesel-powered generator 60
          driven by bubbling-treated oil, which is obtained by
          subjecting the oil produced by the conversion-to-oil apparatus
          M to bubbling treatment for removing gasoline content. The
          electric-driven units such as the heater 62 and the motor 61
          operate by the power from this generator.<br>
          <br>
          [0080] In FIG. 3, the oil pipe 29 is connected to a bubbling
          unit 50 in addition to the filter 30. The collected oil is
          subjected to the bubbling-treatment for removing gasoline
          content by the bubbling unit 50. The collected oil contains
          the mixture of gasoline, kerosene, light oil, and heavy oil.
          As the gasoline (contained in the mixture oil by approximately
          10%) tends to wash away the lubricant of the engine, it needs
          be removed. Therefore, air is fed to the mixture oil to remove
          the gasoline content. The oil treated by the bubbling unit 50
          passes through a line 100 and is fed to a line 101. At the
          line 101, the bubbling-treated oil has its flow quantity
          controlled by a flow control valve 59 and is fed to the
          generator 60. By the generator 60 operate the various motors
          61 and heaters 62 of the conversion-to-oil apparatus M1.<br>
          <br>
          [0081] Further, the generator 60 may be powered by the blend
          oil obtained by blending the oil produced by the conversion-to
          oil apparatus M1 with food oil. Concretely, the oil, instead
          of passing through the bubbling unit 50, filtrated by the
          filter 30 is fed to a blending vessel 51 having a stirrer 52.
          Waste food oil, which is composed of plant oil, is fed from a
          food oil tank 53 to the blending vessel 51, where the waste
          oil and the recovered oil are blended by the ratio of 1:1.
          Thus, when the waste oil is added to the recovered oil (in a
          proportion of 10% or more), action of the gasoline content is
          suppressed so that the blended oil even including the gasoline
          content becomes usable oil.<br>
          <br>
          [0082] Furthermore, the generator 60 may be powered by both
          the off-gas generated during the liquefaction-to-oil of
          plastic and the product oil of the conversion-to-oil apparatus
          M1. Concretely, the generator 60 may operate solely by the
          blended oil, and if the generator 60 employs a dual-fuel
          engine as the diesel engine, both the blended oil and the
          off-gas become usable. Specifically, the gas, including the
          mixture of methane, ethane, propane and others, passes through
          the off-gas pipe 31 to a water-in tank 54. After passing
          through the water-in tank 54, the off-gas is stored in an
          accumulation tank 55, then passes through a flow control valve
          57, which is controlled by a controller 58 (the flow control
          valve 59 is also controlled by the controller 58), and flows
          into the generator 60. The controller (CPU) 58 effectively
          prevents engine knocking by appropriately controlling the
          respective quantities of the blended oil and the off-gas for
          the engine of the generator.<br>
          <br>
          [0083] Next, a controller system for the dual-fuel engine of
          the generator 60 is described in detail with reference to
          FIGS. 4 to 7.<br>
          <br>
          [0084] In FIG. 4, a dual-fuel engine 110 has a piston 111, and
          has a flow-in valve 112 and a discharge valve 113. Between
          both valves is provided an injection nozzle 114, to which the
          blended oil (i.e., the oil having been blended with the
          bubbling-treated oil or food oil) is supplied from an
          injection pump 115. A flow-in pipe 116 connected to the
          flow-in valve 112 is provided with a mixed gas control valve
          117, which controls a quantity of the mixed gas flowed into
          the engine from a mixing unit 118 for mixing the off-gas with
          air. The mixing unit 118 is connected to a gas control valve
          119 mounted to the off-gas pipe 102, and the control valves
          117, 119 and the injection pump 115 are connected to the
          controller (CPU) 58. The mixing unit 118 has a cylindrical
          casing 118a, as shown in FIG. 5, in which an air filter 120 is
          mounted. The air passing through an inlet 121 is guided by
          guide blades 122 to pass through a filter unit 23 and flow to
          the cylinder. On the other hand, the off-gas passes through
          the off-gas pipe 102 and is supplied from an injection pipe
          120a, which is circularly formed around an opening of the
          right end of the air filter 120 and injects the off-gas in a
          circular fashion. By this way, the off-gas and air is suitably
          mixed. Incidentally, the guide blades 122 rotate by the air
          supplied from the inlet 121 to thereby rotate the air filter.
          By this rotation, the off-gas from the off-gas pipe 102 and
          the air from the inlet 121 are uniformly mixed, thereby
          increasing combustion efficiency.<br>
          <br>
          [0085] The water-in tank 54 in FIG. 3 has a rectangular
          cylindrical casing 130, which is partitioned into two rooms by
          a partition plate 131. The lower edge of the partition plate
          31 is positioned at a given height up from the bottom of the
          casing 130 (FIG. 6).<br>
          <br>
          [0086] The left room R1 partitioned by the partition plate 131
          is provided with an atmosphere pipe 132 open to the
          atmosphere, and the lower end of the atmosphere pipe 132 is
          positioned lower than that of the partition plate 131. The
          left room R1 accommodates an end portion of the off-gas pipe
          31 extending from the oil tank 28, and the end portion of the
          off-gas pipe 31 extends close to the bottom of the casing 130
          and to a position lower than that of the lower end of the
          atmosphere pipe 132. The right room R2 partitioned by the
          partition plate 131 accepts an end portion of the line 102 and
          is connected to the accumulation tank 55. In the water-in tank
          54, water is stored up to a level higher than the lower edge
          of the partition plate 131 to form a base level B.L. Now, when
          the pressure in the right room R2 decreases (when the engine
          takes in a large quantity of off-gas), the pressure of the
          right room R2 is lowered than that of the left room R1 so that
          the water level in the left room R1 is lowered to a position
          134, which is lower than the base level B.L, and the water
          level in the light room R2 rises up to an upper position 133.
          Accordingly, the pressure of the left room R1 decreases so
          that the off-gas goes out more easily from the off-gas pipe
          134, while the off-gas is supplied to the right room R2 to
          thereby increase the pressure of the right room R2 so that the
          water level in the right room R2 is lowered and the water
          level in the left room R1 rises. Then, if the respective
          pressures in both rooms increase extraordinarily higher than
          the atmospheric pressure, water is discharged outside through
          the atmosphere pipe 132. Namely, it is possible to determine a
          supply quantity and a consumption quantity of the off-gas by
          detecting the position of either one of the water levels in
          the right room R2 and the left room R1 by means of a level
          meter. Thus detected signals are fed to the controller (FIGS.
          3, 4) mentioned above, and correspondingly the off-gas
          quantity to be supplied to the dual-fuel engine is adjusted.<br>
          <br>
          [0087] As shown in FIG. 7, the off-gas line 102 is provided
          with an on/off safety valve 150 and a flow control valve 151.
          The line 102 terminates at a compressor 154, the compressor
          154 being operated by the power of the generator 60. The
          off-gas compressed by the compressor 154 passes through a flow
          control valve 153 and flows into the accumulation tank 155. In
          the accumulation tank 155 is stored water and in an upper
          space 160 above the water surface is stored the off-gas. When
          the upper space 160 becomes larger (when a larger quantity of
          the off-gas is compressively stored), the water in the
          accumulation tank 155 comes into a water tank 161, which is
          connected to a relief valve 162 through a pipe 163. Before the
          flow control valve 153 is provided a line 164, on which a
          pressure control valve 152 for the off-gas is mounted. If the
          pressure of the compressed off-gas fed from the compressor 154
          exceeds a predetermined value, part of the off-gas passes
          through the valve 152 and returns to the line 102, where the
          returning off-gas joins fresh off-gas flowing through the line
          102 and comes in the compressor 154 again.<br>
          <br>
          [0088] The compressed off-gas fed from the accumulation tank
          155 passes through a maximum flow control valve 156 and the
          control valve 119 mentioned before, which opens or closes,
          depending on a load applied to the engine 110 (FIG. 4) of the
          generator 60, comes in the mixing unit 118, where the off-gas
          is mixed with air, and the mixed gas flows into the engine
          110. Then, the controller 58 controls, as shown in FIG. 4, the
          control valve 119, the mixed gas control valve 117, and the
          fuel injection pump 115 to thereby adjust the respective
          quantities of the mixed gas and the liquid fuel (blend oil) to
          be supplied. According to experiments, it turned out that when
          the proportion of the mixed gas to the liquid fuel is within 7
          to 3, the engine operates normally but if the proportion of
          the mixed gas exceeds the above range, they become out of
          balance, causing engine-knocking. In practical operation of
          the dual-fuel engine, at first the liquid fuel is fed for
          initial rotation of 1500 rpm as a standard control pattern and
          subsequently the off-gas is fed to the engine so that the
          quantity of the liquid fuel injected by the fuel injection
          pump 115 is reduced under the control of the controller CPU 58
          to thereby throttle down the engine.<br>
          <br>
          [0089] The gel-forming unit may preferably be formed in a
          vertically long configuration as shown in FIG. 8 so that the
          apparatus can be constructed in a compact size as a whole.<br>
          <br>
          [0090] Specifically, a motor 201 is mounted on a frame 202 and
          a cylinder 203 is disposed vertically. Plastic pieces are
          obliquely fed from a hopper 204 to a space hole 205 of the
          cylinder 203 and melted. Here, the tip end of a screw 206 in
          the space hole 205 is tapered to form a tapered portion.<br>
          <br>
          [0091] The present invention is most preferably applied to the
          liquefaction of waste plastic, especially polypropylene,
          polyethylene, and polystyrene by using the thermal
          decomposition method. Namely, the waste plastic as industrial
          waste disposals can be effectively utilized, and the off-gas
          generated in the present apparatus can be used as part of the
          power source for the generator, and in particular, in the case
          that the off-gas is used for the dual-fuel engine, the
          liquefied product oil and the off-gas can be utilized to the
          fullest.<br>
          <br>
          [0092] In the conventional apparatus for conversion-to-oil, if
          too much quantity of plastic pieces is fed, or a large
          quantity of PE (polyethylene) with a large melting energy is
          fed to the decomposing unit from the hopper, the rotation of
          the lead screw is obstructed by the viscosity of the molten
          plastic during the melting process unfavorably, which is
          so-called clogging phenomenon. On the other hand, in the
          embodiment of the present invention, the melting unit is
          constructed like an injection molding machine to melt plastic
          pieces into plastic gel by frictional heating and heat from
          heaters and feed the plastic gel to the decomposing unit.
          Thus, the variously mixed plastic pieces can be surely melted
          without clogging the melting unit and the clogging phenomenon
          can be prevented and plastic can be efficiently treated.<br>
          <br>
          [0093] Further, in the case that the catalyst cylinder for
          treating PE is employed, the vaporized gas does not always
          pass through the catalyst cylinder of the decomposing unit but
          partially comes in the residue takeout unit, which could be
          cooled without being completely decomposed. The thus
          non-decomposed oil, which has been liquefied without passing
          through the catalyst cylinder, would be stored in the residue
          tank. On the other hand, the present embodiment is provided
          around the catalyst cylinder of the decomposing unit with
          prevention means (fan for pressure control, valves of the
          residue takeout unit, etc.) for preventing the vaporized gas
          from coming into the residue takeout unit and being liquefied
          into non-decomposed oil. Namely, since the non-decomposed oil
          is prevented from being stored in the residue tank, plastic
          can be treated much more efficiently.<br>
          <br>
          [0094] Furthermore, in the conventional conversion-to-oil
          apparatus, the recovered product oil is usually mixed oil
          including gasoline content, kerosene content, light oil
          content, and heavy oil content, which may be no problem when
          such mixed oil is filtrated to be burned in a waste oil
          boiler. However, when such mixed oil is used for driving the
          diesel engine, the gasoline content tends to cause a burning
          problem or wash away the lubricant of the engine, resulting in
          burning-out of the engine. On the other hand, the
          conversion-to-oil apparatus of the present embodiment is
          provided with a diesel-powered generator, which uses the oil
          obtained by subjecting the produced oil to the bubbling
          treatment for removing gasoline content or blend oil obtained
          by blending the produced oil with food oil. Thus, the
          generator can operate smoothly and efficiently and therefore
          plastic can be efficiently treated. Still furthermore, when a
          dual-fuel engine is employed for the generator, off-gas can be
          utilized as an effective energy and plastic can be treated
          much more efficiently.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Second Embodiment</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0095] Next, a second embodiment of the present invention is
          described with reference to the drawings.<br>
          <br>
          [0096] In FIG. 9, a conversion-to-oil apparatus M2 according
          to the second embodiment comprises a hopper 301, to which
          crushed plastic pieces are fed, the hopper 301 being mounted
          to an end portion of a first melting unit 302 for melting the
          plastic pieces, the other end portion of the first melting
          unit 302 being connected to an end portion of a second melting
          unit 303, which extends perpendicularly to the first melting
          unit 302, the other end portion of the second melting unit
          being connected to a lower end portion of a vaporizing unit
          304 for vaporizing the melted plastic, the vaporizing unit
          extending in a slant direction. Each of the first and second
          melting units 302, 303 and the vaporizing unit 304 has a
          cylindrical body, in which a lead screw is mounted. The
          plastic is continuously fed by the rotations of the lead
          screws. Around the cylinders are wound belt-like heaters h, h
          . . . h, by which respectively the plastic, the molten plastic
          liquid, and the vaporized plastic gas in the cylinders are
          heated. The belt-like heaters h, h . . . h and the cylindrical
          bodies of the first and second melting units 302, 303 and the
          vaporizing unit 304 are covered with thermal insulation
          members i, respectively. At the ends of the cylindrical bodies
          are mounted motors m, m, m, respectively, which are connected
          to the lead screws to rotate each at a predetermined speed.<br>
          <br>
          [0097] At a first connecting portion between the first melting
          unit 302 and the second melting unit 303 is provided a
          vertical connection pipe 305, and at a second connecting
          portion between the second melting unit and the vaporizing
          unit 304 is provided another vertical connection pipe 306.
          Through the connection pipes 305, 306, nitrogen 307, 308 is
          introduced into each of the cylinders for assuring safety (for
          preventing the vaporized gas from burning). Under the hopper
          301 is located a feeding pipe 310, to which a rotary valve 309
          for feeding the plastic in the hopper 301 to the first melting
          unit 302 for every predetermined quantity is mounted.<br>
          <br>
          [0098] The cylindrical body of the melting unit has its
          portion adjacent to the feeding pipe 310 provided with a
          cooling jacket so that the plastic is not melted near the
          hopper. Nitrogen 312 is also fed to the feeding pipe 310.<br>
          <br>
          [0099] Adjacent to an end portion of the vaporizing unit 304
          of the conversion-to-oil apparatus M2 is located a catalyst
          cylinder 313 and concretely, as shown in FIG. 9, the catalyst
          cylinder 313 extends vertically and upwardly from an upside
          end portion of the vaporizing unit 304. In the catalyst
          cylinder 313 is stored a catalyst of zeolite. The catalyst may
          be of synthesis zeolite preferably having an effective fine
          diameter of 9 to 10 mm and having a ratio of 2.5 times SiO2 to
          Al2O3, and of spherical piece having a size of 2.4 to 4.7.
          This catalyst is able to decompose n-paraffin including C3 or
          more and therefore suitable for treating PE.<br>
          <br>
          [0100] At a position more adjacent to the upper end portion of
          the vaporizing unit 304 than the connecting position to the
          catalyst cylinder 313 extends downwardly a residue pipe 314.
          At an intermediate position of the residue pipe 314 is located
          a valve 315 as a rotary valve, which discharges a residue to a
          residue tank 316 located below the valve 315 while maintaining
          the upper space of the residue pipe in a sealed condition.<br>
          <br>
          [0101] Between the first melting unit 302 and the vaporizing
          unit 304 are located two condensers 317, 318. Of them, a first
          condenser 317 is provided for heavier oil, which compresses
          the vaporized gas passing through the catalyst cylinder 313 to
          liquefy it and produces heavier oil while cooling the
          vaporized gas by air. The other condenser, as a second
          condenser 318, compresses the vaporized gas passing through
          the first condenser 317 to liquefy it and produces lighter
          oil, to which cooling water is supplied. The heavier oil has a
          high compression temperature and is therefore sufficient to be
          cooled by air and is covered with a thermal insulation
          material i.<br>
          <br>
          [0102] The heavy oil produced by the first condenser 317 is
          stored in a heavier oil tank 319 and the lighter oil produced
          by the second condenser 318 is stored in a lighter oil tank
          320.<br>
          <br>
          [0103] In FIG. 10, at bearing portions of the lead screws of
          the first and second melting units 302, 303 and the vaporizing
          unit (not shown) are provided cover members 330, 331,
          respectively. To the cover member 330 and the cover member 331
          are connected pipes 332, 333, respectively, both of which 332,
          333 are connected to a collecting pipe 304. At an end of the
          collecting pipe 334 is mounted a fan 335, by which leaking gas
          is discharged outside.<br>
          <br>
          [0104] In FIG. 11, the vaporized gas passing through the
          catalyst cylinder 313 is fed through a pipe 340 and comes in
          the first condenser 317 to be liquefied to be heavier oil,
          which is fed through a pipe 341 and stored in the heavier oil
          tank 319.<br>
          <br>
          [0105] Then, the vaporized gas that has not been liquefied by
          the first condenser 317 passes through a pipe 342 and comes in
          the second condenser 318, while the liquefied lighter oil
          passes through a pipe 343 to be stored in the lighter oil tank
          320. The off-gas that has not been liquefied by the second
          condenser 318 passes through a pipe 395 and comes in both
          tanks 319 and 320. The off-gas, coming out of the tanks 319,
          320, passes through a pipe 349 and flows into water stored in
          a water cylinder 348. The off-gas coming out of the water
          passes through an accumulator 350 and a suction pipe 351 and
          is supplied to a burner 352 to be burned. The burner 352 heats
          a water tank 353 to thereby make hot water. By controlling the
          level H of the water in the water cylinder 348, the pressure
          of the vaporized gas and the pressure in the liquefaction line
          are controlled.<br>
          <br>
          [0106] In FIG. 12, the vaporizing unit 304 is provided with a
          liquid level meter Sm for detecting the level S of the
          liquefied plastic, the liquid level meter Sm including
          nitrogen blow-off ports 360 and 361 arranged distant from each
          other, and a controller 362. The level S of the liquefied
          plastic can be determined by detecting the blow-off pressure
          of nitrogen. According to FIG. 12, since the pressure around
          the blow-off port 360 is higher than that around the blow-off
          port 361, it is determined that the level S is at an
          intermediate position between the blow-off ports 360 and 361.<br>
          <br>
          [0107] As shown in FIG. 13, a thermometer 370 for determining
          a temperature in each of the cylinders of the first and second
          melting units 302, 303 and the vaporizing unit 304 has a
          thermoelectric couple 372 enclosed with a ceramic protection
          member 371 penetrated through a cylinder wall w of each of the
          cylinders. The thermometer is able to detect the temperature
          inside of the cylinder, without detecting the temperature of
          the outer wall of the cylinder owing to the protection member
          371.<br>
          <br>
          [0108] In FIG. 14, the first condenser 317 is supplied with
          air by a fan 381, while at a discharge port 385 for
          discharging the air are mounted a thermometer 383 and a flow
          meter 384, so that if the fan 381 is controlled based on the
          temperature and flow quantity of the discharged air, the
          cooling temperature of the first condenser 317 can be
          controlled to thereby control the quality of the heavier oil.<br>
          <br>
          [0109] Further, in the melting unit 302 is emitted aqueous
          vapor from the plastic being melted, which vapor is fed to the
          first condenser 317 through the pipe 380 so as to control the
          temperature in the condenser 317. The temperature in the first
          condenser 317 may preferably be 200[deg.] C. to 300[deg.] C.,
          in which range the liquefaction to heavier oil is suitably
          achieved.<br>
          <br>
          [0110] Next, another embodiment of the residue pipe is
          described.<br>
          <br>
          [0111] In FIG. 15, adjacent to an end portion of the
          vaporizing unit 304 of the conversion-to-oil apparatus M2 is
          provided a residue pot 391 for receiving the residue and
          heating it. Concretely, the residue pot 391 is located below
          at a position obliquely upward from the connecting portion to
          the catalyst cylinder 313. At the bottom of the residue pot
          391 is provided an open/close lid 393 and around the residue
          pot 391 is provided a heater h, by which the vaporized gas
          coming in the residue pot is heated and goes up to the
          catalyst cylinder 313.<br>
          <br>
          [0112] Even if there remains not-fully vaporized plastic in
          the residue, such plastic is finally vaporized in this residue
          pot and therefore only the pure residue is left in the residue
          pot. After a predetermined quantity of the residue is
          accumulated, the open/close lid 393 is opened to feed the
          residue to the residue tank 392. On the other hand, the
          vaporized gas flowing down to the residue pipe is prevented
          from being liquefied in the residue pipe so that the resultant
          oil would come in the residue tank. In addition, at an inlet
          394 of the residue pot 391 is provided a projecting member
          390, by which the residue is prevented from sticking to the
          peripheral wall of the residue pot.<br>
          <br>
          [0113] Incidentally, in the hopper 7 of the melting unit 1 of
          the first embodiment or the hopper 301 of the first melting
          unit 302 of the second embodiment, if the temperature of the
          lower end portion of the hopper becomes so high, the plastic
          to be fed to the melting unit would be already melted here and
          thus melted plastic would be an obstacle to smooth feeding of
          the plastic. If necessary, it may be preferable to cool the
          periphery of the lower end portion of the hopper 7 or 301 with
          a water jacket. Thus, the plastic can be smoothly fed to the
          melting unit 1 or 302 by the way of cooling.<br>
          <br>
          [0114] The conversion-to-oil apparatus of the present
          invention is particularly used for liquefaction of waste
          plastic and suitable for a small-sized conversion-to-oil
          apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          [0115] As mentioned above, in the conventional apparatus,
          among variously used plastics, PP (polypropylene) and PS
          (polystyrene) are ready to be liquefied but the liquefaction
          of PE (polyethylene) is difficult and liable to cause a
          non-decomposed product like paraffin because of delicate
          control of its liquidity. On the other hand, according to the
          present invention, since the synthesis zeolite composed of
          silicon oxide (SiO2) and alumina (Al2O3) is used, not only PP
          (polypropylene) and PS (polystyrene) but also PE
          (polyethylene) can be completely decomposed. Thus the present
          invention enables efficient liquefaction of plastic.<br>
          <br>
          [0116] Further, as for the case provided with the residue
          pipe, it could sometimes occur that after the molten plastic
          is vaporized, the vaporized gas comes in the residue pipe for
          taking the residue and then the resultant oil coming from the
          residue pipe is left in the residue tank. However, the residue
          pot of the present embodiment enables the residue, even still
          involving the molten plastic, completely to be vaporized,
          namely, enables plastic efficiently to be processed.<br>

          BE SOLVED: To provide a liquefaction plant capable of heating
          plastics speedily, highly precisely and efficiently. ;
          SOLUTION: This liquefaction plant 1 is equipped with a melting
          zone 2 wherein plastics are heated and molten, a decomposition
          zone 3 wherein the plastics molten in the melting zone 2 are
          further heated to cause depolymerization and produce
          decomposition gases, and a liquefaction zone 4 wherein the
          decomposition gases generated in the decomposition zone 3 are
          cooled to produce an oil. The plant is so constructed as to
          employ at least an electric heater 42 as a heating means when
          heating the plastics in the decomposition zone.<br>
