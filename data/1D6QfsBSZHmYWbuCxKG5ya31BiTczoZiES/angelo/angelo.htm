            This invention relates to means for transforming electrical
            energy into electrical energy of a different type, or into
            mechanical energy. The invention refers more particularly to
            electrical machines provided with a stationary or rotary
            pole-armature and to a new method of winding the primary and
            secondary circuits carried by said armature.<br>
            <br>
            An object of the present invention is the provision of
            inexpensive, durable and reliable machines for transforming
            direct or alternating current into a single-phase or
            multi-phase alternating current or direct current of any
            desired voltage.<br>
            <br>
            Another object is the adaptation of a machine provided with
            a pole-armature carrying a primary circuit and a secondary
            circuit for transforming direct current into a direct
            current of any desired voltage.<br>
            <br>
            A further object is the provision of a new method for
            winding the secondary circuit on the pole-armature of a
            machine, said method resulting in an increase in
            electromotive forces developed in the secondary circuit.<br>
            <br>
            The above and other objects of this invention may be
            realized through the provision of a secondary winding
            carried by the pole-armature and having a pitch which is
            different from that of the primary winding; preferably at
            least some of the turns of the secondary winding are wound
            in such a way that each of the last-mentioned turns
            encircles two, three or more poles of the pole armature.<br>
            <br>
            The invention will appear more clearly from the following
            detailed description when taken in connection with the
            accompanying drawings, showing by way of example only, some

          </b><b>The motor-generator illustrated in Figures I to V of
            the drawings is used for transforming direct current into a
            two-phase alternating current;</b> it consists of a
          stationary armature, or stator, having eight long and narrow
          poles and a rotor provided with four poles. Obviously, the
          number of poles may be varied at will. The stationary
          pole-armature is formed of insulated sheets 20 of soft iron,
          as shown in Figure III. The sheets 20 are carried by bolts 21
          (Fig.II) passing through holes 1 (Fig.III). The stator is
          assembled in the usual manner. The space 3 between two
          adjacent stator poles 23 (Fig.III) should be wide enough to
          permit the insertion of the windings of the primary circuit 8
          and of the secondary circuit 4.<br>
          <br>
          The rotor 17 of the <b>motor-generator </b>is illustrated in<b>
            Figures I and II </b>of the drawings, and is provided with
          four poles 16. The rotor 17 is mounted on a shaft 18 and is
          rotatable along with this shaft. A pair of insulated
          slip-rings 14 are also mounted on the shaft 18, and rotate
          together with this shaft. The slip-rings 14 are rotatably
          connected at b with the pole winding 7 of the rotor 17. In the
          modification illustrated in the drawings, the pole windings 7
          of the rotor 17 are connected in parallel with the primary
          windings 6 of the stator. Obviously, the windings 6 and 7 may
          be connected to different sources of energy or interconnected
          in series or in compound.<br>
          <br>
          A source 22 of direct current shown diagrammatically in Figure
          I is connected by conductors 11 with a pair of stationary
          brushes 15, which press against the two rotary slip-rings 14.
          Thus an electrical current is sent from the source 22 to the
          pole windings 7 of the rotor, so that the poles 16 become
          magnetized, and produce a magnetic field, the lines of which
          pass through the primary circuit 6 and the secondary circuit 4
          of the stator.<br>
          <br>
          A stationary commutator 9 surrounds the shaft 18 and is
          provided with a number of conducting segments, which are
          insulated from each other. A rotary brush carrier 19 is
          rigidly mounted on the shaft 18 and is rotatable along with
          said shaft. The brush carrier 19 is provided with a plurality
          of revolving brushes 12, which bear against the segments of
          the stationary commutator 9. The brushes 12 are connected at a
          with the slip-rings 13. Stationary brushes 10, the ends of
          which press against the stationary slip-rings 13, are
          connected with the source 22 of direct current by conductors
          2.<br>
          <br>
          The direct current is thus sent from the source 22 through the
          conductors 2 and the stationary brushes 10 into the revolving
          slip-rings 13. From the slip-rings 13 the current passes
          through conductors a and the revolving brushes 12 into the
          stationary commutator 9. Conductors 8 connect the stationary
          commutator 9 with the primary windings 5 of the stator.<br>
          <br>
          As shown more clearly in <b>Figure IV of the drawings, the
            primary windings, or the primary circuit 6, carried by the
            poles 23 of the stator consists of a number of coils 24,
            which are situated one above the other and at a certain
            distance from each other. Each coil 24 has two ends 8
            connected to separate segments of the commutator 9.</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>The primary circuit 6 is wound in the following manner:</b><br>
          <br>
          One end of a coil 24 is joined to a segment of the commutator
          9. The other end of the same coil 24 is joined to an adjacent
          segment of the commutator 9. An end of an adjacent coil, which
          coil is situated either immediately below or above the
          first-mentioned coil on the same pole, is joined to the same
          segment, to which the nearest end of the first-mentioned coil
          is connected. This arrangement is repeated until the winding
          of the primary circuit 6 is completed. Segments of the
          commutator 9 which are connected with coils carried by one
          pole, are situated at a predetermined distance from
          corresponding segments connected with the coils carried by an
          adjacent pole, said<b> distance being proportional to the
            angle between these two pole</b>s. After the winding of one
          pole has been completed, the end of the first coil of the
          adjacent pole is connected with that segment, which is also
          connected with the nearest end of one the coils carried by the
          first-mentioned pole. Thus all the coils 24 carried by the
          pole 23 are interconnected in series. <b>Due to this
            arrangement a great part of the effects of self-induction is
            avoided and sparking is eliminated to a remarkable extent.</b><br>
          <br>
          The coils 24 are wound in such a manner that groups of poles
          are formed, which have the same sign. In the modification
          illustrated in <b>Figure IV,</b> two adjacent poles have the
          same sign, but the next two poles have the opposite sign. The
          poles 23 of the stator are thus divided into pairs of poles,
          each pair having a different sign from that of the adjacent
          pair. The direction of the current flowing through the primary
          winding 6 is illustrated by arrows in Figure IV. The magnetic
          poles 23 attract the adjacent poles 16 of the rotor 17 thus
          causing a rotation of the rotor 17. Since the brush carrier 10
          and the slip-rings 13 and 14 are rigidly mounted on the shaft
          18, they will rotate along with said shaft, so that the
          brushes 12 will rotate along with the rotor 17 and will slide
          with respect to the stationary commutator 9. While the brushes
          12 pass by the segmants of the commutator, they will reverse
          the polarity of the poles 23 of the stationary armature. Due
          to this arrangement the rotor 17 and the field of the
          stationary armature will revolve with a predetermined speed.<br>
          <br>
          The arrangement of the windings of the secondary circuit 4 is
          diagrammatically illustrated in <b>Figure V</b> of the
          drawings. As shown in that figure,<b> the pitch of the
            secondary windings is much greater than the pitch of the
            primary windings. The secondaty circuit 4 consists of
            windings divided onto a plurality of coils, the turns of
            which encircle or surround two of the poles 23. In the
            illustrated modification the winding is wound twice around a
            pair of poles.</b> Each turn of a coil surrounds both poles,
          and an adjacent pair of poles is surrounded by another turn of
          the same winding. Since a two-phase alternating current is
          required at the secondary side of the machine, the secondary
          circuit 4 consists of two separate windings, one winding being
          situated at a distance of one pole from the other winding. The
          windings of the primary circuit 6, which is connected by
          conductors 8 with the stationary commutator 9, have a smaller
          pitch than that of the secondary windings, since the coils of
          the primary circuit 6 surround each pole 23.<br>
          <br>
          While the magnetic field of the rotor 17 is revolving, the
          lines of forces of that field cut the windings of the
          secondary circuit 4 with the results that an electromotive
          force is produced in the secondary circuit 4. Another
          electromotive force is created in the secondary circuit 4 by
          the revolving magnetic field of the stator. The total
          electromotive force induced in the secondary circuit 4 is thus
          created firstly by the changing of the signs of the poles 23
          of the stationary armature, and secondly, by the revolving
          magnetic field of the poles 16 of the rotor 17.<br>
          <br>
          Since each turn of the secondary winding 4 encircles two poles
          23 of the stationary armature, and since these windings fill
          in the space 3 between the poles 23, one coil of the secondary
          winding 4 is subjected to four variations of the magnetic flux
          in one half cycle. This is due to the fact that the poles,
          which are encircled by the coils of the secondary circuit 4,
          form a pair, the polarity of which is reversed twice during
          one-half cycle: once the sign of one of the poles, forming the
          pair is reversed, and the second time the sign of the other
          pole of the pair is reversed. Consequently, the entire
          electromotive force caused by the continuous changing of the
          signs of the poles 23 of the armature, is induced four times
          in each coil of the secondary circuit 4 during one complete
          revolution of the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure Va </b>illustrate diagrammatically the changes in
          the electromotive forces induced in the motor-generator
          illustrated in Figures I to V of the drawings. The
          electromotive force induced by the magnetic field of the rotor
          is represented by the outer circle: the magnetic flux varies
          between a positive maximum value and a negative maximum value.
          The values of the electromotive force created by the changes
          of sign of two poles encircled by a turn of the secondary
          winding, are represented in Figure Va by four inner circles.
          It should be noted that the last-mentioned electromotive force
          is changed twice to a positive value and twice to a negative
          value.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure Vb </b>is a diagram of the electromotive forces,
          showing changes of the values thereof in the course of one
          revolution of the rotor. The broken curve 26 represents the
          electromotive force or voltage developed in the primary
          circuit 6. The electromotive force induced by the magnetic
          field of the rotor 17 in the secondary circuit 4 is
          represented by a sinusoidal curve 27.<br>
          <br>
          The curve 27 would have represented the entire electromotive
          force if the machine had no primary circuit 6 at all, so that
          it would operate only as a dynamo. However, due to the fact
          that the poles 23 of the stator produce a revolving magnetic
          field, another electromotive force is developed within the
          secondary circuit 4, which is represented by the curve 28 in
          Figure Vb. As illustrated in that Figure, the values of the
          electromotive force represented by the curve 28 vary from zero
          to a maximum value, then to zero, then again to the maximum
          and then again to zero, while the values of the electromotive
          force represented by the curve 27 vary once, from zero to a
          maximum and then again to zero.<br>
          <br>
          <b>These curves illustrate that the electromotive force
            induced by the changing of the signs of the poles 23 of the
            stationary armature is not reversed in the course of
            one-half cycle. This is caused by the fact that one and the
            same turn of the secondary winding is subjected to another
            inductive action during the same half-cycle, due to the
            change of the sign of the second pole of the pair of poles
            encircled by the turn: this sign is changed at a time when
            the electromotive force induced by the first pole is
            reversed. The combined inductive action caused by the
            reversal of the signs of the poles 23 is represented by the
            curve 28 illustrated in Figure Vb.</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>Due to this feature, the induced electromotive force
            developed in the secondary circuit is greater than that of
            the primary circuit, although the secondary circuit has a
            smaller number of conductors and turns. Another reason for
            the increase in voltage is that the pitch of the primary
            winding is much shorter than the pitch of the secondary
            winding. In order to enable the primary winding to develop
            its normal counter-electromotive force, the rotor will make
            more revolution than would have to be made if a full-pitch
            winding were used, provided that the machine runs on direct
            current. A quickly rotating rotor will cut more lines of
            force and this will contribute to the increase of the
            voltage in the secondary winding. Obviously, if the machine
            runs on alternating current, the magnetic field must be
            strangthened in order to develop its normal
            counter-electromotive force, and this will contribute to the
            increase of the secondary voltage.</b><br>
          <br>
          The diagram illustrated in <b>Figure Vc</b> of the drawings,
          is based on the generally known principles that the average
          voltage is proportional to the sine of the angle, through
          which the coil has turned from the position in which it lay
          across the field, and that the total amount of voltage is
          proportional to the rectangular area, which is equal to the
          sum of the areas limited by the sinuous curves, the total
          amount of voltage being therefore proportional to the average
          height of the points along that curve.<br>
          <br>
          In Figure Vc the line a' b' represents the average voltage of
          the direct current flowing in the primary circuit 6. The
          rectangular area a' l d e is equal to the area limited by the
          positive portion of the curve 27 representing the positive
          electromotive force induced by the magnetic field of the rotor
          17. The rectangular area <i><b>a' c h d</b></i> is the sum of
          the areas limited by the positive portion of the curve 28,
          representing the positive electromotive forces induced through
          the changing of the sign of a pair of stator poles 23
          encircled by turns of the secondary winding.<br>
          <br>
          The rectangular area <b><i>l c h e</i></b> is the sum of the
          above-mentioned two areas. Consequently, the line c l
          represents the average positive electromotive force.<br>
          <br>
          In the same manner, the area <i><b>l b' g f </b></i>is equal
          to the area limited by the negative portion of the curve 27
          representing the negative electromotive force induced by the
          rotor 17. the area b' d i g is the sum of the areas limited by
          the curve 28 representing the negative electromotive force
          induced by the change of the sign of a pair of poles 23. The
          area<b><i> l d i f</i></b> is the sum of the two-above areas,
          and the line l d represents the average negative electromotive
          force. The line<i><b> c d</b></i> is, therefore, proportional
          to the difference of potentials of a phase current generated
          during one cycle.<br>
          <br>
          Assuming that both the primary and secondary circuits have an
          equal number of turns and neglecting the energy losses in the
          armature, the average increase in the voltage of the secondary
          circuit as compared to the voltage of the primary circuit, is
          given by substrating the line <i><b>a' b'</b></i> from the
          line <i><b>c d.</b></i> Since the windings of the secondary
          circuit 4 for all phases are exactly alike, a similar current
          will be generated in each phase winding; and since the two
          systems of windings are placed one-half cycle apart from each
          other, the generated current will be the usual two-phase
          current.<br>
          <br>
          If a single-phase alternating current is desired, the second
          phase may be left open; it is also possible to connect the two
          phase windings in series.<br>
          <br>
          The direction of the current flowing in the primary and
          secondary circuits is illustrated by arrows in <b>Figure V</b>
          of the drawings. It will be noted that at a certain time, the
          conductors carrying the current of one phase will have no
          demagnetizing effect on the poles of the armature. This takes
          place when the induced current flows between adjacent poles
          having the same polarity. This effect with those already
          described increases the efficiency of the described
          motor-generator.<br>
          <br>
          The efficiency of the motor-generator may be further increased
          by increasing the length of the armature, since the
          counter-electromotive force is produced mainly by
          self-induction, and self-induction is proportional to the
          square of the number of turns.<br>
          <br>
          The device illustrated in <b>Figure I to V</b> is used for t<b>ransforming




            direct current into a two-phase alternating current.</b> <br>
          <br>
          The modifications shown in <b>Figures VI and VII</b> of the
          drawings illustrate a <b>motor-generator transforming direct
            current into a direct current of a different voltage and
            amperage. </b>For that purpose <b>two different stationary
            commutators are used, one of which sends the incoming
            current into the primary winding of the stationary armature.
            The second commutator is connected with the secondary
            winding and is used for collecting the secondary current.</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure VI i</b>llustrates diagrammatically the windings of
          a machine used for the production of a <b>direct current of a
            low voltage</b>; it comprises a stationary armature having
          poles 32, carrying the primary circuit 33 and the secondary
          circuit 34. The rotor is diagrammatically represented by the
          rotary poles 29. The direct current is supplied by a source of
          energy not shown in the drawings, and flows through stationary
          brushes 39, which are pressed against rotary slip-rings 38.
          The slip-rings 38 are rigidly mounted on the rotor shaft,
          which is not shown in the drawings. The rotary slip-rings 38
          are connected by conductors 37 with the rotary brushes 35
          pressing against the segments of the stationary commutator 36.
          The ends of the primary circuit 33 are connected with the
          segments of the stationary commutator 36.<br>
          <br>
          The<b> primary circuit 33</b> is wound in the following
          manner:<br>
          <br>
          <b>The two ends of a coil surrounding one pole 32, are
            connected to adjacent segments. An adjacent end of a coil
            wound around the nearest pole is connected to the same
            segment, to which the nearest end of the coil carried by the
            first-mentioned pole is connected. This arrangement is
            repeated, so that the coils carried by the poles 32 and
            forming the primary circuit 33, are interconnected in
            series.</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>The secondary circuit 34 is wound in the following
            manner:</b><b><br>
          </b><b><br>
          </b><b>One end of a wire is connected to a segment of a second
            stationary commutator 30. Then the wire is led around two
            poles back to the commutator 30 and is connected to the
            adjacent segment of that commutator. Another wire is
            connected to the second-mentioned segment of the commutator
            30, and is again led around two poles. It will be noted that
            each turn of the secondary winding encircles two poles 32.
            However, each turn is situated at a distance equal to one
            pole from the adjacent turn. Due to this arrangement the
            beginning of one turn and the end of another turn are passed
            along two sides of the same pole.</b><b><br>
          </b><br>
          Rotary brushes 40 press against the segments of the stationary
          commutator 30 and are connected by conductors 41 with the
          rotary slip-rings 42. Stationary brushes 48 press against
          rotary slip-rings 42, and are used for collecting the
          secondary current.The device illustrated in <b>Figure VI is
            used for producing a direct current having a low voltage</b>.
          The device illustrated in Figure VII may be used when the
          secondary direct current should have a higher voltage. The
          same parts are indicated by the same numerals in the figures.<br>
          <br>
          It will be noted that the secondary circuit 44 shown in Figure
          VI is wound in such a way that<b> each turn or coil
            surrounding a pair of adjacent poles is connected to two
            adjacent segments of the commutator 30. This done, because
            if the voltage is small the self-induction will not have a
            serious disturbing effect during the commutation of the
            current.</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure VII</b> shows diagrammatically the system of <b>secondary




            windings for generating a </b><b>high voltage direct
            current</b>. To prevent sparking, the commutator 46 is
          divided into a large number of segments. The secondary circuit
          44, consists of a number of windings surrounding a pair of
          adjacent poles, each winding being subdivided into a plurality
          of separate turns, the turns of the same windings surrounding
          the same pair of poles. As shown in Figure VII the adjacent
          ends 45 of the turns forming one winding, are <b>connected to
            separate adjacent segments of the commutator</b> 46. If, for
          instance, a winding surrounding two adjacent poles consists of
          three separate turns, then one turn of that winding is
          connected to the first and third segments of the commutator
          46. The second turn of the same winding is then connected to
          the second and fourth segments of the commutator 46. The third
          turn of the same winding is connected to the third and fifth
          segments of the commutator 46.<br>
          <br>
          This arrangement is repeated until all the turns of the
          secondary winding are connected with the commutator 46. The
          machine operates in substantially the same manner as that
          illustrated in Figure VI.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure VIII</b> illustrates an arrangement used when a
          series-wound field is desired. The rotor of a machine is
          provided with a number of poles 47 having a pole-winding 48.
          The shaft of the rotor, which is not shown in the drawings,
          carries a pair of slip-rings 49 and 50, which are rotatable
          along with this shaft. The machine is also provided with two
          rotary brushes 51 and 52. The rotary brush 61 is electrically
          connected with the slip-ring 49, while the rotary brush 52 is
          electrically connected with the end 53 of the rotor-pole
          winding 48. The other end 54 of the rotor-pole winding 48 is
          connected with the rotary slip-ring 50. Stationary brushes 55
          press against the slip-rings 49 and 50.<br>
          <br>
          The stationary armature comprises a number of poles 57
          carrying the primary circuit 56, which consists of a number of
          coils, each one of which surrounds a separate pole 57. The
          adjacent ends of two adjacent coils are connected to the same
          segment of a commutator 95. The secondary circuit 58 consists
          of two phase-windings, each one of which comprise a number of
          turns encircling adjacent poles 57. One turn, surrounding a
          pair of poles forms a continuation of another turn surrounding
          a pair of adjacent poles. It will be noted that the
          pole-winding 48 of the rotor 47 is connected in series with
          the pole-winding 56 of the stator.<br>
          <br>
          It is obvious that a <b>compound winding</b> may also be used
          by <b>combining this winding in series with the winding</b><b>
            in parallel </b>described in connection with the machine
          illustrated in <b>Figures I to V</b> of the drawings.<br>
          <br>
          This machine may be used as an<b> ordinary electric motor,
            irrespective as to whether the windings creating the
            magnetic field are excited separately or are wound in
            parallel, or in series, or are compound wound. To use the
            machine as a motor, the secondary circuit may be left open,
            or it may be omitted altogether. The torque of this motor is
            due to the magnetic pull between the poles of the stator and
            the poles of the rotor.</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure IX</b> illustrates a <b>rotary transformer used for
            transforming a two-phase alternating current into a direct
            current.</b> The pole winding 58, which transmits the
          primary alternating current, is carried by the poles 60 of the
          stationary armature; two coils carried by separate poles are
          connected with each other and the ends of these coils are
          joined to a source of current not shown in the drawings. The
          coils are wound in uniform layers, each coil having the same
          number of turns. One coil carried by one of the poles 60 is
          connected with another coil carried by a pole which is
          situated at a distance of one-half cycle from the
          first-mentioned pole.<br>
          <br>
          The secondary winding 61 consists of turns, each one of which
          encircles two adjacent poles. The turns are connected to
          segments of a commutator 62, in such a way that all turns
          appear to be interconnected in series. Rotary brushes 65 are
          connected with rotary slip-rings 64 carried by the rotor
          shaft, which is not shown in the drawings. Stationary brushes
          63 press against the slip-rings 64 and collect the direct
          current passing through these slip-rings.<br>
          <br>
          The primary alternating current creates a revolving magnetic
          field, which will attract or repulse the poles 96 of the
          rotor, so that the rotor will be caused to rotate. The rotary
          field of the stationary armature and the magnetic of the rotor
          will produce an electromotive force in the secondary circuit
          with the result that an alternating current will flow through
          these windings and will be transformed into a direct current
          by the commutator 62.<br>
          <br>
          Due to this arrangement <b>alternating current of a very high
            voltage, for instance 12,000 volts, may be transformed into
            direct current of a very low voltage, for instance 25 volts,
            without the necessity of using any auxiliary devices.</b><br>
          <br>
          The machine illustrated in Figure IX may be used as a
          synchronous alternating current motor. This is accomplished by
          leaving the secondary circuit open, or by omitting the
          secondary circuit altogether.<br>
          <br>
          Instead of providing a stationary armature and a rotating
          magnetic field, it is obviously possible to construct a<b>
            rotary armature and stationary magnets</b>. This arrangement
          is illustrated in modifications described in <b>Figures X to
            XIV.</b><br>
          <br>
          <b>Figures X and XI</b> show a motor-generator provided with a
          rotating armature carrying the primary and secondary circuits
          and used for generating a three phase alternating current. The
          stator 66 is provided with four elongated poles 97 carrying a
          pole winding 68. The rotor carries twelve long and narrow
          poles 67 provided with a pole winding 69. The winding 69 is
          arranged in such a manner that the twelve poles 67 of the
          rotor are divided into groups of three poles each, poles of
          the same group having the same sign, although this sign is
          different from that of the poles of the adjacent groups.<br>
          <br>
          Obviously, the number of the poles of the stator and the rotor
          may be varied at will.<br>
          <br>
          A commutator 70, consisting of a number of segments, is
          mounted on the shaft of the rotor and is rotated along with
          that shaft. The pole winding 68 of the stator poles 97 may be
          excited separately or may be interconnected in any suitable
          manner. The primary circuit 69 carried by the rotor poles 67
          is connected with the segments of the rotary commutator 70
          (Fig. XI).<br>
          <br>
          The end of each coil, carried by a separate pole 67, is
          connected to the same segment, to which the adjacent end of
          the coil carried by the adjacent pole is connected. The
          winding of the primary circuit 69 is substantially the same as
          that of the machine illustrated in Figures I to V of the
          drawings.<br>
          <br>
          The direct current is supplied by a source of energy not shown
          in the drawings. The stationary brushes 71, press against the
          segments of the rotary commutator 70. The current flowing
          through the rotor-pole winding or primary winding 69, creates
          a magnetic field, which will cut the lines of the magnetic
          field created by the poles 97 of the stator. The resulting
          repulsion or attraction will cause the rotation of the
          armature.<br>
          <br>
          The polarity of the poles 67 of the rotor will be reversed
          when the stationary brushes 71 will come in contact with other
          segments of the commutator 70. Thus the rotor will be driven
          steadily and continuously by the magnetic forces.<br>
          <br>
          The secondary circuit, carried by the rotor consists of three
          separate windings 72, 73, and 74. In the course of the
          rotation of the rotor, these windings will cut the lines of
          the magnetic field created by the stationary poles 97, with
          the result that an electromotive force will be induced in
          these windings. The electromotive force will be increased by
          other electromotive forces caused by the continuous changing
          of the polarity of the poles 67 of the armature.<br>
          <br>
          Since the windings of the secondary circuit consist of three
          groups situated at a distance of one third of a cycle from
          each other, the current flowing through them will be the usual
          three-phase alternating current. The three-phase windings 72,
          73, and 74 may be joined at 76, to form a star-connection. The
          current flowing through the secondary circuit is collected by
          stationary brushes 98 pressing against the rotating slip-rings
          75 ( <b>Fig.X </b>), which are mounted on the shaft of the
          rotor. As shown in Figure XI, each secondary winding is formed
          by passing a wire twice around a group of three poles 67 and
          then winding it twice around the adjacent group of three
          poles. Obviously each phase winding may consist of any desired
          number of turns.<br>
          <br>
          The electromotive forces induced in the secondary circuit are
          substantially similar to those developed in the secondary
          circuit of the machine illustrated in Figure I to V of the
          drawings. The two electromotive forces produced by the
          magnetic field of the rotor 66 and by reversing the polarity
          of the rotor poles 67 are added to each other. In this machine
          also there is a time, during which the electric current
          flowing through the secondary circuit will have no
          demagnetizing effect on the pole winding 69. This occurs when
          the secondary current is flowing between poles having the same
          polarity as shown by arrows in<b> Figure XI.</b><br>
          <br>
          Figure XII showa a modified form of the machine illustrated in
          <b>Figure X and XI</b> of the drawings. The machine shown in <b>FIgure




            XII may be used for transforming a direct current into
            another direct current of any desired voltage and amperage.</b>
          The direct current on the primary side is supplied by a source
          of energy not shown in the drawings, to a pair of stationary
          brushes 80. The brushes 80 are in contact with the segments of
          a rotary commutator 81. The revolving armature of this machine
          is provided with a number of poles 83 carrying a pole winding
          82. The pole winding 82 is divided into a number of coils,
          each coil being carried by a separate pole 83. The end of each
          coil is connected to that segment of the commutator 81, to
          which the adjacent end of the coil carried by the adjacent
          pole is connected. Due to this arrangement, the various coils
          forming the primary circuit 82 are connected in series with
          each other.<br>
          <br>
          The secondary circuit 78 consists of a number of windings
          joined to the segments of another revolving commutator 79. In
          the modification illustrated in<b> Figure XII</b>, <b>each
            turn of the secondary winding encircles three poles</b> 83.
          One end of a turn is connected to one segment of the
          commutator 79, while the other end of the same turn is
          connected to the second-mentioned segment of the commutator
          79, while the other end of that turn is connected to the third
          segment of the commutator. Stationary brushes 98 press against
          the segments of the commutator 79 and are used for collecting
          the secondary current. The stationary magnetic field is
          indicated diagrammatically by the two poles 99.<br>
          <br>
          The machine illustrated in <b>Figure XIII is used for
            generating a current of a high voltage</b>. This machine is
          somewhat similar to that shown in Figure XII, the main
          difference consisting in the use of a secondary circuit 84
          wound in a different way, and in the provision of a rotary
          commutator 85 having a large number of segments. The secondary
          circuit 84 consists of a large number of segments. The
          secondary circuit 84 consists of a large number of separate
          windings, each turn of a winding encircling a group of three
          poles, is joined to one segment of the commutator 85, while
          the other end of the same turn is joined to the adjacent
          segment of the commutator 85, while the other end of the same
          turn is joined to the adjacent segment of the commutator 85.
          The adjacent end of a second turn is joined to the
          second-mentioned segment of the commutator 85 and then the
          wire is wound around the same poles around which the
          first-mentioned turn was wound. The other end of the
          second-mentioned turn is joined to the third segment of the
          commutator 85. The next two turns are wound around a group of
          three poles, two of which are the poles belonging to the
          first-mentioned group.<br>
          <br>
          The machine operates in substantially the same manner as that
          illustrated in figure XII. The direct current of the primary
          circuit passes through stationary brushes 80 and through the
          rotary commutator 81 into the pole winding 82. Due to the
          rotation of the commutator 81, the direction of the current
          will be reversed in the course of the rotation of the
          armature, with the result that an electromotive force will be
          induced in the secondary circuit 84. The magnetic field
          created by the stationary poles 99 will produce another
          electromotive force in the secondary circuit 84, and the two
          electromotive forces will be added to each other. The
          secondary current will be collected from the commutator 85 by
          the stationary brushes 98.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure XIV</b> shows a secondary circuit 87 consisting of
          windings encircling<b> groups of four poles.</b> After one end
          of a turn has been joined to a segment of the commutator 79,
          the wire is passed around four poles and the other end of this
          turn is joined to the adjacent segment of the commutator 79.
          The end of the next turn is joined to the third segment of the
          commutator 79. Then this wire is passed around four poles,
          three of which were surrounded by the first-mentioned turn,
          and the other end of the second-mentioned turn is joined to
          the fourth segment of the commutator 79.<br>
          <br>
          The primary direct current is supplied from a source of energy
          not shown in the drawings to stationary brushes 80, which
          press against the rotary commutator 81. The current passes
          through the primary winding 83 and the direction of the
          current is reversed in the course of rotation of the
          commutator 81. The secondary current is induced in the
          secondary circuit 87 by the stationary magnetic field 99 and
          the continuous reversal of the signs of the poles 86. The
          secondary current is collected by the brushes 98 pressing
          against the segments of the rotary commutator 79.<br>
          <br>
          The above-described machine may be used as an ordinary motor
          by leaving open the secondary circuit, or by omitting this
          secondary circuit altogether.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Figure XV</b> shows diagrammatically a stationary
          transformer constructed in accordance with the principles of
          this invention and used for<b> transforming a two-phase
            alternating current.</b> This transformer is formed of
          insulated soft-iron sheets 88 provided with concentric
          projections or poles 89, which project towards the center of
          the device. The primary circuit 90 is formed of a plurality of
          uniform layers of conductors wound on each of the poles 89 and
          connected in such a way that one end 91 of a coil is connected
          with the end of a coil carried by a pole situated in the
          opposite quadrant. The space between the poles 89 is filled by
          a central part 92, which consists of laminated iron and which
          fits snugly between the ends of the poles 89.<br>
          <br>
          The secondary circuit consists of two separate windings 93 and
          94, each of said windings encircling two poles of the
          transformer. The end 95 of one winding is connected with the
          end of a winding situated on the opposite side of the
          transformer.<br>
          <br>
          <b>Due to this arrangement, each of the secondary windings is
            subjected to the variations of the magnetic flux produced by
            the two-phase alternating current supplied to the primary
            winding 90. Each winding is subjected to two inductive
            actions of the phases. Consequently, there are four
            inductions for each winding in one cycle. The efficiency of
            this transformer is quite high, and this is caused
            particularly by the joint effect of the overlapping
            electromotive forces.</b><br>
