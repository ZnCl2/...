          Right In Your Mouth</b><br>

      Dr. Jeremy Mao has unveiled a technique that directs the body's
      stem cells into a scaffolding that will aid in the regeneration of
      a new tooth.<br>
      <br>
      The loss of a tooth is a minor deformity and a major pain.
      Although dental implants are available, the healing process can
      take months on end, and implants that fail to align with the
      ever-growing jawbone tend to fall out. If only adult teeth could
      be regenerated, right?<br>
      <br>
      According to a study published in the latest Journal of Dental
      Research, a new tissue regeneration technique may allow people to
      simply regrow a new set of pearly whites.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Jeremy Mao, the Edward V. Zegarelli Professor of Dental
      Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, has unveiled a
      growth factor-infused, three-dimensional scaffold with the
      potential to regenerate an anatomically correct tooth in just nine
      weeks from implantation. By using a procedure developed in the
      university's Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine
      Laboratory, Dr. Mao can direct the body's own stem cells toward
      the scaffold, which is made of natural materials. Once the stem
      cells have colonized the scaffold, a tooth can grow in the socket
      and then merge with the surrounding tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Mao's technique not only eliminates the need to grow teeth in
      a Petri dish, but it is the first to achieve regeneration of
      anatomically correct teeth by using the body's own resources.
      Factor in the faster recovery time and the comparatively natural
      process of regrowth (as opposed to implantation), and you have a
      massively appealing dental treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Columbia University has already filed patent applications in
      regard to the technology and is seeking associates to aid in its
      commercialization. In the meantime, Dr. Mao is considering the
      best approach for applying his technique to cost-effective
      clinical therapies.<br>

      <b> </b><br>
      Research has proven that dental stem cells hold potential for the
      successful regeneration of dental and other body tissues. In May,
      experts from around the globe gathered in New York for the first
      time to discuss the latest concepts and scientific breakthroughs
      at the International Conference on Dental and Craniofacial Stem
      Cells. Dental Tribune Group Editor Daniel Zimmermann spoke with
      Columbia University professor and co-organiser Dr Jeremy Mao about
      the conference and when the first clinical applications might be
      available for dentists.<br>
      <br>
      Daniel Zimmermann: Dr Mao, re-growing teeth or parts of it could
      mean an end to dentistry as we know it. When will this concept
      become reality?<br>
      Dr Jeremy Mao: Research in the area of dental tissue regeneration
      and engineering is developing rapidly. Different parts of the
      tooth like the dental pulp, dentine and cementum have been already
      successfully regenerated in animal models. These techniques are
      not ready for clinical use yet but they will be available in a few
      years from now, depending on approval by regulatory agencies like
      the Food and Drug Administration in the US. Science is only one
      part of this process.<br>
      <br>
      In contrast with embryonic stem cell research, there is little
      controversy regarding dental stem cells. Why is that?<br>
      <br>
      This is true. There is not much ethical discussion because unlike
      embryonic stem cells, which can only be obtained by destroying the
      fertilised embryo, dental stem cells are harvested from what
      clinicians refer to as “dental waste” such as extracted teeth or
      teeth that have fallen out.<br>
      <br>
      What fields of dentistry will probably benefit most from this
      research?<br>
      <br>
      Theoretically, there seems to be no limit to what tissue we can
      regenerate, so you can expect the whole range of dentistry fields
      to benefit from these techniques. It is only a matter of time
      until we have learned enough about these cells to be able to use
      them to regenerate all kinds of tissues.<br>
      <br>
      Can dental stem cells be used for medical applications as well?<br>
      <br>
      Very likely. Earlier this year, for example, we published an
      article that demonstrated that clones of mononucleated stem cells
      of dental pulp can transform into myoblasts and help with the
      formation of muscle tissue. This, and other research, suggests
      that dental stem cells can be used to treat not only dental
      diseases, but also other medical conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Is there collaboration between scientists that work with dental
      and medical stem cells?<br>
      <br>
      To some degree, but not to the extent that we would like. Let me
      give you an example. Two years ago, I attended a conference
      organised by the International Society for Stem Cell Research in
      Barcelona in Spain, and there was not one single presentation on
      dental stem cells. Realising that this was an understudied area,
      the idea of an international conference on dental and craniofacial
      stem cell research was born. With it, we also hope to promote
      collaboration between scientists working in these areas.<br>
      <br>
      How did the congress in New York turn out, in general?<br>
      <br>
      Looking back, it was quite an intense conference. We had over 200
      attendees and 30 presentations over the course of three days. The
      feedback was extremely positive and there are already plans for a
      second conference. However, we have not decided on a location yet.<br>
      <br>
      Which regions or countries are currently leading in dental stem
      cell research?<br>
      <br>
      As far as research is concerned, people tend to look at the US
      first but as the conference has shown, there are quite a number of
      researchers in Europe and Asia working on dental and craniofacial
      stem cell research, including some countries where you would not
      expect such research to be conducted, like Malaysia.<br>
      <br>
      Stem cell tissue regeneration will obviously have a significant
      impact on dental practice. Do you expect dentists to be open to
      this concept?<br>
      <br>
      I think, as dental professionals we are quite used to new
      inventions and innovations. I have had the opportunity to lecture
      to various members of the profession, such as oral surgeons and
      paediatric dentists, and with a few exceptions they were quite
      enthusiastic about the potential of dental stem cells for tissue
      regeneration and engineering. In acknowledging that regenerative
      endodontics could be the next evolution in root-canal treatment,
      the American Association of Endodontists has set up a special
      committee that will provide funding for research projects in this
      area in future.<br>
      <br>
      Edentulism, particularly amongst the elderly, is a major problem
      in countries with mass populations such as India. Could dental
      stem cells offer the ultimate solution to this problem?<br>
      <br>
      It would certainly not be right for any scientist or company
      working in this field to ignore these regions because there is
      such a strong clinical need. I am certain that as the technology
      develops, it will also be available to some of the populous
      regions in the world such as India, China or Africa. Of course,
      there is the problem of affordability, which was also discussed at
      the conference in New York. Stem cell therapies will be higher
      priced at the beginning but with a larger variety of products I am
      sure the price will come down. Considering the high costs of
      current restorative procedures, such as dental implants, I am sure
      stem cell regenerating tissue will be a strong contender.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you very much for this interview.<br>

      NEW YORK, USA/LEIPZIG, Germany: Dental implants could soon become
      a secondary choice for replacing natural teeth. According to new
      research from the College of Dental Medicine at Columbia
      University in New York, three-dimensional scaffolds infused with
      stem cells could yield an anatomically correct tooth in as soon as
      nine weeks once implanted. The new technique, developed by
      Columbia University professor Jeremy Mao, has also shown potential
      to regenerate periodontal ligaments and alveolar bone, which could
      make way to re-grow natural teeth that fully integrate into the
      surrounding tissue.<br>
      <br>
      Previous research on tooth regeneration has been focusing on
      harvesting stem cells directly on dental implants to improve
      osseointegration or outside the body where the tooth is grown
      under laboratory conditions and implanted once it has matured.
      Mao’s technique, which has been tested on animal-models, is moving
      the harvesting process directly into the socket where the tooth
      can be grown ‘orthotopically’.<br>
      <br>
      “A key consideration in tooth regeneration is finding a
      cost-effective approach that can translate into therapies for
      patients who cannot afford or who aren’t good candidates for
      dental implants,” Dr Mao told Dental Tribune Asia Pacific. “Our
      findings represent the first report of regeneration of
      anatomically shaped tooth-like structures in vivo.”<br>
      <br>
      Dr Mao’s study has been published in the recent Journal of Dental
      Research and will be presented at this year’s International
      Association of Dental Research congress in Barcelona. Columbia has
      also announced to have filed patient applications in relation to
      the engineered tooth and is actively seeking partners to help
      commercialise the technology through its technology transfer
      office Columbia Technology Ventures.<br>

      </b><b>US2011027339</b><b><br>
      </b>The common premise of synthetic implants in the restoration of
      diseased tissues and organs is to use inert and solid materials.
      Here, a porous titanium implant enables the delivery of
      microencapsulated bioactive cues. Control-released TGF[beta]1
      promoted the proliferation and migration of human mesenchymal stem
      cells into porous implants in vitro. Upon 4-wk implantation in the
      rabbit humerus, control-released TGF[beta]1 from porous implants
      significantly increased BIC by 96% and bone ingrowth by 50% over
      placebos. Control-released 100 ng TGF[beta]1 induced equivalent
      BIC and bone ingrowth to adsorbed 1 [mu]g TGF[beta]1, suggesting
      that controlled release is effective at 10-fold less drug dose
      than adsorption. Histomorphometry, SEM and [mu]T showed that
      control-released TGF[beta]1 enhanced bone ingrowth in the
      implant's pores and surface. These findings suggest that solid
      prostheses can be transformed into porous implants to serve as
      drug delivery carriers, from which control-released bioactive cues
      augment host tissue integration.<br>
