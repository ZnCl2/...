              Modulated Magnetic and Microwave Fields: The Priore
              Machine</font></b> </p>
        <p>by <b>J.B. Bateman</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Introduction ~</b> </p>
      A very complicated generator invented by Antoine Priore (or
      Prioré), a former radar operator without academic qualification,
      has been said to produce radiation which causes certain implanted
      animal tumors to regress and cures trypanosomiasis in certain
      laboratory animals. There are several remarkable things about the
      papers describing these biological effects, the most remarkable
      being the contrast between the careful detail in which the
      biological data thenselves are presented and the absence of
      anything but the most vague, and often contradictory, information
      about the generator. I have given examples of these disparities
      elsewhere (1).
      <p>A first consequence of the publication of these communications
        in the <i>Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Sciences</i> (Paris)
        was a violent polarization of opinion within the Academy and in
        other French scientific circles. There were some who wished to
        ignore or deny any phenomenon, however completely attested,
        brought about by inadequately specified means; they would have
        opposed presentation of the reports to the Academy and would
        probably have succeeded in suppressing them but for the
        determined sponsorship o£ the distinguished
        secrétaire-perpétuel, Prof. Robert Courrier. Others felt that
        the importance of the results, if they could be confirmed, made
        further investigation imperative: if possible, with disclosure
        of the inventor's "secret"; if not, then without it. </p>
      <p>A second result was the journalistic exploitation of a
        situation brimming over with human interest. Commentators
        (2)(3)(4)(5) ranged from a writer in Esquire who has since
        followed another path to notoriety (3) to Lord (Solly) Zuckerman
        writing in popular vein (4). None of them resisted the
        regrettable impulse to step up the popular appeal by introducing
        scientifically irrelevant biographical details about Priore in
        order to demonstrate his worthiness for political patronage,
        which indeed he has received in abundance. Aside from this, they
        maintained a nice balance between sympathy for the victim of
        prejudice and healthy scepticism toward his work. Zuckerman, in
        a lecture given at the Lovelace Foundation in Albuquerque (5),
        gives Priore an honorable place in his catalogue of those whose
        innovative achievements remained unrecognized because of
        conservative prejudice and ignorance, from Babbage to Peyton
        Rous, though not without leaving himself a loophole should the
        initial promise not be kept. The main point, he insists, is that
        people who believe in what they are doing should refuse to be
        discouraged in an atmosphere of incomprehension and hostility. </p>
      <p>The present report is the outcome of a visit to Priore's
        establishment sponsored by the organization ADERA for those
        attending a course of instruction on microwave exposure hazards
        (6). I shall write very briefly about the alleged biological
        effects, then about the Priore invention itself and the nature
        of its biologically active output. Impressions and private
        conversations bearing on these matters will be mentioned when
        they add, reliably or otherwise, to the total picture. </p>
      <p><b>Biological Observations ~</b> </p>
      <p>There is a pre-history of verbal recollection and gossip
        connected with the Priore invention. Priore himself is said (3)
        to have become interested in possible medical applications of
        electromagnetic waves upon observing that fruit and vegetables
        could be preserved by exposure to ultra-high frequency fields. A
        machine was built from US Army surplus and at some stage sick
        persons were placed in the field generated (3). According to a
        US scientist who has been interested in repeating some of the
        Priore experiments, a politically well-connected lady who was
        cured in this way of cancer after receiving a prognosis of early
        death is still enjoying perfect health in Bordeaux. </p>
      <p>The first experiments on cancerous animals were done by Delmon
        and Biraben who withheld their results from publication after
        receiving an unfavorable report from a committee, and because of
        a fear that publication would prejudice the candidature of one
        of them for admission to a fellowship (aggregation) (7). They
        used (8) rats implanted subcutaneously with a well-characterized
        uterine carcinoma, the so-called T8 (Guérin), having previously
        studied the effects of x-rays and of pulsed magnetic fields upon
        these animals without finding anything particularly noteworthy:
        The magnetic fields had no effect on tumor growth or on the
        occurrence of lympth node metastases, while the remission
        produced by x-rays was only transient. After exposure to the
        window of Priore’s machine, on the other hand, tumor growth
        could be stopped for as long as three months afterwards. The
        animals recovered good general health, and lymph node metastases
        were seldom seen. </p>
      <p>The T8 tumor in rats was also used by Rivière and colleagues
        (9) from Guérint’s laboratory in the cancer institute at
        Villejuif. They found macroscopic regression of the tumors and
        of metastases after treatment and observed no relapses up to
        three months thereafter. Their publication anticipated that of
        Delmon and Biraben. </p>
      <p>Rivière and colleagues then worked with rats implanted with a
        lymphoblastic lymphosarcoma which when untreated invariably
        proved fatal within 11 to 15 days, with generalized colonization
        of the nodes and a leukemic syndrome. Treatment under the Priore
        machine led to total regression of the graft and of the
        accompanying metastatic and leukemic phenomena (lO). Certain of
        these experiments were done with animals from Courrier's
        laboratory under the constant supervision of his assistant
        Madame Colonge. The results were the same, and Courrier reported
        them in an addendum to a further paper by Rivière et al (11)
        describing comparable results with a mouse lymphosarcoma.
        Further studies with the rat (12) yielded the discovery that
        treated rats clinically free of the lymphosarcoma were able to
        resorb a second transplant of the isologous tumor while
        succumbing to an homologous tumor of a histologically different
        type. </p>
      <p>Courrier (7) complained that, because of a campaign of
        disparagement, no French "cancerologists" offered to repeat
        these experiments Shortlived cooperation was however forthcoming
        from an English laboratory. According to one account (2),
        cancerous mice were sent over to Priore's establishment and some
        healthy ones were later sent from there to England, but the
        latter were not the ones that had been sent for treatment. The
        anonymous director of the English laboratory withdrew his
        cooperation, though not without providing "a French colleague"
        with a detailed memorandum. In 1977 Courrier (7) issued his own
        account of the episode and identified the persons concerned. The
        director was the late Sir Alexander Haddow (Institute of Cancer
        Research, Royal Cancer Hospital, Univ. of London), and his
        envoys to Floirac were E. Whiss and Dr. and Mrs. E.J. Ambrose,
        the latter being scientists of some repute. Courrier was
        evidently not persuaded that any substitution had taken place,
        for he wrote that the rumor was put about: on fait courir le
        bruit... </p>
      <p>The discovery of specific anti-tumor immunity in the treated
        animals may have lent force to the hunch that the Priore
        radiation might act upon the immune system of the host rather
        than directly upon the cancer cells. At any rate, Professor
        Raymond Pautrizel, a parasitologist already associated with the
        work of Rivière and Guérin, exposed mice after they had been
        injected with a dose of Tryponosoma equiperdum sufficient to
        kill them within five days if untreated, and they all survived
        (13). At this point extraordinary measures were taken to remove
        all suspicion of fraud. The experiments were repeated
        successfully under lock and key and under the eye of a bailiff
        appointed by a&nbsp; "Commission de Contrôle" composed of
        university officials and local dignitaries. The official report
        was certified by all the members of the Commission. A positive
        result obtained under such conditions, said Courrier (7), should
        have put an end to all criticism from men of good faith. </p>
      <p>In a further series of short papers in the <i>Comptes rendus
          Acad. Sci. Paris</i> (14) (15) (16) this indirect effect upon
        the immune system of animals infected with T. equiperdum was
        confirmed and elaborated. These brief published statements
        represent a lot of work: just how much was apparent from a
        lecture given by Pautrizel during my visit to Floirac. When I
        asked about his plan to publish the evidence in detail, he told
        me that he had not found a journal willing to accep such a
        manuscript. </p>
      <p>The evidence presented, furnished by experiments on mice (13)
        (14) (16), rats (14) and rabbits (15), follows fairly
        conventional lines which I shall not attempt to review in
        detail. Briefly: the pathogenic organisms disappeared from the
        treated arimals, which survived indefinitely. In rare cases
        where the parasites reappeared, they were of a different
        antigenic type from those causing the original infection.
        Treatment brought about an intense acquired immunity. Some
        animals were reinfected 7 times over a period of 6 morths,
        eventually with 100 times the original, and otherwise invariably
        fatal, dose, Multiple reinfection resulted in a high titer of
        agglutinating antibodies. The blood of these animals conferred
        upon other normal animals an immunity which persisted for about
        45 days. Treatment with an immunosuppressor, cyclophosphamide,
        depressed, but did not abolish, the appearance of agglutinating
        antibody when infected animals were subjected to Priore
        irradiation, although relapse occurred after about 12 days.
        Newborn animals died of the infection whether irradiated or not,
        and the organisms found in their blood were of the original
        strain. Trypanosomal antigen of unspecified nature, injected
        intraperitoneally after the first irradiation of infected
        animals, caused an enhancement of antibody production. When the
        parasites were protected from the host's immune system by being
        implanted in a diffusion chamber, Priore irradiation failed to
        inhibit their multiplication. In his talk, Pautrizel said that
        in order to elucidate further the apparent effect of irradiation
        in exalting the mobilization of the immune system, the course of
        change of immunoglobulins M and G. of albumin/globulin ratio,
        and of agglutinating and hemagglutinating titers was followed in
        irradiated and reinfected animals for about one year. The data
        were given in detail. With no time in which to understand, much
        less to assimilate them, I was left only with the impression
        that a clear picture has yet to emerge a conclusion apparently
        shared by Prof. Czersky of Warsaw. One point of interest was the
        passing mention of a failure to modify the course of a malarial
        infection. This is not surprising, perhaps, remembering the
        vastly more complex life cycle of the plasmodium and its greater
        antigenic variability. </p>
      <p>The postulated general stimulation of "defense mechanisms" by
        the output of the Priore machine led Pautrizel to ask whether
        this effect might extend to the prevention or cure of
        atherosclerosis. Another short paper communicated, as usual, by
        Courrier (17), described a "spectacular" attenuation of the
        hyperlipemia induced in rabbits by a diet of "industrial
        granules" supplemented by 1% of cholesterol, resulting in a
        daily cholesterol intake by each rabbit of about 1 gram. The
        observed effect of irradiation took the form of an inhibition of
        increased cholesterolemia, persisting for several weeks after
        treatment, and a marked decrease in the extent of aortic
        deposition. I find the data rather unconvincing, with quite a
        lot of overlap of experirnental and control values. As for the
        explanation of the effect, if it can be confirmed, Pautrizel and
        colleagues (17) ask whether it could be due to an activation of
        lipid catabolism. Strangely enough they do not discuss the role
        of macrophages in the regression of tumors, the cure of
        trypanosomiasis, or the prevention of hypercholesterolemia,
        although macrophage mobilization might provide a common
        mechanism. </p>
      <p><b>The Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>Much has been written deploring Priore's secretiveness. It has
        been an embarrassment in one camp and a ground for dismissing
        his invention in another. My own view is that a secretive
        inventor and his invention, if important, must be investigated
        as a part of the external world, and the obstacle posed by
        limited cooperation accepted in the spirit in which the
        inaccessibility of nature is accepted as a challenge to our
        wits. Priore has in fact been much more considerate than the
        Almighty, who after all has provided no blueprints to his
        creations, while Priore included in his first paper a footnote
        (9) informing us that the physical principle of his invention
        has been the subject of a patent (18). How strange that none of
        the journalistic commentators, from Zuckerman down the line,
        have thought it worthwhile even to mention the existence of this
        document. When drawing it to the attention or several members of
        the party visiting Floirac, I found astonishment at its
        existence followed by doubts as to whether, since they had not
        read it, it could contain any information of value. I had no
        opportunity to ask Priore about it, but an associate who did so
        met with a similar response : it won’t help very much, he said.
        Nevertheless the apparatus described is presumably that used by
        Rivière, in whose paper it is mentioned, and the amount of
        detail given is such that, unless indeed it is fraudulent, a
        reasonable guess as to the nature of the emerging radiation
        ought to be possible for people competent in the field. </p>
      <p>With this in mind I planned to include only a summary in this
        report, but have now decided upon a full translation (Appendix),
        without which the odd flavor of the document would be lost. A
        seemingly reasonable description of components and layout is
        coupled with a quaint - some might say superstitious - intrusion
        of pseudo biology and mention of electrophysiological pioneers
        whose identity can only be guessed through a haze of
        misspellings. There is, for instance, the choice of modulation
        frequency of the magnetic field to match the rhythm of the
        patient's heartbeat. There is, too, the comment that the best
        results are obtained when the cathode generating a stream of
        positive ions is made of molybdenum, the metal whose valency is
        closest to the mean valency of the chemical molesules
        constituting living tissues. </p>
      <p>I leave the reader to form his own impression of the invention
        described in the patent, save to mention that the active
        radiation emerges from a tube containing a rotating deflector
        upon which impinge, from several different sources, a stream of
        positive ions accelerated in a cyclotron, a beam of centimeter
        waves generated by a magnetron, and a magnetic field. Any or all
        of these may be chopped or modulated according to various
        patterns. The machine was working during the visit to Floirac.
        One could see the exit of the tube beneath which the biological
        targets are placed. There was a certain amount of rumbling and
        crackling, and the pinkish luminescent plasma appeared to be
        turbulent. I asked about the speed of rotation but was told by
        one of Priore's assistants that the informatlon is strictly
        confidential. I could guess it to be well under 100 rpm. </p>
      <p><b>The Emergent Field ~</b> </p>
      <p>After several misleading statements about the nature of the
        biologically active field generated by Priore's machine
        (mentioned in ref 1), a short paper in the « Comptes rendus »
        described the results of experiments in which two physicists of
        established reputation had been allowed to cooperate with
        Priore, Pautrizel, and their associates. Berteaud and Bottreau
        (19) were able to analyze the radiation in some detail, up to x-
        and gamma-ray frequencies. Their report is confined to the
        assertion that they have established the presence of a 904-GHz
        pulsed electromagnetic wave, amplitude modulated at HF frequency
        17 MHz, and a slowly modulated continuous magnetic field of the
        order of 1 kG. Other components, if detected, are not mentioned.
        There exists, I am told, a confidential report of the whole
        investigation. Bottreau assured me personally that there was no
        trace of ionizing radiation. </p>
      <p>Berteaud and coworkers (19) also mapped the intensity
        distribution of these radiations in a plane perpendicular to the
        axis of the apparatus. Then, using as targets mice infected with
        T. equiperdum, they were able to demonstrate a simple
        relationship between the rate of decrease of parasitemia in
        these animals and the relative intensity of the UHF component.
        However, in separate experiments they found that fatalities
        among infected mice were not decreased when the animals were
        exposed to an unmodulated 9.4-GHz field of comparable intersity.
        They concluded that the UHF field generated by Priore's machine
        is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the observed
        biological effects. </p>
      <p>The results of Berteaud et al leave us with some unanswered
        questions. If their analysis of the field was complete, the
        biological activity must rest jointly on the UHF ccmponent and
        the magnetic field. How critical are the exact values of the
        many parameters involved and the relationship between them for
        the manifestation of biological activity ? Is it possible that
        the methods available to Berteaud and coworkers were incapable
        of furnishing a complete analysis ? </p>
      <p>One can only speculate. It has struck me that in all the papers
        describing the biological effects of this radiation, there is
        nowhere any mention of any search for the correct operating
        conditions of the machine. Apparently the machine, if it works
        at all, always produces results, and one must remember that two
        different models have been built and found to be effective. The
        one quantity that is resularly mentioned is the magnetic field
        strength, 620 G in the first model and 1240 G in the second. The
        patent document seems to suggest that there is great flexibility
        in the mode of operation. It is moreover almost inconceivable
        that Priore could have had any genuine theoretical basis upon
        which to favor one particular set of patterns over another in
        relation to biological changes that are themselves of
        intractable complexity and totally unpredictable. One is bound
        to suspect that the exact mix is anything but critical, and that
        if the reported biological effects are genuine they might very
        well be brought about by much simpler means. It is of some
        interest that extremely sharp frequency selectivity has been
        claimed in recent biological experiments with monochromatic
        microwaves, in contrast to the sort of flat response surmised in
        the present context. The need for fine tuning could of course be
        obviated in a machine designed for sturdiness and broad
        applicability by arranging for it to generate "white" energy
        with respect to the several decisive characteristics, including
        modulation frequencies and perhaps their derivatives, or
        alternatively to generate an output which varies rapidly in real
        time, systematically or randomly, over a sufficiently wide range
        of values. The biological effects of such radiation would then
        he the sum of Various qualitatively and quantitatively different
        selective processes including the possible cancellation of
        additive effects such as stimulation and inhibition. However,
        total nullification would be no more likely than it is, for
        instance, in the visible everyday consequences of illumination
        by sunlight. Such an approach, if it has been adopted by Priore
        or if it has emerged fortuitously as an unforseen property of an
        assemblage of components chosen on the basis of some other
        rationale, would account for the extravagance of the machine in
        energy consumption in return for a very modest biological yield.
        There is no immediate evidence for this in the statements of
        Berteaud and Bottreau (19), but the relevant quality of
        "whiteness" might apply pertinently to other parameters than
        those investigated by them. The possibility that some hitherto
        unrecognized feature of the radiation from a rotating plassa may
        be responsible for the Priore effects should not be dismissed
        out of hand, at any rate by those who, like myself, know nothing
        about plasmas. Dr. John Carstoiu of Brookline, MA, who counts
        among his accomplishments an extension of the Maxwell equations
        to the evaluation of ponderomotor forces, likes to call the
        Priore machine a magnetohydrodynamic wave guidea He considers
        the acceleration of the plasma to be a significant feature. He
        refers to the various types of oscillation that may be set up
        but does not, and presumably cannot, say how they can manifest
        themselves across a quartz window. One's naive reaction is to
        doubt, in any case, whether the accelerations attainable in an
        apparatus as described in the patent document would be great
        enough to initiate a gravitational wave of any significance.
        Unless the suggestion is an obvious absurdity to a plassa
        physicist, somebody will have to do the arithmetic. </p>
      <p><b>The New Generator ~</b> </p>
      <p>The further development of Priore's invention is being done
        under the auspices of an organization set up for the purpose :
        the Société d'Exploitation du Rayonnement Antoine Priore (SERAP)
        which brings Priore into formal relationship with a company,
        Moteurs Leroy Somer of Angouleme. This company has been the
        recipient of a $ 0.7 million contract from the DGRST (Delégation
        Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technique) for the
        construction of a third machine of greatly increased output.
        Priore has been reported (3) to predict that the cost is more
        likely to be $ 3 million. No doubt other sources of funding are
        available. In return for such support Priore promises a much
        bigger and better machine that will generate a more intense
        field of much larger cross section than those with which the
        results already reported were obtained. So, one can guess,
        larger groups of small animals will be irradiated simultaneously
        for shorter periods than formerly and the rate of accumulation
        of data will increase -- if, that is, the biological
        measurements can keep pace. Perhaps too, by the same token,
        small groups of large animals will be treated, with the single
        sick human as the ultimate target of the entire endeavor. </p>
      <p>Little was learned of this latest development during my visit
        to Floirac. The Priore residence is coming to look like an
        industrial laboratory of electrical engineering geared to pilot
        scale operations. There are rumors of serious technical
        difficulties such as might have been anticipated in scaling up
        such a complicated device. It is said to be proving difficult,
        for instance, to construct a pyrex container able to cope with
        the very high energy flux in the plasma. </p>
      <p>Is the new machine really needed? At the technical level the
        answer is almost certainly "no". Evidently technical
        considerations are overruled by others, no doubt of a personal,
        political, and even patriotic nature. The whole operation takes
        on a farcical aspect when one considers that the only genuine
        need in the present state of affairs is to get independent
        confirmation, or refutation, of results already obtained with
        equipment that was clearly adequate for the original
        experiments. The funds now made available would suffice for the
        building of several replicas of the Mark 2 machine. These,
        placed in selected centers of research, could be used by
        independent teams for a critical repetition and extension of
        earlier findings. The success or otherwise of the time-consuming
        attempt to build a giant machine is largely irrelevant to the
        central doubts that persist as to the claims made for the Priore
        radiation, and this expensive diversion of effort betrays a
        certain recklessness which ill serves the quest for a solution
        to the mystery surrounding "L'affaire Priore." </p>

        <b>US Cl. 128-1.3 ~ October 25, 1966</b>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Method of Producing Radiations for
              Penetrating Living Cells</font></b> </p>
        <p><b><font size="+1">Antoine Priore</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>This invention relates in a general way to radiations capable
        of penetrating matter. More precisely, it has for its object to
        provide a method for obtaining a combination of radiation of
        different kinds capable of penetrating matter, and more
        particularly of penetrating intimately into living organic
        tissues and producing certain effects therein and most notably
        in human tissues for therapeutic purposes, without destroying
        therein such essential elements as the enzymes for instance. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, electrically charged
        particles are emitted into a cavity, and onto this emission is
        superimposed a centimetric electromagnetic radiation the
        wavelength of which preferably lies between 3 cm and 80 cm, and
        the resulting radiation issuing from said cavity is directed
        onto the target to be irradiated. </p>
      <p>The applicant has noted that the penetration and particularly
        the curative effects are very markedly improved when the
        frequency of the electromagnetic radiation is determined
        according to the organ or tissue to be penetrated or treated.
        For example, a wavelength of 14 cm is suitable for the liver and
        a wavelength of 19.5 cm for the spleen. </p>
      <p>The charged particles radiated are preferably accelerated in a
        particle accelerator in order to increase the penetration force.
      </p>
      <p>The resulting radiation is preferably applied to and directed
        at the target, namely at the tissue to be penetrated, by means
        of a tube which is the seat of accelerating and directing
        magnetic fields and electrical fields, said radiation being with
        advantage directed and/or reflected by a rotary deflecting
        device placed within the tube. </p>
      <p>In many cases it will be of advantage to modulate the particle
        radiation or to produce it rhythmically by means of varying
        magnetic and/or electrical fields whereby to further increase
        the penetration force. Such a rhythm is preferably tuned,
        particularly in medical applications, to the natural period
        (oscillation time) of the tissue to be penetrated or of the
        tissues adjacent thereto, an example being the muscles. These
        natural periods are well known in medicine and are applied for
        diathermy in particular; they lie in the range of wavelengths
        extending from 1 meter to 50 m and more specifically from 1 m to
        18 m. </p>
      <p>Means are preferably provided for modulating the emitted
        radiations, the accelerating electrical and magnetic fields, and
        possibly also the rotary deflecting device, in step with the
        patient’s heartbeats. </p>
      <p>It would appear that the positive results obtained with this
        invention in the treatment of disorders of the living cells (be
        they vegetable or animal), are due to certain phenomena which
        will be discussed hereinafter, it being of course understood
        that such discussion in no way limits the spirit and scope of
        the invention. </p>
      <p>Depending on its electro-physico-chemical constitution, the
        cellular protoplasm-nucleus couple is endowed with electrical
        conductivity which is related directly to the ionic exchange
        motions caused by metabolic phenomena. Indeed one notes in the
        tissues the presence of accumulations of electricity under
        potentials that differ according to the varying cell densities
        of the tissues. </p>
      <p>The work conducted by Renshaw, Forbes, Morison, Amassian, De
        Vito, Buser, Albe-Fessard, Tau, Adrian, etc., has demonstrated
        with the aid of microelectrodes the existence of a
        slow-oscillation-type elemental electrical activity within the
        cells, while the pace-maker can be regarded as being provided by
        the oscillating electromagnetic system formed by the cell
        nucleus. Basically, indeed, the nucleus consists of tubular
        filaments of insulating material (akin to chitin) containing
        therein an electricity conducting saline liquid, and these
        filaments, twisted onto themselves, can be likened to veritable
        little oscillating circuits. </p>
      <p>Recent work carried out by Warson in America, as well as other
        work carried out by French researchers, including a paper by
        Messrs. Polonsky, Douzou, and Sadron, read on 16 May 1960 before
        the Academy of Science by Prof. Francis Perrin (Collected Weekly
        Reports, Tome 250, No. 20, pp 3414-3416), brought out the fact
        that the experimental solid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) samples
        used revealed properties similar to the familiar properties of
        ferro-electric bodies, thus giving verisimilitude to the
        hypothesis that a difference of potential can exist across the
        nucleus and the periphery of the cells. Certain recent theories
        even go further and liken the cell to an electronic
        receiving-emitting device that operates in the normal state with
        a frequency attuned to the ambient media. In accordance with
        these recent theories, the cell nucleus forms a damped-wave
        oscillating system which obeys the laws governing
        semi-conducting bodies. </p>
      <p>The applicant has come to the firm conclusion that, in the
        normal state of physico-electrical equilibrium, the cell nucleus
        is positively charged but that it can become negatively
        overcharged following phenomena similar to polarization. It is
        believed that the results obtained by the applicant by treating
        living cells with the resulting radiation of the invention are
        due to restoration of a correct electrical potential of the
        nuclei. <br>

      <p>Referring first to Figure 1, the apparatus shown thereon
        includes a device 1 emitting electrically charged particles 2
        into a cavity or duct 3, a cyclotron 4 for accelerating
        particles 2 and sending them into a conduit 5 in communication
        with a further cavity 6 forming a waveguide for an
        electromagnetic radiation of centimetric frequency emitted by a
        magnetron 7. The cavity 8 formed by the union of conduit 5 with
        a waveguide 6 leads to a tube 9 for accelerating and directing
        the resulting radiation. The cavity jointly formed by elements
        1, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9 contains argon under a pressure of 2 mm Hg.
      </p>
      <p>The particle emitter 1 consists of an electron gun having a
        plate 10 and a cathode 11. </p>
      <p>Cathode 11 is made of molybdenum and is shaped in a very
        special manner shown in Figures 1 and 2. It includes a rim 11a
        which is joined through two diametrically opposed radii 11b to a
        hub 11c embodying a hole 11d of axis XX’. Rim 11a is made up of
        two parts (as shown in Figure 1) assembled together by means of
        screws or the like, and embodies a cavity of revolution 11e in
        the walls of which are provided a plurality of uniformly spaced
        pairs of opposed holes 11f parallel with axis XX’. Within cavity
        11e is disposed a heating filament 12 connected to the supply
        leads 12a. </p>
      <p>The best results are obtained with a cathode 11 made of
        molybdenum. However, the applicant obtained satisfactory, though
        less good, results with tungsten cathodes. It so happens that
        molybdenum, and to a lesser extent tungsten, are metals the
        valence of which is nearest the mean valence of the chemical
        molecules that make up living tissue and more particularly human
        tissue. Whereas a scientific explanation based on observation of
        the phenomena involved could be attempted, it is to be clearly
        understood that the invention is by no means limited by any such
        scientific explanation. Further, insofar as the low-pressure gas
        in the device is concerned, optimum results are obtained with
        argon. However, the applicant also obtained satisfactory, though
        less good, results with the other gases of the family of rare
        gases. </p>
      <p>Surrounding the tube forming the electromagnetic chamber are
        disposed an electromagnet 13 with its coil 13a, placed level
        with the cathode, and the accelerating coils 14 and 15. Further
        accelerating coils 14a, 15a, 16a and 14b, 15b, and 16b are
        likewise arranged about cavities 3 and 5 respectively. </p>
      <p>The two semi-circular boxes or D’s 4a of cyclotron 4 are placed
        in the customary fashion between the frame poles, and said frame
        is surrounded by accelerating windings 4b and 4c. </p>
      <p>Magnetron 7 is of any convenient known design and must be
        capable of emitting into cavity 3 a centimetric radiation of
        wavelength adjustable between 3 cm and 80 cm. </p>
      <p>Accelerating and directing tube 9 is provided in its lower part
        with a cathode 17 similar to cathode 11, together with a heating
        filament 17a. Cathode 17 is supported on a hollow base 18
        embodying holes 18a adjacent where it joins the end closure of
        tube 9. Said base 18 communicates with a tube 18b which has an
        open end adjacent a rotary deflector 19 provided with two rings
        of graphite plates 19a inclined at 45 degrees to the vertical.
        The shaft 19b of the rotary deflector is rotatably supported in
        a bearing 20 fixed with magnetic fly-weights 19c which set it in
        rotation by coacting with magnetic fly-weights 21a rigid with
        the shaft 21b of a motor 21. The lower extremity of rotary
        deflector 19 consists of a pyramid-shaped molybdenum or tungsten
        part 19d the apex of which is situated opposite the open end of
        tube 18b to deflect the radiation downwardly towards the target.
        The lower part of bearing 20 forms the plate or anode 22 of tube
        9. </p>
      <p>Hollow base 18and tube 18b can be made of some boro-silicate
        glass of low coefficient of expansion, such as Pyrex.
        Alternatively, they can be made of quartz. Tube 9 likewise can
        be made of Pyrex-type glass, or of any other glass of the
        quality commonly used for manufacturing electron tubes, but its
        end closure 9a, through which the radiation passes, is
        preferably made of quartz. </p>
      <p>Conduit 8 communicates with tube 9 via a plurality of pipes
        such as 8a and 8b directed at a certain angle, along vertical
        planes, towards plates 19a, said angle being preferably in the
        region of 22.5 degrees, About cathode 17 is disposed an
        electromagnet 23 similar to the electromagnet 13 of radiating
        tube 1. About tube 9 are likewise disposed accelerating coils
        24. At the points shown on the drawing, tube 9 also includes
        three electrodes 25, 25a and 25b surrounded respectively by
        coils 26, 26a and 26b. On the drawings are also represented the
        feeders 17b and 17c of the cathode and its filament, and 22a of
        the anode. </p>
      <p>The power supply circuit diagram is shown on Figure 4. The main
        supply 27 supplies low-voltage alternating current to a first
        branch comprising a rectifier 28 (a kenotron, for instance), the
        rectified current from which is modulated to a rate adjustable
        between 30 and 120 pulses per minute by means of a resistor 29
        the control system of which will be described hereinafter with
        reference to Figures 7 and 8. The current modulated thus is
        applied to electromagnets 13 and 23 whereby to cause them to
        generate, at the level of cathodes 11 and 17, a modulated
        unidirectional field of 10,000 to 20,000 gauss. </p>
      <p>The main supply 27 also powers a variometer 30 which is adapted
        to be operated to modulate the current from at a rate which is
        adjustable between 30 and 120 pulses per minute, and the current
        issuing from variometer 30 supplies the remainder of the system,
        to wit: </p>
      <p>The magnetron 7: </p>
      <p>A converter set 31 the excitation of which is modulated at a
        frequency variable from 300 to 900 cps; this provides a direct
        current for supplying coils 15, 16, and 26, which is doubly
        modulated (first at 30 to 120 pulses per minute, then at a
        frequency of 300 to 900 cps); </p>
      <p>A further converter set 32 producing low-voltage direct current
        modulated to a rate of 30 to 120 pulses per minute by virtue of
        variometer 30; this current supplies motor 21, together with the
        motors driving variometer 30 and the control device of resistor
        29. </p>
      <p>The current produced by converter set 32 additionally feeds a
        voltage step-up device 33 comprising a vibrator followed by a
        transformer and a rectifier and generating a direct current the
        voltage of which varies in step with the 30 to 120 pulses per
        minute rate imposed by variometer 30. The maximum value of this
        voltage produced by device 33 could be 300,000 volts for
        instance, but this figure can vary either way, depending on the
        power to be brought into play. </p>
      <p>The current produced by voltage step-up device 33 feeds the
        windings 4b of the cyclotron and 24 of the tubes 9, as well as a
        rheostat 34 which permits adjusting the voltage to the desired
        value between 5000 volts and 70,000 volts. This voltage is
        applied to an oscillating circuit 35 which imparts thereto
        oscillations of frequency adjustable as desired between
        wavelengths of 1 m and 18 m. The current available across the
        output terminals 35a and 35b of oscillating circuit 35 is
        consequently high tension current that is initially modulated to
        30 to 120 pulses per minute (by virtue of variometer 30) and
        subsequently to a wavelength of 1 m to 18 m. This current
        supplies the coils 4c and 14. Electrodes 25a and 25b are
        respectively connected to terminals 35a and 35b, while electrode
        25 is connected to the mid-point 35c. </p>
      <p>The cathodes 11 and 17, the cyclotron D’s 4a and the plates 10
        and 22, which are not shown on the block diagram of Figure 4m
        are connected to the output end of voltage step-up device 33,
        the preheat current for filaments 11e and 17a being furnished by
        resistor 29. </p>
      <p>To use the apparatus according to this invention, the control
        system of resistor 29 and variometer 30 is set to the required
        pace which, in medical applications, is preferably the patient’s
        pulse rate: this rate is thus imposed on the system as a whole.
        Cathode 11 emits a stream of positively charged particles 2
        leftwardly, which particles are concentrated by electromagnet 13
        and accelerated by windings 14, 15, and 16 and by cyclotron 4.
        To this radiation of particles is added, in conduit 8, the
        electromagnetic radiation of magnetron 7 which is adjusted to a
        wavelength shown by experience to be the most favorable for the
        cells to be penetrated, examples being 14 cm for the liver and
        19.5 cm for the spleen. The resulting radiation is directed and
        accelerated in tube 9 and then directed by the base thereof
        towards the target to be penetrated. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the unidirectional magnetic field of
        coils 15, 16 and 26 is modulated by converter set 31 to a
        frequency adjustable between 300 and 900 cps. The result of this
        modulation is to concentrate the particles, i.e., detach them
        from the conduit walls, and also to enable a substantial saving
        to be made on the weights of the iron cores of the coils. </p>
      <p>The unidirectional magnetic fields of the cyclotron coils 4c
        and the accelerating coils 14, and the electrical field of the
        electrodes 25, 25a and 25b, are modulated by oscillating circuit
        35 to a wavelength selected between 1 m and 18 m. In medical
        applications in particular, the wavelength chosen is that best
        suited to the organ to be treated or to such adjacent parts
        thereof as the muscles. As already stated, diathermy experiments
        will enable the most appropriate wavelength to be determined. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the resulting radiation already
        possesses considerable penetration force in conduit 8 (see
        Figure 1). The device herein before described can therefore be
        used without tube 9 and by bounding the cavity at the extremity
        of conduit 8 by means of a glass or quartz end closure, the
        resulting radiation being accelerated and directed immediately
        upstream thereof, for instance by an ultimate coil (not shown)
        surrounding conduit 8. However, tube 9 substantially improves
        the results obtained. </p>
      <p>Reference is next had to Figures 5 and 6, which illustrate an
        alternative embodiment of th apparatus according to this
        invention, wherein components performing like functions are
        designated by the same reference numerals as those on Figures 1
        and 3, followed by the “prime” symbol. </p>
      <p>In Figure 5, the disposition of the conduits with respect to
        tubes 1’ and 9’, magnetron 7’ and cyclotron 4’, differs from
        that of Figure 1 and has been used with success by the
        applicant. The waveguide 6’ of magnetron 7’ is connected to the
        extremity of tube 1’, while conduit 3’ conveying the resulting
        radiation divides into two branches: branch 25 surrounded by
        accelerating coils 14c’ and 15c’, which conveys the radiation
        directly to tube 9’ and branch 37 which conveys its to cyclotron
        4’. The latter arrests the electromagnetic radiation and
        accelerates the radiated particles which are dispatched into
        tube 9’ through conduit 38. </p>
      <p>This particular disposition can be used with particle-emitting
        and accelerating-and-directing tubes similar to tubes 1 and 9 of
        the preceding figures. However, the tubes 1’ and 9’ of Figures 5
        and 6 are designed differently insofar as their cathodes and
        anodes are concerned. </p>
      <p>Tube 1’ includes a first electrode 11’ exactly similar to the
        cathode 11 of tube 1, and a second identical electrode 39
        provided with a heating filament 39a. Tube 9’ (see Figure 6)
        includes in its lower part a first electrode 17’ with its
        heating filament 17’a, and a second identical electrode 40 with
        its heating filament 40a. </p>
      <p>In normal operation, i.e., to produce a radiation identical to
        that described with reference to Figures 1 through 4, electrode
        11’ serves as a cathode and electrode 39 is subjected to a
        positive potential and performs the function of plate 10 of
        Figure 1m the filament 39a not being heated. Electrode 40 and
        its filament 40a are placed out of circuit, and cathode 17’ and
        plate 22’ are energized as in the case of Figure 3. </p>
      <p>To obtain unusually penetrating radiation, the polarities are
        reversed: electrode 11’ becomes an anode and its filament 11’e
        is placed out of circuit, while electrode 39 is energized as a
        cathode and its filament 39a is heated; electrode 17’ (the
        filament 17’a of which is out of circuit) and electrode 22’
        become anodes, while electrode 40 is connected as a cathode and
        its filament 40a is heated. By way of example, it is possible to
        establish a potential of 250,000 volts across electrodes 40 and
        17’, and of 50,000 volts across electrodes 40 and 22’. It will
        be appreciated that, this being so, cathode 39 will emit a
        stream of electrons leftwardly, which will be concentrated,
        modulated and accelerated by the various coils as well as in the
        cyclotron, the polarities of which must manifestly be
        established in the suitable sense. This electron radiation is
        combined with the centimetric radiation emitted by magnetron 7’,
        and there results in tube 9’ a very hard emission, modulated to
        the chosen frequencies of x-rays combined with the centimetric
        radiation of desired frequency. </p>
      <p>Thus, the apparatus of Figures 5 and 6 permits obtaining at
        will wither this very hard x-ray emission, or the radiation
        described with reference to the preceding figures. If the very
        hard x-ray emission is obtained, converter set 31 is preferably
        adjusted to feed coils 15’, 16’ and 26’ with a current modulated
        at the highest frequencies (i.e., close to 900 cps). </p>
      <p>The description which follows with reference to Figures 7
        through 9 relates to a number of features of the devices
        utilized for obtaining modulation of the electric current. </p>
      <p>Figure 7 is a schematic illustration of the control system of
        resistor 29 and variometer 30. Adjustable resistor 29 is
        provided with a graphite helical member 29a immersed in a
        conductive liquid 29b into which dips partly a graphite
        electrode 29c to which a reciprocating motion is imparted by a
        connecting rod 41a pivotally connected to a flywheel 41. The
        latter is rotated through an endless screw transmission 41b by a
        shaft 42b, either by a motor 43 or by the shaft 30a of
        variometer 30, which variometer is in turn driven by a motor 44
        through an endless screw type transmission 44a. </p>
      <p>Reciprocating movement of electrode 29c will vary the surface
        thereof which dips into the conductive liquid 29b, and
        accordingly will vary the resistance between electrodes 29, 29a
        of resistor 29, at a rhythm which is equal t the rpm imparted to
        flywheel 41. Rhythmically variable resistor 29 is shunted by a
        resistor which is shown diagrammatically, resulting in a
        component having a rhythmically variable resistance, which is
        inserted in the line (Figure 4) feeding electromagnets 13, 23
        with rectified current delivered by rectifier 28. </p>
      <p>If flywheel 41 is driven by motor 43 at suitable speed,
        resistor 29 will vary the current energizing electromagnets 13
        and 23 (Figures 1 and 4) a the chosen rhythm which, as explained
        above, can be included between 30 and 120 pulses per minute and
        which can be monitored by means of a revolution-counter
        represented schematically at 45. When this is the case, motor 44
        of variometer 30 can be stopped, thus no longer subjecting the
        remainder of the system to a set pace. Conversely, if the drive
        to flywheel 41 is engaged at 42b and released at 42a, motor 44
        will act as a pace-maker for variometer 30 and resistor 29. </p>
      <p>The rotational speed of motors 43 or 44 can be adjusted to an
        appropriate speed corresponding substantially to the patient’s
        pulse rate, by operating on the exciter of said motors by means
        of a manually adjustable rheostat. Should it be preferred to
        have the speed of motors 43 or 44 governed directly by the
        patient’s pulse rate, a device such as the one illustrated
        schematically in Figure 8 can be resorted to. In Figure 8, a
        contact type microphone is connected at 46 and produces pulses
        when placed on the patient’s heart. These pulses are amplified
        in the circuit shown and are applied to an electromagnet
        represented at 47, of which the moving core operates a rheostat
        for adjusting the excitation current to motors 43 or 44. </p>
      <p>Figure 9 is the circuit diagram of oscillating circuit 35. The
        rectified voltage adjustable between 5000 and 70,000 volts by
        means of rheostat 34 (see Figure 4) is applied across terminals
        48 and 48a. Terminal 35c (which is also connected to electrode
        25 in Figures 2 and 4) is connected to the neutral point, on the
        high tension side, of the transformer which is a component port
        of voltage step-up device 33 (See Figure 4). Terminals 49 and
        49a receive the heating current produced by resistor 29.
        Adjustable capacitors 50 and 50a permit of adjusting the current
        available across the output terminals 25a and 25b of the
        oscillator represented to the desired wavelength (which, as
        already indicated, lies between 1 m and 18 m). </p>
      <p>Although the specific embodiments described hereinbefore have
        been experimented with successfully, it goes without saying that
        they are given by way of example only and could be variously
        modified without departing from the spirit and scope of the
        invention. In particular, the electron gun 1 or 1’ could be
        replaced by any other convenient particle emitter. </p>

      <p><i>Dedication</i>: This short paper is dedicated to the memory
        of the late Chris Bird, a noted researcher, colleague, and
        stalwart friend who first acquainted me with the Prioré affair
        and with the remarkable results that were obtained by Prioré and
        his associates. Some months prior to his passing, Chris gave me
        most of his most important Prioré file, including the thesis
        submitted by Prioré to the University of Bordeaux (the actual
        document itself). We sorely miss his booming voice and ever
        cheerful encouragement. </p>
      <p>We also express our deep thanks to my colleague Alain Beaulieu
        for translating the Prioré thesis and several other important
        French documents dealing with the Prioré affair. </p>
      <p>We further reiterate our remembrances to Bob Whitney and Frank
        Golden, when we tried so hard to revive the Prioré machine and
        work while Prioré was still alive. For our efforts we were
        resoundingly suppressed. God willing, your efforts will yet
        prove to have been worthwhile. At least we have finally
        deciphered the exact mechanism by which the Prioré machine was
        able to accomplish its astonishing cures. We shall continue
        striving to see that the Prioré work has not been in vain, and
        that at some point the scientific community accepts and uses the
        fact that Prioré had discovered how to time-reverse the treated
        diseased cells back to a previous healthy cell state. </p>
      <p>Antoine Prioré was born in Italy. He graduated from a small
        provincial school for electricity in Trieste, Italy and became a
        radar technician and operator in the Italian Navy. By some
        manner he became a prisoner of the Germans (apparently after
        Italy left the war in WW II), and was moved as a forced laborer
        for the Nazi to the vicinity of the submarine base in Bordeaux,
        France. </p>
      <p>When it became obvious the Germans were losing the war and were
        preparing to leave, Prioré realized he would be killed. He
        approached a French police agent to plead for his life. That
        police officer worked clandestinely for the French underground.
        He put Prioré in his car and drove him out of the base to
        safety. He took Prioré to the nearby province of Dordogne, and
        introduced him to the 7th Battalion of French underground
        resistance fighters. Prioré distinguished himself in military
        operations and was eventually decorated by the French
        Government. </p>
      <p>Thankful to the French for saving his life, and loyal to his
        French companions-in-arms, Prioré decided after the war to live
        in Bordeaux. He was encouraged by his French resistance friends
        such as Jacques Chaban-Delmas who later rose to become the
        French Prime Minister. </p>
      <p>For some time Prioré worked as an electrical repairman and did
        research on exposing plants, etc. to EM radiation. </p>
      <p>Prioré was introduced to Francis Berlureau, former Director of
        Studies at the School for Veterinary Medicine in Toulouise, and
        director of the Bordeaux abbatoir at the time. He worked
        together with Berlureau for some 10 years. He noticed effects on
        a cancerous bull’s testicles, then began exposing various
        animals such as cats to the radiations of his early apparatus.
        The histological work was done by Professor Drieux at the famous
        Veterinarian School of Maisons-Allfort, near Paris. Drieux wrote
        a technical report proving that the cat’s cancer, developing
        before treatment, was benign after treatment. </p>
      <p>By 1953 Prioré began treating human patients whose cancers had
        been judged hopeless. Fournier maintained a huge file of such
        human cases, but the file later was mysteriously lost.
        Nonetheless, Prioré cured cases of a malignant form of Hodgkin’s
        disease, a case of cancer of the larynx, etc. </p>
      <p>Attempts to interest leading Bordeaux physicists and leading
        cancer experts in the results of the new approach were laughed
        off or dismissed with stony silence. </p>
      <p>Prioré’s response was to build a new and more complicated
        version of his treatment device. Secretly he treated dozens of
        hopeless cancer patients. At Prioré’s funeral, a small platoon
        of mourners was composed of the now-older people who had been
        cured of their terrible afflictions by Prioré in the late 1950s.
      </p>
      <p>He was introduced to Professor Tayeau, vice dean of Bordeaux’s
        Medical Faculty, in latter 1959-early 1960. Prioré was sent to
        Biraben, head of the Faculty’s Department of Pathological
        Anatomy, and his assistant, Delmon. To their utter surprise,
        grafted T-8 tumors in animals subsequently treated with Prioré’s
        machine were reduced by 60%, a first in the history of
        cancerology. </p>
      <p>The mayor of Bordeaux, who later became prime minister of
        France, was Jacques Chaban-Delmas. He was a fellow resistance
        fighter and very interested in Prioré’s work. Chaban-Delmas
        invoked two commissions of Bordeaux and Parisian scientists to
        study the Biraben-Delmon results in detail. Both commissions
        rejected Prioré and his machine offhandedly. Biraben and Delmon
        could not explain the nature of the radiations from Prioré’s
        machine. A certain professor Lachapele on the first commission
        was ever an ardent foe of the Prioré method, dismissing the
        results offhand because the tumors were grafted. His view
        prevailed. Neither of the commissions interviewed Prioré
        himself, nor did they run an experiment under their own control.
      </p>
      <p>Biraben and Delmon continued their experiments, achieving
        unequivocal and complete success, but because of the political
        climate in the medical community, did not publish these
        outstanding results. Biraben, e.g., was told he could either get
        his degree or publish his research, but not both. Biraben and
        Delmon finally published a memoir in the <u>Revue of
          Comparative Pathology</u>. But a vicious campaign to destroy
        the Prioré work and suppress it was already underway. </p>
      <p>Other persons involved with L’affair Prioré were: Professor
        Guerin, at the cancer institute at Villejuif (equivalent to the
        American National Cancer Institute in Bathesda, Maryland).
        Buerin was a co-discoverer of the T-8 tumor. Guerin assigned his
        colleague Marcel-René Riviére to delve into the entire question.
        Reviére confirmed the Biraben-Delmon findings. A note was sent
        for publication in the Proceedings of the French Academy of
        Science. Reviére also tested the Prioré Ray against other types
        of tumors, achieving spectacular results. </p>
      <p>Robert Courrier, an eminent endocrinologist still in his 30s, a
        full professor, and Secrétaire Perpétuel to the Academy of
        Sciences and head of the biology section (and later to become
        President of the Academy of Medicine), took up the cudgel to
        interest high French scientists and scientific agencies. The
        CNRS director took offense because Prioré was essentially
        self-taught and not academically credentialed. Others did not
        understand anything at all about the machine’s operation. To
        Bordeaux, Courrier sent his trusted assistant Madame Colonge, to
        repeat Riviére’s experiments under her personal supervision. A
        physicist sent to examine the machine could make "neither heads
        nor tails" of its operation. There is little wonder! The Prioré
        machine involved a dramatic extension to present nonlinear phase
        conjugate optics (NLO) before NLO was even born! It also
        involved a dramatic extension to both U(1) electrodynamics and
        to general relativity. It is also little wonder that Prioré, who
        discovered the process by intuition and by trial and error,
        could not explain the operation of his own machine or the
        mechanism by means of which the cures were accomplished by the
        "ray" emitted by his device. In fact, the best physicists in
        France could not comprehend or explain the mechanism whereby
        such spectacular results were produced by Prioré's machine when
        used to treat patients with non-ionizing EM radiation from it. </p>
      <p>On May 1, 1965, Robert Courrier formally presented the
        astounding Prioré results to the assembled French Academy of
        Science. He was met with stony silence. A leading cancer
        specialist even stalked out of the assembly hall in full view.
        No serious discussion among the scientists present at the
        meeting ever took place. </p>
      <p>Controversy and research continued, in the midst of a raging
        controversy over "l’Affair Prioré". </p>
      <p>Prioré’s sister in Italy then came down with cancer. Prioré
        issued an ultimatum to his associates to build the bigger
        machine he needed, so that he could save his sister’s life.
        Conventional engineers repeatedly changed Prioré’s design,
        thinking many components unnecessary, etc. and causing machine
        failures. Prioré’s sister died (mid-60s) before the machine
        could be finished because of these unnecessary setbacks. A
        grief-stricken Prioré went into isolation, unwilling to talk to
        anyone. </p>
      <p>In early 1967, Professor Raymond Pautrizel entered the picture.
        At 40, Pautrizel was an eminent parasitologist, on the Faculty
        of Medicine at Bordeaux, and soon became known worldwide as the
        "father of parasitological immunity." Pautrizel was awarded the
        first academic chair in France for immunology, and later headed
        a special unit on parasitological immunology. [This subject is
        of particular significance to the study of AIDS, because it
        deals also with the continual adaptation and genetic change of
        the invading parasites and agents.] Pautrizel specialized on a
        particularly lethal parasite, the trypanosome family (which
        causes sleeping sickness, equine syphilis, and other
        afflictions). Pautrizel was one of the first scientists to
        recognize and utilize ambivalence in biological drugs. Pautrizel
        also noticed that the Prioré ray was not <i>killing</i> the
        tumor cells, and therefore must be doing something else instead.
        Pautrizel personally persuaded the distraught Prioré to return
        to work. </p>
      <p>From 1966 on, many papers were published on the results of
        applying the Prioré technique to various animals and diseases.
        The results continued to be revolutionary. </p>
      <p>Another scientist-ally of Prioré’s was Pierette Chateau-Reynaud
        Duprat. Over the years she worked with the Prioré method,
        showing that the Prioré ray had no direct effect on the
        trypanosomes themselves but stimulated and reinforced the
        defense mechanism of the infested organisms. [No one knew to
        investigate the regenerative system of the body, poorly
        understood and using the very kind of infolded EM extension to
        NLO that Prioré’s ray used.] The ray was shown to cause the
        rejection of both allografts and isografts, so that the machine
        affected not only the defense mechanisms of the organism but
        also the recognition system. The original P-1 (Prioré 1) machine
        affected cellular defense mechanisms. The second machine, P-2,
        seemed to act not on the cellular but on the humoral defense
        mechanisms. </p>
      <p>Prioré himself also cured cases of malaria and also
        tuberculosis in humans, but apparently did not publish these
        results. </p>
      <p>Biologist André Lwoff went from an ardent skeptic to an admirer
        and supporter of Prioré’s work, because of the undisputed
        results. His favorable opinion of the Prioré results prevailed
        in a DRME report on the matter, which was classified for some
        years. A synthesis of the report was published in November 1979
        by Herbert Gossot, Secretary General for the French Association
        for Bioelectromagnetism. Its title was, "A Scientific Balance
        Sheet on the Prioré Ray." It reports that two physicists who
        studied the machine in detail favorably correlated the machine’s
        ray to the results produced, and confirmed the biological
        efficacy of Prioré’s device. The two physicists were named
        Bottreau and Berteau. In their note to L’Academie, they were not
        allowed to even use the names of the laboratories where they
        worked, which were (1) the CNRS Magnetic Laboratory at Bellevue
        near Paris, and (2) the Laboratory of Ultra-Hertzian Optics and
        Talence near Bordeaux. </p>
      <p>Eventually the French Government backed the construction of a
        more powerful Prioré device. Professor Courrier had also sent a
        report on Pautrizel’s behalf to the Nobel Committee in 1979. The
        M-600 machine was built but its huge tube functioned only about
        a week before it exploded. Meanwhile Pautrizel, working with a
        smaller machine, verified the utility of the Prioré Ray on
        atherosclerosis. Rebuilding the M-600 went slowly. The machine
        weighed some 50 tons and required 3-1/2 stories to contain it.
        The pyrex tube was 60 cm in diameter and 6 meters tall. It
        imploded twice and was replaced each time. The coil which
        generated the DC-pulsed magnetic field weighed 5.5 tons and had
        11 miles of copper wire. During the week or 10 days that the
        machine was in operation, the results were formidable. The
        results were presented in notes to the Academy of Sciences by
        Pautrizel and his team in 1978. </p>
      <p>Pautrizel then came under suppression himself, with funds being
        pulled, postings being denied, etc. Pautrizel eventually became
        so emotionally overwrought that he gave up his medical career
        and retired and gave himself over to alcohol. Every one of the
        collaborators of Pautrizel saw their careers put in jeopardy,
        compromised, or broken. </p>
      <p>About this time Prioré's doctoral thesis, backed by both
        Pautrizel and Nobel Laureate André Lwoff himself, was summarily
        refused by the President of the University of Bordeaux. </p>
      <p>In 1977 Professor Georges Dubourg urged Prioré to treat human
        cancer patients and jolt the medical establishment. Pautrizel
        contacted Courrier, who gave the green light. A few terminal
        cancer patients whose immune defense systems had been
        disastrously weakened by chemotherapy or radiation or both, were
        treated. At least one was totally cured. The others lived,
        without pain, for much longer than predicted by standard
        prognosis. The results were submitted to the French Academy of
        Medicine for publication – and were rejected. </p>
      <p>Pautrizel in final desperation turned to a journalist,
        Jean-Michel Graille, to tell the story. Graille researched for
        four years, publishing three long articles in Sud-Ouest France,
        and finally a book, <u>Dossier Priore: Une Nouvelle Affaire
          Pasteur</u>. [<u>The Prioré Dossier: A New Pasteur Affair</u>?]




        De Noel, Paris, 1984. [in French]. </p>
      <p>From 1965 to 1980, the Prioré project spent about 20 million
        francs. Results were positively demonstrated, many of them
        sensational. </p>
      <p>Prioré suffered a debilitating stroke or similar complication
        in 1981 and died in May 1983 after a lengthy debilitated period.
      </p>
      <p>Admiral Pierre Emeury, conseiller scientifique de la
        presidence, discovered L’Affaire Prioré. His inquest led him to
        conclude that the Prioré discovery was the most important
        medical discovery of the entire century. </p>
      <p>The suppression of such a revolutionary discovery<i>, even
          though its technical methodology was not understood</i>,
        remains one of the heinous examples of scientific dogma blocking
        highly innovative research and results. Untold millions of human
        lives would have been saved had science and government acted
        along scientific lines. </p>

        He was quite correct: It was the longitudinal EM radiations and
        their induction of time-domain pumping of the nonlinear cells
        and every part of them that provided the cellular time reversal
        from the diseased state back to the previous healthy state. </p>

        that cured terminal tumors in laboratory animals under rigorous
        scientific protocols and while working with eminent French
        scientists. Treatment with the device also cured

      <p><b><u>Comment</u>:</b> Orchitis is inflammation of a testes.
        Trypanosomes are protozoan flagellates of genus <i>trypanosoma</i>
        which infect humans and animals and are responsible for various
        serious diseases such as Chaga's disease, dourine, nagana,
        sleeping sickness, and surra. <i>Chaga's disease</i> is marked
        by prolonged high fever, edema, and enlargement of the spleen,
        liver, and lymph nodes. <i>Dourine</i> is a disease favoring
        horses and asses, marked by inflammation of the genitals,
        subcutaneous edematous plaques, low-grade fever, progressive
        paralysis, emaciation, and death. <i>Nagana</i> is a highly
        fatal disease in/of domestic animals in tropical Africa marked
        by fluctuating fever, inappetance, edematous swelling, and
        sluggishness, and is transmitted by the tsetse fly and possibly
        by other biting flies. <i>Sleeping sickness</i> is a serious
        disease that is prevalent in much of tropical Africa; it is
        marked by fever, protracted lethargy, tremors, and loss of
        weight, and is transmitted by tsetse flies. <i>Surra</i> is a
        severe Old World febrile and hemorrhagic disease of domestic
        animals and is transmitted by biting insects. </p>

      <p><b><u>Comment</u>:</b> Lymphosarcoma is a malignant lymphoma
        (malignant tumor of lymph or lymph-like tissue) that tends to
        metastasize freely and spread throughout the body. It easily
        leads to the condition of lymphomatosis, which is the presence
        of multiple lymphomas in the body, including wide distribution
        through the various organs, lymph tissue, and tissue resembling
        lymph tissue. A lymphoblast is a cell giving rise to
        lymphocytes, the colorless weakly motile cells produced in
        lymphoid tissue and include the cellular mediators of immunity,
        constituting some 20 to 30 percent of the leukocytes (white
        blood cells) of normal human blood. In effect the experimenters
        have healed a transplanted condition that represents a serious
        leukemia. </p>

      <p>Bearden, T. E. (1997-2001) Collection of various draft research
        papers and write-ups. Strongly updates and significantly expands
        version of work in 1998 and prior. Pumping any mass with
        longitudinal EM waves produces time-reversal of the pumped mass,
        and the mechanism and results must be interpreted by a
        combination of extended nonlinear optics for time domain pumping
        and general relativity. The correspondent to the NLO input
        "signal wave" in this case is the spacetime internested
        curvatures (the spacetime engine, or vacuum engine) associated
        with the pumped mass and all its parts, including even the
        quarks in its nucleons. The output is an amplified specific
        vacuum <i>anti</i>-engine, that precisely reverses the mass
        (either living or inert) back over its previous changes of
        3-spatial form with respect to the flow of time. This is the
        fundamental mechanism utilized by the body's Regeneration and
        Recovery (R&amp;R) system, within its limitations. The Prioré
        approach used a far more powerful application of the body's
        method by which the R&amp;R system is able to slowly reverse
        cellular damage back to a previous earlier healthy state. The
        author has also extended the method by inputting an additional
        vacuum engine, so that time-reversal of the mass can be
        "steered" into any related form desired, whether or not the mass
        ever previously existed in that 3-spatial state. Eventually, we
        will probably produce a book from these research draft papers. </p>

        of cancer, and a long-term cumulative mechanism for cancer
        incorporating all contributing factors. Cancer is often a result
        of the body's electrical master cellular control system sending
        an order (a <i>vacuum engine</i>) to the most affected cells
        (in a long condition of hypoxic stress) to dedifferentiate back
        toward anaerobic cells, from their dim ancestry on the primeval
        earth. Explains in depth how the Prioré method causes an
        amplified counterorder (an <i>amplified vacuum anti-engine</i>)
        to be issued, redifferentiating the cancerous cell back to a
        normal cell. <u>Note added</u>: This entire engine-antiengine
        area and functioning can be adequately modeled in Evans' O(3)
        electrodynamics as a subset of Sachs' unified field theory. </p>

        "Saving the Lives of Mass BW Casualties from Terrorist BW
        Strikes on U.S. Population Centers," April 2, 1998, 36 p.
        Explains that longitudinal EM wave pumping in the Prioré device
        was time-domain pumping. Viewed general relativistically, this
        temporal pumping produced a time-reversal of the entire cellular
        mass and all its components, from its diseased state back to a
        previous healthy state. Advances an extension to the method
        which allows the targeted "past" state to be deliberately
        determined as desired, whether or not the pumped mass ever
        possessed that physical state. Proposes a crash project to
        develop a portable Prioré-type treatment unit in 18 months, to
        be used in treatment of mass casualties after terrorist BW
        attacks on U.S. population centers. 36 p. Two color briefings
