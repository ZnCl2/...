      Handout picture released from Japan's Kinki University professor
      Shigeki Hontsu shows a tooth-patch, an ultra thin biocompatible
      film made from hydroxyapatitte. Scientists in Japan have created a
      microscopically thin film that can coat individual teeth to
      prevent decay or to make them appear whiter, the chief researcher
      said.<br>
      <br>
      AFP - Scientists in Japan have created a microscopically thin film
      that can coat individual teeth to prevent decay or to make them
      appear whiter, the chief researcher said.<br>
      <br>
      The "tooth patch" is a hard-wearing and ultra-flexible material
      made from hydroxyapatite, the main mineral in tooth enamel, that
      could also mean an end to sensitive teeth.<br>
      <br>
      "This is the world's first flexible apatite sheet, which we hope
      to use to protect teeth or repair damaged enamel," said Shigeki
      Hontsu, professor at Kinki University's Faculty of
      Biology-Oriented Science and Technology in western Japan.<br>
      <br>
      "Dentists used to think an all-apatite sheet was just a dream, but
      we are aiming to create artificial enamel," the outermost layer of
      a tooth, he said earlier this month.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers can create film just 0.004 millimetres (0.00016
      inches) thick by firing lasers at compressed blocks of
      hydroxyapatite in a vacuum to make individual particles pop out.<br>
      <br>
      These particles fall onto a block of salt which is heated to
      crystallise them, before the salt stand is dissolved in water.<br>
      <br>
      The film is scooped up onto filter paper and dried, after which it
      is robust enough to be picked up by a pair of tweezers.<br>
      <br>
      "The moment you put it on a tooth surface, it becomes invisible.
      You can barely see it if you examine it under a light," Hontsu
      told AFP by telephone.<br>
      <br>
      The sheet has a number of minute holes that allow liquid and air
      to escape from underneath to prevent their forming bubbles when it
      is applied onto a tooth.<br>
      <br>
      One problem is that it takes almost one day for the film to adhere
      firmly to the tooth's surface, said Hontsu.<br>
      <br>
      The film is currently transparent but it is possible to make it
      white for use in cosmetic dentistry.<br>
      <br>
      Researchers are experimenting on disused human teeth at the moment
      but the team will soon move to tests with animals, Hontsu said,
      adding he was also trying it on his own teeth.<br>
      <br>
      Five years or more would be needed before the film could be used
      in practical dental treatment such as covering exposed dentin --
      the sensitive layer underneath enamel -- but it could be used
      cosmetically within three years, Hontsu said.<br>
      <br>
      The technology, which has been jointly developed with Kazushi
      Yoshikawa, associate professor at Osaka Dental University, is
      patented in Japan and South Korea and applications are under way
      in the United States, Europe and China.<br>

      <br>
      Inventor: HONTSU SHIGEKI, et al.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- It is intended
      to provide a biocompatible transparent sheet which is highly
      capable of absorbing a biocompatible or biologically-relevant
      substance and usable as a novel biological material, enables
      real-time observation of the proliferation and differentiation of
      living cells and so on and has sufficient flexibility and
      softness. This biocompatible transparent sheet is produced by
      forming a biocompatible ceramic film (2) by, for example, the
      laser ablation method on a base material (1) being soluble in a
      solvent (11) in which the biocompatible ceramic is insoluble,
      dipping the base material (1) having the film formed thereon in
      the solvent (11) to thereby dissolve the base material (1) and
      then drying the film (2) thus separated.; By seeding and growing
      cells on the surface of this biocompatible transparent sheet (2)
      having sufficient flexibility and softness, it is possible to
      construct a cell sheet which can be directly transplanted into an
      affected part.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TECHNICAL FIELD</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a biocompatible
      transparent sheet which exhibits a biocompatibility and a high
      bioadherence of ability to adsorb a biologically relevant
      substance, which can be used as a novel biomaterial, and which can
      be used to observe the propagation, differentiation, and/or the
      like of living cells in real time; a method for producing the
      biocompatible transparent sheet; and a cell sheet which is
      prepared in such a manner that cells are seeded on the
      biocompatible transparent sheet and then propagated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND ART</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Biocompatible ceramics such as hydroxyapatite have high
      biocompatibility; hence, metals and ceramics coated with
      hydroxyapatite are excellent biomaterials. It has been confirmed
      that the propagation and/or differentiation of cells can be
      promoted in such a manner that the cells are cultured on
      substrates of these materials (see Patent Document 1). Sheets
      coated with the biocompatible ceramics have high abilities to
      adsorb biologically relevant substances and therefore have been
      investigated for use as isolation/analysis sheets for nucleic
      acids, proteins, and the like (see Patent Documents 2 and 3).
      Furthermore, there are transparent strips which are used to
      directly observe living cells and which are prepared by grinding a
      bulk of biocompatible ceramics sintered at high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] In addition to these sheets, a high bioadherence cultured
      sell sheet laminated on a porous film made from a hydrophobic
      organic solvent solution containing a biodegradable polymer and an
      amphipatic polymer (see Patent Document 4) or fibrous film, and a
      layered sheet of such high bioadherence cultured sell sheet (see
      Patent Document 5) are known hitherto.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Substrates coated with biocompatible ceramics are
      non-flexible and therefore are limited in working range. Cells
      cultured on the coatings cannot be collected such that tissues
      composed of the cells perform desired functions. Any cell sheets
      that are absorbed in living organisms after transplantation cannot
      be prepared. Since metal and ceramic substrates are opaque, it is
      impossible to observe the behavior, such as adhesion or
      differentiation, of living cells in real time.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The biocompatible ceramic-coated sheets can adsorb the
      biologically relevant substances or can be used to isolate the
      biologically relevant substances but cannot be used to observe the
      interaction between the biologically relevant substances in real
      time because these sheets are opaque.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Further, there is a limitation on thinning the bulk of
      biocompatible ceramics by grinding; hence, any transparent strips
      which are flexible and soft cannot be obtained from the bulk
      biocompatible ceramics. Therefore, such transparent strips cannot
      be used as coating materials for tissues, such as soft tissues,
      required to be soft.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In addition, the porous film contains a synthetic resin of
      amphiphatic polymer and therefore may be biologically toxic. The
      high bioadherence cell culturing sheet contains the fibrin gel and
      therefore may cause viral infections.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0008] It is an object of the present invention to provide a
      biocompatible transparent sheet that is flexible, soft, and safe.
      The biocompatible transparent sheet has high biocompatibility and
      a high ability to adsorb a biologically relevant substance, can be
      used as a novel biomaterial, and can be used to observe the
      propagation, differentiation, and/or the like of living cells in
      real time.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The present invention is characterized in that the
      biocompatible transparent sheet is produced in such a manner that
      a biocompatible ceramic film is formed on a substrate soluble in a
      solvent incapable of dissolving biocompatible ceramics and the
      substrate is then dissolved in the solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The biocompatible transparent sheet of the present
      invention has much biocompatibility, a high bioadherence and a
      safety. Therefore, the biocompatible transparent sheet can be used
      as a novel biomaterial or used as a sheet for isolating or
      adsorbing a protein or DNA or a substrate for culturing cells. The
      cells cultured on such biocompatible transparent sheet can be
      directly used for transplantation without requiring a peeling
      operation or the like. The biocompatible sheet is transparent and
      therefore it can be used to monitor the propagation and/or
      differentiation of cells or biomolecular attraction in real time.
      The shape of the sheet can be varied by varying the shape of the
      substrate. The biocompatible transparent sheet is flexible and
      soft and therefore can be used as a coating material applied to a
      portion that has not been coated with the biocompatible ceramic
      film. If cells are seeded on the biocompatible transparent sheet,
      the cells are grafted thereto or propagated thereon. Hence, if the
      biocompatible transparent sheet is used as a substrate for cell
      culture, a cell sheet which can be directly transplanted to an
      affected area together with cells can be obtained.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Biocompatible Transparent
        Sheet</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0020] A biocompatible transparent sheet according to the present
      invention includes only a biocompatible ceramic film including no
      support and is produced through steps schematically shown in FIGS.
      1(a) to 1(e). The production of the biocompatible transparent
      sheet principally includes a film-forming step and a dissolving
      step and may further include a drying step and a heat-treating
      step for crystallization. These steps are described below in
      detail.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) Film-Forming Step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0021] In the film-forming step, the biocompatible ceramic film 2
      is formed on a substrate 1 shown in FIG. 1(a) by a laser abrasion
      process or the like. FIG. 1(b) shows the completion of the film.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">i) Substrate</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0022] The substrate 1 is made of a material soluble in a solvent
      incapable of dissolving biocompatible ceramics. The material is
      not particularly limited. Examples of the material include alkali
      metal halides such as sodium chloride and potassium chloride,
      water-soluble inorganic slats such as amorphous magnesium oxide,
      and water-soluble organic compounds such as crystalline amino
      acids including glycine. In particular, sodium chloride is
      preferable because sodium chloride can be readily crystallized and
      is inexpensive.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The substrate 1 has a tabular shape as shown in FIG. 1(a).
      The shape of the substrate 1 is not limited to such a shape. The
      substrate 1 may have an arbitrary shape, such as a hemispherical
      shape or a tubular shape, suitable for producing the biocompatible
      transparent sheet.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(ii) Biocompatible Ceramics</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0024] Biocompatible ceramics refer to apatite, raw materials
      therefore, and mixtures containing the raw materials. The
      appetites herein refer to minerals having the formula M10(ZOn)6X2,
      wherein M represents, for example, Ca, Na, Mg, Ba, K, Zn, or Al;
      ZOn represents, for example, PO4, SO4, or CO3; and X represents,
      for example, OH, F, O, or CO3. Examples of the apatite usually
      include hydroxyapatite and carboxyapatite. In particular, a
      hydroxyapatite is preferably used herein due to exhibiting a high
      biocompatibility. An exemplary source material of the apatite is
      tricalcium phosphate (TCP). An exemplary mixture containing the
      apatite is a bioapatite obtained from a bovine bone or the like.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0000] (iii) Laser Abrasion
        Process</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0025] The laser ablation process is explained below in reference
      to FIG. 2, which shows a schematic view of a laser ablation system
      5.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As shown in FIG. 2, the substrate 1 is rotatably fixed on a
      sample holder (not shown) mounted in a vacuum deposition chamber
      51. A molded material formed of a powder of the biocompatible
      ceramics by pressure forming with a pressure mold is mounted on a
      target 52 in a position opposed to the substrate 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The vacuum deposition chamber 51 is evacuated to a
      predetermined vacuum level with an evacuation unit 53. After
      having completed of evacuation, the substrate 1 is heated to a
      predetermined temperature with a heater 54 and rotated with the
      sample holder.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] A steam-containing gas or a carbon dioxide-containing gas
      is introduced into the vacuum deposition chamber 51 through a gas
      introduction nozzle 55. The target 52 is irradiated with a laser
      beam L generated from a laser beam apparatus 56 including a laser
      beam generator 56, for example, a ArF excimer laser beam
      generator, a mirror 56b, a lens 56, and the like. This causes the
      biocompatible ceramics contained in the target 52 to be decomposed
      into atoms, ions, clusters, and/or the like, whereby a surface of
      the substrate 1 that faces the target 52 is covered with a
      biocompatible coating of apatite ceramics. Examples of the
      steam-containing gas include steam, an oxygen-steam mixed gas, an
      argon-steam mixed gas, a helium-steam mixed gas, a nitrogen-steam
      mixed gas, and an air-steam mixed gas. Examples of the carbon
      dioxide-containing gas include carbon dioxide, an
      oxygen-steam-carbon dioxide mixed gas, an argon-steam-carbon
      dioxide mixed gas, a helium-steam-carbon dioxide mixed gas, a
      nitrogen-steam-carbon dioxide mixed gas, and an air-steam-carbon
      dioxide mixed gas. These gases can be used alone or in
      combination.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In order to allow the biocompatible transparent sheet to be
      flexible and soft and In order to allow the biocompatible
      transparent sheet to have a predetermined strength, the
      biocompatible transparent sheet has a thickness of 1 to 100 [mu]m
      and preferably 40 to 50 [mu]m. Therefore, conditions for forming
      the biocompatible ceramic film by the laser ablation process, for
      example, the temperature of the substrate and the pressure of an
      atmosphere gas, need to be adjusted in consideration of the
      configuration and/or performance of the laser ablation system such
      that the biocompatible transparent sheet has a thickness within
      the above range.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) Dissolving Step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0030] In the dissolving step, the substrate 1 having the
      biocompatible ceramic film thereon is dipped in a solvent, whereby
      the substrate is dissolved off. FIG. 1(c) shows a situation in
      which the substrate 1 having the biocompatible ceramic film 2
      thereon is dipped in the solvent 11 contained in a vessel 10. FIG.
      1(d) shows a situation in which the substrate 1 is dissolved off.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(i) Solvent</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0031] The solvent is not particularly limited except that the
      solvent is incapable of dissolving the biocompatible ceramic film
      2. Examples of the solvent include polar solvents and nonpolar
      solvents. Preferable examples of the solvent include aqueous
      solvents, which are inexpensive and non-toxic. Particularly
      preferable examples of the solvent include pure water, buffer
      solutions for cell culture, and liquid culture media for cell
      culture.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3) Drying Step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0032] In the drying step, the biocompatible ceramic film 2, which
      is separated from the substrate 1 because the substrate 1 is
      dissolved off, is taken out of the solvent 11 and then naturally
      or mechanically dried. FIG. 1(e) shows the biocompatible ceramic
      film 2 that has been dried up.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As described above, the biocompatible transparent sheet can
      be produced by a combination of the above established techniques,
      that is, film formation, solvent immersion, and film drying. The
      above-mentioned transparent sheet having a high biocompatibility,
      can be used as a novel biomaterial, and can be used to observe the
      propagation, differentiation, and/or the like of living cells in
      real time.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The present invention is not limited to the above
      embodiment. Various modifications may be made within the scope of
      the present invention as set forth in the claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] For example, a substrate 7 shown in FIG. 3(a) may be used.
      This substrate 7, as well as that substrate 1, includes a part 7a
      made of a material soluble in the solvent 11 and another part 7b
      made of a material, such as glass or steel, insoluble in the
      solvent 11. As shown in FIG. 3(b), this substrate 7 may further
      include projections 7c which are made of a material soluble in the
      solvent 11 and which are arranged on the upper surface of the part
      7a in a predetermined pattern.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] If this substrate 7 is used, other substrates need not be
      prepared for the production of biocompatible transparent sheets;
      hence, the biocompatible transparent sheets can be produced at low
      cost. If this substrate 7, which includes the projections 7c
      arranged in a predetermined pattern as shown in FIG. 3(b), is
      used, a biocompatible transparent ceramic sheet 8 having
      perforations 8a as shown in FIG. 3(d) can be produced in 5 such a
      manner that a biocompatible ceramic film 8 is formed (a
      film-forming step, the state of the formed film is shown in FIG.
      3(c)), this substrate 7 is dissolved off (a dissolving step), and
      the biocompatible ceramic film 8 is then dried (a drying step) as
      described in the above embodiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] This substrate 7 can be produced in such a manner that a
      coating of a material soluble in the solvent 11 is formed on a
      glass or steel sheet insoluble in the solvent 11 by a laser
      ablation process, a sputtering process, an ion beam deposition
      process, an electron beam deposition process, a 15 vacuum
      evaporation process, a molecular beam epitaxy process, a chemical
      vapor deposition process, or the like; a liquid containing the
      material soluble in the solvent 11 is sprayed on the coating, and
      the coating is then dried.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] For this biocompatible transparent sheet 8, the diameter of
      the perforations 8a and the distance between the perforations 8a
      can be controlled by varying the size of the projections 7c and
      the distance between the projections 7c, respectively. This is
      effective in controlling the rate of cell proliferation. Cells can
      be propagated in such a manner that substances are exchanged
      through the perforations 8a; hence, different types of cells can
      be propagated on both surfaces of this biocompatible transparent
      sheet 8. A multilayer sheet which contains different types of
      cells and which has a complicated structure can be readily
      produced by tacking a plurality of sheets identical to this
      biocompatible transparent sheet 8 having the different cells
      propagated on both surfaces thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In the film-forming step, the following process may be used
      instead of the laser ablation process: for example, a sputtering
      process, an ion beam deposition process, an electron beam
      deposition process, a vacuum evaporation process, a molecular beam
      epitaxy process, a chemical vapor deposition process, or the like.
      After the biocompatible ceramic film is formed or dried, the
      biocompatible ceramic film may be heat-treated in a
      steam-containing gas or a carbon dioxide-containing gas at a high
      temperature of 300[deg.] C. to 1200[deg.] C. in a heat-treating
      step so as to be crystallized. This allows the biocompatible
      transparent sheet to be denser.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Furthermore, a plurality of different biocompatible
      ceramics may be used in combination. In particular, for example,
      bioapatite and stoichiometric apatite may be used in combination.
      The bioapatite used herein is bioabsorbable and therefore is
      superior in tissue inducibility. In contrast, the stoichiometric
      apatite used herein remains in living organisms and therefore is
      superior in tissue stability. A combination of these apatites is
      effective in producing a sheet having a tissue inducibility and
      tissue stability. This sheet is transparent and therefore can be
      used to observe living cells with a microscope by the excellent
      tissue-inducible effect of the bioapatite.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">2. Cell Sheet</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0041] A cell sheet according to the present invention is one
      prepared by propagating cells on a surface of a biocompatible
      transparent sheet and can be directly transplanted to an affected
      area.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(1) Cells</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0042] Examples of the cells include, but are not limited to,
      corneal epithelial cells, epidermal keratinocytes, oral mucosal
      cells, conjunctival epithelial cells, osteoblastic cells, nerve
      cells, cardiac muscle cells, fibrocytes, vascular endothelial
      cells, hepatic parenchymal cells, adipose cells, and stem cells
      capable of differentiating into these cells. These cells may be
      used alone or in combination. The origins of these cells need not
      be particularly limited. Examples of the origins thereof include
      human, canine, cat, rabbit, rat, pig, and sheep. In the case where
      the cell sheet is used to human therapy, human cells are
      preferably used.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) Culturing Process</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0043] In particular, the cells are cultured as described below.
      The biocompatible transparent sheet is placed into a culture
      vessel such as a petri dish, an appropriate cell culture solution
      is poured into the petri dish, a culture medium is removed, and
      the cell culture solution is caused to penetrate the biocompatible
      transparent sheet. The culture medium is replaced with fresh one
      several times and the biocompatible transparent sheet is then left
      for an appropriate time, whereby the biocompatible transparent
      sheet is impregnated with the cell culture solution. The cells are
      seeded on the biocompatible transparent sheet, the cell culture
      solution poured into the petri dish, and the cells are then
      cultured for an appropriate period under ordinary culture
      conditions. The cell culture solution may be replaced with fresh
      one as required.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The cells may be propagated on both surfaces of the
      biocompatible transparent sheet instead of that the cells are
      propagated on one surface thereof. If a biocompatible transparent
      sheet having perforations is used and different types of cells are
      propagated respectively on both surfaces thereof, only humoral
      factors which are produced by these cells and which are released
      into a culture solution are allowed to pass through the
      perforations pass through the perforations. This provides, for
      example, a cell sheet which has epithelial cells (for example,
      epidermal keratinocytes) propagated on one surface thereof and
      feeder cells propagated on the other surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Examples of the feeder cells used include fibrocytes,
      tissue stem cells, and embryo-stem cells. The feeder cells are not
      particularly limited and may be freely modified depending on
      applications thereof. The epithelial cells and the feeder cells
      need not isolated from one type animal. However, the epithelial
      cells and the feeder cells are preferably isolated from one type
      animal in the case where this sheet is used for transplantation.
      Alternatively, the epithelial cells and the feeder cells are
      preferably isolated from human in the case where this sheet is
      used for human therapy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(3) Culture Medium</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0046] A culture medium used to culture the cells may be ordinary
      one and is not particularly limited. Examples of the culture
      medium include D-MEM, MEM, HamF12 medium, and HamF10 medium. These
      culture media may be supplemented with a fetal calf serum or no
      serum. In the case where the cell sheet is used for human therapy,
      the culture medium preferably contains a component which has an
      obvious origin or which is certified to be used as a medical drug.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(4) Transplantation Technique</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0047] The cell sheet having the cells propagated thereon is
      directly transplanted to an affected area alone or in combination
      with a plurality of stacked sheets identical to the cell sheet.
      The use of the stacked sheets allows a three-dimensional tissue
      composed of the cells to be transplanted to the affected area. A
      technique using, for example, a pair of tweezers is used to take
      the cell sheet out of the culture solution, to stack the cell
      sheet on the sheets, and to transplant the cell sheet to the
      affected area.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A technique for securing the transplanted cell sheet to a
      living tissue is not particularly limited and may be a known one.
      The cell sheet may be secured to the living tissue with sutures.
      Alternatively, the cell sheet may be attached to the affected area
      and then covered with a bandage by making use of the compatibility
      between the cell sheet and the living tissue.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(5) Applicable Disorders</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0049] Disorders to which the cell sheet is applicable are not
      particularly limited. In particular, the cell sheet having
      chondrocytes propagated thereon can be used to treat
      osteoarthritis, a cardiac muscle sheet having cardiac muscle cells
      propagated thereon can be used to treat ischemic heart disease,
      and stacked cell sheets each having epidermal cells or dermal
      cells propagated thereon can be used to treat burn injuries,
      keloids, birthmarks, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The present invention is further described in detail with
      reference to examples below. The claims of the present application
      are not limited to the examples in any sense.<br>

        Transparent Sheet</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0051] A hydroxyapatite film is formed on a substrate of sodium
      chloride crystal through a laser ablation process. In particular,
      the sodium chloride crystal substrate of 10 mm*10 mm*2.5 mm, was
      fixed on a sample holder mounted in a laser ablation system (which
      was designed by Hontsu Laboratory of the biology-oriented science
      and technology school of Kinki University and was manufactured by
      Seinan Industries Co., Ltd.) and was then treated for 18 hours by
      the laser ablation process using an ArF excimer laser
      ([lambda]=193 nm, a pulse width of 20 nanoseconds), whereby the
      hydroxyapatite film was formed. The hydroxyapatite film had a
      thickness of about 12 [mu]m. The temperature of a substrate was
      300[deg.] C., an atmosphere gas used was an oxygen-steam mixed
      gas, and the mixed gas had a pressure of 0.8 mTorr.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The sodium chloride crystal having the hydroxyapatite film
      formed thereon was dipped in pure water such that sodium chloride
      was eluted, whereby the hydroxyapatite film, which was
      transparent, was isolated. The isolated transparent hydroxyapatite
      film was cleaned with pure water, naturally dried, and then
      post-annealed (heat-treated) at 400[deg.] C. for ten hours in an
      oxygen-steam atmosphere, whereby the transparent hydroxyapatite
      film was crystallized into a biocompatible transparent sheet.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">(2) Evaluation of Produced
        Biocompatible Transparent Sheet</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br>
      [0053] FIG. 4 shows the biocompatible transparent sheet produced
      as described above. The thickness thereof was determined to be
      about 12 [mu]m with a stylus-type thickness meter. The X-ray
      diffraction pattern of the biocompatible transparent sheet was
      measured by 2[theta]-[theta] X-ray diffractometry. FIG. 5 shows
      the measurement results. The X-ray diffraction pattern shown in
      FIG. 5 indicates that the biocompatible transparent sheet, which
      was produced by a method according to the present invention, is
      crystalline. A force was applied to the biocompatible transparent
      sheet, whereby the biocompatible transparent sheet was bent as
      shown in FIG. 6. This confirms that the biocompatible transparent
      sheet is flexible and soft. A cell sheet was prepared in such a
      manner that the biocompatible transparent sheet was dipped in 15%
      FBS-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (D-MEM) placed
      in a culture petri dish, 2 ml of a solution containing human
      osteoblastic cells suspended at a density of 2*10&lt;5
      &gt;cells/ml was poured onto the biocompatible transparent sheet,
      and the human osteoblastic cells were then cultured for 24 hours
      in an incubator (37[deg.] C., a CO2 concentration of 5%). The cell
      sheet was observed with a phase-contrast microscope. FIG. 7 shows
      the observation results. After the human osteoblastic cells were
      cultured for 12 days, the cell sheet was capable of being grasped
      with a pair of tweezers as shown in FIG. 8.<br>

        Transparent Sheet</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0054] A 2-mm thick glass plate was surface-treated for four hours
      by a laser ablation process in the same manner as that described
      in Example 1, whereby the glass plate was coated with amorphous
      magnesium oxide at a thickness of 5 [mu]m. A 0.1-mm thick metal
      mask having holes, arranged in a matrix at intervals of 100 [mu]m,
      having a diameter of 50 [mu]m was placed onto the glass plate. The
      glass plate was treated for eight hours by a laser ablation
      process such that amorphous magnesium oxide pillars with a height
      of 20 [mu]m were formed, whereby a substrate having surface
      micro-irregularities was prepared.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The substrate, which had the surface micro-irregularities,
      was fixed on a sample holder mounted in a laser ablation system
      and was then treated for 18 hours by a laser ablation process
      using an ArF excimer laser ([lambda]=193 nm, a pulse width of 20
      nanoseconds) in the same manner as that described in Example 1,
      whereby the substrate was coated with a hydroxyapatite film having
      a thickness of about 12 [mu]m. The temperature of the substrate
      was equal to room temperature, an atmosphere gas used was an
      oxygen-steam mixed gas, and the mixed gas had a pressure of 0.8
      mTorr.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The substrate was coated with the hydroxyapatite film was
      dipped in pure water such that a portion made of amorphous
      magnesium oxide was dissolved off, whereby the hydroxyapatite
      film, which was transparent, was separated from the glass plate.
      The separated transparent hydroxyapatite film was cleaned with
      pure water and then naturally dried, whereby a biocompatible
      transparent sheet having perforations, arranged in a matrix at
      intervals of 100 [mu]m, having a diameter of 50 [mu]m was
      obtained. FIG. 9 is a micrograph of the biocompatible transparent
      sheet.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- Provided are a
      hard tissue regeneration material, which has an excellent ability
      to regenerate a hard tissue, highly effectively promotes
      recalcification of dental enamel and has good protection
      performance and good aesthetic properties, and a hard tissue
      regeneration method. The hard tissue regeneration material is a
      biocompatible ceramic film and has flexibility and softness. The
      biocompatible ceramic film is obtained by, for example, immersing
      a base material, on which a biocompatible ceramic film is formed,
      in a solvent to thereby dissolve or separate the base material, in
      said solvent the biocompatible ceramic being insoluble but at
      least a part of the base material being soluble. The hard tissue
      regeneration method comprises bonding the aforesaid hard tissue
      regeneration material to a hard tissue defect or winding the
      material therearound.<br>
