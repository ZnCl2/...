      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0001] 1. Technical Field</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The technology relates to the production of hydrogen gas in
      a generator that includes a pair of electrodes and an electrolyte,
      and more particularly relates to the production of hydrogen
      without applying an external source of electrical energy to the
      electrodes, wherein at least one electrode comprises magnetic
      nano-particles.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0003] 2. Description of the
        Related Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0004] Hydrogen gas is a valuable commodity with many current uses
      and potentially wide ranging future uses. Currently many countries
      are evaluating the installation of a "hydrogen highway" that would
      provide hydrogen refueling stations for a national fleet of
      hydrogen-powered vehicles. Currently, several auto manufacturers
      (e.g., BMW and Honda) are demonstrating hydrogen powered vehicles.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Aside from the potential for large scale uses of hydrogen
      to power automobiles, hydrogen also potentially provides a clean
      fuel from which to generate electricity for other purposes. This
      is especially desirable if the production of hydrogen does not
      generate greenhouse gasses, or otherwise has a "small carbon
      footprint" so that it has potential environmental benefits over
      fossil fuels.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] One of the methods of generating hydrogen is by the
      electrolysis of water in an electrolysis cell. However, this
      method requires an input of electrical energy that might be
      generated by combustion of fossil fuels thereby releasing carbon
      dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the environment.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] An exemplary embodiment provides an apparatus for
      generating hydrogen. The apparatus includes an outer housing
      having an interior divided into an upper portion and a lower
      portion separated by a septum. The lower portion contains an
      electrolyte comprising zinc hydroxide dissolved therein, and
      nano-particles comprising nickel. The lower portion also contains
      a first electrode at least partially immersed in the electrolyte.
      The first electrode has several features including a non-ferrous,
      conductive electrode housing enclosing at least one magnet, with
      the electrode housing at least partially covered with
      nano-particles of nickel, tungsten, cobalt, or alloys of these. In
      addition, the lower portion of the outer housing contains a second
      electrode of aluminum that is at least partially immersed in the
      electrolyte. The generator also has a vent in communication with
      the upper portion of the interior of the housing for removal of
      generated hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Another exemplary embodiment provides an apparatus for
      generating hydrogen that has an outer housing having an interior
      divided into an upper portion and a lower portion separated by a
      septum. The lower portion contains an electrolyte and a composite
      electrode at least partially immersed in the electrolyte. The
      electrolyte includes zinc hydroxide dissolved therein. The
      composite electrode has several features including a non-ferrous,
      conductive electrode housing enclosing at least one magnet. An
      outer surface of the electrode housing is at least partially
      covered with nano-particles held in place by magnetic attraction
      of the at least one magnet to thereby form another electrode in
      direct contact with the first electrode. The nano-particles may be
      of nickel, iron, tungsten, cobalt, or alloys of these. The
      generator apparatus has a vent in communication with the upper
      portion of the interior of the outer housing for removal of
      generated hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another exemplary embodiment provides a method of
      generating hydrogen gas without applying electrical energy from an
      outside source. The method includes the steps of providing an
      electrolyte comprising zinc hydroxide, and disposing a first
      electrode comprised of aluminum in the provided electrolyte. It
      also includes disposing a second electrode comprised of a
      non-ferrous housing in the electrolyte. The non-ferrous housing
      contains at least one magnet and the outer surface of the housing
      is at least partially covered with nano-particles of nickel,
      tungsten, iron, cobalt, or alloys of these. In addition, the steps
      include producing hydrogen gas at the first electrode without
      applying a current from an external source to the first electrode
      or to the second electrode, and collecting the hydrogen gas
      produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] A further exemplary embodiment provides yet another method
      of generating hydrogen gas without applying electrical energy from
      an outside source. The method includes the steps of providing an
      electrolyte that includes zinc hydroxide, and disposing a first
      electrode in the provided electrolyte. The first electrode is
      comprised of aluminum and has a cavity formed therein that
      contains at least one magnet. An outer surface of the first
      electrode is at least partially covered with nano-particles that
      form a second electrode in contact with the first electrode. The
      steps further include producing hydrogen gas without applying an
      external current to the electrode, and collecting the hydrogen gas
      produced in the generator.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0014] The exemplary embodiments provide hydrogen generators that
      do not require the input of energy from an external source. More
      particularly, the consumables for the exemplary embodiments of
      hydrogen generators include aluminum electrodes and water only. At
      least one electrode has a non-ferrous housing containing at least
      one magnet, and nano-particles adhered thereto by magnetic forces.
      In another feature, a coating of magnetic nano-particles is either
      used to form an electrode or to form an integral part of an
      electrode. In addition, the initiation, termination and rate of
      hydrogen generation may be controlled by relatively simple
      mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] FIG. 1 is a drawing of an exemplary two-electrode hydrogen
      generator 100, which does not require the application of an
      external electrical current. The configuration and materials may
      vary and those skilled in the art will appreciate that actual
      configurations may be influenced by capacity for hydrogen
      generation, electrode size, electrode materials, and other
      parameters.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Briefly, the generator 100 of FIG. 1 includes a housing 110
      that is divided horizontally into an upper portion 112 and a lower
      portion 114 by a septum 116. The lower portion contains two
      electrodes 130 and 150. The electrodes 130, 150 are electrically
      connected by a conductive element 160.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Generator 100 commences operation when electrolyte 125 is
      supplied through electrolyte feeder tube 118 from the upper
      portion 112 of the housing 110 to the lower portion 114. When the
      electrolyte 125, described below, enters the lower portion 114
      through the feeder tube 118, a chemical reaction begins and the
      aluminum electrode 150 is consumed as the reaction proceeds. The
      chemical reactions are described below. The chemical reactions,
      and hydrogen production from the reactions, can be terminated by
      the removal of the electrolyte 125 through the feeder tube 118, or
      by another means including, but not limited to, a drain line at
      the base of housing 110, not shown. Hydrogen gas produced at
      electrode 130 is exhausted through vent tube 120. The production
      of hydrogen continues until all the consumables are consumed. The
      consumables include water and the electrode 150.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The exemplary generator of FIG. 1 includes an electrode 150
      that is composed of aluminum. The other electrode, electrode 130,
      is a composite structure and is composed of three elements. In
      this exemplary embodiment, composite electrode 130 includes
      firstly a non-ferrous tube electrically-conductive element, such
      as a copper tube 132. Copper tube 132 encloses in its annular
      cavity either a single magnet or a plurality of magnets 134.
      Electrode 130 secondly includes one or more cylindrical magnets
      134. These magnet(s) 134 may be diametrically polarized rather
      than axially polarized, to enhance performance, but either will
      suffice to the task. Diametric polarization may provide greater
      efficiency in hydrogen generation. Thirdly, the electrode 130
      includes nano-particles 140 attracted by magnet(s) 134 that adhere
      by magnetic force to at least a portion of the outer surface of
      tube 132. While these nano-particles are shown schematically as
      spaced from the tube 132, for reasons of clarity, they are in fact
      held to the outer surface of tube 132 to thereby complete the
      structure of electrode 130. The nano-particles 140 may be selected
      from magnetic particles such as nickel, iron, tungsten, cobalt,
      and the like, and their alloys. Because of its multiple structural
      features, electrode 130 may be regarded as a "composite
      electrode."<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Because of their high surface area to volume ratio, the
      nano-particles provide a very large surface area from which the
      electrode 130 releases hydrogen, when the two electrodes 130, 150
      are connected to each other electrically via connector 160. To be
      operative, the conductive electrical connection 160 connects
      electrodes 130 and 150 to complete a circuit. Accordingly,
      hydrogen production may be stopped by opening this electrical
      connection but chemical reaction with the electrolyte and erosion
      of the aluminum electrode 150 will continue for some time.
      Hydrogen production may also be controlled by controlling the
      electrical resistance of connector 160 either through material
      selection, or through dimensions, or by adding a variable,
      controllable resistance element to it.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The exemplary electrolyte 125 is aqueous and is produced
      from a liquid mixture that includes colloidal silver, colloidal
      magnesium, and sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide dissolved
      in distilled water. Zinc is placed in this liquid mixture along
      with a nickel electrode. The zinc is allowed to digest and the
      resulting liquid mixture, after removal of any excess undigested
      zinc, is the electrolyte 125.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In another exemplary embodiment, that may be scaled up or
      down as to volumes and weights, the exemplary electrolyte
      includes:<br>
      <br>
      [0022] 50 ml colloidal silver<br>
      <br>
      [0023] 50 ml colloidal magnesium<br>
      <br>
      [0024] 50 ml distilled water<br>
      <br>
      [0025] 20 grams sodium hydroxide<br>
      <br>
      [0026] 20 grams potassium hydroxide<br>
      <br>
      [0027] This mixture may be placed in a container that includes a
      nickel electrode and a zinc electrode of about 7 grams of
      elemental zinc. The zinc is allowed to digest. After digestion,
      the remaining zinc is removed. The liquid mixture produced is an
      example of an electrolyte.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] It is theorized, without being bound, that in the generator
      100 of FIG. 1, an exchange reaction takes place on the surface of
      the aluminum electrode 150 with the zinc hydroxide in the
      electrolyte solution. This reaction forms metallic zinc on the
      surface of the aluminum. This metallic zinc in turn reacts with
      the nano-particles 140 producing hydrogen gas at electrode 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] It is further theorized, without being bound, that during
      hydrogen production, the zinc hydroxide of the electrolyte is
      reduced to zinc on the aluminum electrode. The zinc reacts with
      the nano-nickel (or nano-particles of iron, cobalt, tungsten, and
      the like) in the strong base electrolyte, thereby producing
      hydrogen on the nano-particle covered electrode 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] It was observed that there is some hydrogen produced off
      the surface of the aluminum electrode 150. It is theorized,
      without being bound, that this results in an apparent greater
      hydrogen production than might be expected from stoichiometry.
      This hydrogen, it is believed without being bound, results from a
      further reaction that converts ZnOH to Zn and a reaction
      converting the aluminum to form Al2O3. It is theorized, without
      being bound, that the following reactions A, B take place:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 6ZnOH+4Al=6Zn+2Al2O3+3H2 [A]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] 2Zn+NaOH/KOH (in presence of Nickel)+2H2O=2ZnOH+NaOH/KOH+H2
      [B]<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Regardless of any theory, the exemplary hydrogen generator
      of FIG. 1 provides a controlled rate of hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 2 illustrates an alternative exemplary embodiment. In
      this embodiment, the generator 100 also includes a housing 110
      divided into upper 112 and lower 114 portions by a horizontal
      septum 116. In comparison with the example of FIG. 1, the
      non-ferrous tube 132 is eliminated. Instead, composite electrode
      150 includes a housing with a cavity, such as an aluminum tube 154
      that houses one or more cylindrical magnets 134 in its annular
      space. As in the embodiment of FIG. 1, nano-nickel particles 140
      in the electrolyte 125 are attracted to the outer surface of the
      aluminum tube 154 of an electrode 150 and form a coat on the
      surface held in place by magnetic fields. Once the outer surface
      of the tube 132 is at least partially coated with
      magnetically-adhering nano-particles, the nano-particles
      effectively form the second electrode, which is in direct contact
      with the aluminum tube 154 that is the first electrode. Hydrogen
      is produced from this nano-particle-coated surface. Since the
      nano-particles 140 are in direct electrical communication with the
      aluminum tube 154 of electrode 150, an electrical connector 160 is
      not required to connect the nano-particles to the aluminum
      electrode housing 154.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Hydrogen production rate and volume is similar to the
      embodiment of FIG. 1, but the overall generator complexity and
      cost is reduced. To control hydrogen production, the extent of the
      immersion of the electrode 150 in the electrolyte 125 may be
      controlled. In one mode of operation, the electrode 150 is lowered
      or raised in the solution to control the hydrogen production rate.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLES</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0034] A number of experiments were performed to determine the
      hydrogen production based on the consumption of aluminum. One gram
      of aluminum will produce 1.23 liters of hydrogen. The results
      appear to indicate producing hydrogen in an amount greater than
      might be expected. In all of these experiments, the generator was
      in accordance with FIG. 2, and the electrolyte was produced as
      follows. The following components were mixed together:<br>
      <br>
      [0035] 50 ml colloidal silver<br>
      <br>
      [0036] 50 ml colloidal magnesium<br>

      [0038] 20 grams sodium hydroxide<br>
      <br>
      [0039] 20 grams potassium hydroxide<br>
      <br>
      [0040] This mixture was placed in a beaker containing a nickel
      electrode. To this was added 7 grams of elemental zinc, connected
      to the nickel electrode, and the zinc was allowed to digest,
      thereby producing electrolyte 125. The nickel electrode and any
      remaining zinc were then removed. The resulting liquid was used as
      the electrolyte.<br>

      <br>
      [0045] The average hydrogen production was 1.5 liters per gram of

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] 1. Technical Field</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The technology relates to the production of hydrogen, and
      more particularly to the use of chemical reaction to produce
      hydrogen in a system that includes an electrode formed from
      metallic nano-particles suspended in an electrolyte.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0004] 2. Description of the
        Related Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] There is a growing demand for sources of energy other than
      from the combustion of fossil fuels. The combustion of these fuels
      has long been associated with the production of undesirable
      combustion gas products, such as sulfur dioxide. In more recent
      years, it has also become a matter of concern that the combustion
      of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The
      growing concentration of carbon dioxide has been implicated in the
      phenomenon variously known as "global warming" or "climate
      change." Accordingly, there is a desire to develop other sources
      of energy, or to find ways to utilize fossil fuels which may
      entail technologies that either sequester or otherwise remove the
      potential for carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Among the proposed alternatives to fossil fuels as a source
      of energy that do not release carbon dioxide are solar power, wind
      power, nuclear power, marine (wave) power and hydrogen. Each of
      these power sources poses challenges and each may occupy a niche
      in a long term energy strategy aimed at minimizing the release of
      carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Hydrogen is a plentiful
      elemental gas but is usually chemically bound or in the atmosphere
      in a relatively small percentage. Accordingly, the large scale use
      of hydrogen requires technologies that will produce hydrogen from
      its chemically bound state and permit its capture in a form useful
      for conversion to energy, by combustion or otherwise. Much
      attention has been devoted to fuel cell technology, and the use of
      hydrogen as a potential automotive fuel is also being explored.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] An exemplary embodiment provides a controlled electrolysis
      system for generating hydrogen gas by creating an electrode with a
      magnetic field and controlling the magnetic field strength to
      control a rate of hydrogen production. The system includes a first
      electrode and an electrolyte in contact with it that includes
      colloidal silver, colloidal magnesium, and nano-metal particles.
      The system also has a conductive body portion in contact with the
      electrolyte. Further, it includes a magnetic element having a
      magnetic field at least partially encompassing the conductive body
      portion. The magnetic field pulls nano-metal particles from the
      electrolyte to at least partially coat a surface of the conductive
      body portion to form a second electrode. The strength of the
      magnetic field is controllable to either increase or decrease a
      rate of hydrogen production by controlling an extent of the
      surface of the conductive body portion coated with nano-metal
      particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A further exemplary embodiment provides a system for
      controlled generation of hydrogen gas by creating an electrode
      with a magnetic field and controlling the magnetic field strength
      to control a rate of hydrogen production. The system includes a
      first non-magnetic electrode and, in contact with it, an
      electrolyte that includes colloidal silver, colloidal magnesium,
      and nano-metal particles. In addition, it has a hollow body having
      a conductive portion and an insulated portion. The hollow body is
      in contact with the electrolyte. Further, it has a magnetic
      element having a magnetic field. The magnetic field at least
      partially encompasses the hollow body and pulls nano-metal
      particles from the electrolyte to at least partially coat an outer
      surface of the conductive portion to form a second electrolyte and
      produce hydrogen. The extent of influence of the magnetic field on
      the conductive portion is controlledly variable to control the
      rate of hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Another exemplary embodiment provides a system for
      controlled generation of hydrogen gas by creating an electrode
      with a magnetic field and controlling the magnetic field strength
      to control a rate of hydrogen production. The system includes a
      cell that has a first non-magnetic electrode, an electrolyte in
      contact with it, and a hollow body that forms a second electrode,
      when coated with nano-metal particles, under influence of a
      magnetic field. The electrolyte may include colloidal silver,
      colloidal magnesium, and nano-metal particles. The nano-metal
      particles may include at least one of nano-nickel, nano-iron or a
      nano-nickel-iron alloy. The hollow body has a conductive portion
      and an insulated portion and is in contact with the electrolyte.
      The hollow conductive body is coated with nano-metal from the
      electrolyte to form a second electrode, when the system is in
      hydrogen production mode. Further, the system includes at least
      one controlled magnetic element located within the hollow body and
      pulling nano-metal particles from the electrolyte to at least
      partially coat an outer surface of the hollow body to form the
      second electrode to produce hydrogen by electrolysis. The magnetic
      element controls a rate of hydrogen production by controlling the
      strength of the magnetic field at the conductive portion of the
      hollow body. The system also includes a gas-tight end cover
      enclosing contents of the cell, the end cover having an outlet
      therein for removal of produced hydrogen.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0015] In the following description, numerous details may be set
      forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present
      technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the
      art that the present technology may be practiced without some of
      these specific details. For the most part, details considering
      alternate material choices and design configurations and the like
      have been omitted inasmuch as details are not necessary to obtain
      complete understanding of the present technology and are within
      the skills of persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In the specification, the term "exemplary embodiment" means
      a non limiting example of an embodiment of the technology.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] FIG. 1 illustrates a simplified exemplary embodiment of a
      system that is a single cell hydrogen generator 5 that includes a
      chemical inert container 10, in this instance an elongate
      container, of a non-magnetic material, typically a chemically
      inert material. Container 10 may vary in configuration. Container
      10 includes a hollow electrical (copper or any other conductive
      material which is non-reactive) conductor 20 and a zinc electrode
      30 abuts one end of the conductor 20. Exemplary embodiments may
      have either zinc electrodes or aluminum electrodes when the
      electrolyte contains zinc hydroxide so that zinc will plate out
      onto the aluminum electrode. Other non-magnetic electrode
      materials may also be used. The conductor 20 may be of any
      configuration that is suitable. In this example, conductor 20 is
      composed of a hollow, copper tube. Conductor 20 is divided into
      two sections (insulated portion 40 and conductive portion 45), the
      outer surface of conductor 20 exposed to the electrolyte 65. The
      second electrode is formed by nano-metal particles, such as
      nano-nickel and iron particles, attracted to and coated over the
      non-insulated area, conductive portion 45, of conductor 20, in the
      illustrated example. The hollow interior of conductor 20 is
      accessible from outside of container 10 through a port in the end
      seal 80, which also has an outlet 90 for produced hydrogen gas.
      This allows the movable magnetic element 50 to be selectively
      positioned within conductor 20 to control hydrogen production.
      Hydrogen production is at a maximum when the magnetic element 50
      is fully inserted into the conductive portion 45 of the conductor
      and the maximum area of this conductive portion 45 is coated with
      attracted nano-metal particles. As the magnetic element 50 is
      withdrawn, the area of the conductor 20 that is coated with
      nano-metal is reduced (and hydrogen production is also reduced)
      until the magnet is completely shielded within insulated portion
      40. When magnetic element 50 is completely shielded within
      insulated portion 40, the magnetic field strength at conductive
      portion 45 is weak or non-existent and the conductive portion 45
      is substantially free of magnetically attracted nano-metal
      particles. At this point, hydrogen production is minimized or
      terminated. Thus, the movement of magnetic element 50, which
      affects the magnetic field strength at the conductive portion 45,
      acts to control hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The second electrode (conductive portion 45 as coated with
      nano-metal) is produced by the magnetic field effects of a movable
      magnetic element 50 and nano-particles 60 of the electrolyte 65.
      Thus, when the magnetic element 50 is in the insulated portion 40
      of conductor 20, as illustrated in FIG. 2, the cell 5 is inactive.
      In this "off" mode, the presence of the magnetic field of magnetic
      element 50 attracts metallic nano-particles 60 of the electrolyte
      65 to the outer surfaces of the insulated portion 40, resulting in
      no hydrogen production. When the magnetic element 50 is moved into
      the conductive portion 45 of conductor 20, the attracted
      nano-particles follow the magnetic field, thereby forming a
      metallic nano-particle coating on the outside surface of the
      conductive portion 45, thereby forming the second electrode. In
      this "on" mode, the hydrogen generator cell 5 is active and
      produces hydrogen. Thus, the magnetic element 50 should be in a
      position to exert a sufficiently strong magnetic field strength on
      the conductive portion 45 of conductor 20 to attract nano-metal
      particles to it to form the second electrode. Once the second
      electrode is formed, hydrogen production commences. As the
      magnetic field moves to cover a greater portion of the area of
      conductive portion 45, the extent of the proportion of the area of
      conductive portion 45 coated with nano-metal particles increases,
      and hydrogen production increases. Likewise, as the magnetic
      element 50 retreats and the magnetic field encompasses less of the
      area of conductive portion 45, the area of nano-metal coating is
      reduced, and consequently hydrogen production is reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] An exemplary embodiment of a movable magnetic element 50
      may selected, for example, from the rare earth magnets, or any
      other magnetic material that will attract magnetic nano-particles,
      such as nickel and nano-iron, so strongly as to cause these
      particles to move through electrolyte 60 to attach to insulated
      surfaces of conductor 20 (off position) or to the non-insulated
      portion of conductor 20 (on position) forming the second
      electrode. These magnetic nano-particles may be selected from
      nano-nickel, nano-iron, nano-alloys of nickel and iron, or other
      nano-metals, such as tungsten, tungsten carbide, platinum, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] An exemplary embodiment of the electrolyte 65 may include
      colloidal silver, colloidal magnesium, sodium hydroxide, potassium
      hydroxide and distilled water. Into this electrolyte solution is
      placed nano-nickel and nano-iron particles. For example, a 100 ml
      solution might be composed of 10 ml of colloidal silver, 10 ml of
      colloidal magnesium, 80 ml of distilled water, and 33 grams of the
      hydroxide. To this may be added 0.5 grams of nano-nickel and 0.5
      grams of nano-iron particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] FIG. 2 shows an exemplary embodiment of a hydrogen
      generator cell 5 with the magnetic element 50 in the "off"
      position, when no hydrogen is produced. The magnetic element 50 is
      within the insulated layer 40 and this attracts the nano-metal
      particles to the surface of the insulated layer 40. In an
      exemplary embodiment, the magnetic field pulls substantially all
      the nano-nickel and nano-iron particles onto the outer surface of
      hollow conductor 20. No second electrode is formed, because the
      nano-metal particles coat an insulated portion 40, and thus there
      is no hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In FIG. 3, in contrast, the magnetic element 50 is moved
      all the way into conductor 20 (i.e. inside conductive portion 45)
      to the proximity of the zinc electrode 30. The nano-metal
      particles are pulled onto the surface of conductive portion 45
      which is in close proximity of the zinc electrode 30, thereby
      allowing electrolysis to commence by making an electrical
      connection. As a result, electrolytic hydrogen production begins.
      The hydrogen is produced from the nano-metal electrode formed on
      the conductive portion 45 of hollow conductor 20. The production
      of hydrogen can be reduced or terminated by moving the magnetic
      element 50 toward the "off" position until it is within the
      insulated portion 40, as in FIG. 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In an exemplary embodiment, the extent of insertion of the
      magnetic element 50 within the conductor 20, in other words, its
      location relative to the "on" and "off" positions described above,
      may be used to control the rate of hydrogen gas production from
      the hydrogen generator cell 5. Alternatively, the second electrode
      (which is formed by magnetically attracted nano-metal particles on
      conductive portion 45) may be sized for a particular hydrogen
      output by a predetermined sizing of the area of conductive portion
      45, or through application to the conductive portion 45 of a
      variable magnet permeable coating which will change the strength
      of the magnetic field. The production rate of hydrogen may also be
      controlled by temperature: increasing electrolyte temperature
      increases the rate of hydrogen generation.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIG. 4 illustrates an alternative exemplary embodiment
      wherein the magnetic element 50 is an electro-magnet movable
      laterally as shown by arrow 55. When power is supplied to the
      windings of the electro-magnet 50, it becomes magnetic. Thus, when
      fully inserted into the hollow conductor 20, the electro-magnetic
      element 50 pulls nano-particles onto the outer surface of
      conductive portion 45 of conductor 20 to form a second electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The electro-magnetic material of the electro-magnet(s) may
      be selected from any suitable material, such as electro-magnetic
      alloys of iron or steel. Operation of the hydrogen generation cell
      5 is similar to the above description using permanent magnets, but
      electro-magnets provide some additional flexibility and ease of
      control. For example, an electro-magnet readily permits control of
      hydrogen production by controlling magnetic field strength.
      Magnetic field strength may be controlled to some extent by

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0002] 1. Technical Field</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] The present technology relates to the field of
      electrolysis, and more particularly to the use of electrolysis
      techniques to produce hydrogen and oxygen gasses.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0004] 2. Description of the
        Related Art</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] In the field of electrolysis it is generally regarded as
      highly desirable to be able to produce hydrogen (and oxygen) at or
      near the Faraday Limit of 10.5873 Joules per ml, which is the
      power presumed necessary to be 100% efficient. While many systems
      have been proposed to meet this goal, it appears that electrolysis
      may often require exotic chemicals and complex electrical
      switching systems to exceed even a modest 70% of the Faraday
      Limit. Exceeding this limit of 10.5873 J/ml generally requires
      replenishing or replacing some consumables, for example, replacing
      electrodes due to dissolution and/or the replenishing of consumed
      chemical(s).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0006] An exemplary embodiment of an electrolysis cell and process
      produces hydrogen and oxygen gasses, by electrolysis of water, at
      efficiencies ranging above about 80% of the Faraday Limit and
      approaching and often exceeding about 90% of the Faraday Limit. An
      embodiment of the technology employs a minimum of two electrodes
      per cell to provide a system that requires little maintenance,
      such as electrode repair or maintenance of chemicals, other than
      addition of make up water to compensate for water consumed in the
      process. Another exemplary embodiment provides an electrolysis
      system that may use DC power rather than complex alternating
      current waveforms and fixed non-replaceable elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] An exemplary embodiment provides a method of producing
      hydrogen and oxygen from an aqueous solution. The method includes
      the steps of placing a graphite electrode and a nickel electrode
      in an alkaline electrolyte comprising colloidal silver, colloidal
      magnesium and aluminum powder, and applying a constant positive
      voltage to the nickel electrode. Further, the method includes
      cyclically applying a negative voltage potential to the graphite
      electrode by turning on the negative applied voltage for a first
      time period and switching off the negative voltage for a second
      time period. The second time period should be sufficient to permit
      removal of substantially all or at least some of any aluminum
      deposited on the graphite electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] An exemplary embodiment provides a cell producing hydrogen
      and oxygen gas from an aqueous solution. The cell includes an
      alkaline electrolyte having colloidal silver, colloidal magnesium,
      and a metal powder comprising aluminum powder. It also has at
      least one positive electrode disposed at least partially in the
      alkaline solution and at least one switching negative electrode
      that includes graphite, infused with a precious metal. The
      switching negative electrode is also disposed at least partially
      in the electrolyte. In addition, the cell has a first chamber
      configured and located to capture gas produced at the positive
      electrode; and a second chamber configured and located to capture
      gas produced at the at least one switching negative electrode.
      Further, it includes an automatic controller cyclically applying
      negative voltage potential to the switching negative electrode
      according to a predetermined sequence. In an alternate embodiment,
      the aluminum powder may be substituted with finely divided zinc
      hydroxide. In this instance, the positive electrode comprises
      nickel and is pre-treated with zinc, as explained here below<br>
      <br>
      [0009] An additional exemplary embodiment provides a cell
      producing hydrogen and oxygen gas from an aqueous electrolyte. The
      cell includes an alkaline electrolyte comprising colloidal silver,
      colloidal magnesium, and a metal powder comprising aluminum. The
      cell has at least one positive electrode disposed at least
      partially in the alkaline electrolyte; and a plurality of
      switching negative electrodes. The switching electrodes each
      comprise graphite, infused with a precious metal, and the
      plurality of switching negative electrodes is disposed at least
      partially in the alkaline electrolyte. The cell has a first
      chamber configured and located to capture gas produced at the
      positive electrode; and a second chamber configured and located to
      capture gas produced at the plurality of switching negative
      electrodes. The cell also includes an automatic controller
      cyclically applying negative voltage potential to each of the
      plurality of switching negative electrodes for a predetermined
      time and according to a predetermined sequence. In an alternate
      embodiment, the aluminum powder may be substituted with finely
      divided zinc hydroxide. In this instance, the positive electrode
      comprises nickel and is pre-treated with zinc, as explained here
      below<br>

      <br>
      [0020] In the following description, numerous details may be set
      forth to provide a thorough understanding of the present
      technology. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the
      art that the present technology may be practiced without these
      specific details. In other instances, well-known circuits have
      been shown in block diagram form in order not to obscure the
      present technology in unnecessary detail. For the most part,
      details considering alternate material choices and design
      configurations and the like have been omitted inasmuch as details
      are not necessary to obtain complete understanding of the present
      technology and are within the skills of persons of ordinary skill
      in the relevant art.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In the appended drawings, depicted features are not
      necessarily shown to scale. Further, like or similar features are
      designated by the same reference numeral through the several
      views, as far as possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of an
      electrolysis cell 5 that includes a chemical bath 30, which is
      cylindrical in this case, but which may be of another geometric
      configuration, such as square, hexagonal, etc., in cross section.
      The chemical bath 30 has a central electrode 10 to which is
      applied a fixed voltage. The central electrode is surrounded by
      six switched voltage electrodes 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 in this
      embodiment, although another number of electrodes may also be
      used. Each of these electrodes 20-25 are subjected to a pulsed or
      cyclical applied negative voltage. Thus, each switched electrode
      20-25 may be "on" (voltage applied) or "off" (voltage not
      applied). Thus, for example, each of switched electrodes 20-25 has
      a connector 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, respectively. As shown
      schematically in FIG. 2, a switch relay 90 includes a series of
      switches 80-85. Each of the switches 80-85 is able to close a
      circuit with a corresponding one of the connectors 60-65. When a
      switch is closed, a voltage is applied via the closed switch
      through the connector to the electrode. A constant voltage is
      applied via line 91 through connector 70 to the central electrode
      10. Thus, the switched electrodes 20-25 may be switched on in any
      pre-determined sequence such that one of the electrodes 20-25 is
      on while the others are off. FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a
      controller system 100 that may be used to achieve the switching
      automatically. Of course, other types of controllers are also
      useful as long as they can "pulse" the switched electrodes 20-25
      on and off and maintain a constant voltage at the central
      electrode 10. Further, the chemical bath 30 has separate gas
      chambers 40, 50 that are isolated from each other. The gas chamber
      50 surrounding an upper portion of central electrode 10 is an
      oxygen chamber, while the gas chamber surrounding upper portions
      of the switched electrodes 20-25 is a hydrogen chamber. These
      chambers are used to capture off-gasses from the electrolysis
      process produced at the electrodes, and the off gasses may be
      siphoned off from these chambers by conduits (not shown) for any
      useful purpose. More than two chambers may also be useful,
      depending upon the configuration of the chemical bath 30, the
      number of fixed electrodes 10 per chemical bath 30, the number of
      switched electrodes 20-25, and other factors. Chemical bath 30
      contains an electrolysis solution 35, indicated by its upper
      surface level in FIG. 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] A "switching cycle" is the time period between when a
      switching electrode is first turned on (or off) and when it is
      next turned on (or off). The switching electrodes are "pulsed" by
      a pulsing period that is the time period from being turned on to
      being turned off. Referring to FIG. 3, exemplary controller 100
      includes a variable timer 110 for setting the switching cycle
      time. The variable timer 110 is coupled to a decoder 130 through a
      divider 120. The decoder 130 sends signals to relay drivers
      140-145 (shown generically as 140-140n in FIG. 3, for example)
      that are each in communication with a corresponding relay switch
      80-85. The relay switches 80-85 are each coupled to a
      corresponding connector 60-65. As explained above, these
      connectors 60-65 are each in turn connected to a corresponding
      switched electrode 20-25.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] FIG. 5 is a schematic illustration of an exemplary and
      generalized embodiment of an electrolysis system 5 that has a
      single fixed voltage electrode 10 and n switched voltage
      electrode(s) 20, 20n. The illustrated embodiment shows a case
      where "n" equals 2, but of course n may be any integer. The
      positive electrode 10 is located at or near the center of the
      chemical bath 30 surrounded by a circular array of n electrodes
      20, 20n. These n electrodes 20, 20n may be in either a negatively
      charged state or off, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In an exemplary embodiment, the positively charged
      electrode 10 may be a nickel electrode. Another electrolytically
      equivalent electrode, such as nickel alloy, Incalloy(TM),
      tungsten, tungsten carbide, and the like, may also be useful. An
      exemplary embodiment of switched electrode element 20 is a
      proprietary carbon-based electrode that is available from Global
      Hydrogen, Inc. of Bertram, Tex. The chemical bath 30 utilized with
      this electrode combination may suitably include finely divided
      aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In another exemplary embodiment, the switched negative
      electrodes 20, 20n may include nickel, or nano nickel, or nano
      nickel and iron, or tungsten, or tungsten carbide. The positively
      charged electrode 10 may be graphite. In this embodiment, the
      chemical bath may contain finely divided zinc hydroxide, instead
      of aluminum.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to the example of FIG. 5, a fixed positive
      voltage is connected to connection line 91 and a negative voltage
      is connected to connection line 90. The fixed electrode 10 is
      connected directly to the positive voltage connection line 91. The
      electrode elements 20, 20n each include a connector 60-60n,
      respectively, and these connectors 60-60n may each be sequentially
      coupled to the negative voltage connection line 90 through a
      corresponding relay switch 80-80n.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The example of a chemical bath 30 shown in FIG. 5 includes
      two isolated gas chambers 40 and 50 to separate H2O (liquid),
      hydrogen (gas) and oxygen (gas). Details of the electrolysis
      solution 35 in the chemical bath 30 are described below.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] As used herein, the term "out-gasses" refers to gasses
      produced in the processes of embodiments including production
      through electrolysis and production through the reaction of metals
      with components of the electrolysis liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The exemplary embodiment of the system 5 shown in FIG. 5 is
      in a quiescent state with all negative electrodes 20, 20n off.
      External power may be supplied to electrodes 20-20n through
      corresponding relay switches 80-80n from connection line 90, and
      to electrode 10 via line 91. Electrode elements 20, 20n are always
      either (a) at negative voltage potential when switched on or (b)
      disconnected (or "off"). Electrode element 10 is always positive.
      However, reverse voltage may be applied with different results. In
      the quiescent state, all relays 80, 80n are in the normally open
      state and no gasses are emitted from either electrode 10 or 20,
      20n. Relays 80, 80n are operated sequentially (i.e. for the
      configuration in FIG. 5, connecting line 90 may rotate).<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Referring to FIG. 6, when relay 80 closes, it applies a (-)
      negative voltage to electrode 20 and electricity flows between
      electrode 20 and positive electrode 10 through the electrolytic
      solution of chemical bath 30. Electrolysis takes place in the
      chemical bath 30, so that oxygen out-gasses at electrode 10 while
      hydrogen out-gasses at electrode 20. This gas production continues
      for a time period that extends beyond the time when the controller
      100 relay switch 80 opens (disconnects from electrode 20) and
      closes relay 81 (not shown). The controlled process of timed
      opening and closing of relays according to a predetermined
      schedule is repeated sequentially for each electrode from 20
      through 20n, and then the cycle repeats starting at electrode 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] During the process, electrode 10 continues producing O2
      (gas) as long as the controller is sequencing and any of
      electrodes 20 through 20n produces H2 (gas) as long as it is live
      and for a period immediately after applied voltage is removed and
      it is dead. According to an exemplary embodiment, immediately
      after any electrode 20n is deselected by the controller and is
      dead, it will continue to produce H2 (gas) for a period of time,
      despite being disconnected. After a predetermined period of time,
      the controller 100 via the relay switching mechanism, for example
      as described above, switches the applied voltage from one
      electrode (e.g. electrode 20 (n-1)) to the next electrode (e.g.
      electrode 20n). The process repeats and continues to cycle until
      it is stopped, when the system returns to the quiescent state.
      Note that hydrogen is emitted from the (-) electrode and oxygen is
      emitted from the (+) electrode.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Referring to exemplary FIG. 7, the polarity of the
      electrodes is reversed relative to that of FIG. 6. For example, in
      FIG. 7, the central electrode 10 is negatively charged while the
      switched electrodes 20-20n are positively charged, when activated.
      Hydrogen is then produced at the electrodes 20-20n, while oxygen
      is produced at the central electrode 10.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Electrode Preparation</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0034] According to an exemplary embodiment, the system uses two
      types of electrodes: a metal electrode, desirably nickel or an
      alloy of nickel, and graphite. These electrodes are treated before
      being used. It is theorized, without being bound, that the
      treatment saturates the pores of the electrodes with colloidal
      material and that it also increases the effective surface area of
      the electrodes by etching their surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In an exemplary embodiment, a solution that includes
      colloidal platinum, available from Purest Colloids, Inc. of
      Westhampton, N.J., USA, may be used in pre-treating the
      electrodes. The treatment solution may be prepared by adding about
      75 ml of colloidal platinum to 75 ml distilled water and 10 ml of
      98% sulfuric acid. Of course, for larger batches, these volumes
      may be increased proportionately. The colloidal metal is not
      restricted to platinum but may be any colloidal precious metal
      such as gold, palladium, rhenium, ruthenium, and the like. The
      electrodes are immersed at least partially in the solution and a
      positive terminal of a power source may be connected to the nickel
      electrode and a negative to the graphite electrode. Upon current
      flow, the graphite electrode becomes impregnated with platinum.
      This may be carried out, for example, at 4 volts dc and a 5 amp
      current. Then, after elapse of a time period, typically but not
      necessarily in the range 10-15 seconds, polarity is reversed,
      applying the same current and voltage potential, to plate platinum
      onto the nickel electrode's surfaces. This reversing of polarity
      may be carried out several times, desirably while heating the
      electrolysis solution to about 108[deg.] F. The process may be
      carried out for about 10 minutes, and then the electrodes may be
      removed and washed in distilled water.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] An alternative embodiment of a method of electrode

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0037] As explained above with reference to FIG. 6, electrode
      element 10 has a positive voltage at all times and electrode
      elements 20, 20n are always either negative when connected, or
      otherwise disconnected. In the quiescent state, electrode elements
      20, 20n are disconnected by relays 80, 80n, respectively, and no
      gas is emitted from electrode elements 10 or 20, 20n. In the
      active state, the controller 100 closes and opens relays 80, 80n
      in a predetermined scheduled sequence around the illustrated
      circular cell until the process is terminated. When the controller
      100 closes relay element 80, a negative voltage is applied to
      electrode 20, for example, while electrode 10 is always positive.
      While relay 80 is closed, copious amounts of hydrogen are emitted
      from electrode element 20 and oxygen is emitted from electrode
      element 10. Due to electrolysis reactions, metal hydroxide present
      in the chemical bath solution plates out onto electrode 20 as a
      metallic coating while the electrolysis generates hydrogen and
      oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In an exemplary embodiment, the voltage controller 100 is
      preset or pre-programmed for a "relay closed" time period of three
      seconds for each electrode 20, 20n. Thus, it automatically closes
      a relay for each negative electrode sequentially for three
      seconds. As a consequence, the metal is plated onto the electrode
      for which the relay is closed (i.e. the "live" negative electrode)
      for three seconds. When the controller opens the relay, components
      of the chemical bath 30 solution commence reducing the plated out
      metal on the now dead electrode, thereby releasing copious
      hydrogen due to the reduction of metal to metal hydroxide, until
      substantially all the metal is dissolved back into element 30, or
      until a negative voltage potential is again applied to the
      electrode, when metal plating will recommence. In general, after
      the negative potential is disconnected from the electrode, the
      disconnected electrode 20 will continue producing gas at a
      gradually reducing rate and will substantially return to the
      quiescent state in about seven seconds. In the illustrated example
      embodiment shown in FIG. 1, there are six electrodes 20 which the
      controller 100 may sequentially connect to the negative connection
      lines 90 for three seconds each. Thus, the initial negative
      electrode 20 produces gas for a minimum of about ten seconds
      (three seconds while connected and seven seconds after
      disconnection). The electrode 20 will be selected for
      re-connection to line 90, according to the controller sequence,
      fifteen seconds after it was disconnected. The controller 100
      establishes a three-seconds "on" and fifteen-seconds "off"
      sequence for each electrode 20, 20n. The production rate of this
      system averages over about 90% of the hydrogen that stoichiometry
      would predict (see FIG. 8, Table 1).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The gas-producing electrochemical process (metal plating
      onto the electrode when it is live and metal converting back to
      metal hydroxide when the electrode is dead) is believed, without
      being bound, to be of a catalytic nature and should continue as
      long as H2O lost through conversion to hydrogen and oxygen is
      replenished. It is believed, without being bound, that the
      colloidal silver and colloidal magnesium along with palladium
      infused in the graphite electrode have a catalytic effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] When the controller 100 activates an electrode with an
      applied negative potential, for example electrode 20, electrical
      current will flow through the electrolyte chemical bath solution
      30 between positive electrode 10 and negative electrode 20. Metal
      is plated on electrode 20, and if the process is allowed to
      continue, electrode 20 would become increasingly heavily plated,
      thus changing its electrical potential. As a result, its rate of
      hydrogen gas production would decline and finally cease. However,
      according to embodiments of the present technology, electrode 20
      is disconnected (the applied potential is removed) after a
      predetermined period of time. In the non-limiting example
      described above, this time period was three seconds, although
      other longer or shorter time periods may be useful as well. In
      general, the time period may be selected based on several factors,
      one of which is to permit sufficient "electrode off" time to
      permit the chemical bath components to oxidize substantially all
      or so much of the metal from the electrode surface so that the
      amount of plated metal does not build up to the point of adversely
      affecting the rate of hydrogen gas production during the time
      period that the electrode is on. Thus, the chemicals in the
      electrolyte 35 may begin reacting with the metal deposited on
      electrode 20, thereby releasing more gas, and may substantially
      completely remove the deposited metal by the time electrode 20 is
      again selected by the controller 100 for activation. The total
      amount of gasses produced includes both (a) gas produced while an
      electrode is live and (b) gas produced when the electrode is dead.
      Accordingly, the electrical energy input needed to produce the
      total amount of gasses is less than would be the case if the gas
      produced under condition (b) also required energy (electricity)
      input.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The cycle time of the controller 100 may be set or
      pre-programmed to take into account various factors, including,
      but not limited to, power supplied to the electrodes, the voltage,
      the current, the electrode active surface area, the number of
      cells (a cell includes a negative electrode, the positive
      electrode and the chemical bath solution), and the cell
      configuration.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Controller</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0042] It is understood that the illustrated exemplary embodiment
      of controller 100 in FIGS. 3 and 4 is merely one of many
      potentially useful controllers provided for explanatory purposes.
      Other forms of electronic controllers, such as Asics, or software
      controlled devices or micro-processors may be substituted, for
      example.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A more detailed drawing of an embodiment of an exemplary
      controller 100 is shown in FIG. 4. For purposes of description,
      element 110 may be a variable LM324 Op Amp oscillator generating
      square waves controlled by the RC time constant of R1, R16 and
      C11. Element 110 may, for example, be adjusted for a three-minute
      output of Divider Q5. Divider 120 may be a seven stage CMOS
      Divider. Since the exemplary circuit has six switched elements
      20-20n, a four bit divider would suffice. The unused stages Q1-Q4
      buffer the clock for more accurate timing, if required. The
      outputs Q5-Q7 are input to an analog sixteen bit decoder 130. A
      digital decoder may also be used. The decoder drives a Bipolar NPN
      transistor(s) MOSFET substitutable and has an LED to indicate
      which element is selected. Output X6 130 returns the counter to
      reset, causing the divider 120 to reset starting the count over
      after every sixth count. The number of counts are thus=n, up to
      n=8 for this example of a chip, or n=16 by using additional logic
      or a 4:16 bit decoder. The base input of the transistors 140-140n
      are normally disconnected and grounded turning the transistor(s)
      "OFF." When the counter 120 selects the channel on Output X6 130,
      a positive voltage is applied to the selected transistor turning
      the selected coil on. Coils 80-80n apply voltage on line 90 to the
      appropriate electrode. A diode is used to suppress high voltage
      induced by switching of the coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The controller system 100 shown in FIGS. 3 and 4 operates
      the relays 80, 80n at precise predetermined times. A first LED
      (D2), which may be any color, such as red, pulses at the Adjusted
      Oscillator frequency and a second LED (D7), which may be any color
      (conveniently a different color from the first LED), pulses at the
      electrode timing frequency, which, in this example, is three
      seconds "live." Of course, timing can be set by monitoring the
      state changes of the LEDs (D8-D13).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] There are potentially a wide range of applications for the
      present technology. For example, FIG. 9 illustrates a residential
      application and FIG. 10 illustrates an automotive application.
      Other applications may become apparent to one of skill in the art
      who has read this disclosure. From the foregoing disclosure, it
      will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the
      techniques described herein may be applied to a wide variety of

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus
      for the production of hydrogen gas from water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Hydrogen gas is a valuable commodity with many current and
      potential uses. Hydrogen gas may be produced by a chemical
      reaction between water and a metal or metallic compound. Very
      reactive metals react with mineral acids to produce a salt plus
      hydrogen gas. Equations 1 through 5 are examples of this process,
      where HX represents any mineral acid. HX can represent, for
      example HCl, HBr, HI, H2SO4, HNO3, but includes all acids.<br>
      <br>
      2Li+2HX-&gt;H2+2LiX (1)<br>
      2K+2HX-&gt;H2+2KX (2)<br>
      2Na+2HX-&gt;H2+2NaX (3)<br>
      Ca+2HX-&gt;H2+CaX2 (4)<br>
      Mg+2HX-&gt;H2+MgX2 (5)<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Each of these reactions take place at an extremely high
      rate due to the very high activity of lithium, potassium, sodium,
      calcium, and magnesium, which are listed in order of their
      respective reaction rates, with lithium reacting the fastest and
      magnesium reacting the most slowly of this group of metals. In
      fact, these reactions take place at such an accelerated rate that
      they have not been considered to provide a useful method for the
      synthesis of hydrogen gas in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Metals of intermediate reactivity undergo the same reaction
      but at a much more controllable reaction rate. Equations 6 and 7
      are examples, again where HX represents all mineral acids.<br>
      <br>
      Zn+2HX-&gt;H2+ZnX2 (6)<br>
      2Al+6HX-&gt;3H2+2AlX3 (7)<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Reactions of this type provide a better method for the
      production of hydrogen gas due to their relatively slower and
      therefore more controllable reaction rate. Metals like these have
      not, however, been used in prior art production of diatomic
      hydrogen because of the expense of these metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Iron reacts with mineral acids by either of the following
      equations:<br>
      <br>
      Fe+2HX-&gt;H2+FeX2 (8)<br>
      <br>
      or<br>
      <br>
      2Fe+6HX-&gt;3H2+2FeX3 (9)<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Due to the rather low activity of iron, both of these
      reactions take place at a rather slow reaction rate. The reaction
      rates are so slow that these reactions have not been considered to
      provide a useful method for the production of diatomic hydrogen in
      the prior art. Thus, while iron does provide the availability and
      low price needed for the production of elemental hydrogen, it does
      not react at a rate great enough to make it useful for hydrogen
      production.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Metals such as silver, gold, and platinum are not found to
      undergo reaction with mineral acids under normal conditions in the
      prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Ag+HX-&gt;No Reaction (10)<br>
      Au+HX-&gt;No Reaction (11)<br>
      Pt+HX-&gt;No Reaction (12)<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Accordingly, a need exists for a method and apparatus for
      the efficient production of hydrogen gas using relatively
      inexpensive metals.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 1 shows a mixture and apparatus that may be used for
      the production of hydrogen. A reaction vessel 100 contains a
      reaction medium 102. The reaction medium preferably comprises
      water and an acid, and preferably has a pH less than 5, although
      other reaction media may be used including other solvents or
      non-liquid media such as gelatinous or gaseous media. The acid is
      preferably sulfuric acid with a variable concentration up to 98%
      by weight or hydrochloric acid with a variable concentration up to
      35% by weight, although other acids may be used. The reaction
      vessel 100 is inert to the reaction medium 102. The reaction
      medium 102 contains a first colloidal metal (not shown) suspended
      in the solution. The first colloidal metal is preferably a metal
      with low activity such as silver, gold, platinum, tin, lead,
      copper, zinc or cadmium, although other metals may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The reaction vessel 100 also preferably contains a second
      metal 104, at least partially submerged in the reaction medium
      102. The second metal 104 may be in any form but is preferably in
      the form of a solid with a relatively large surface area, such as
      pellet form. The second metal 104 is preferably a metal with a
      mid-range activity, such as iron, aluminum, zinc, nickel or tin.
      The second metal 104 preferably has a higher activity than the
      first colloidal metal. The second metal 104 is most preferably
      iron, because of its medium reactivity and low cost. Preferably,
      the reaction medium 102 also contains a second colloidal metal
      (not shown). The second colloidal metal preferably has a higher
      activity than the second metal 104, such as aluminum, magnesium,
      beryllium, and lithium. Preferably, the reaction vessel 100 also
      contains another metal (not shown), which is a different metal
      than the second metal 104, but which is in the same general form.
      Therefore, in the most preferable case, the reaction vessel 100
      contains two metals in solid form in contact with the reaction
      medium 102, as well as two colloidal metals suspended in the
      reaction medium 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Alternatively to the above, the reaction medium 102 may
      contain a metal salt or metal oxide, rather than an acid and the
      second metal 104, in addition to the one or more colloidal metals.
      Preferably, the reaction medium 102 contains a solid metal and
      either an acid or a metal salt or metal oxide of the same metal as
      the solid metal. It is believed that if the reaction medium 102
      initially contains a solid metal and a strong acid, such as HCl or
      H2SO4, the acid reacts with the solid metal, creating metal ions
      and releasing hydrogen gas, until the acid or solid metal is
      substantially consumed. It is also believed that a solution
      initially containing a metal salt along with a proper colloidal
      catalyst will become acidic, even if the initial pH is greater
      than 7. Additionally, the apparatus may comprise a combination of
      metal salts, oxides and solid metals, in addition to one or more
      colloidal metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The reaction vessel 100 has an outlet 106 to allow hydrogen
      gas (not shown) to escape. The reaction vessel may also have an
      inlet 108 for adding water or other constituents to maintain the
      proper concentrations. The reaction vessel may also include one or
      more anode (not shown) and one or more cathode (not shown) which
      contact the reaction medium. The anodes and cathodes may be used
      to provide electrical energy to the reaction or to utilize
      electrical energy created by the reactions for other purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Because the reactions expected to occur in the reaction
      vessel are believed to be collectively endothermic, an energy
      source 112 is also preferably provided to increase the rate of
      reaction, although the reaction may potentially be powered by
      ambient heat. While the energy source shown in FIG. 1 is a heater
      (hot plate), other forms of energy may be used including electric
      and light energy. There may be other effects of light or other
      electromagnetic radiation, in addition to the energy effect.
      Additionally, the reaction temperature is limited to about
      100[deg.] C. at atmospheric pressure where an aqueous solution is
      used as the reaction medium or boiling may occur (neglecting
      changes in the boiling point due to the addition of solutes).
      Therefore, it may be advantageous to perform the reactions in a
      reaction vessel 100 which is configured to maintain an internal
      pressure above atmospheric pressure so that higher reaction
      temperatures may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Most metals can be produced in a colloidal state in an
      aqueous solution. A colloid is a material composed of very small
      particles of one substance that are dispersed (suspended), but not
      dissolved in solution. Thus colloidal particles do not settle out
      of solution even though they exist in the solid state. A colloid
      of any particular metal is then a very small particle of that
      metal suspended in a solution. These suspended particles of metal
      may exist in the solid (metallic) form or in the ionic form, or as
      a mixture of the two. The very small size of the particles of
      these metals results in a very large effective surface area for
      the metal. This very large effective surface area for the metal
      can cause the surface reactions of the metal to increase
      dramatically when it comes into contact with other atoms or
      molecules. The colloidal metals used in the experiments described
      below were obtained using a colloidal silver machine sold by CS
      Prosystems of San Antonio, Tex. The website of CS Prosystems is
      www.csprosystems.com. Colloidal solutions of metals that are
      produced using this apparatus result from an electrolytic process
      and are thought to contain colloidal particles some of which are
      electrically neutral and some of which are positively charged.
      Other methods can be employed in the production of colloidal metal
      solutions where all of the colloidal particles are thought to be
      electrically neutral. It is believed that the positive charge on
      the colloidal metal particles used in the experiments described
      below provides additional rate enhancement effects. It is still
      believed however that it is to a great extent the size and the
      resulting surface area of the colloidal particles that causes a
      significant portion of the rate enhancement effects that are
      detailed below, regardless of the charge on the colloidal
      particles. Based on materials from the manufacturer, the particles
      of a metal in the colloidal solutions used in the experiments
      described below are believed to range in size between 0.001 and
      0.01 microns. In such a solution of colloidal metals, the
      concentration of the metals is believed to be between about 5 to
      20 parts per million.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] Alternative to using a catalyst in colloidal form, it may
      be possible to use a catalyst in another form that offers a high
      surface-area to volume ratio, such as a porous solid, nanometals,
      colloid-polymer nanocomposites and the like. In general, any
      catalysts may be in any form with an effective surface area of at
      least 298,000,000 m&lt;2 &gt; per cubic meter of catalyst metal,
      although smaller surface area ratios may also work.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Thus when any metal, regardless of its normal reactivity,
      is used in its colloidal form, the reaction of the metal with
      mineral acids can take place at an accelerated rate. Equations
      13-15 are thus general equations that are believed to occur for
      any metals in spite of their normal reactivity, where M represents
      any metal. M, for instance, can represent, but is not limited to,
      silver, copper, tin, zinc, lead, and cadmium. In fact, it has been
      found that the reactions shown in equations 13-15 occur at a
      significant reaction rate even in solutions of 1% aqueous acid.<br>
      <br>
      2M+2HX-&gt;2MX+H2 (13)<br>
      M+2HX-&gt;MX2+H2 (14)<br>
      2M+6HX-&gt;2MX3+3H2 (15)<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Even though equations 13-15 represent largely endothermic
      processes for a great many metals, particularly those of
      traditional low reactivity (for example, but not limited to,
      silver, gold, copper, tin, lead, and zinc), the rate of the
      reactions depicted in equations 13-15 is in fact very large due to
      the surface effects caused by the use of the colloidal metal.
      While reactions involved with equations 13-15 take place at a
      highly accelerated reaction rate, these reactions do not result in
      a useful production of elemental hydrogen since the colloidal
      metal by definition is present in very low concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] A useful preparation of hydrogen results, however, by the
      inclusion of a metal more reactive than the colloidal metal such
      as, but not limited to, metallic iron, metallic aluminum, or
      metallic nickel. Thus any colloidal metal in its ionic form would
      be expected to react with the metal Me as indicated in equation
      16, where those metals below Me on the electromotive or activity
      series of metals would react best.<br>
      <br>
      Me+M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;M+Me&lt;+&gt; (16)<br>
      <br>
      [0043] It is believed that the reaction illustrated by equation 16
      in fact takes place quite readily due to the large effective
      surface area of the colloidal ion, M&lt;+&gt; , and also due to
      the greater reactivity of the metal Me compared to any metal of
      lower reactivity which would be of preferable use. In fact, for
      metals normally lower in reactivity than Me, equation 16 would
      result in a highly exothermic reaction. The resulting metal, M,
      would be present in colloidal quantities and thus, it is believed,
      undergoes a facile reaction with any mineral acid including, but
      not limited to, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic
      acid, nitric acid, hydroiodic acid, perchloric acid, and chloric
      acid. However, the mineral acid is preferably sulfuric acid,
      H2SO4, or hydrochloric acid, HCl. Equation 17 describes this
      reaction where the formula HX (or H&lt;+&gt; +X&lt;-&gt; in its
      ionic form) is a general representation for any mineral acid.<br>
      <br>
      2M+2H&lt;+&gt; +2X&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2M&lt;+&gt; +H2+2X&lt;-&gt; (17)<br>
      <br>
      [0044] While equation 17 represents an endothermic reaction, it is
      believed the exothermicity of the reactions in equation 16
      compensates for this, making the combination of the two reactions
      energetically obtainable using the thermal energy supplied by
      ambient conditions. Of course the supply of additional energy
      would accelerate the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Consequently, it is believed that elemental hydrogen is
      efficiently and easily produced by the combination of the
      reactions shown in equations 18 and 19.<br>
      <br>
      4Me+4M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4M+4Me&lt;+&gt; (18)<br>
      4M+4H&lt;+&gt; +4X&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4M&lt;+&gt; +2H2+4X&lt;-&gt; (19)<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Thus the metal Me reacts with the colloidal metal ion in
      equation 18 to produce a colloidal metal and the ionic form of Me.
      The colloidal metal will then react with a mineral acid in
      equation 19 to produce elemental hydrogen and regenerate the
      colloidal metal ion. The colloidal metal ion will then react again
      by equation 18, followed again by equation 19, and so on in a
      chain reaction process to provide an efficient source of elemental
      hydrogen. In principle, any colloidal metal ion should undergo
      this process successfully. It is found that the reactions work
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal ion is lower in
      reactivity than the metal Me on the electromotive series table.
      The combining of equations 18 and 19 results in the net equation
      20. Equation 20 has as its result the production of elemental
      hydrogen from the reaction of the metal Me and a mineral acid.<br>
      <br>
      4 Me+4M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4M+4Me&lt;+&gt; (18)<br>
      +<br>
      4M+4H&lt;+&gt; +4X&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4M&lt;+&gt; +2H2+4X&lt;-&gt; (19)<br>
      =<br>
      4 Me+4H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4 Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2 (20)<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Equation 20 summarizes a process that provides a very
      efficient production of elemental hydrogen where the metal Me and
      acid are consumed. It is believed, however, that both the
      elemental metal Me and the acid are regenerated as a result of a
      voltaic electrochemical process or thermal process that follows.
      It is believed that a colloidal metal Mr (which can be the same
      one used in equation 18 or a different one) can undergo a voltaic
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 21 and 22.<br>
      <br>
      Cathode (reduction)<br>
      <br>
      4Mr&lt;+&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4Mr (21)<br>

      Anode (oxidation)<br>
      <br>
      2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +O2+4e&lt;-&gt; (22)<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The colloidal metal Mr can in principle be any metal, but
      reaction 21 progresses most efficiently when the metal has a
      higher (more positive) reduction potential. Thus, the reduction of
      the colloidal metal ion, as indicated in equation 21, takes place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal is lower than the metal
      Me on the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any
      colloidal metal will be successful, but reaction 21 works best
      with colloidal metals such as colloidal silver or lead, due to the
      high reduction potential of these metals. When lead, for example,
      is employed as the colloidal metal ion in equations 21 and 22, the
      pair of reactions is found to take place quite readily. The
      voltaic reaction produces a positive voltage as the oxidation and
      reduction reactions indicated take place. This positive voltage
      can be used to supply the energy required for other chemical
      processes. In fact, the voltage produced can even be used to
      supply an over potential for reactions employing equations 21 and
      22 taking place in another reaction vessel. Thus, this
      electrochemical process can be made to take place more quickly
      without the supply of an external source of energy. The resulting
      colloidal metal, Mr, can then react with oxidized ionic metal, Me,
      as indicated in equation 23 which would result in the regeneration
      of the metal, Me, and the regeneration of the colloidal metal in
      its oxidized form.<br>
      <br>
      4 Me&lt;+&gt; +4Mr-&gt;4Mr&lt;+&gt; +4Me (23)<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The reaction described by equation 23 could in fact occur
      using as starting material any colloidal metal, but will take
      place most effectively when the colloidal metal, Mr, appears above
      the metal, Me, on the electromotive series. The combining of
      equations 21-23 results in equation 24 which represents the
      regeneration of the elemental metal, Me, the regeneration of the
      acid, and the formation of elemental oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      4Mr&lt;+&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4Mr (21)<br>

      4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +4Me+O2 (24)<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The reaction shown in equations 21 and 22 seems to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals; however, the reaction depicted by
      equation 23 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      Mr, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 24, which is merely the
      sum of equations 21, 22, and 23, could in fact be maximally
      facilitated by either colloidal metals of higher activity or by
      colloidal metals of low activity. The relative importance of the
      reaction illustrated by equations 21 and 22 compared to the
      reaction shown in equation 23 would determine the characteristics
      of the colloidal metal that would best assist the net reaction in
      equation 24. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 24 proceeds at a maximal rate when the colloidal metal is
      of maximum activity, that is, when the colloidal metal is as high
      as possible on the electromotive series of metals. It has been
      found that the more reactive colloidal metals such as, but not
      limited to, colloidal magnesium ion or colloidal aluminum ion
      produce the most facile processes for the reduction of cationic
      metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The combination of equations 20 and 24 results in a net
      process indicated in equation 25. As discussed above, the reaction
      depicted in equation 21 proceeds most efficiently when the
      colloidal metal is found below the metal, Me, on the electromotive
      series. However, the reaction represented by equation 23 is most
      favorable when the colloidal metal is found above the metal, Me,
      on the electromotive series. Accordingly, it has been observed
      that the concurrent use of two colloidal metals, one above the
      metal, Me, and one below it in the electromotive series, for
      example, but not limited to, colloidal lead and colloidal
      aluminum, produces optimum results in terms of the efficiency of
      the net process. Since equation 25 merely depicts the
      decomposition of water into elemental hydrogen and elemental
      oxygen, the complete process for the production of elemental
      hydrogen now has only water as an expendable substance, and the
      only necessary energy source is supplied by ambient thermal
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      4Me+4H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2 (20)<br>
      4 Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +4Me+O2 (24)<br>
      2H2O-&gt;2H2+O2 (25)<br>
      <br>
      [0054] The net result of this process is exactly that which would
      result from the electrolysis of water. Here, however, no
      electrical energy needs to be supplied. Although the providing of
      additional energy would result in an enhanced rate of hydrogen
      formation, the reaction proceeds efficiently when the only energy
      supplied is ambient thermal energy. When additional energy is
      supplied, it can be supplied in the manner of thermal energy,
      electrical energy or as radiant energy. As discussed above, when
      the additional energy supplied is in the form of thermal energy,
      it may be preferable to use a reaction vessel 100 configured to
      maintain internal pressures greater than the prevailing
      atmospheric pressure in order increase the boiling point of the
      solution, and increase the amount of thermal energy that can be
      supplied. The colloidal metallic ion catalysts, as well as the
      metal Me, and the acid are regenerated in the process, leaving
      only water as a consumable material.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A further means by which the rate of hydrogen production
      could be increased would involve the inclusion of a nonmetal in
      the reaction such as, but not limited to, carbon or sulfur. Using
      the symbol Z to represent the nonmetal, equation 22 would be
      replaced by equation 22A which would provide a more facile
      reaction due to the thermodynamic stability of the oxide of the
      nonmetal.<br>
      <br>
      2H2O+Z-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +ZO2+4e&lt;-&gt; (22A)<br>
      <br>
      Equation 24 would then be replaced by equation 24A, and equation
      25 would be replaced by equation 25A.<br>
      <br>
      4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2O+Z-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +4Me+ZO2 (24A)<br>
      2H2O+Z-&gt;2H2+ZO2 (25A)<br>
      <br>
      Thus, rather than resulting in the formation of elemental oxygen,
      the reaction would produce an oxide of a nonmetal such as CO2 or
      SO2, where the thermodynamic stability of the nonmetal oxide would
      provide an additional driving force for the reaction, and thus
      result in an even faster rate of hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] An alternative to this process involves the introduction of
      hydrogen peroxide to react in the place of water. Thus, the
      reactions illustrated in equations 22 and 23 would be replaced by
      similar reactions illustrated by equations 26 and 27. The net
      result of these two reactions would be the reaction represented in
      equation 28, the production of elemental hydrogen using an
      elemental metal Me and a mineral acid as reactants.<br>
      <br>

      2Me+2H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;2Me&lt;+&gt; +H2 (28)<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The elemental metal, Me, as well as the mineral acid, would
      then be regenerated as a result of a different voltaic
      electrochemical process followed by a thermal reaction. Again a
      colloidal metal, Mr, reacts with hydrogen peroxide in an
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 29 and 30.<br>

      H2O2-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +O2+2e&lt;-&gt; (30)<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide has a larger (less
      negative) oxidation potential than water, as shown in the standard
      oxidation potentials listed below, the oxidation-reduction
      reaction resulting from equations 29 and 30 takes place at an
      enhanced rate compared to the oxidation-reduction reaction
      indicated by equations 21 and 22.<br>
      <br>

      oxidation=-0.695V<br>
      <br>
      [0061] The colloidal metal can in principle be any metal but works
      most efficiently when the metal has a higher (more positive)
      reduction potential. Thus, the regeneration process takes place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal is as low as possible on
      the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any colloidal
      metal will be successful, but the reaction works well with
      colloidal silver ion, for example, due to the high reduction
      potential of silver. When silver is employed as the colloidal
      metal ion in equations 29 and 30, the pair of reactions is found
      to take place quite readily. The voltaic reaction produces a
      positive voltage as the oxidation and reduction reactions
      indicated take place. This positive voltage can be used to supply
      the energy required for other chemical processes. In fact, the
      voltage produced can even be used to supply an over potential for
      reactions employing equations 29 and 30 taking place in another
      reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can be made to
      take place more quickly without the supply of an external source
      of energy. The resulting colloidal metal, Mr, will then react to
      regenerate the metal, Me (equation 31).<br>

      <br>
      [0062] The reaction illustrated by equation 31 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is more reactive
      than the metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 31 will
      proceed most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is above
      the metal, Me, on the electromotive series of metals. The
      combining of equations 29-31 results in equation 32 which
      represents the regeneration of the elemental metal, Me, the
      regeneration of the acid, and the formation of elemental oxygen.<br>

      [0063] The reaction shown in equations 29 and 30 seems to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals; however, the reaction depicted by
      equation 31 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      Mr, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 32, which is merely the
      sum of equations 29, 30, and 31, could in fact be maximally
      facilitated by either colloidal metals of higher activity, or by
      colloidal metals of lower activity. The relative importance of the
      reaction illustrated by equations 29 and 30 compared to the
      reaction shown in equation 31 would determine the characteristics
      of the colloidal metal that would best assist the net reaction in
      equation 32. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 32 proceeds at a maximal rate when the colloidal metal is
      of maximum activity, that is, when the colloidal metal is as high
      as possible on the electromotive series of metals. It has been
      found that the more reactive colloidal metals such as, but not
      limited to, colloidal magnesium ion, and colloidal aluminum ion
      produce the most facile reduction processes for the reduction of
      cationic metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The combination of equations 28 and 32 results in a. net
      process indicated in equation 33. Since equation 33 merely depicts
      the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into elemental hydrogen and
      elemental oxygen, the complete process for the production of
      elemental hydrogen now has only hydrogen peroxide as an expendable
      substance, and the only necessary energy source is supplied by
      ambient thermal conditions. Although the providing of additional
      energy would result in an enhanced rate of hydrogen formation, the
      reaction proceeds efficiently when the only energy supplied is
      ambient thermal energy. When additional energy is supplied, it can
      be supplied in the manner of thermal energy, electrical energy or
      as radiant energy. When the additional energy supplied is in the
      form of thermal energy, one is limited by the boiling point of the
      solvent. In aqueous systems this would provide a maximum
      temperature of 100[deg.] C. Under pressures higher than one
      atmosphere, however, temperatures higher than 100[deg.] C. could
      be obtained, and would provide an even more enhanced rate of
      hydrogen production.<br>

      =<br>
      H2O2-&gt;H2+O2 (33)<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Since the regeneration of the metal, Me, and the mineral
      acid are significantly lower with respect to reaction rate than
      the oxidation of the metal, Me, by a mineral acid, it is the
      regeneration of the metal, Me, and the mineral acid that proves to
      be rate determining in this process. Since the oxidation of
      hydrogen peroxide (equation 30) is more favorable than the
      oxidation of water (equation 22), the rate of hydrogen formation
      is significantly enhanced when hydrogen peroxide is used in the
      place of water. This, of course, must be balanced by the fact that
      hydrogen peroxide is obviously a more costly reagent to supply,
      and that the ratio of elemental hydrogen to elemental oxygen
      becomes one part hydrogen to one part oxygen as indicated in
      equation 33. This would differ from the ratio of two parts
      hydrogen to one part oxygen as found in equation 25, where water
      is oxidized. In cases where the rate of hydrogen production is the
      most critical factor, the use of hydrogen peroxide will offer a
      significant advantage.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] A further means by which the rate of hydrogen production
      could be increased would involve the inclusion of a nonmetal in
      the reaction such as, but not limited to, carbon or sulfur. Using
      the symbol Z to represent the nonmetal, equation 30 would be
      replaced by equation 30A which would provide a more facile
      reaction due to the thermodynamic stability of the oxide of the
      nonmetal.<br>
      <br>
      H2O2+Z-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +ZO2+2e&lt;-&gt; (30A)<br>
      <br>
      Equation 32 would then be replaced by equation 32A, and equation
      33 would be replaced by equation 33A.<br>
      <br>
      2Me&lt;+&gt; +H2O2+Z-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +2Me+ZO2 (32A)<br>
      H2O2+Z-&gt;H2+ZO2 (33A)<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Thus, rather than resulting in the formation of elemental
      oxygen, the reaction would produce an oxide of a nonmetal such as
      CO2 or SO2, where the thermodynamic stability of the nonmetal
      oxide would provide an additional driving force for the reaction,
      and thus result in an even faster rate of hydrogen production. A
      further alternative to this process involves the introduction of
      formic acid to react in the place of water, or hydrogen peroxide.
      Thus, the reactions illustrated in equations 22 and 23 would be
      replaced by similar reactions illustrated by equations 26 and 27.
      The net result of these two reactions would be the reaction
      represented in equation 28, the production of elemental hydrogen
      using an elemental metal, Me, and a mineral acid as reactants.<br>

      2Me+2H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;2Me&lt;+&gt; +H2 (28)<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The elemental Metal, Me, as well as the mineral acid would
      then be regenerated as a result of a different voltaic
      electrochemical process followed by a thermal reaction. In this
      case, however, the colloidal metal, Mr, reacts with formic acid in
      an oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 29 and 34.<br>

      <br>
      [0071] Due to the fact that formic acid has a very favorable
      positive oxidation potential compared to the negative ones
      reported for water and for hydrogen peroxide, as shown by the
      standard oxidation potentials listed below, the
      oxidation-reduction reaction resulting from equations 29 and 34
      takes place at an enhanced rate compared to the
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 21 and 22, or
      the oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 29 and 30.<br>

      <br>
      [0072] The colloidal metal can in principle be any metal but works
      most efficiently when the metal has a higher (more positive)
      reduction potential. Thus, the regeneration process takes place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal is as low as possible on
      the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any colloidal
      metal will be successful, but the reaction works well with
      colloidal silver ion, for example, due to the high reduction
      potential of silver. When silver is employed as the colloidal
      metal ion in equations 29 and 34, the pair of reactions is found
      to take place quite readily. The voltaic reaction produces a
      positive voltage as the oxidation and reduction reactions
      indicated take place. This positive voltage can be used to supply
      the energy required for other chemical processes. In fact, the
      voltage produced can even be used to supply an over potential for
      reactions employing equations 29 and 34 taking place in another
      reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can be made to
      take place more quickly without the supply of an external source
      of energy. The resulting colloidal metal, Mr, will then react to
      regenerate the metal, Me (equation 31).<br>

      <br>
      [0073] The reaction illustrated by equation 31 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is more reactive
      than the metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 31 will
      proceed most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is above
      the metal, Me, on the electromotive series of metals. The
      combining of equations 29, 34 and 31 produces the net reaction
      shown by equation 35. The net reaction represented by equation 35
      results in the regeneration of the elemental metal, Me, the
      regeneration of the acid, and the formation of carbon dioxide.<br>

      [0074] The reaction shown in equations 29 and 34 seems to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals; however, the reaction depicted by
      equation 31 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      Mr, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 35, which is merely the
      sum of equations 29, 34, and 31, could, in fact, be maximally
      facilitated by either colloidal metals of higher activity or by
      colloidal metals of lower activity. The relative importance of the
      reaction illustrated by equations 29 and 34 compared to the
      reaction shown in equation 31 would determine the characteristics
      of the colloidal metal that would best assist the net reaction in
      equation 35. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 35 proceeds at a maximal rate when the colloidal metal is
      of maximum activity, that is, when the colloidal metal is as high
      as possible on the electromotive series of metals. It has been
      found that the more reactive colloidal metals such as, but not
      limited to, colloidal magnesium ion and colloidal aluminum ion,
      produce the most facile reduction processes for the reduction of
      the cationic metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The combination of equations 28 and 35 results in a net
      process indicated in equation 36. Since equation 33 merely depicts
      the decomposition of formic acid into elemental hydrogen and
      carbon dioxide, the complete process for the production of
      elemental hydrogen now has only formic acid as an expendable
      substance, and the only necessary energy source is supplied by
      ambient thermal conditions. Although the providing of additional
      energy would result in an enhanced rate of hydrogen formation, the
      reaction proceeds efficiently when the only energy supplied is
      ambient thermal energy. When additional energy is supplied, it can
      be supplied in the manner of thermal energy, electrical energy or
      as radiant energy. When the additional energy supplied is in the
      form of thermal energy, one is limited by the boiling point of the
      solvent. In aqueous systems, this would provide a maximum
      temperature of 100[deg.] C. Under pressures higher than one
      atmosphere, however, temperatures higher than 100[deg.] C. could
      be obtained and would provide an even more enhanced rate of
      hydrogen production.<br>

      CH2O2-&gt;H2+CO2 (36)<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Since the regeneration of the metal, Me, and the mineral
      acid are significantly lower with respect to reaction rate than
      the oxidation of the metal, Me, by a mineral acid, it is the
      regeneration of the metal, Me, and the mineral acid that proves to
      be rate determining in this process. Since the oxidation of formic
      acid (equation 34) is more favorable than the oxidation of water
      (equation 22), or the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (equation
      30), the rate of hydrogen formation is significantly enhanced when
      formic acid is used in the place of water or in the place of
      hydrogen peroxide. This, of course, must be balanced by the facts
      that formic acid is a more costly reagent than water, but a less
      costly one than hydrogen peroxide, and that the co-product formed
      along with hydrogen is carbon dioxide rather than oxygen.
      Additionally, the ratio of elemental hydrogen to carbon dioxide is
      one part hydrogen to one part carbon dioxide, as indicated in
      equation 36. This would differ from the ratio of two parts
      hydrogen to one part oxygen, as found in equation 25, where water
      is oxidized. In cases, however, where the rate of hydrogen
      production is the most critical factor, the use of formic acid
      will offer a significant advantage.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Finally, while all equations depicted here involve the use
      of just a single metal, Me, in addition to the colloidal metal(s),
      it has been shown that all of the reactions discussed herein can
      be carried out using a combination of two or more different metals
      in the place of the single metal, Me, along with one or more
      colloidal metal(s). It has been shown, in fact, that in some cases
      the use of multiple metals results in a significant rate
      enhancement over a rather large period of time. In experiments #7
      and #10, for example, a mixture of metallic iron and metallic
      aluminum is used. The steady state production of hydrogen that
      results from experiment #10, for example, is approximately 100 mL
      of hydrogen per minute with the total volume of the reaction
      vessel being just over 100 mL. In experiments #8 and #9, similar
      reactions are carried out with just a single metal, aluminum, and
      it is demonstrated that when the reaction rate decreases, the
      addition of the second metal, iron, results in an immediate rate
      increase to a rate similar to those reactions where the two metals
      were present throughout the reaction. It is not clear at this
      point what causes this impressive rate enhancement. It is possible
      that the multiple metals all take part in the reaction mechanism
      to provide a more complicated mechanism having a greater number of
      steps, but a lower net activation barrier. Another possibility is
      that a second metal might provide a surface where the regenerated
      metal, Me, could reform more efficiently. Whatever the
      explanation, experiments #9 and #10 very clearly demonstrate that
      the rate enhancement caused by the use of two different metals is
      quite obvious and quite significant. Experimental Results:
      Experiment #1 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0078] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with iron
      pellets (sponge iron) and about 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and
      80 mL of colloidal lead each at a concentration believed to be
      about 20 ppm. A theoretical maximum of 8.06 liters of hydrogen gas
      could be produced if solely from the consumption of the acids as
      indicated in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      1 mole H2SO4 = 98 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Therefore, the maximum yield is 0.23 liters of H2 per gram
      of H2SO4.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] 2 moles of HCl yields 1 mole H2 (22.4 liters)<br>
      <br>
      [0081] 2 moles of HCl=73 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.31 liters of H2
      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The experimental setup was as illustrated in FIG. 2. The
      acid and iron solution was placed in flask 202. A hot plate 204
      was used to provide thermal energy for the reaction and maintain
      the solution at a temperature of about 71[deg.] C. The gas
      produced by the reaction was fed through tube 206 to a
      volume-measuring apparatus 208. The volume-measuring apparatus 208
      was an inverted reaction vessel 210 filled with water and placed
      in a water bath 212. The primary purpose of the experiment was to
      provide evidence that more than the theoretical maximum 8.06
      liters of hydrogen was being produced by the closed-loop process
      of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The rate of the reaction initially is very fast with
      hydrogen generation at ambient temperature. When the acids are
      temporally consumed, the regeneration process takes into effect
      and the reaction rate slows. Heat may be added to the process to
      accelerate the regeneration process.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] At least 15 liters of gas was observed to have been
      produced, and the reaction was still proceeding in a continuous
      fashion (about 2 bubbles of gas per second at 71[deg.] C.) when
      interrupted. It should be noted that the 15 liters of gas observed
      does not account for hydrogen gas losses likely due to leakage.
      Based upon previous observations and theoretical projections, the
      first 8.06 liters of gas produced is likely to be made up of
      essentially pure hydrogen, and beyond the theoretical threshold of
      8.06 liters, 66.7% by volume of the gas produced would be hydrogen
      and the other 33.3% by volume would be oxygen. It is believed this
      experiment provides ample evidence of the regeneration process.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] A follow-up experiment was conducted using iron (III)
      chloride (FeCl3) as the only source of iron in an attempt to
      qualitatively verify the reverse reaction. Pure iron (III)
      chloride was chosen because it could be shown to be free of iron
      in any other oxidation state. While similar experiments had been
      successfully carried out using iron (III) oxide as the source of
      iron, the results were clouded by the fact that other oxidation
      states of iron may have been present. The results are described in
      Experiment #2, below. Experiment #2 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0087] An experiment was conducted using 150 mL of iron (III)
      chloride in an aqueous solution (commonly used as an etching
      solution, purchased from Radio Shack) as the starting materials.
      Ten mL of 93% concentration sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was added to the
      solution, at which point no reaction occurred. About 50 mL of
      colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead each at a
      concentration believed to be about 20 ppm were then added, at
      which point a chemical reaction began and the bubbling of gases
      was evident at ambient temperature. The production of gas
      accelerated when the solution was heated to a temperature of
      65[deg.] C. The product gas was captured in soap bubbles and the
      bubbles were then ignited. The observed ignition of the gaseous
      product was typical for a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Since hydrogen gas could only be produced with a concurrent
      oxidation of iron, it is evident that the iron (III) had to be
      initially reduced before it could be oxidized, thereby providing
      strong evidence of the reverse reaction. This experiment has
      subsequently been repeated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) instead of
      sulfuric acid, with similar results.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] Two additional follow-up experiments (#3 using aluminum
      metal and #4 using iron metal) were conducted to determine if more
      hydrogen is produced compared to the maximum amount expected
      solely from the consumption of the metal. These results are
      described below. Experiment #3 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The starting solution had a total volume of 250 mL,
      including water, about 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of
      colloidal lead, each at a concentration believed to be about 20
      ppm, 10 mL of 93% concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35%
      concentration HCl as in experiment #1 above. Ten grams of aluminum
      metal was added to the solution which was heated and maintained at
      90[deg.] C. The reaction ran for 1.5 hours and yielded 12 liters
      of gas. The pH was found to have a value under 2.0 at the end of
      1.5 hours. The reaction was stopped after 1.5 hours by removing
      the unused metal and weighing it. The non-consumed aluminum
      weighed 4.5 grams, indicating a consumption of 5.5 grams of
      aluminum. The maximum amount of hydrogen gas normally expected by
      the net consumption of 5.5 grams of aluminum is 6.8 liters, as
      indicated in the table below.<br>

      2 moles Al yields 3 moles H2 (67.2 liters)<br>
      <br>
      2 moles Al = 54 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0091] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 1.24 liters of H2
      per gram of Al is expected without the regeneration reaction
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] As in experiment #1, based on the total amount of acid
      supplied, it is expected that the first 8.06 liters of the gas
      generated is pure hydrogen with the balance being 50% hydrogen.
      Alternatively, the theoretical amount of hydrogen based on the
      amount of aluminum consumed is 6.84 liters. After 6.84 liters (the
      maximum yield expected from the aluminum consumed), it is expected
      that the remaining gas is 66.7% hydrogen. Therefore, we estimate
      that about 10.3 liters of hydrogen (out of about 12 total liters
      of gas) was produced in this experiment compared to the maximum of
      6.84 or 8.06 liters expected based on the amount of aluminum
      consumed and the amount of acid supplied, respectively, thereby
      providing additional evidence of the regeneration process.
      Experiment #4 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0093] The starting solution included a total volume of 250 mL,
      including water, about 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of
      colloidal lead, each at a concentration believed to be about 20
      ppm, 10 mL of 93% concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35%
      concentration HCl, as in experiment #1 above. One hundred grams of
      iron pellets (sponge iron) was added to the solution, which was
      heated and maintained at 90[deg.] C. The reaction ran for 30 hours
      and yielded 15 liters of gas. The pH was found to have a value of
      about 5.0 at the end of 30 hours. The reaction was stopped after
      30 hours by removing the unused metal and weighing it. The
      non-consumed iron weighed 94 grams, indicating a consumption of 6
      grams of iron. The maximum amount of hydrogen gas normally
      expected by the net consumption of 6 grams of iron, without the
      regeneration reaction described above, is 2.41 liters, as
      indicated in the table below.<br>

      <br>
      1 mole Fe yields 1 mole H2 (22.4 liters)<br>
      <br>
      1 mole Fe = 55.85 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0094] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.40 liters of H2
      per gram of Fe is expected without the regeneration reaction
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] As in experiment #1, based on the total amount of acid
      supplied, it is expected that the first 8.06 liters of the gas
      generated is pure hydrogen with the balance being 66.7% hydrogen.
      However, the maximum theoretical generation of hydrogen based on
      the amount of iron consumed is 2.41 liters. After 2.41 liters (the
      maximum yield expected from the iron consumed), it is expected
      that the remaining gas is 66.7% hydrogen. Therefore, it is
      estimated that about 10.8 liters of hydrogen (out of about 15
      total liters of gas) was produced in this experiment using
      colloidal catalyst, well over the maximum of 2.41 liters expected
      with the amount of iron consumed, thereby providing additional
      evidence of the regeneration process. Experiment #5 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0096] An experiment was conducted using 200 mL of the final
      solution obtained from experiment #4, which contained oxidized
      iron plus catalyst and was found to have a pH of about 5. Acid was
      added to the solution, as in the above reactions (10 mL of 93%
      concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl), that
      brought the pH to a level of about 1. No additional colloidal
      materials were added, but 20 grams of aluminum metal was added.
      The solution was heated to a constant 96[deg.] C. The reaction
      proceeded to produce 32 liters of gas in a span of 18 hours, at
      which point the rate of the reaction had slowed significantly and
      the pH of the solution had become approximately 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] The metal remaining at the end of the 18-hour experiment
      was separated and found to have a mass of 9 grams. This metal
      appeared to be a mixture of Al and Fe. Therefore, neglecting the
      amount of iron and aluminum remaining in solution, there was net
      consumption of 11 grams of metal and a net production of 32 liters
      of gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] As indicated above, based on the amount of acid added to
      the reaction, the maximum amount of hydrogen gas expected solely
      from the reaction of acid with metal would be 8.06 liters.
      Depending on the makeup of the recovered metal, which had a mass
      of 9 grams, two extremes are possible: a) assuming the metal
      recovered was 100% Al, a maximum of 13.75 liters of hydrogen gas
      would be expected from the consumption of 11 grams of aluminum;
      and b) alternatively, assuming the metal recovered was 100% Fe, a
      maximum of 21.25 liters of hydrogen gas would be expected from the
      consumption of 17 grams of aluminum (20 grams supplied minus three
      grams used in the production of iron). For purposes of calculating
      maximum hydrogen gas generation, we assume the regeneration
      process does not occur and the Fe metal would have been generated
      from a conventional single displacement reaction with Al.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The actual percentage of Al and Fe would be somewhere
      between the two extremes and, therefore, the maximum amount of
      hydrogen gas generated solely from the consumption of metal
      (without regeneration) would be between 13.75 liters and 21.25
      liters. The observed generation of 32 liters of gas compared to
      the maximum amount one would expect from the sole consumption of
      metal indicates that the regeneration process is taking place. It
      is believed that the increase in the rate of H2 production
      resulted from a high concentration of metal ions in the solution
      prior to the introduction of the elemental iron. Thus, resulting
      solutions from this family of reactions should not be discarded
      but rather should be used as the starting point for subsequent
      reactions. Consequently, this process for the generation of H2
      will not produce significant chemical wastes that need to be
      disposed of. Experiment #6 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0100] An experiment was conducted using 20 mL FeCl3, 10 mL
      colloidal magnesium, and 20 mL colloidal lead at a temperature of
      about 90[deg.] C. A gas was produced that is believed to be a
      mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, based upon observing the ignition
      of the gas. The pH of the mixture decreased during the reaction
      from a value of about 4.5 to a value of about 3.5. These
      observations show that it is not necessary to introduce either
      metallic iron or acid into the solution to produce hydrogen. Since
      the electrochemical oxidation/reduction reactions (equations 21-23
      resulting in the net equation 24) result in the production of
      metallic iron and acid, these two constituents can be produced in
      this manner. Presumably, this would eventually attain the same
      steady state that is reached when metallic iron and acid are
      supplied initially. Experiment #7 Summary<br>
      <br>
      [0101] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with 20 grams
      of iron pellets, and 20 grams of aluminum pellets. There were then
      added 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead
      each at a concentration believed to be about 20 ppm, producing a
      total volume of about 215 mL. A theoretical maximum of 8.06 liters
      of hydrogen gas could be produced if solely from the consumption
      of the acids as indicated in Table 4.<br>

      <br>
      [0102] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.23 liters of H2
      per gram of H2SO4 is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>

      <br>
      [0105] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.31 liters of H2
      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The experimental setup was as illustrated in FIG. 2. The
      mixture of acids and metals was placed in flask 202. A hot plate
      204 was used to provide thermal energy for the reaction and
      maintain the solution at a temperature of about 71[deg.] C. The
      gas produced by the reaction was fed through tube 206 to a
      volume-measuring apparatus 208. The volume-measuring apparatus 208
      was an inverted reaction vessel 210 filled with water and placed
      in a water bath 212. The primary purpose of the experiment was to
      provide evidence that more than the theoretical maximum 8.06
      liters of hydrogen was being produced by the closed-loop process
      of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The rate of the reaction initially is very fast with
      instantaneous hydrogen generation at a rate of about 20 liters per
      hour. After about an hour the rate slows to a steady-state value
      of about 8.4 liters of gas produced per hour. Heat may be added to
      the process to accelerate the process of regenerating the metals
      and the acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] While some gas was lost due to leakage and diffusion, at
      least 25 liters of gas was collected over a period of three hours,
      and the reaction was still proceeding in a continuous fashion at a
      rate of 8.4 liters of gas produced per hour. At this point the
      experiment was stopped and the remaining metal, a mixture of
      aluminum and iron was collected and dried, and was found to have a
      mass of 35.5 grams. Thus, 4.5 grams of metal was consumed. Since
      the remaining metal was not analyzed, it is not known in what
      ratio aluminum and iron reacted; however the simple oxidation of a
      metal by an acid would produce a maximum of 5.6 liters of
      hydrogen, well below that observed. Based upon previous
      observations and theoretical projections, the first 8.06 liters of
      gas produced is likely to be made up of essentially pure hydrogen,
      and beyond the theoretical threshold of 8.06 liters, 66.7% by
      volume of the gas produced would be hydrogen and the other 33.3%
      by volume would be oxygen. It is believed this experiment provides
      ample evidence for the regeneration process.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] It is believed that the simultaneous use of two metals does
      not improve the initial rate of gas formation, but rather produces
      a reaction rate that is sustained over a much greater period of
      time. In order to further demonstrate this point, two additional
      experiments were performed. Experiment #8 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0110] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with 20 grams
      of aluminum pellets. There were then added 50 mL of colloidal
      magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead each at a concentration
      believed to be about 20 ppm, producing a total volume of about 215
      mL. A theoretical maximum of 8.06 liters of hydrogen gas could be
      produced if solely from the consumption of the acids as indicated
      in Table 5.<br>

      <br>
      [0116] The initial reaction rate was similar to that found in
      experiment #1, where 9 liters of gas was produced in slightly less
      than one hour. At this point, however, the reaction rate was found
      to decrease by a factor of approximately one half. The addition of
      20 grams of iron caused an immediate increase in reaction rate to
      the value that was initially observed at the onset of the
      experiment. Experiment #9 Summary:<br>

      <br>
      [0124] Clearly an interaction is taking place between the two
      metals that produces a reaction that sustains its high rate of gas

      [0128] 2 moles of HCl=73 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0129] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.31 liters of H2
      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] The experimental setup was as illustrated in FIG. 2. The
      mixture of acids and metals was placed in flask 202. A hot plate
      204 was used to provide thermal energy for the reaction and
      maintain the solution at a temperature of about 90[deg.] C. The
      gas produced by the reaction was fed through tube 206 to a
      volume-measuring apparatus 208. The volume-measuring apparatus 208
      was an inverted reaction vessel 210 filled with water and placed
      in a water bath 212. The primary purpose of the experiment was to
      provide evidence that more than the theoretical maximum 8.06
      liters of hydrogen was being produced by the closed-loop process
      of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] The rate of the reaction initially is very fast with
      instantaneous hydrogen generation at a rate of about 20 liters per
      hour. After about an hour the rate slows to a steady-state value
      of about 6.0 liters per hour. Additional heat may be added to the
      process to further accelerate the process of regenerating the
      metals and the acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] While some gas was lost due to leakage and diffusion, at
      least 32 liters of gas was collected over a period of five hours,
      and the reaction was still proceeding in a continuous fashion at a
      rate of 6.0 liters per hour. At this point, the experiment was
      stopped and the remaining metal, a mixture of aluminum and iron
      was collected and dried, and was found to have a mass of about 40
      grams. Thus, only a negligible amount of metal was consumed. Since
      the remaining metal was not analyzed, it is not known in what
      ratio aluminum and iron were present; however, it can be assumed
      that approximately 20 grams of each metal was present in the
      remaining metallic sample. Based upon previous observations and
      theoretical projections, the first 8.06 liters of gas produced is
      likely to be made up of essentially pure hydrogen, and beyond the
      theoretical threshold of 8.06 liters, 66.7% by volume of the gas
      produced would be hydrogen and the other 33.3% by volume would be
      oxygen. It is believed this experiment provides further evidence
      for a more efficient regeneration process when smaller volumes are
      used in the reaction vessel.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] The foregoing experiments were carried out under ambient
      lighting conditions which included a mixture of artificial and
      natural light sources. When the reactions described were performed
      under decreased light conditions, the reaction rates decreased.
      However, separate formal testing under decreased lighting has not
      been performed.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] It is believed the experimental results described above
      demonstrate the potential value of the invention described herein.
      However, the calculations are based on the reaction mechanisms
      described above and are believed to accurately characterize the
      reactions involved in these experiments. However, if it is
      discovered that the theories of reactions or the calculations
      based thereon are in error, the invention described herein
      nevertheless is valid and valuable.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] The embodiments shown and described above are exemplary.
      Many details are often found in the art and, therefore, many such
      details are neither shown nor described. It is not claimed that
      all of the details, parts, elements, or steps described and shown
      were invented herein. Even though numerous characteristics and

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus
      for the production of hydrogen gas from water.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Dihydrogen gas, H2, also referred to as hydrogen gas,
      diatomic hydrogen, or elemental hydrogen is a valuable commodity
      with many current and potential uses. Hydrogen gas may be produced
      by a chemical reaction between water and a metal or metallic
      compound. Very reactive metals react with mineral acids to produce
      a salt plus hydrogen gas. Equations 1 through 5 are examples of
      this process, where HX represents any mineral acid. HX can
      represent, for example HCl, HBr, HI, H2SO4, HNO3, but includes all
      acids.<br>
      <br>
      2Li+2HX-&gt;H2+2LiX (1)<br>
      2K+2HX-&gt;H2+2KX (2)<br>
      2Na+2HX-&gt;H2+2NaX (3)<br>
      Ca+2HX-&gt;H2+CaX2 (4)<br>
      Mg+2HX-&gt;H2+MgX2 (5)<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Each of these reactions take place at an extremely high
      rate due to the very high activity of lithium, potassium, sodium,
      calcium, and magnesium, which are listed in order of their
      respective reaction rates, with lithium reacting the fastest and
      magnesium reacting the most slowly of this group of metals. In
      fact, these reactions take place at such an accelerated rate that
      they have not been considered to provide a useful method for the
      synthesis of hydrogen gas in the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Metals of intermediate reactivity undergo the same reaction
      but at a much more controllable reaction rate. Equations 6 and 7
      are examples, again where HX represents all mineral acids.<br>
      <br>
      Zn+2HX-&gt;H2+ZnX2 (6)<br>
      2Al+6HX-&gt;3H2+2AlX3 (7)<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Reactions of this type provide a better method for the
      production of hydrogen gas due to their relatively slower and
      therefore more controllable reaction rate. Metals like these have
      not, however, been used in prior art production of diatomic
      hydrogen because of the expense of these metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Iron reacts with mineral acids by either of the following
      equations:<br>
      <br>
      Fe+2HX-&gt;H2+FeX2 (8)<br>
      or<br>
      2Fe+6HX-&gt;3H2+2FeX3 (9)<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Due to the rather low activity of iron, both of these
      reactions take place at a rather slow reaction rate. The reaction
      rates are so slow that these reactions have not been considered to
      provide a useful method for the production of diatomic hydrogen in
      the prior art. Thus, while iron does provide the availability and
      low price needed for the production of elemental hydrogen, it does
      not react at a rate great enough to make it useful for hydrogen
      production.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Metals such as silver, gold, and platinum are not found to
      undergo reaction with mineral acids under normal conditions in the
      prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Ag+HX-&gt;No Reaction (10)<br>
      Au+HX-&gt;No Reaction (11)<br>
      Pt+HX-&gt;No Reaction (12)<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In neutral or basic solutions very reactive metals react
      with water to produce hydrogen gas plus a base. Equations 13-16
      are examples of this process.<br>
      <br>
      2Li+2H2O-&gt;H2+2LiOH (13)<br>
      2K+2H2O-&gt;H2+2KOH (14)<br>
      2Na+2H2O-&gt;H2+2NaOH (15)<br>
      Ca+2H2O-&gt;H2+Ca(OH)2 (16)<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Each of these reactions take place at an extremely high
      rate due to the very high activity of lithium, potassium, sodium,
      and calcium, which are listed in order of their respective
      reaction rates, with lithium reacting the fastest and calcium
      reacting the slowest of this group of metals. In fact, these
      reactions take place at such an accelerated rate that they do not
      provide a useful method for the synthesis of hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Metals of intermediate reactivity undergo the same reaction
      in neutral or basic solution but heat must be supplied to promote
      these reactions. Equations 17-21 are examples of such a process.<br>
      <br>
      Mg+2H2O-&gt;H2+Mg(OH)2 (17)<br>
      2Al+6H2O -&gt;3H2+2Al(OH)3 (18)<br>
      Zn+2H2O-&gt;H2+Zn(OH)2 (19)<br>
      Fe+2H2O-&gt;H2+Fe(OH)2 (20)<br>
      2Fe+6H2O-&gt;3H2+2Fe(OH)3 (21)<br>
      <br>
      [0013] While reactions of this type might seem to provide a better
      method for the production of hydrogen gas due to their relatively
      slower and therefore more controllable reaction rate, the high
      temperatures required for these reactions increase the cost of the
      process. Metals like these have therefore not been used in the
      production of diatomic hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Accordingly, a need exists for a method and apparatus for
      the efficient production of hydrogen gas using relatively
      inexpensive metals.<br>
      <br>

      BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 1 is a diagram of a reactor for the production of
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Most metals can be produced in a colloidal state in an
      aqueous solution. A colloid is a material composed of very small
      particles of one substance that are dispersed (suspended), but not
      dissolved in solution. Thus, colloidal particles do not settle out
      of solution, even though they exist in the solid state. A colloid
      of any particular metal is then a very small particle of that
      metal suspended in a solution. These suspended particles of metal
      may exist in the solid (metallic) form or in the ionic form, or as
      a mixture of the two. The very small size of the particles of
      these metals results in a very large effective surface area for
      the metal. This very large effective surface area for the metal
      can cause the surface reactions of the metal to increase
      dramatically when it comes into contact with other atoms or
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The catalysts used in the experiments described below are
      colloidal metals obtained using a colloidal silver machine, model:
      Hvac-Ultra, serial number: U-03-98-198, sold by CS Prosystems of
      San Antonio, Tex. The website of CS Prosystems is
      www.csprosystems.com. Colloidal solutions of metals that are
      produced using this apparatus result from an electrolytic process
      and are thought to contain colloidal particles, some of which are
      electrically neutral and some of which are positively charged.
      Other methods can be employed in the production of colloidal metal
      solutions. It is believed that the positive charge on the
      colloidal metal particles used in the experiments described below
      provides additional rate enhancement effects. It is still
      believed, however, that it is to a great extent the size and the
      resulting surface area of the colloidal particles that causes a
      significant portion of the rate enhancement effects that are
      detailed below, regardless of the charge on the colloidal
      particles. Based upon data provided by the manufacturer of the
      machine used, the particles of a metal in the colloidal solutions
      used in the experiments described below are believed to range in
      size between 0.001 and 0.01 microns. In such a solution of
      colloidal metals, the concentration of the metals is believed to
      be between about 5 to 20 parts per million.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Alternative to using a catalyst in colloidal form, it may
      be possible to use a catalyst in another form that offers a high
      surface-area-to-volume ratio, such as a porous solid, nanometals,
      colloid-polymer nanocomposites and the like. In general, the
      catalysts may be in any form with an effective surface area that
      preferably on the order of 298,000,000 m2 per cubic meter of
      catalyst, although smaller surface area ratios may also work.
      Reactions In Acidic Media<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Thus, when any metal, regardless of its normal reactivity,
      is used in its colloidal form, the reaction of the metal with
      mineral acids can take place at an accelerated rate. Equations
      22-24 are thus general equations that are believed to occur for
      any metals in spite of their normal reactivity, where M represents
      any metal in colloidal form. M, for instance, can represent, but
      is not limited to, silver, copper, tin, zinc, lead, and cadmium.
      In fact, it has been found that the reactions shown in equations
      22-24 occur at a significant reaction rate even in solutions of 1%
      aqueous acid.<br>
      <br>
      2M+2HX-&gt;2MX+H2 (22)<br>
      M+2HX-&gt;MX2+H2 (23)<br>
      2M+6HX-&gt;2MX3+3H2 (24)<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Even though equations 22-24 represent largely endothermic
      processes for many metals, particularly those of low reactivity
      (for example, but not limited to, silver, gold, copper, tin, lead,
      and zinc), the rate of the reactions depicted in equations 22-24
      is in fact very high due to the surface effects caused by the use
      of the colloidal metal. While the reactions portrayed in equations
      22-24 take place at a highly accelerated reaction rate, these
      reactions do not result in a useful production of elemental
      hydrogen since the colloidal metal by definition is present in
      very low concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] A useful preparation of hydrogen results, however, by the
      inclusion of a metal more reactive than the colloidal metal such
      as, but not limited to, metallic iron, metallic aluminum, or
      metallic nickel. Thus, any colloidal metal in its ionic form,
      M&lt;+&gt; , would be expected to react with the metal Me as
      indicated in equation 25, where those metals M&lt;+&gt; below Me
      on the electromotive or activity series of metals would react
      best.<br>
      <br>
      Me+M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;M+Me&lt;+&gt; (25)<br>
      <br>
      [0049] It is believed that the reaction illustrated by equation 25
      takes place quite readily due to the large effective surface area
      of the colloidal ion, M&lt;+&gt; , and also due to the greater
      reactivity of the metal Me compared to M&lt;+&gt; , which is
      preferably of lower reactivity. In fact, for metals normally lower
      in reactivity than Me, equation 25 would result in a highly
      exothermic reaction. The metal, M, resulting from reduction of the
      colloidal ion, M&lt;+&gt; , would be present in colloidal
      quantities and thus, it is believed, undergoes a facile reaction
      with any mineral acid including, but not limited to, sulfuric
      acid, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, hydroiodic
      acid, perchloric acid, and chloric acid. However, the mineral acid
      is preferably sulfuric acid, H2SO4, or hydrochloric acid, HCl.
      Equation 26 describes this reaction where the formula HX (or
      H&lt;+&gt; +X&lt;-&gt; in its ionic form) is a general
      representation for any mineral acid.<br>
      <br>
      2M+2H&lt;+&gt; +2X&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2M&lt;+&gt; +H2+2X&lt;-&gt; (26)<br>
      <br>
      [0050] While equation 26 represents an endothermic reaction, it is
      believed the exothermicity of the reactions in equation 25
      compensates for this, making the combination of the two reactions
      energetically obtainable using the thermal energy supplied by
      ambient conditions. Of course the supply of additional energy
      accelerates the process.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Consequently, it is believed that elemental hydrogen is
      efficiently and easily produced by the combination of the
      reactions shown in equations 27 and 28.<br>
      <br>
      4Me+4M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4M+4Me&lt;+&gt; (27)<br>
      4M+4H&lt;+&gt; +4X&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4M&lt;+&gt; +2H2+4X&lt;-&gt; (28)<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Thus the metal Me reacts with the colloidal metal ion in
      equation 27 to produce a colloidal metal and the ionic form of Me.
      The colloidal metal will then react with a mineral acid in
      equation 28 to produce elemental hydrogen and regenerate the
      colloidal metal ion. The colloidal metal ion will then react again
      by equation 27, followed again by equation 28, and so on in a
      chain process to provide an efficient source of elemental
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In principle, any colloidal metal ion should undergo this
      process successfully. It is found that the reactions work most
      efficiently when the colloidal metal is lower in reactivity than
      the metal Me on the electromotive series table. The combining of
      equations 27 and 28 produces a net reaction that is illustrated by
      equation 29. Equation 29 has as its result the production of
      elemental hydrogen from the reaction of the metal Me and a mineral
      acid.<br>
      <br>
      4Me+4M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4M+4Me&lt;+&gt; (27)<br>
      +<br>
      4M+4H&lt;+&gt; +4X&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4M&lt;+&gt; +2H2+4X&lt;-&gt; (28)<br>
      =<br>
      4Me+4H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2 (29)<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Equation 29 summarizes a process that provides for very
      efficient production of elemental hydrogen where the metal Me and
      acid are consumed. It is believed, however, that both the
      elemental metal Me and the acid are regenerated as a result of a
      voltaic electrochemical process or thermal process that follows.
      It is believed that a colloidal metal Mr (which can be the same
      one used in equation 27 or a different metal) can undergo a
      voltaic oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 30 and
      31.<br>
      <br>
      Cathode (reduction) 4Mr&lt;+&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4Mr (30)<br>
      Anode (oxidation) 2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +O2+4e&lt;-&gt; (31)<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The colloidal metal Mr can in principle be any metal, but
      reaction 30 progresses most efficiently when the metal has a
      higher (more positive) reduction potential. Thus, the reduction of
      the colloidal metal ion, as indicated in equation 30, takes place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal is lower than the metal
      Me on the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any
      colloidal metal will be successful, but reaction 30 works best
      with colloidal metals such as colloidal silver or lead, due to the
      high reduction potential of these metals. When lead, for example,
      is employed as the colloidal metal ion in equations 30 and 31, the
      pair of reactions is found to take place quite readily. The
      voltaic reaction produces a positive voltage as the oxidation and
      reduction reactions take place. This positive voltage can be used
      to supply the energy required for other chemical processes. In
      fact, the voltage produced can even be used to supply an over
      potential for reactions employing equations 30 and 31 taking place
      in another reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can
      be made to take place more quickly without the supply of an
      external source of energy. The resulting colloidal metal, Mr, can
      then react with oxidized ionic metal, Me&lt;+&gt; , as indicated
      in equation 32, which would result in the regeneration of the
      metal, Me, and the regeneration of the colloidal metal in its
      oxidized form.<br>
      <br>
      4Me&lt;+&gt; +4Mr-&gt;4Mr&lt;+&gt; +4Me (32)<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The reaction described by equation 32 could in fact occur
      using as starting material any colloidal metal, but will take
      place most effectively when the colloidal metal, Mr, appears above
      the metal, Me, on the electromotive series. The combining of
      equations 30-32 results in equation 33 which represents the
      regeneration of the elemental metal, Me, the regeneration of the
      acid, and the formation of elemental oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      4Mr&lt;+&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4Mr (30)<br>

      4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +4Me+O2 (33)<br>
      <br>
      [0057] It is believed that the reaction shown in equations 30 and
      31 occur best when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as low as possible
      on the electromotive series of metals; however, it is believed
      that the reaction depicted by equation 32 takes place most
      efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as high as possible
      on the electromotive series of metals. The net reaction
      illustrated by equation 33, which is merely the sum of equations
      30, 31, and 32, could in fact be maximally facilitated by either
      colloidal metals of higher activity or by colloidal metals of
      lower activity. The relative importance of the reaction
      illustrated by equations 30 and 31 compared to the reaction shown
      in equation 32 would determine the characteristics of the
      colloidal metal that would best assist the net reaction in
      equation 33. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 33 proceeds at a maximal rate when the colloidal metal is
      of higher activity, that is, when the colloidal metal is higher on
      the electromotive series of metals. It has been found that the
      more reactive colloidal metals such as, but not limited to,
      colloidal magnesium ion or colloidal aluminum ion produce the most
      facile processes for the reduction of cationic metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The combination of equations 29 and 33 results in a net
      process indicated in equation 34. As discussed above, the reaction
      depicted in equation 30 proceeds most efficiently when the
      colloidal metal is found below the metal, Me, on the electromotive
      series. However, the reaction represented by equation 32 is most
      favorable when the colloidal metal is found above the metal, Me,
      on the electromotive series. Accordingly, it has been observed
      that the concurrent use of two colloidal metals, one above the
      metal, Me, and one below it in the electromotive series-for
      example, but not limited to, colloidal lead and colloidal
      aluminum-produces optimum results in terms of the efficiency of
      the net process. Since equation 34 merely depicts the
      decomposition of water into elemental hydrogen and elemental
      oxygen, the complete process for the production of elemental
      hydrogen now has only water as an expendable substance, and the
      only necessary energy source is supplied by ambient thermal
      conditions.<br>
      <br>
      4Me+4H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2 (29)<br>
      +<br>
      4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +4Me+O2 (33)<br>
      =<br>
      2H2O-&gt;2H2+O2 (34)<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The net result of this process is exactly that which would
      result from the electrolysis of water. Here, however, no
      electrical energy needs to be supplied. Although the providing of
      additional energy would result in an enhanced rate of hydrogen
      formation, the reaction proceeds efficiently when the only energy
      supplied is ambient thermal energy. When additional energy is
      supplied, it can be supplied in the form of thermal energy, solar
      energy, electrical energy, radiant energy or other energy forms.
      When the additional energy supplied is thermal in nature, the
      maximum temperature achievable at atmospheric pressure is the
      boiling point of the solution; in aqueous systems this would be
      approximately a temperature of 100[deg.] C. At pressures greater
      than one atmosphere, however, temperatures higher than 100[deg.]
      C. could be obtained, and would provide an even more enhanced rate
      of hydrogen production. Therefore, when the additional energy
      supplied is in the form of thermal energy, it may be preferable to
      use a reaction vessel configured to maintain internal pressures
      greater than the prevailing atmospheric pressure, in order
      increase the boiling point of the solution and increase the amount
      of thermal energy that can be supplied. The colloidal metallic ion
      catalysts M&lt;+&gt; and/or Mr&lt;+&gt; as well as the metal Me
      and the acid are regenerated in the process, leaving only water as
      a consumable material. Elemental Nonmetal<br>
      <br>
      [0060] A further means by which the rate of hydrogen production
      could be increased involves the inclusion of a nonmetal in the
      reaction such as, but not limited to, carbon or sulfur. Using the
      symbol Z to represent the nonmetal, equation 31 would be replaced
      by equation 35 which portrays a more facile reaction due to the
      thermodynamic stability of the oxide of the nonmetal.<br>
      <br>
      2H2O+Z-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +ZO2+4e&lt;-&gt; (35)<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Equation 33 would then be replaced by equation 36, and
      equation 34 would be replaced by equation 37.<br>
      <br>
      4Me&lt;+&gt; +2H2O+Z-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +4Me+ZO2 (36)<br>
      2H2O+Z-&gt;2H2+ZO2 (37)<br>
      <br>
      Thus, rather than resulting in the formation of elemental oxygen,
      O2, the reaction would produce an oxide such as CO2 or SO2 of a
      nonmetal, where the thermodynamic stability of the nonmetal oxide
      would provide an additional driving force for the reaction and
      thus result in an even faster rate of hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reducing Agents</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0062] An alternative to the above process involves the
      introduction of a reducing agent such as hydrogen peroxide to
      react in the place of water. Thus, the reactions illustrated in
      equations 31 and 32 would be replaced by similar reactions
      illustrated by equations 38 and 39. The net result of these two
      reactions would be the reaction represented in equation 40, the
      production of elemental hydrogen using an elemental metal Me and a
      mineral acid as reactants.<br>
      <br>
      2Me+2M&lt;+&gt; -&gt;2M+2Me&lt;+&gt; (38)<br>
      +<br>

      =<br>
      2Me+2H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;2Me&lt;+&gt; +H2 (40)<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The elemental metal, Me, as well as the mineral acid, would
      then be regenerated as a result of a different voltaic
      electrochemical process followed by a thermal reaction. Again, a
      colloidal metal, Mr, reacts with hydrogen peroxide in an
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 41 and 42.<br>
      <br>
      Cathode (reduction) 2Mr&lt;+&gt; +2e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2Mr (41)<br>
      Anode (oxidation) H2O2-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +O2+2e&lt;-&gt; (42)<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide has a larger (less
      negative) oxidation potential than water, as shown in the standard
      oxidation potentials listed below, the oxidation-reduction
      reaction resulting from equations 41 and 42 takes place at an
      enhanced rate compared to the oxidation-reduction reaction
      indicated by equations 30 and 31.<br>
      <br>
      2H2O-&gt;4H&lt;+&gt; +O2+4e&lt;-&gt; [epsilon]&lt;0 &gt;
      oxidation=-1.229V<br>
      H2O2-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +O2+2e&lt;-&gt; [epsilon]&lt;0 &gt;
      oxidation=-0.695V<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The colloidal metal, Mr, can, in principle, be any metal
      but works most efficiently when the metal has a high (more
      positive) reduction potential. Thus, the regeneration process
      takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal is as low as
      possible on the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any
      colloidal metal will be successful, but the reaction works well
      with colloidal silver ion, for example, due to the high reduction
      potential of silver. When silver is employed as the colloidal
      metal ion in equations 41 and 42, the pair of reactions is found
      to take place readily. The voltaic reaction produces a positive
      voltage as the oxidation and reduction reactions indicated take
      place. This positive voltage can be used to supply the energy
      required for other chemical processes. In fact, the voltage
      produced can even be used to supply an over-potential for
      reactions employing equations 41 and 42 taking place in another
      reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can be made to
      take place more quickly without the supply of an external source
      of energy. The resulting colloidal metal, Mr, will then react to
      regenerate the metal, Me (equation 43).<br>
      <br>
      2Me&lt;+&gt; +2Mr-&gt;2Mr&lt;+&gt; +2 (43)<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The reaction illustrated by equation 43 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is more reactive
      than the metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 43 will
      proceed most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is above
      the metal, Me, on the electromotive series of metals. The
      combining of equations 41-43 results in equation 44 which
      represents the regeneration of the elemental metal, Me, the
      regeneration of the acid, and the formation of elemental oxygen.<br>

      <br>
      [0067] The reactions shown in equations 41 and 42 seem to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals; however, the reaction depicted by
      equation 43 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      Mr, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 44, which is merely the
      sum of equations 41, 42, and 43, could in fact be facilitated by
      either colloidal metals of higher activity or lower activity than
      Me. The relative importance of the reaction illustrated by
      equations 41 and 42 compared to the reaction shown in equation 43
      would determine the characteristics of the colloidal metal that
      would best assist the net reaction in equation 44. It has been
      found that the net reaction indicated in equation 44 proceeds at a
      maximal rate when the colloidal metal is of higher activity, that
      is, when the colloidal metal is as high as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals. It has been found that the more
      reactive colloidal metals such as, but not limited to, colloidal
      magnesium ion and colloidal aluminum ion produce the most facile
      reduction processes for the reduction of cationic metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The combination of equations 40 and 44 results in the net
      process indicated in equation 45. Since equation 45 merely depicts
      the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into elemental hydrogen and
      elemental oxygen, the complete process for the production of
      elemental hydrogen now has only hydrogen peroxide as an expendable
      substance, and the only necessary energy source is supplied by
      ambient thermal conditions.<br>

      =<br>
      H2O2-&gt;H2+O2 (45)<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Since the rate of regeneration of the metal, Me, and the
      mineral acid are significantly lower than the rate of oxidation of
      the metal, Me, by a mineral acid, it is the regeneration of the
      metal, Me, and the mineral acid that proves to be rate-determining
      in this process. Since the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide
      (equation 42) is more favorable than the oxidation of water
      (equation 31), the rate of hydrogen formation is significantly
      enhanced when hydrogen peroxide is used in the place of water.
      This, of course, must be balanced by the fact that hydrogen
      peroxide is obviously a more costly reagent to supply, and that
      the ratio of elemental hydrogen to elemental oxygen becomes one
      part hydrogen to one part oxygen as indicated in equation 45. This
      would differ from the ratio of two parts hydrogen to one part
      oxygen as found in equation 34, where water is oxidized. In cases
      where the rate of hydrogen production is the more critical factor,
      the use of hydrogen peroxide will offer a significant advantage.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A further means by which the rate of hydrogen production
      could be increased would involve the inclusion of a nonmetal in
      the reaction such as, but not limited to, carbon or sulfur. Using
      the symbol Z to represent the nonmetal, equation 42 would be
      replaced by equation 46 which portrays a more facile reaction due
      to the thermodynamic stability of the oxide of the nonmetal.<br>
      <br>
      H2O2+Z-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +ZO2+2e&lt;-&gt; (46)<br>
      <br>
      Equation 44 would then be replaced by equation 47, and equation 45
      would be replaced by equation 48.<br>
      <br>
      2Me&lt;+&gt; +H2O2+Z-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +2Me+ZO2 (47)<br>
      H2O2+Z-&gt;H2+ZO2 (48)<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Thus, rather than resulting in the formation of elemental
      oxygen, O2, the reaction would produce an oxide such as CO2 or SO2
      of a nonmetal, where the thermodynamic stability of the nonmetal
      oxide would provide an additional driving force for the reaction,
      and thus result in an even faster rate of hydrogen production.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] A further alternative to this process involves the
      introduction of other reducing agents, such as formic acid, to
      react in the place of water or hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the
      reactions illustrated in equations 31 and 32 would be replaced by
      similar reactions illustrated by equations 38 and 39. The net
      result of these two reactions would be the reaction represented in
      equation 40, the production of elemental hydrogen using an
      elemental metal, Me, and a mineral acid as reactants.<br>

      <br>
      [0073] The elemental metal, Me, as well as the mineral acid would
      then be regenerated as a result of a different voltaic
      electrochemical process followed by a thermal reaction. In this
      case, however, the colloidal metal, Mr, reacts with formic acid in
      an oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 41 and 49.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0074] Due to the fact that formic acid has a very favorable
      positive oxidation potential compared to the negative ones
      reported for water and for hydrogen peroxide, as shown by the
      standard oxidation potentials listed below, the
      oxidation-reduction reaction resulting from equations 41 and 49
      takes place at an enhanced rate compared to the
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 30 and 31, or
      the oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 41 and 42.<br>

      oxidation=0.199V<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The colloidal metal, Mr, can in principle be any metal but
      works most efficiently when the metal has a high (more positive)
      reduction potential. Thus, the regeneration process takes place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal is as low as possible on
      the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any colloidal
      metal will be successful, but the reaction works well with
      colloidal silver ion, for example, due to the high reduction
      potential of silver. When silver is employed as the colloidal
      metal ion in equations 41 and 49, the pair of reactions is found
      to take place quite readily. The voltaic reaction produces a
      positive voltage as the oxidation and reduction reactions
      indicated take place. This positive voltage can be used to supply
      the energy required for other chemical processes. In fact, the
      voltage produced can even be used to supply an over-potential for
      reactions employing equations 41 and 49 taking place in another
      reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can be made to
      take place more quickly without the supply of an external source
      of energy. The resulting colloidal metal, Mr, will then react to
      regenerate the metal, Me (equation 43).<br>
      <br>
      2Me&lt;+&gt; +2Mr-&gt;2Mr&lt;+&gt; +2Me (43)<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The reaction illustrated by equation 43 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is more reactive
      than the metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 43 will
      proceed most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mr, is above
      the metal, Me, on the electromotive series of metals. The
      combining of equations 41, 49 and 43 produces the net reaction
      shown by equation 50. The net reaction represented by equation 50
      results in the regeneration of the elemental metal, Me, the
      regeneration of the acid, and the formation of carbon dioxide.<br>

      <br>
      [0077] The reactions shown in equations 41 and 49 seem to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, Mr, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals. However, the reaction depicted by
      equation 43 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      Mr, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 50, which is merely the
      sum of equations 41, 49, and 43, could, in fact, be maximally
      facilitated by either colloidal metals of higher activity or by
      colloidal metals of lower activity. The relative importance of the
      reaction illustrated by equations 41 and 49 compared to the
      reaction shown in equation 43 would determine the characteristics
      of the colloidal metal that would best assist the net reaction in
      equation 50. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 50 proceeds at a maximal rate when the colloidal metal is
      of maximum activity, that is, when the colloidal metal is as high
      as possible on the electromotive series of metals. It has been
      found that the more reactive colloidal metals such as, but not
      limited to, colloidal magnesium ion and colloidal aluminum ion,
      produce the most facile reduction processes for the reduction of
      the cationic metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The combination of equations 40 and 50 results in a net
      process indicated in equation 51. Since equation 51 merely depicts
      the decomposition of formic acid into elemental hydrogen and
      carbon dioxide, the complete process for the production of
      elemental hydrogen now has only formic acid as an expendable
      substance, and the only necessary energy source is supplied by
      ambient thermal conditions. Although the providing of additional
      energy would result in an enhanced rate of hydrogen formation, the
      reaction proceeds efficiently when the only energy supplied is
      ambient thermal energy.<br>

      =<br>
      CH2O2-&gt;H2+CO2 (51)<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Since the regeneration of the metal, Me, and the mineral
      acid are significantly lower with respect to reaction rate than
      the oxidation of the metal, Me, by a mineral acid, it is the
      regeneration of the metal, Me, and the mineral acid that is
      believed to be rate determining in this process. Since the
      oxidation of formic acid (equation 49) is more favorable than the
      oxidation of water (equation 31), or the oxidation of hydrogen
      peroxide (equation 42), the rate of hydrogen formation is
      significantly enhanced when formic acid is used in the place of
      water or in the place of hydrogen peroxide. This, of course, must
      be balanced by the facts that formic acid is a more costly reagent
      than water, but a less costly one than hydrogen peroxide, and that
      the co-product formed along with hydrogen is carbon dioxide rather
      than oxygen. Additionally, the ratio of elemental hydrogen to
      carbon dioxide is one part hydrogen to one part carbon dioxide, as
      indicated in equation 51. This would differ from the ratio of two
      parts hydrogen to one part oxygen, as found in equation 34, where
      water is oxidized. In cases, however, where the rate of hydrogen
      production is the most critical factor, the use of formic acid
      will offer a significant advantage. Multiple Metals<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Finally, while all equations depicted here involve the use
      of just a single metal, Me, in addition to the colloidal metal(s)
      M and/or Mr, it has been found that all of the reactions discussed
      herein can be carried out using a combination of two or more
      different metals in the place of the single metal, Me, along with
      one or more colloidal metal(s). It has been found, in fact, that
      in some cases the use of multiple metals results in a significant
      rate enhancement over a rather large period of time. In
      experiments #7 and #10, for example, both metallic iron and
      metallic aluminum are used. The steady state production of
      hydrogen that results from experiment #10, for example, is
      approximately 100 mL of hydrogen per minute with the total volume
      of the reaction vessel being just over 100 mL. In experiments #8
      and #9, similar reactions are carried out with just a single
      metal, aluminum, and it is demonstrated that when the reaction
      rate decreases, the addition of the second metal, iron, results in
      an immediate rate increase to a rate similar to those reactions
      where the two metals were present throughout the reaction.
      Reactions in Neutral or Basic Media<br>
      <br>
      [0081] When any metal, regardless of its normal reactivity, is
      used in its colloidal form, the reaction of the metal with water
      in neutral or basic solutions can take place at an accelerated
      rate. Equations 52-54 are general equations that can be made to
      occur for any metals in spite of their normal reactivity, where Mf
      represents any metal in colloidal form. Mf, for instance, can
      represent but is not limited to Ag, Cu, Sn, Zn, Pb, Mg, Fe, Al and
      Cd. In fact, it has been found that the reactions shown in
      equations 52-54 occur at a significant rate.<br>
      <br>
      2Mf+2H2O-&gt;2MfOH+H2 (52)<br>
      Mf+2H2O-&gt;Mf(OH)2+H2 (53)<br>
      2Mf+6H2O-&gt;2Mf(OH)3+3H2 (54)<br>
      <br>
      [0082] Even though equations 52-54 would represent largely
      endothermic processes for a great many metals, particularly those
      of traditional low reactivity (for example but not limited to
      silver, gold, copper, tin, lead, nickel, and zinc), the rates of
      the reactions depicted in equations 52-54 could in fact be very
      large due to the surface effects caused by the use of the
      colloidal metal. While reactions represented by equations 52-54
      would take place at a highly accelerated rate, they would not
      result in a useful production of elemental hydrogen since the
      colloidal metal by definition is present in very low
      concentrations, and would therefore yield insignificant amounts of
      hydrogen upon reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] A useful preparation of hydrogen can result by the
      inclusion of a solid metal, Ms, more reactive than the colloidal
      metal, Mf, such as but not limited to elemental aluminum, iron,
      lead, nickel, tin, tungsten, or zinc. Thus any colloidal metal in
      its ionic form would be expected to react with the solid metal,
      Ms, as indicated in equation 55, where those metals below Ms on
      the electromotive or activity series of metals would react best.<br>
      <br>
      Ms+Mf&lt;+&gt; -&gt;Mf+Ms&lt;+&gt; (55)<br>
      <br>
      [0084] The reaction illustrated by equation 55 would in fact take
      place quite readily due to the large effective surface area of the
      colloidal ion, Mf&lt;+&gt; , and also perhaps due to the greater
      reactivity of the solid metal Ms, compared to any metal of lower
      reactivity. In fact, for colloidal metals normally lower in
      reactivity than Ms, equation 55 would be an exothermic reaction.
      The resulting metal, Mf, would be theorized to be present in
      colloidal form and thus would undergo a facile reaction with water
      to produce elemental hydrogen and a base, either by equation 52,
      53, or 54 depending upon the oxidation state of the resulting
      colloidal metal ion.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] Although the reaction represented by equations 52, 53, or
      54 would most likely be endothermic, it is believed that the
      exothermicity of the reaction shown in equation 55 compensates for
      this. Therefore, the combination of the two reactions yields a
      process that is thermally obtainable.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] Consequently, elemental hydrogen is efficiently and easily
      produced by the combination of the reactions shown in equations 56
      and 57.<br>
      <br>
      4Ms+4Mf&lt;+-&gt;4&gt; Mf+4Ms&lt;+&gt; (56)<br>
      4Mf+4H2O-&gt;4Mf&lt;+1&gt; +2H2+4OH&lt;-&gt; (57)<br>
      <br>
      [0087] As shown, the solid metal, Ms, reacts with the colloidal
      metal ion (equation 56) to produce a product theorized to be a
      colloidal metal. It is believed the colloidal metal will then
      react with water in equation 57 to produce elemental hydrogen and
      regenerate the colloidal metal ion. The colloidal metal ion will
      then react again by equation 56, followed again by equation 57,
      and so on in a chain reaction process to provide an efficient
      source of elemental hydrogen. In principle, any colloidal metal
      ion should undergo this process successfully. It is found that the
      reaction works most efficiently when the colloidal metal ion is
      lower in reactivity than the metal, Ms, on the electromotive
      series table. Equations 56 and 57 can be combined, and this would
      result in the net reaction that is illustrated by equation 58.
      Equation 58 has as its result the production of elemental hydrogen
      from the reaction of a metal, Ms, and water.<br>

      4Ms+4H2O-&gt;4Ms&lt;+&gt; +2H2+4OH&lt;-&gt; (58)<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Equation 58 summarizes a process that can provide an
      efficient production of elemental hydrogen where an elemental
      metal, Ms, and water are consumed. It is believed, however, that
      the elemental metal can be regenerated as a result of a voltaic
      electrochemical process and a thermal process that follows. A
      colloidal metal, which can be the same or different from the one
      represented in equation 56 referred to as Mrs in equation 59, can
      undergo a voltaic oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by
      equations 59 and 60.<br>
      <br>
      Cathode (reduction) 4Mrs&lt;+&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4Mrs (59)<br>
      Anode (oxidation) 4OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O+O2+4e&lt;-&gt; (60)<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The colloidal metal, Mrs, can in principle be any metal but
      works most efficiently when the metal has a higher (more positive)
      reduction potential. Thus, the regeneration process takes place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal is as low as possible on
      the electromotive series of metals. Consequently, any colloidal
      metal will be successful, but the reaction works best with
      colloidal silver ion, due to the high reduction potential of
      silver. When silver is employed as the colloidal metal ion, for
      example, the reactions portrayed in equations 59 and 60 take place
      readily. The voltaic reaction produces a positive voltage, as the
      indicated oxidation and reduction reactions occur. This positive
      voltage can be used to supply the energy required for other
      chemical processes. In fact, the voltage produced can even be used
      to supply an over-potential for reactions employing the
      conversions portrayed by equations 59 and 60 but taking place in
      another reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can be
      made to take place more quickly without the supply of an external
      source of energy. It is believed that the resulting colloidal
      metal, Mrs, may then react to regenerate the elemental metal, Ms
      (equation 61).<br>
      <br>
      4Ms&lt;+&gt; +4Mrs-&gt;4Mrs&lt;+&gt; +4Ms (61)<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The reaction illustrated by equation 61 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, Mrs, is more reactive
      than the metal, Ms. That is, the reaction in equation 61 will
      proceed most readily when the colloidal metal, Mrs, is above the
      metal, Ms, on the electromotive series of metals. Combining
      equations 59-61 results in the chemical reaction represented by
      equation 62, which results in the regeneration of the elemental
      metal Ms, and the formation of elemental oxygen.<br>

      [0091] The reactions shown in equations 59 and 60 seem to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, Mrs, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals; however, the reaction depicted by
      equation 61 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      Mrs, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 62 is merely the sum of
      equations 59, 60, and 61 and could be maximally facilitated by
      either colloidal metals of higher activity or by colloidal metals
      of lower activity. The relative importance of the reaction
      illustrated by equations 59 and 60 compared to the reaction shown
      in equation 61 would determine the characteristics of the
      colloidal metal that would best assist the net reaction in
      equation 62.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 62 proceeds at a maximal rate when the colloidal metal is
      of maximum activity, that is, when the colloidal metal is as high
      as possible on the electromotive series of metals. It has been
      found that the more reactive colloidal metal ions such as, but not
      limited to colloidal magnesium ion or colloidal aluminum ion
      produce the most facile processes for the reduction of cationic
      metals. In fact, it has been found that the overall reaction
      proceeds most efficiently when at least two colloidal metals are
      present, preferably where at least one of the colloidal metal ions
      is higher than the solid metal Me on the electromotive series, and
      at least one of the colloidal metal ions is lower than the solid
      metal Me on the electromotive series. In such case, it is believed
      that the less reactive colloidal metal performs the Mf functions
      described above, while the more reactive colloidal metal performs
      the Mrs functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Combining equations 58 and 62 results in a net process
      indicated in equation 34. Since equation 34 merely depicts the
      decomposition of water into elemental hydrogen and elemental
      oxygen, the complete process for the production of elemental
      hydrogen now has only water as an expendable substance.<br>

      =<br>
      2H2O-&gt;2H2+O2 (34)<br>
      <br>
      [0094] The net result of this process is exactly that which would
      result from the electrolysis of water. Here, however, no
      electrical energy needs to be supplied. It is believed that the
      colloidal metallic ion catalysts, as well as the metal Me, are
      regenerated during the process, leaving only water as a consumable
      material. Controllable Reactions<br>
      <br>
      [0095] While all of the processes described above can provide an
      efficient production of hydrogen gas at a wide range of pH levels,
      and most operate efficiently even at ambient temperatures, it is
      rather difficult to control the rate of hydrogen formation; that
      is, once the process has begun, it cannot conveniently be stopped
      and restarted as needed. An improvement that addresses this
      difficulty has been developed that uses two electrodes, an anode
      and a cathode, along with one or more colloidal metal catalysts.
      The best results have been found when the anode is a metal of low
      to intermediate reactivity and the cathode is generally inert, but
      highly conductive. It has been found, in fact, that even
      metallic-like materials such as tungsten carbide can be employed
      as the cathode. Additionally, significant rate enhancement has
      also been achieved using, as the cathode, nickel which has been
      melted with an acetylene torch with a carbonizing flame and then
      re-solidified. This process is believed to result in carbonized
      nickel.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] While in theory any two metals of different reactivity can
      be employed along with any colloidal metal catalysts at any level
      of pH, the process will be illustrated in the form of reactions
      performed at ambient temperature, under basic conditions using the
      metal-like material tungsten carbide as the cathode, the metal
      zinc as the anode, and colloidal silver and colloidal magnesium.
      Similar results were obtained for reactions carried out in acidic
      media as described in experiments 19-21.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Zinc is known to undergo reaction under basic conditions
      with water according to the reaction represented by equation 19.<br>
      <br>
      Zn+2H2O-&gt;H2+Zn(OH)2 (19)<br>
      <br>
      Due to the rather modest reactivity of zinc in alkaline solution,
      the reaction requires the input of significant thermal energy in
      order to proceed at a reasonable rate. In fact, if this reaction
      is performed at room temperature, the observed reaction rate is
      virtually zero. In theory, the rate of this reaction could be
      enhanced by the inclusion of a colloidal metal catalyst. If
      colloidal silver in its ionic form, Agc&lt;+&gt; , is introduced,
      the colloidal silver ion will react efficiently with the zinc, due
      to the large effective surface area of the colloidal silver ion,
      and also perhaps due to the enhanced reactivity of zinc compared
      to silver, a result of the fact that zinc is above silver in the
      electromotive series. Thus, the colloidal silver ion will undergo
      reaction with zinc at an impressive rate according to equation 63.<br>
      <br>
      2Agc&lt;+&gt; +Zn-&gt;Zn&lt;+2&gt; +2Agc (63)<br>
      <br>
      The reduced silver, Agc, would be theorized to be present in a
      colloidal form and would thus undergo a facile reaction with water
      to produce elemental hydrogen and a base, as illustrated in
      equation 64.<br>
      <br>
      2Agc+2H2O-&gt;H2+2Agc&lt;+&gt; +2OH&lt;-&gt; (64)<br>
      <br>
      [0098] Although the reaction represented by equation 64 would most
      likely be endothermic, it is believed that the exothermicity of
      the reaction shown in equation 63 compensates for this. Therefore,
      the combination of the two reactions yields a process that is
      thermally obtainable.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] Consequently, elemental hydrogen is efficiently and easily
      produced by the combination of the reactions shown in equations 65
      and 66.<br>

      [0100] As shown, the solid zinc metal reacts with the colloidal
      silver ion in equation 65 to produce a product theorized to be
      elemental colloidal silver. It is believed the elemental colloidal
      silver will then react with water in equation 66 to produce
      elemental hydrogen and regenerate the colloidal-silver ion. The
      colloidal-silver ion will then react again by equation 65,
      followed again by equation 66, and so on in a chain reaction
      process to provide an efficient source of elemental hydrogen.
      Equations 65 and 66 can be combined, and this would result in the
      net reaction that is illustrated by equation 67. Equation 67 has
      as its result the production of elemental hydrogen from the
      reaction of zinc and water.<br>

      <br>
      [0101] Equation 67 summarizes a process that can provide an
      efficient production of elemental hydrogen where elemental zinc
      and water are consumed. It is believed, however, that the
      elemental zinc can be regenerated as a result of a voltaic
      electrochemical process and a thermal process that follows. Thus,
      colloidal magnesium ion Mgc&lt;+2 &gt; can undergo a voltaic
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 68 and 60.<br>

      <br>
      [0102] It is believed that the resulting colloidal metal, Mgc, may
      then react to regenerate the elemental zinc (equation 69).<br>

      <br>
      [0103] The reaction illustrated by equation 69 will take place
      quite efficiently due to the fact that magnesium is above zinc on
      the electromotive series of metals. Combining equations 68, 60,
      and 69 results in the reaction illustrated in equation 70, which
      represents the regeneration of the elemental zinc, and the
      formation of elemental oxygen.<br>

      <br>
      [0104] Combining equations 67 and 70 results in a net process
      indicated in equation 34. Since equation 34 merely depicts the
      decomposition of water into elemental hydrogen and elemental
      oxygen, the complete process for the production of elemental
      hydrogen now has only water as an expendable substance.<br>

      <br>
      [0105] The net result of this process is exactly that which would
      result from the electrolysis of water. Here, however, no
      electrical energy needs to be supplied. It is believed that the
      colloidal metallic ion catalysts as well as the elemental zinc are
      regenerated during the process; since the base is not consumed,
      water is the only material consumed.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] While the net process illustrated by equation 67 is
      catalyzed by colloidal silver ion in an alkaline solution, the
      reaction rate is still found to be extremely slow at ambient
      temperatures presumably due to the low reactivity of zinc in the
      absence of additional thermal energy. The reaction rate can be
      significantly enhanced by the introduction of a second material
      that is inert but highly conductive, such as, but not limited to,
      tungsten carbide, which will be employed for this discussion. For
      this rate enhancement to be observable, the tungsten carbide must
      be conductively connected to the metallic zinc. The required
      connection can be achieved by having the two materials directly in
      contact, or they can be connected by a conductive medium,
      preferably made of a material low in reactivity such as copper.
      Under these conditions, the reaction represented by equation 65 is
      followed by an electrochemical voltaic process transpiring as
      illustrated in equations 71 and 60. The oxidation reaction
      represented by equation 71 takes place at the surface of the zinc
      electrode and the reduction reaction represented by equation 60
      occurs at the surface of the tungsten carbide electrode.<br>

      <br>
      [0107] When equations 71 and 60 are combined, the result is a
      voltaic oxidation-reduction reaction that is represented by
      equation 66.<br>
      <br>
      Oxidation-4Agc-&gt;4Agc&lt;+&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; (71)<br>

      <br>
      [0108] Thus, the net reaction illustrated by equation 66 has two
      significant applications that can be employed individually or
      simultaneously. Equation 66 results in the generation of elemental
      hydrogen; however equation 66 also produces a measurable
      electrical potential that will produce a potentially useful
      electrical current. Therefore the chemical system described here
      can provide a voltaic cell that produces energy. Concurrently,
      there is the production of hydrogen gas which can be used to
      provide additional energy when employed in a hydrogen cell or
      engine.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] The favorable potential produced by equation 66 allows the
      entire process to proceed without the requirement of an outside
      energy source. It is the favorable energetics of equation 66 that
      provide the driving force for the entire process. If the
      connection between the zinc electrode and the tungsten carbide
      electrode is broken, however, the reaction of equation 66 will not
      occur, resulting in a decrease or a virtual cessation in the rate
      of production of hydrogen. Thus one can generate hydrogen gas in a
      completely controllable manner simply by completing and
      disconnecting the circuit created by connecting the tungsten
      carbide and zinc electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Combining equations 65, 71 and 60 again yields a net
      reaction that is illustrated by equation 67 as shown below.<br>
      <br>

      2Zn+4H2O-&gt;2Zn&lt;+2&gt; +2H2+4OH&lt;-&gt; (67)<br>
      <br>
      With the inclusion of the tungsten carbide electrode however, the
      net reaction shown by equation 67 will now progress at a
      significantly enhanced rate. It has been found that the generation
      of elemental hydrogen takes place at a considerable rate even at
      usual ambient temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Cathode Surface Area</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0111] Since the rate of hydrogen production is at least partially
      dependent upon the surface area of the cathode, the reaction rate
      can be further enhanced using any means that increases the surface
      area of the cathode. In fact, it has been shown that if the
      cathode is present as a thin foil or as a mesh in order to
      increase its surface area, there is an increase in the rate of
      hydrogen formation. Alternatively, it has been shown that the use
      of multiple cathodes, each in electrical contact with the metallic
      zinc anode, produces an increase in the rate of hydrogen
      production presumably resulting from the increase in the surface
      area of the cathode. The combination of these two effects results
      in an large surface area of the cathode, and a corresponding
      increase in the rate of hydrogen produced. Regeneration of Metal<br>
      <br>
      [0112] Although elemental zinc is consumed (equation 67), it is
      believed the zinc can be regenerated as a result of a voltaic
      electrochemical process and a subsequent thermal process similar
      to that shown for the regeneration of elemental metal, Ms, in
      equation 61. Thus, colloidal magnesium ion, Mgc&lt;+2&gt; , can
      take part in a voltaic oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by
      equations 68 and 60.<br>

      <br>
      [0113] The resulting colloidal magnesium, Mgc, will then react to
      reproduce elemental zinc (equation 69).<br>

      2Mgc+2Zn&lt;+2&gt; -&gt;2Mgc&lt;+2&gt; +2Zn (69)<br>
      <br>
      Combining equations 68, 60, and 69 yields a reaction illustrated
      by equation 70 which represents the regeneration of the elemental
      zinc, and the formation of elemental oxygen.<br>

      <br>
      [0114] Combining equations 67 and 70 results in equation 34. Since
      equation 34 merely depicts the decomposition of water into
      elemental hydrogen and elemental oxygen, the complete process for
      the production of elemental hydrogen now has only water as an
      expendable substance.<br>

      =<br>
      2H2O-&gt;2H2+O2 (34)<br>
      <br>
      [0115] The net result of this process is exactly that which would
      result from the electrolysis of water, but no electrical energy
      needs to be supplied. It is believed that the colloidal metallic
      ion catalysts as well as the zinc metal are regenerated during the
      process, leaving water as the only consumable material. Since the
      net process shown by reaction 34 is dependent upon the electrical
      connection of the electrodes, the production of elemental hydrogen
      can be interrupted and resumed simply by breaking and reforming
      the electrical contact through a switch that connects and
      disconnects the two electrodes through a conductive inert wire.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] Thus in the process depicted by the net equation 67
      elemental hydrogen is produced along with the concurrent oxidation
      of elemental zinc to zinc ion. In the process portrayed by the net
      equation 70, the zinc ion is reduced to elemental zinc with the
      concurrent formation of elemental oxygen. As stated above, the
      theoretical net result of equations 67 and 70 is equation 34. It
      has been found, however, that the net reaction represented by
      equation 70 does not occur at a rate competitive with the net
      reaction depicted in equation 67. Thus under normal circumstances,
      the production of hydrogen is believed to take place at a rate
      significantly greater than the production of oxygen. In addition,
      the zinc metal will undergo oxidation more quickly than the zinc
      ion undergoes reduction so therefore the zinc electrode will
      eventually become depleted. It is clear, then, that the rate of
      the process will eventually slow to a point where the production
      of hydrogen will no longer proceed at a useful rate.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] It has been found however that the reduction of zinc ion to
      yield elemental zinc can be achieved through an electrolytic
      process. Thus, a potential can be applied in the direction
      opposite to the normal flow of electrons to produce a different
      oxidation-reduction process. As outlined in experiments 15 and 16,
      the application of an external electrical potential causes the
      oxidation reaction of equation 60 and the reduction reaction of
      equation 72 to occur.<br>
      <br>
      Oxidation-4OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O+O2+4e&lt;-&gt; (60)<br>
      Reduction-2Zn&lt;+2&gt; +4e-2Zn (72)<br>
      <br>
      The addition of equation 60 and equation 72 once again results in
      equation 70, where the elemental zinc is regenerated on the
      electrode with the simultaneous production of elemental oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      4OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O+O2+4e&lt;-&gt; (60)<br>

      2Zn&lt;+2&gt; +4OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O+2Zn+O2 (70)<br>
      <br>
      From the standard oxidation and reduction potentials shown below,
      it is clear that the reactions represented by equations 60 and 72
      will not take place spontaneously, having a standard cell
      potential of -1.136 volts.<br>
      <br>
      4OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O+O2+4e&lt;-&gt; [epsilon]&lt;0&gt;
      oxidation=-0.401 V<br>
      2Zn&lt;+2&gt; +4e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2Zn[epsilon]&lt;0&gt;
      reduction=-0.762 V<br>
      <br>
      The application of an external electrical potential will however
      cause this process to easily occur. Thus, when the production of
      hydrogen slows to an unacceptable rate, the process may be
      reversed by electrolysis, and the resulting rate of hydrogen
      formation will increase to that observed at the beginning of the
      process. Alternatively, the anode may simply be replaced.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] In the preceding discussion, the colloidal metal ion
      catalysts, Mf and Mr, are supplied along with the reactants as
      described in experiments 11 through 16. However, it has been found
      that the process can still proceed even without supplying
      colloidal metal catalysts as described in experiment 17. Although
      the reaction rate is decreased by a factor of approximately
      one-half, the production of elemental hydrogen is visibly obvious,
      and the voltaic potential produced is about the same as in the
      catalyzed reaction. The fact that the reaction can proceed with
      the apparent lack of catalysis is explained by the fact that
      metallic zinc and many other metals react very slowly with water
      in neutral or basic solutions to produce cations, such as the
      Zn&lt;+2 &gt; ion, in very low concentration, as illustrated in
      equation 73.<br>
      <br>
      Zn+2H2O-&gt;H2+Zn&lt;+2&gt; +2OH&lt;-&gt; (73)<br>
      <br>
      [0119] The cations produced in equation 73 will take part in the
      reaction in the same manner as the colloidal ions; however, they
      would catalyze the process with a limited efficiency compared to
      the colloidal catalysts. Thus when the catalysts are not
      physically added to the reaction mixture, it is still the
      catalyzed process discussed previously that occurs. Controllable
      Reactions at an Enhanced Rate in Acidic Media<br>
      <br>
      [0120] The rate of hydrogen production can also be increased by
      using as the anode a metal of higher reactivity, such as aluminum,
      and as the cathode a material that is inert but highly conductive,
      such as tungsten carbide, in a highly acidic solution that
      contains one or more dissolved acids, such as, but not limited to,
      sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid. Additionally, there are
      preferably one or more salts or metal oxides (where, in acidic
      media, a metal oxide is the precursor to a salt) dissolved in the
      acidic solution, where each salt or metal oxide contains a cation
      of intermediate reactivity. For example, the salts or metal oxides
      may be, but are not limited to, zinc sulfide, zinc chloride,
      cobalt(II) sulfate, cobalt(II) chloride, zinc oxide, or cobalt(II)
      oxide. The solution preferably also contains one or more
      colloidal-metal ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] While there are numerous ways in which this process may be
      performed, for the purposes of illustration, the process will be
      described where the reaction medium is a solution of sulfuric acid
      that contains colloidal silver ion, colloidal magnesium ion and
      zinc sulfate. Aluminum will be discussed as the metal of high
      reactivity, and tungsten carbide will be employed as the highly
      conductive, inert material.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] At low values of pH, aluminum is known to produce hydrogen
      at a significant rate by reaction with sulfuric acid as
      illustrated by equation 74.<br>
      <br>
      4Al+12H&lt;+&gt; +6SO4&lt;-2&gt; -&gt;4Al&lt;+3&gt;
      +6H2+6SO4&lt;-2 &gt; (74)<br>
      <br>
      [0123] The rate of this reaction is in fact so impressive that the
      reaction of aluminum and sulfuric acid is often described as being
      uncontrollable. The rate of this reaction can be even further
      enhanced by the inclusion of colloidal silver ion, Agc&lt;+&gt; ,
      which is believed to catalyze the reaction. Thus, aluminum will
      react with the colloidal silver ion in a reaction represented by
      equation 75. The metallic silver, Agc, that results is presumed to
      be in a colloidal state and is expected to react with sulfuric
      acid to produce elemental hydrogen by the reaction described by
      equation 76. Due to the colloidal nature of the silver, this
      reaction occurs at an even greater rate than the reaction of
      aluminum and sulfuric acid represented by equation 74.<br>

      <br>
      [0124] Combining equations 75 and 76 results in the net equation
      74. However, the rate of hydrogen production will be enhanced by
      the presence of the colloidal silver.<br>

      <br>
      [0125] Equation 74 summarizes a process that can provide an
      extremely efficient production of elemental hydrogen where
      elemental aluminum and sulfuric acid are consumed. It is believed,
      however, that the elemental aluminum and the sulfuric acid can
      both be regenerated as a result of a voltaic electrochemical
      process and a thermal process described below:<br>
      <br>
      [0126] Colloidal magnesium ion Mgc&lt;+2 &gt; can undergo a

      [0128] The reaction illustrated by equation 79 will take place
      quite efficiently due to the fact that magnesium is above aluminum
      on the electromotive series of metals. Combining equations 77, 78
      and 79 results in the reaction illustrated in equation 80, which
      represents the regeneration of the elemental aluminum, the
      regeneration of the sulfuric acid, and the formation of elemental
      oxygen.<br>

      [0129] Combining equations 74 and 80 results in a net process
      indicated in equation 81. Since equation 81 merely depicts the
      decomposition of water into elemental hydrogen and elemental
      oxygen, the complete process for the production of elemental
      hydrogen now has only water as an expendable starting material.<br>

      [0130] The net result of this process is exactly that which would
      result from the electrolysis of water. Here, however, no
      electrical energy needs to be supplied. It is believed that the
      colloidal metallic ion catalysts as well as the elemental aluminum
      are regenerated during the process; since the acid is not
      consumed, water is the only material consumed.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] It has been found that the reaction illustrated by equation
      74, whether catalyzed or uncatalyzed, can be inhibited by the
      dissolving of zinc sulfate into the sulfuric acid solution. In the
      absence of the colloidal silver catalyst, the elemental aluminum
      is thought to react with the zinc cation, thus replacing the
      reaction illustrated by equation 74 with the reaction depicted by
      equation 82. While the reaction of aluminum and zinc cation occurs
      preferentially to the reaction of aluminum and sulfuric acid, it
      has been found that the reaction proceeds at a rather low rate
      and, therefore, the aluminum is not appreciably consumed.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0132] With the inclusion of the colloidal silver cation, the
      reaction illustrated in equation 76 is replaced by the reaction
      shown in equation 83. Once again, while the reaction of colloidal
      silver and zinc cation occurs preferentially to the reaction of
      colloidal silver and sulfuric acid, it has been found that the
      reaction proceeds at a rather low rate. Thus, combining equations
      75 and 84 results in the net equation 85. The reaction illustrated
      in equation 85 results in the consumption of aluminum; however, it
      is found to proceed at a rather low rate, and, thus, will not
      result in a large consumption of aluminum. The reaction shown in
      equation 85 will still, however, take place preferentially when in
      competition with the net reaction that is depicted in equation 74.<br>

      <br>
      [0133] Thus, the effect of the introduction of zinc chloride would
      be to severely limit or completely terminate the production of
      hydrogen from the net oxidation of aluminum. It has been found,
      however, that the rate of hydrogen formation can be increased to
      the point where it competes successfully with the net reaction
      depicted in equation 85. Specifically, the reaction rate for
      hydrogen production can be significantly enhanced by the
      introduction of a second material that is inert but highly
      conductive, such as, but not limited to, tungsten carbide, which
      will be employed for this discussion. Alternatively, in place of
      tungsten carbide, significant rate enhancement has also been
      achieved using nickel which has been melted with an acetylene
      torch with a carbonizing flame and then re-solidified. For this
      rate enhancement to be observable, the tungsten carbide must be
      conductively connected to the metallic aluminum. The required
      connection can be achieved by having the two materials directly in
      contact, or they can be attached by a conductive medium,
      preferably made of a material low in reactivity such as copper.
      Under these conditions, the reaction represented by equation 75 is
      followed by an electrochemical voltaic process transpiring as
      illustrated in equations 86 and 87. The oxidation reaction
      represented by equation 86 is believed to take place at the
      surface of the aluminum electrode and the reduction reaction
      represented by equation 87 is believed to occur at the surface of
      the tungsten carbide electrode.<br>

      Reduction-12H&lt;+&gt; +12e&lt;-&gt; -&gt;6H2 (87)<br>
      <br>
      [0134] When equations 86 and 87 are combined, the result is a
      voltaic oxidation-reduction reaction that is represented by
      equation 88.<br>
      <br>
      12Agc-&gt;12Agc&lt;+&gt; +12e&lt;-&gt; (86)<br>

      12Agc+12H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;12Agc&lt;+1&gt; +6H2 (88)<br>
      <br>
      [0135] Thus, the net reaction illustrated by equation 88 has two
      significant applications that can be employed individually or
      simultaneously. Equation 88 results in the generation of elemental
      hydrogen. Additionally, equation 88 produces a measurable
      electrical potential that could produce a potentially useful
      electrical current. Therefore, the chemical system described here
      can provide a voltaic cell that produces useful electrical energy.
      Concurrently, there is the production of hydrogen gas, which can
      be used to provide additional energy when employed in a hydrogen
      cell or an engine. The favorable potential produced by equation 88
      is believed to allow the entire process to proceed without the
      requirement of an outside energy source. It is the favorable
      energetics of equation 88 that is believed provides the driving
      force for the entire process. If the connection between the
      aluminum electrode and the tungsten carbide electrode is broken,
      however, the reaction of equation 88 will not occur, resulting in
      a decrease or a virtual cessation in the rate of production of
      hydrogen. Thus, one can generate hydrogen gas in a controllable
      manner simply by completing and disconnecting the circuit created
      by connecting the tungsten carbide and aluminum electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] Combining equations 75, 86 and 87 again yields a net
      reaction that is illustrated by equation 89 as shown below.<br>
      <br>

      4Al+12H&lt;+&gt; -&gt;4Al&lt;+3&gt; +6H2 (89)<br>
      <br>
      The reaction that is represented by equation 89 occurs at an
      impressive reaction rate due to the high reactivity of aluminum.
      With the inclusion of the tungsten carbide electrode, however, the
      net reaction shown by equation 89 will now progress at an even
      faster rate. It is believed that this is due at least in part to
      the increased surface area of the tungsten carbide compared to
      that of the colloidal elemental silver. It has been found that the
      generation of elemental hydrogen takes place at a considerable
      rate even at usual ambient temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] Since the rate of hydrogen production is believed to be at
      least partially dependent upon the surface area of the tungsten
      carbide cathode, the reaction rate can be further enhanced using
      any means that increases the surface area of the cathode. In fact,
      it has been shown that if the cathode is present as a thin foil or
      as a mesh in order to increase its surface area, there is an
      increase in the rate of hydrogen formation. Alternatively, it has
      been shown that the use of multiple cathodes, each in electrical
      contact with the metallic aluminum anode, produces an increase in
      the rate of hydrogen production, presumably resulting from the
      increase in the surface area of the cathode. The combination of
      these two effects, that is, the use of multiple cathodes
      consisting of a tungsten carbide mesh or foil, results in a large
      surface area of the cathode and a corresponding increase in the
      rate of hydrogen produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] Employing the chemistry described above, a controllable
      production of hydrogen at an extremely high rate can be achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] FIG. 1 shows a mixture and apparatus that may be used for
      the production of hydrogen. A reaction vessel 100 contains a
      reaction medium 102. The reaction medium preferably comprises
      water and, most preferably, further comprises either a base or an
      acid, although the reaction can exist at virtually any level of
      pH. Alternatively, it is believed that other reaction media may be
      used, including other solvents, or non-liquid media, such as
      gelatinous or gaseous media. In basic media, the base is
      preferably sodium hydroxide with a concentration of about 2.5
      Molar, although other bases and other concentrations may be used.
      In acidic media, the acid is preferably sulfuric acid or
      hydrochloric acid with a pH of about 1.0, although other acids and
      other concentrations may be used. The reaction vessel 100 is
      preferably inert to the reaction medium 102.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] The reaction medium 102 preferably contains a first
      colloidal metal (not shown) suspended in the solution. Although
      some of the reactions described above may proceed without a
      colloidal metal in the reaction medium 102, the colloidal metal
      significantly enhances the reaction rate. The first colloidal
      metal is preferably a metal with low activity, such as silver,
      gold, platinum, tin, lead, copper, zinc, or cadmium, although
      other metals may be used. Alternatively, as discussed above, other
      high-surface-area catalysts may be used in place of the colloidal
      metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] Preferably, there is at least one cathode 104 in contact
      with the reaction medium 102. The cathode 104 may be in any form,
      but is preferably in the form of a solid with a relatively large
      surface area. Most preferably, the cathode 104 comprises a
      plurality of surface-area-enhancing features 105, which increase
      the surface area of the cathode. The surface-area-enhancing
      features 105 are preferably arranged to allow the reaction medium
      102 or its constituents to move between them and to allow bubbles
      of produced gas to easily escape from the surface of the cathode
      104. The surface-area-enhancing features 105 are preferably
      vertically-oriented rods projecting upwardly from a base of the
      cathode 104. However, the surface-area-enhancing features may be
      any feature, in electrical contact with the cathode 104, which
      effectively increases the surface area of the cathode 104.
      Alternatively, the cathode 104 may be in another relatively
      high-surface-area form, such as a coil, film, wool, nanomaterial,
      nanocoating, or the like. Further alternatively, a plurality of
      cathodes 104 may be used which combine to provide a larger surface
      area. The total surface area of the cathode(s) 104 is preferably
      greater than the surface area of the anode.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The cathode 104 preferably comprises a material that is
      highly conductive but virtually inert to the reaction medium 102,
      such as nickel, carbonized nickel, tungsten, or tungsten carbide.
      The cathode 104 most preferably comprises tungsten carbide.<br>
      <br>
      [0143] The reaction vessel 100 also preferably comprises an anode
      106 in contact with the reaction medium. The anode 106 preferably
      comprises a metal of high-range activity, and thus of a higher
      activity than the cathode. Most preferably, the anode 106
      comprises aluminum, or a mixture of aluminum and other, less
      reactive, metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] Preferably, the reaction medium 102 also contains a second
      colloidal metal (not shown). The second colloidal metal preferably
      has a higher activity than the metals comprising the cathode 104
      and the anode 106, such as aluminum, magnesium, beryllium, and
      lithium. Alternatively, as discussed above, other
      high-surface-area catalysts may be used in place of the second
      colloidal metal.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] Preferably, the reaction medium 102 also contains an ionic
      salt (not shown) comprising a metal cation that is less reactive
      than the metal composing the anode 106, and an anion that is
      largely inert to other constituents in the reaction medium, such
      as, but not limited to, zinc sulfate, zinc chloride, cobalt(II)
      sulfate, and cobalt(II) chloride.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The cathode 104 and the anode 106 are preferably
      conductively connected through conductive paths 107 and 109,
      respectively, to a controller 108 which may be manipulated to
      allow or restrict the flow of electricity between the cathode 104
      and the anode 106. The controller 108 may be a switch, a variable
      resistor, or other device for allowing or resisting electric
      currents. When electrical current flows freely between the cathode
      104 and the anode 106, it is found that the production of hydrogen
      will be maximized. When the conductive contact between the cathode
      104 and the anode 106 is broken, hydrogen production will be
      minimal or zero. It is believed that a variable resistor between
      the anode 106 and the cathode 104 would allow a user to select
      from a wide range of hydrogen production rates.<br>
      <br>
      [0147] The electrical energy produced by the reaction, which flows
      from the anode 104 to the cathode 106 through the conductive paths
      107 and 109 may be used to provide electrical energy for a similar
      reaction occurring in a similar apparatus, or the system may be
      used as a battery, and the electrical energy created by the
      reaction can be used for other purposes. Alternatively, the
      cathode 104 and anode 105 may be placed in direct contact with one
      another.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] The reaction vessel 100 preferably comprises an outlet 110
      to allow hydrogen gas (not shown) and/or other products to escape.
      The reaction vessel may also have an inlet 112 for adding water or
      other constituents to maintain desired concentrations.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] In addition, an electrical power source 114 may be used to
      intermittedly provide an electrical current through the reaction
      medium 102. The electrical power source 114 may be a battery,
      power outlet, generator, transformer, or the like. The electrical
      power source 114 preferably provides DC electrical power at a
      potential of at least 12 volts. A first terminal 115 of the
      electrical power source 114 is electrically connected through
      conductive paths 116 and 109 to the anode 106. A second terminal
      117 of the electrical power source 114 is electrically connected
      through conductive paths 118 and 107 to the cathode 104.
      Preferably, the first terminal 115 has a higher electrical
      potential than the second terminal 117 so that when the controller
      108 is configured in an open position (restricting current flow
      between the anode 106 and cathode 108), the electrical potential
      source 114 will cause a flow of electrical current in the opposite
      direction from when the controller 108 is closed and no external
      potential is applied. Power is applied from the electrical power
      soure 114 as needed to regenerate the anode and increase the
      hydrogen production rate. For most of the reaction duration,
      however, current is not applied. Alternatively, the anode 106 may
      be replaced by a new anode 106.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] In addition, the apparatus preferably comprises an energy
      source 122. Although most of the reactions described above are
      believed to proceed without any energy input, hydrogen will be
      produced at a greater rate when additional energy is added. The
      energy source 122 shown in FIG. 1 is an electric heating coil,
      however, any form of thermal energy may be used including solar
      heating, combustion heating, hot plates, or the like. Generally,
      any energy source capable of heating the reaction medium above
      ambient temperatures may be used, and the particular source will
      preferably be chosen based on cost considerations. Additionally,
      it is believed that other energy types may be used, including,
      without limitation, electric energy, nuclear energy or
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The hydrogen gas produced may be used in many known ways.
      Particularly, without limitation, the produced gas may be fed to a
      fuel cell to produce electric energy. Thus, the hydrogen
      production apparatus shown in FIG. 1 may be combined with a fuel
      cell (not shown) to form a compact and efficient source of
      electrical energy, which could be used to power a wide variety of
      devices. Experimental Results: Experiment #1 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0152] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with iron
      pellets (sponge iron) and about 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and
      80 mL of colloidal lead, each at a concentration believed to be
      about 20 ppm. A theoretical maximum of 8.06 liters of hydrogen gas
      could be produced if solely from the consumption of the acids as
      indicated in Table 1.<br>

      <br>
      [0154] 1 mole H2SO4=98 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0155] Therefore, the maximum yield is 0.23 liters of H2 per gram
      of H2SO4.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] 2 moles of HCl yields 1 mole H2 (22.4 liters)<br>
      <br>
      [0157] 2 moles of HCl=73 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0158] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.31 liters of H2
      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0159] At least 15 liters of gas was observed to have been
      produced, and the reaction was still proceeding in a continuous
      fashion (about 2 bubbles of gas per second at 71[deg.] C.) when
      interrupted. It should be noted that the 15 liters of gas observed
      does not account likely losses of hydrogen gas due to leakage.
      Based upon previous observations and theoretical projections, the
      first 8.06 liters of gas produced is likely to be made up of
      essentially pure hydrogen; beyond the theoretical threshold of
      8.06 liters, 66.7% by volume of the gas produced would be hydrogen
      and the other 33.3% by volume would be oxygen. It is believed this
      experiment provides ample evidence of the regeneration process.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] A follow-up experiment was conducted using iron (III)
      chloride (FeCl3) as the only source of iron in an attempt to
      verify the reverse reaction. Pure iron (III) chloride was chosen
      because it could be shown to be free of iron in any other
      oxidation state. While similar experiments had been successfully
      carried out using iron (III) oxide as the source of iron, the
      results were clouded by the fact that other oxidation states of
      iron may have been present. The results are described in
      Experiment #2, below. Experiment #2 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0161] An experiment was conducted using 150 mL of iron (III)
      chloride in an aqueous solution (commonly used as an etching
      solution, purchased from Radio Shack) as the starting materials.
      Ten mL of 93% concentration sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was added to the
      solution, at which point no reaction occurred. About 50 mL of
      colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead, each at a
      concentration believed to be about 20 ppm, were then added, at
      which point a chemical reaction began and the bubbling of gases
      was evident at ambient temperature. The production of gas
      accelerated when the solution was heated to a temperature of
      65[deg.] C. The product gas was captured in soap bubbles and the
      bubbles were then ignited. The observed ignition of the gaseous
      product was typical for a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0162] Since hydrogen gas could only be produced with a concurrent
      oxidation of iron, it is evident that the iron (III) had to be
      initially reduced before it could be oxidized, thereby providing
      strong evidence of the reverse reaction. This experiment has
      subsequently been repeated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) instead of
      sulfuric acid, with similar results.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] Two additional follow-up experiments (#3 using aluminum
      metal and #4 using iron metal) were conducted to determine if more
      hydrogen is produced compared to the maximum amount expected
      solely from the consumption of the metal. These results are
      described below. Experiment #3 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0164] The starting solution had a total volume of 250 mL,
      including water, about 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of
      colloidal lead, each at a concentration believed to be about 20
      ppm, 10 mL of 93% concentration H2SO4, and 30 mL of 35%
      concentration HCl as in experiment #1 above. Ten grams of aluminum
      metal was added to the solution, which was heated and maintained
      at 90[deg.] C. The reaction ran for 1.5 hours and yielded 12
      liters of gas. The pH was found to have a value under 2.0 at the
      end of 1.5 hours. The reaction was stopped after 1.5 hours by
      removing the unused metal and weighing it. The non-consumed
      aluminum weighed 4.5 grams, indicating a consumption of 5.5 grams
      of aluminum. The maximum amount of hydrogen gas normally expected
      by the net consumption of 5.5 grams of aluminum is 6.8 liters, as
      indicated in the table below.<br>

      2 moles Al yields 3 moles H2 (67.2 liters)<br>
      <br>
      2 moles Al = 54 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0165] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 1.24 liters of H2
      per gram of Al is expected without the regeneration reaction
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] As in experiment #1, based on the total amount of acid
      supplied, it is expected that the first 8.06 liters of the gas
      generated is pure hydrogen with the balance being 50% hydrogen.
      Alternatively, the theoretical amount of hydrogen based on the
      amount of aluminum consumed is 6.84 liters. After 6.84 liters (the
      maximum yield expected from the aluminum consumed), it is expected
      that the remaining gas is 66.7% hydrogen. Therefore, it is
      estimated that about 10.3 liters of hydrogen (out of about 12
      total liters of gas) was produced in this experiment, compared to
      the maximum of 6.84 or 8.06 liters expected, based on the amount
      of aluminum consumed and the amount of acid supplied,
      respectively, thereby providing additional evidence of the
      regeneration process. Experiment #4 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0167] The starting solution included a total volume of 250 mL,
      including water, about 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of
      colloidal lead, each at a concentration believed to be about 20
      ppm, 10 mL of 93% concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35%
      concentration HCl, as in experiment #1 above. One hundred grams of
      iron pellets (sponge iron) was added to the solution, which was
      heated and maintained at 90[deg.] C. The reaction ran for 30 hours
      and yielded 15 liters of gas. The pH was found to have a value of
      about 5.0 at the end of 30 hours. The reaction was stopped after
      30 hours by removing the unused metal and weighing it. The
      non-consumed iron weighed 94 grams, indicating a consumption of 6
      grams of iron. The maximum amount of hydrogen gas normally
      expected by the net consumption of 6 grams of iron, without the
      regeneration reaction described above, is 2.41 liters, as
      indicated in the table below.<br>

      <br>
      1 mole Fe yields 1 mole H2 (22.4 liters)<br>
      <br>
      1 mole Fe = 55.85 grams<br>
      <br>
      [0168] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.40 liters of H2
      per gram of Fe is expected without the regeneration reaction
      described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] As in experiment #1, based on the total amount of acid
      supplied, it is expected that the first 8.06 liters of the gas
      generated is pure hydrogen with the balance being 66.7% hydrogen.
      However, the maximum theoretical generation of hydrogen based on
      the amount of iron consumed is 2.41 liters. After 2.41 liters (the
      maximum yield expected from the iron consumed), it is expected
      that the remaining gas is 66.7% hydrogen. Therefore, it is
      estimated that about 10.8 liters of hydrogen (out of about 15
      total liters of gas) was produced in this experiment using
      colloidal catalyst, well over the maximum of 2.41 liters expected
      with the amount of iron consumed, thereby providing additional
      evidence of the regeneration process. Experiment #5 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0170] An experiment was conducted using 200 mL of the final
      solution obtained from experiment #4, which contained oxidized
      iron plus catalyst and was found to have a pH of about 5. Acid was
      added to the solution, as in the above reactions, i.e., 10 mL of
      93% concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl that
      brought the pH to a level of about 1. No additional colloidal
      materials were added, but 20 grams of aluminum metal was added.
      The solution was maintained at a constant temperature of 96[deg.]
      C. The reaction proceeded to produce 32 liters of gas in a span of
      18 hours, at which point the rate of the reaction had slowed
      significantly and the pH of the solution had become approximately
      5.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] The metal remaining at the end of the 18-hour experiment
      was separated and found to have a mass of 9 grams. This metal
      appeared to be a mixture of Al and Fe. Therefore, neglecting the
      amount of iron and aluminum remaining in solution, there was net
      consumption of 11 grams of metal and a net production of 32 liters
      of gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] As indicated above, based on the amount of acid added to
      the reaction, the maximum amount of hydrogen gas expected solely
      from the reaction of acid with metal would be 8.06 liters.
      Depending on the makeup of the recovered metal, which had a mass
      of 9 grams, two extremes are possible: a) assuming the metal
      recovered was 100% Al, a maximum of 13.75 liters of hydrogen gas
      would be expected from the consumption of 11 grams of aluminum;
      and b) alternatively, assuming the metal recovered was 100% Fe, a
      maximum of 21.25 liters of hydrogen gas would be expected from the
      consumption of 17 grams of aluminum (20 grams supplied minus three
      grams used in the production of iron). For purposes of calculating
      maximum hydrogen gas generation, we assume the regeneration
      process does not occur and the Fe metal would have been generated
      from a conventional single displacement reaction with Al.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] The actual percentage of Al and Fe would be somewhere
      between the two extremes and, therefore, the maximum amount of
      hydrogen gas generated solely from the consumption of metal
      (without regeneration) would be between 13.75 liters and 21.25
      liters. The observed generation of 32 liters of gas compared to
      the maximum amount one would expect from the sole consumption of
      metal indicates that the regeneration process is taking place. It
      is believed that the increase in the rate of H2 production
      resulted from a high concentration of metal ions in the solution
      prior to the introduction of the elemental iron. Thus, solutions
      resulting from this family of reactions should not be discarded
      but rather should be used as the starting point for subsequent
      reactions. Consequently, this process for the generation of H2
      will not produce significant chemical wastes that require
      disposal. Experiment #6 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0174] An experiment was conducted using 20 mL FeCl3, 10 mL
      colloidal magnesium, and 20 mL colloidal lead at a temperature of
      about 90[deg.] C. A gas was produced that is believed to be a
      mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, based upon observing the ignition
      of the gas. The pH of the mixture decreased during the reaction
      from a value of about 4.5 to a value of about 3.5. These
      observations show that it is not necessary to introduce either
      metallic iron or acid into the solution to produce hydrogen. Since
      the electrochemical oxidation/reduction reactions (equations 30-32
      resulting in the net equation 33) result in the production of
      metallic iron and acid, these two constituents can be produced in
      this manner. Presumably, this would eventually attain the same
      steady state that is reached when metallic iron and acid are
      supplied initially. Experiment #7 Summary<br>
      <br>
      [0175] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with 20 grams
      of iron pellets and 20 grams of aluminum pellets. There were then
      added 50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead,
      each at a concentration believed to be about 20 ppm, producing a
      total volume of about 215 mL. A theoretical maximum of 8.06 liters
      of hydrogen gas could be produced if solely from the consumption
      of the acids as indicated in Table 4.<br>

      <br>
      [0178] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.23 liters of H2

      <br>
      [0181] Therefore, a theoretical maximum yield of 0.31 liters of H2
      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] While some gas was lost due to leakage and diffusion, at
      least 25 liters of gas was collected over a period of three hours,
      and the reaction was still proceeding in a continuous fashion at a
      rate of 8.4 liters of gas produced per hour. At this point the
      reaction was stopped and the remaining metal, a mixture of
      aluminum and iron was collected and dried, and was found to have a
      mass of 35.5 grams. Thus, 4.5 grams of metal was consumed. Since
      the remaining metal was not analyzed, it is not known in what
      ratio aluminum and iron reacted; however the simple oxidation of a
      metal by an acid would produce a maximum of 5.6 liters of
      hydrogen, well below that observed. Based upon previous
      observations and theoretical projections, the first 8.06 liters of
      gas produced is likely to be made up of essentially pure hydrogen,
      and beyond the theoretical threshold of 8.06 liters, 66.7% by
      volume of the gas produced would be hydrogen and the other 33.3%
      by volume would be oxygen. It is believed this experiment provides
      ample evidence for the regeneration process.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] It is believed that the simultaneous use of two metals does
      not improve the initial rate of gas formation, but rather produces
      a reaction whose rate is sustained over a much greater period of
      time. In order to demonstrate this point, two additional
      experiments were performed. Experiment #8 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0184] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with 20 grams
      of aluminum pellets. There were then added 50 mL of colloidal
      magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead each at a concentration
      believed to be about 20 ppm, producing a total volume of about 215
      mL. A theoretical maximum of 8.06 liters of hydrogen gas could be
      produced if solely from the consumption of the acids as indicated

      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0191] The initial reaction rate was similar to that found in
      experiment #1, where 9 liters of gas was produced in slightly less
      than one hour. At this point, however, the reaction rate was found
      to decrease by a factor of approximately one-half. The addition of
      20 grams of iron caused an immediate increase in reaction rate to
      the value that was initially observed at the onset of the
      experiment. Experiment #9 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0192] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with 40 grams
      of aluminum pellets. There were then added 50 mL of colloidal

      the value that was observed at the onset of the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] Clearly an interaction is taking place between the two
      metals that produces a reaction that sustains a high rate of gas
      production a significant period of time. Experiment #10 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0201] An initial solution comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration
      H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35% concentration HCl was reacted with 20 grams
      of iron pellets and 20 grams of aluminum pellets. There were then
      added 25 mL of colloidal magnesium and 40 mL of colloidal lead,

      per gram of HCl is expected without the regeneration reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0208] The rate of the reaction initially is very fast with
      instantaneous hydrogen generation at a rate of about 20 liters per
      hour. After about an hour the rate slows to a steady-state value
      of about 6.0 liters per hour. Additional heat may be added to
      accelerate the process of regenerating the metals and the acids.<br>
      <br>
      [0209] While some gas was lost due to leakage and diffusion, at
      least 32 liters of gas was collected over a period of five hours,
      and the reaction was still proceeding in a continuous fashion at a
      rate of 6.0 liters per hour. At this point, the reaction was
      stopped and the remaining metal, a mixture of aluminum and iron
      was collected and dried, and was found to have a mass of about 40
      grams. Thus, only a negligible amount of metal was consumed. Since
      the remaining metal was not analyzed, it is not known in what
      ratio aluminum and iron were present; however, it can be assumed
      that approximately 20 grams of each metal was present in the
      remaining metallic sample. Based upon previous observations and
      theoretical projections, the first 8.06 liters of gas produced is
      likely to be made up of essentially pure hydrogen, and beyond the
      theoretical threshold of 8.06 liters, 66.7% by volume of the gas
      produced would be hydrogen and the other 33.3% by volume would be
      oxygen. It is believed this experiment provides further evidence
      for a more efficient regeneration process when smaller volumes are
      used in the reaction vessel. Experiment #11 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0210] An initial solution comprising 10 g of sodium hydroxide, 20
      mL of colloidal silver, and 10 mL of colloidal magnesium, where
      each of the colloidal solutions had a concentration believed to be
      about 20 ppm was diluted with 70 mL of distilled water. There was
      then added to the solution 20 g of metallic zinc and 20 g of
      metallic nickel. Initially the two metals were not in contact and
      virtually no reaction and no gas evolution were observed. When the
      zinc and nickel metals were moved into contact with each other, a
      vigorous evolution of gas was observed emanating from the surface
      of the nickel metal. The gaseous product produced at the surface
      of the metallic nickel was captured in soap bubbles and was
      ignited. The explosion upon ignition strongly indicated the
      presence of elemental hydrogen in the product gas. Experiment #12
      Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0211] An initial solution comprising 10 g of sodium hydroxide, 20
      mL of colloidal silver, and 10 mL of colloidal magnesium, where
      each colloidal solution had a concentration believed to be about
      20 ppm, was diluted with 70 mL of distilled water. There was then
      added to the solution a small piece of metallic zinc and a small
      piece of metallic nickel each connected to a piece of copper wire
      approximately three inches long. A vigorous evolution of gas was
      observed emanating from the surface of the nickel metal. The
      gaseous product produced at the surface of the metallic nickel was
      captured in soap bubbles and was ignited. The explosion upon
      ignition strongly indicated the presence of elemental hydrogen in
      the product gas. Experiment #13 Summary:<br>

      [0212] An initial solution comprising 10 g of sodium hydroxide, 20
      mL of colloidal silver, and 10 mL of colloidal magnesium, where
      each colloidal solution had a concentration believed to be about
      20 ppm, was diluted with 70 mL of distilled water. There was then
      added to the solution a small piece of metallic zinc, and a small
      piece of a tungsten carbide, each connected to a piece of copper
      wire that extended outside of the solution. When the ends of the
      copper wire were not in direct contact, virtually no reaction and
      no gas evolution were observed. When the two ends of the copper
      wire were placed into contact a vigorous evolution of gas was
      observed emanating from the surface of the tungsten carbide
      electrode. The gas evolution could be stopped and restarted
      repeatedly simply by removing and then replacing the connection at
      the two ends of the copper wires. When the two copper wires were
      not in contact, a potential of about 0.3 volts was measured across
      the two ends of the copper wires. The gaseous product produced at
      the surface of the tungsten carbide sample was captured in soap
      bubbles and was ignited. The explosion upon ignition strongly
      indicated the presence of elemental hydrogen in the product gas.
      After about 100 hours the rate of gas evolution and the measured
      potential were unchanged. Experiment #14 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0213] An initial solution comprising 9.8 g of sodium hydroxide,
      20 mL of colloidal silver, and 10 mL of colloidal magnesium, where
      each colloidal solution had a concentration believed to be about
      20 ppm, was diluted with 70 mL of distilled water. There was then
      added to the solution 42.2 g of tungsten carbide directly fused to
      30.3 g of metallic zinc. A vigorous evolution of gas was observed
      emanating from the surface of the tungsten carbide electrode.
      After a period of two hours, approximately 1.5 L of gaseous
      product had been collected. The reaction was stopped at this point
      and the solution was found to have a pH of 11, and it was further
      determined that 2.8 g of metal had been consumed. Experiment #15

      hours the rate of gas evolution and the measured potential were
      unchanged. An external 12-volt power source was then attached to
      the electrodes in order to cause a flow of electrical current in
      the direction opposite to what had been observed. Upon the
      application of this potential the zinc metal was observed to
      reform on the electrode with the concurrent production of a gas
      thought to be elemental oxygen. Experiment #16 Summary:<br>

      electrode consisting of copper wire. There was no observable
      chemical reaction when the circuit was completed. An external
      12-volt power source was then attached to the electrodes in order
      to cause a flow of electrical current in the direction opposite to
      what had been observed. Upon application of this potential the

      concurrent production of a gas thought to be elemental oxygen.
      After 10 minutes, the external 12-volt power source was
      disconnected and the circuit was once again completed by placing
      the two ends of copper wire into contact. When the two ends of the
      copper wire placed into contact, a vigorous evolution of gas was
      observed emanating from the surface of the tungsten carbide

      that had been initially observed. Experiment #17 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0216] An initial solution was prepared by dissolving 10 g of
      sodium hydroxide in 100 mL of distilled water. There was then

      piece of a tungsten carbide each connected to a piece of copper
      wire that extended outside of the solution. When the ends of the
      copper wire were not in direct contact, virtually no reaction and
      no gas evolution were observed. When the two ends of the copper
      wire were placed into contact, the evolution of gas was observed
      emanating from the surface of the tungsten carbide electrode. The
      rate of gas evolution was noticeably less than the rate observed
      with the inclusion of the colloidal catalysts. The gas evolution
      could be stopped and restarted repeatedly simply by removing and
      then replacing the connection at the two ends of the copper wires.
      When the two copper wires were not in contact, a potential of

      20 ppm, was diluted with 70 mL of distilled water. There was then
      added to the solution a small piece of metallic zinc, and a copper
      plate connected to four pieces of a tungsten carbide. The metallic
      zinc and the copper plate were each connected to a piece of copper
      wire that extended outside of the solution. When the ends of the
      copper wire were not in direct contact, virtually no reaction and
      no gas evolution were observed. When the two ends of the copper
      wire were placed into contact, a vigorous evolution of gas was
      observed emanating from the surface of each of the pieces of the
      tungsten carbide. The total rate of gas evolution was
      approximately four times that obtained when a single piece of
      tungsten carbide was employed, indicating the relationship between
      the rate of hydrogen production and the surface area of the
      cathode. The gas evolution could be stopped and restarted
      repeatedly simply by removing and then replacing the connection at
      the two ends of the copper wires. When the two copper wires were

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      [<br>
      0002] The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus
      for the production of metals from metal ore.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Most metals are found in nature in their oxidized form. In
      order to extract these metals from their ores, it is necessary to
      chemically reduce these metals to their elemental form. The
      reduction of these metals usually requires stringent reaction
      conditions and therefore results in a significant cost. For
      example, iron, as found in nature, is generally in the oxidized
      form iron(III) oxide, Fe2O3, or iron(II) oxide, FeO, or a
      combination of the two: magnetite, Fe3O4. The reduction of
      Fe&lt;+2 &gt; or Fe&lt;+3 &gt; to yield Fe is normally carried out
      at very high temperatures, generally in excess of 1000[deg.] C.
      This reduction is commonly accomplished by reaction of the
      iron(III) oxide with carbon as shown in equation 1.<br>
      <br>
      2Fe2O3+3C-&gt;4Fe+3CO2 (1)<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The very high temperature required for the reaction
      employed in equation 1 causes the generation of metallic iron from
      its oxide to be difficult to achieve, and very expensive.
      Likewise, aluminum, as found in nature, is generally in the
      oxidized form aluminum oxide, Al2O3. The reduction of Al&lt;+3
      &gt; to yield Al is normally carried out using a procedure called
      the Hall-Heroult process. In the Hall-Heroult process, aluminum
      oxide, Al2O3, is dissolved in a carbon-lined bath of molten
      cryolite, Na3AlF6. Aluminum fluoride, AlF3, is also present to
      reduce the melting point of the cryolite. The reactants are then
      electrolyzed, and liquid aluminum is produced at the cathode. The
      carbon anode is oxidized and forms gaseous carbon dioxide. The net
      chemical reaction that describes this process is shown in equation
      2. The very high temperature (about 600[deg.] C.) required for the
      reaction employed in equation 2 causes the generation of metallic
      aluminum from its oxide to be difficult to achieve, and the need
      for the electrical energy necessary for electrolysis causes the
      production of aluminum to be a very expensive process.<br>
      <br>
      2Al2O3+3C-&gt;4Al+3CO2 (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Accordingly, there exists a need for a method and apparatus
      for the production of metals from metal ore that requires less
      extreme conditions and, accordingly, can be done at a lower cost.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">

      [0021] The drawing FIGURE is a diagram of equipment which may be
      used in connection with one embodiment of the present invention.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0022] The drawing FIGURE shows equipment which may be used in one
      embodiment of the present invention. A reaction vessel 102
      contains a reaction medium 104. The reaction medium 104 preferably
      comprises water and an acid, and preferably has a pH less than 7,
      although other reaction media may be used, including other
      solvents or non-liquid media such as gelatinous or gaseous media.
      A cathode 106 and an anode 108 are preferably in electrical
      contact with reaction medium 104. Cathode 106 is preferably in the
      form of a disk made of carbon, but metallic materials such as lead
      and iron may also be used. Cathode 106 is preferably positioned on
      or near a bottom 107 of vessel 102. However, cathode 106 may
      generally be any shape and may be positioned anywhere that is in
      contact with reaction medium 104 and not in direct contact with
      anode 108. Cathode 106 may be made of any material which is inert
      or of lower reactivity than the metal being reduced and is
      electrically conductive. Anode 108 is preferably in the form of a
      rod made of carbon, but metallic materials such as lead and iron
      may also be used. Anode 108 is preferably positioned to extend
      into reaction medium 104 through a top surface of reaction medium
      104. However, anode 108 may generally be any shape and may be
      positioned anywhere in contact with reaction medium 104 and not in
      direct contact with cathode 106. Anode 108 may be made of any
      material which is inert or of lower reactivity than the metal
      being reduced and is electrically conductive.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Vessel 102 also preferably contains an elemental non-metal
      109 in contact with reaction medium 104. The elemental non-metal
      is preferable in solid form, for the sake of convenience, though a
      gaseous or liquid form should also work. Most preferably,
      elemental non-metal 109 is carbon, since carbon is relatively
      abundant and the byproducts produced in the resulting reactions
      (described below) are not toxic or environmentally harmful.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] An electrical potential source 110 is electrically
      connected to cathode 106 and anode 108 and provides an electrical
      potential between cathode 106 and anode 108. Electrical potential
      source 110 preferably provides a direct current potential of the
      approximate order of or greater than 12 volts. The invention
      described herein has been performed using as little as 1 volt and
      as great as 12 volts. It has been found that higher voltages
      increase the overall reaction rate. As an alternative to providing
      electrical energy, other forms of energy, such as thermal energy,
      or light or other electromagnetic radiation energy, may be
      provided to reaction medium 104. Additionally, ambient thermal
      energy may be used, but the necessary reactions (discussed below)
      will occur at a slower rate. However, unlike prior art methods of
      metal production, the necessary reactions do not require that the
      reaction medium 104 temperature be extremely high. The necessary
      reactions have been observed to occur at a reasonable rate at
      temperatures of about 75[deg.] C. when the energy source 110
      provides electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Reaction medium 104 contains ions (not shown) of a metal
      which is to be reduced to its elemental state. Preferably, the ion
      source is a metal-containing compound 112 in the solid state which
      is in contact with reaction medium 104. Most preferably, the
      metal-containing compound 112 is a metal ore found in nature, such
      as iron(III) oxide or aluminum oxide. Alternatively, the
      metal-containing compound 112 may be a derivative of a metal ore,
      such as aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)3. Additionally, the metal ions
      may be from a salt, either in a solid or dissolved form, a metal
      oxide or other ion source.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Reaction medium 104 also preferably contains a dissolved
      salt (not shown). The salt preferably comprises a metal cation
      that is higher on the electromotive series of metals than the
      metal of the metal-containing compound which is being reduced. The
      salts that have been found to be most effective are aluminum
      sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, magnesium sulfate, MgSO4, and potassium
      aluminum sulfate, KAl(SO4)2. However, in theory, any salt could
      have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Reaction medium 104 also contains a suspended colloidal
      catalyst (not shown). Most metals can be produced in a colloidal
      state in a liquid. A colloid is a material composed of very small
      particles of one substance that are dispersed (suspended), but not
      dissolved, in a liquid. Thus, colloidal particles do not settle
      out of a liquid even though they exist in the solid state. A
      colloid of any particular metal is then a very small particle of
      that metal suspended in a liquid. These suspended particles of
      metal may exist in the solid (metallic) form or in the ionic form,
      or as a mixture of the two. The very small size of the particles
      of these metals results in a very large effective surface area for
      the metal. This very large effective surface area for the metal
      can cause the surface reactions of the metal to increase
      dramatically when it comes into contact with other atoms or
      molecules. The colloidal metals used in the experiments described
      below were obtained using an apparatus for producing colloidal
      silver in water sold by CS Prosystems of San Antonio, Tex. The
      website of CS Prosystems is www.csprosystems.com. Based on
      materials provided by the manufacturer, the particles of a metal
      in the colloidal dispersions used in the experiments described
      below are believed to range in size between 0.001 and 0.01
      microns. In such a solution of colloidal metals, the
      concentrations of the metals are believed to be between about 5 to
      20 parts per million with the remainder being water.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Alternative to using a catalyst in colloidal form, it may
      be possible to use a catalyst in another form that offers a high
      surface-area to volume ratio, such as a porous solid or
      colloid-polymer nanocomposite. In general, any of the catalysts
      may be in any form with an effective surface area preferably of at
      least 298,000,000 m&lt;2 &gt; per cubic meter of catalyst metal,
      although smaller surface area ratios may also work.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] When a colloidal metal ion is treated with an oxidized
      metal, a voltaic oxidation-reduction will take place. The oxidized
      metal can be any compound where the metal is in a cationic form.
      Preferably, the oxidized metal will be the metal ore as found in
      nature. For many metals, this is the metal oxide (MexOy).
      Equations 3 and 4 are believed to represent the oxidation and
      reduction reactions that occur with respect to the colloidal
      metal. Equations 5 and 6 are believed to represent the oxidation
      and reduction reactions that occur with the inclusion of elemental
      non-metal 109, represented by the letter "Z". The process proceeds
      most successfully when elemental non-metal 109, Z, is either
      carbon or sulfur, but any non-metal may theoretically be employed.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The colloidal metal, M, can in principle be any metal, but
      it has been found that equations 3 and 4, or equations 5 and 6,
      work most efficiently when the colloidal metal has a higher (more
      positive) reduction potential than Me. Thus, equations 3 and 4 and
      equations 5 and 6 proceed most efficiently when the colloidal
      metal is as low as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      Consequently, any colloidal metal will be successful, but the
      reactions illustrated in equations 3 and 4 and equations 5 and 6
      proceed most quickly with colloidal silver ion, due to the high
      reduction potential of silver. When silver, for example, is
      employed as the colloidal metal ion in equations 3 and 4, or in
      equations 5 and 6, the pair of reactions is found to take place
      quite readily. The voltaic reaction produces a positive voltage as
      the oxidation and reduction reactions indicated take place. This
      positive voltage can be used to supply the energy required for
      other chemical processes. In fact, the voltage produced can even
      be used to supply an over potential for reactions employing
      equations 3 and 4, or equations 5 and 6, taking place in another
      reaction vessel. Thus, this electrochemical process can
      theoretically be made to take place more quickly without the
      supply of an external source of energy, if at least two of these
      reactions are performed in series. The addition of an external
      source of energy, such as thermal energy, electrical energy or
      light, or other electromagnetic radiation, will further enhance
      the reaction rate. <br>

      <br>
      [0031] It is believed that the oxidation-reduction reaction
      represented by reactions 5 and 6 occur faster and more easily than
      the oxidation-reduction reaction represented by equations 3 and 4
      due to the thermodynamic stability of the non-metallic oxide, ZO2.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The net result of the oxidation and reductions shown in
      equations 5 and 6 is equation 7, which results in the production
      of a colloidal metal in its elemental state plus a non-metallic
      oxide plus acid. [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In the absence of the non-metal, Z, the net result of the
      oxidation and reductions shown in equations 3 and 4 is equation
      7A, which is believed to result in the production of a colloidal
      metal in its elemental state, plus elemental oxygen, plus acid.
      [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The colloidal elemental metal that has been produced is
      believed to undergo reaction with the metal ion of the substance
      that contains the oxidized form of the metal, which will be
      represented as Me&lt;+&gt; . Me&lt;+&gt; can represent the
      oxidized form of any metal, which can be present in any oxidation
      state. Equation 8 illustrates this reaction where the oxidized
      form of the metal, Me, is an oxide, but in reality can be any
      compound that contains the metal, Me, in its oxidized form.<br>
      <br>
      4M+2MeO+2H2O-&gt;4M&lt;+&gt; +2Me+4OH&lt;-&gt; (8)<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The reaction illustrated by equation 8 will take place most
      efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is more reactive than the
      metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 8 will proceed most
      efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is above the metal, Me,
      on the electromotive series of metals. The hydroxide ion produced
      in equation 8 will react with the hydrogen ion produced in
      equation 7, or in equation 7A, to produce water as indicated in
      equation 9.<br>
      <br>
      4H&lt;+&gt; +4OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;4H2O (9)<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Since the acid produced in the electrochemical reaction
      depicted in equations 5 and 6 is neutralized by the base produced
      in the thermal reaction represented by equation 8, the entire
      reaction system remains at a pH close to 7 throughout. The
      combining of equations 5, 6, 8, and 9 results in the net process
      illustrated by equation 10, which represents the production of the
      elemental metal, Me, produced by a reduction reaction, and the
      formation of an oxide of a non-metal, ZO2, produced by an
      oxidation reaction. [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In the absence of the non-metal, Z, the combining of
      equations 3, 4, 8, and 9 results in the net process illustrated by
      equation 10A, which represents the production of the elemental
      metal, Me, produced by a reduction reaction, and the formation of
      elemental oxygen, produced by an oxidation reaction. [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0038] The reactions shown in equations 3 and 4, or in equations 5
      and 6, seem to occur best when the colloidal metal, M, is as low
      as possible on the electromotive series of metals (less reactive);
      however, the reaction depicted by equation 8 takes place most
      efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is as high as possible on
      the electromotive series of metals. The net reaction, which is
      illustrated by equation 10, or by equation 10A, is merely the sum
      of equations 3, 4, 8, and 9 or of equations 5, 6, 8, and 9, and
      could, in fact, be maximally facilitated by either colloidal
      metals of high activity or by colloidal metals of low activity.
      The relative importance of the reaction illustrated by equations 3
      and 4, or by equations 5 and 6, compared to the reaction shown in
      equation 8 determines the characteristics of the colloidal metal
      that would best assist the net reaction in equation 10 or in
      equation 10A. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 10 or in equation 10A proceeds at a maximal rate when the
      colloidal metal is of maximum activity; that is, when the
      colloidal metal is as high as possible on the electromotive series
      of metals (more reactive). It has been found that the more
      reactive colloidal metals, such as, but not limited to, colloidal
      aluminum ion or colloidal magnesium ion, produce the most facile
      reduction processes for the reduction of cationic metals. It is
      also believed, although not yet shown analytically, that the
      overall reaction may proceed even more favorably when two
      colloidal metals are used, especially where one is higher (more
      reactive) and one lower (less reactive) on the electromotive
      series than the metal being reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In addition, it has also been found that the inclusion of a
      small amount (such as 10 wt %) of a salt leads to a rate increase
      in the reaction represented by equation 10, or equation 10A. The
      salt has its maximal effect when it includes a cation of a metal
      of higher activity than Me; that is, one that is higher (more
      reactive) than Me on the electromotive series of metals. The salts
      that have been found to be most effective are aluminum sulfate,
      Al2(SO4)3, magnesium sulfate MgSO4, and potassium aluminum
      sulfate, KAl(SO4)2; however, in theory, any salt could potentially
      have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Thus, under ambient thermal conditions, the oxide of any
      metal can be converted to its metallic elemental state, with the
      concurrent formation of elemental oxygen or the oxide of a
      non-metal. It is believed that the thermal stability of the oxide
      of the non-metal, ZO2, lowers the endothermicity of the process,
      and allows the reduction of the oxidized metal to proceed at lower
      temperatures, when the non-metal Z is used. The supplying of
      additional energy leads to an acceleration of the reaction rate
      for the process. When additional energy is supplied, it can be
      supplied in the manner of thermal energy, electrical energy,
      radiant energy, or the like. When the additional energy supplied
      is in the form of thermal energy, one is limited by the boiling
      point of the solvent. In aqueous systems, this would provide a
      maximum temperature of 100[deg.] C. Under pressures higher than
      one atmosphere, however, temperatures higher than 100[deg.] C.
      could be obtained, and would provide an even more enhanced
      reaction rate. It has been found that the increase in reaction
      rate is most significant when additional energy is supplied in the
      form of electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] An alternative to the above involves the introduction of a
      reducing agent into reaction medium 104. Hydrogen peroxide has
      been found to be an effective reducing agent for this process.
      With the addition of hydrogen peroxide to reaction medium 104,
      equations 5 and 6 are replaced by equations 11 and 12, or
      equations 3 and 4 are replaced by equations 11A and 12A. <br>

      [0043] Due to the fact that hydrogen peroxide has a larger (less
      negative) oxidation potential than water, as indicated in the
      comparison of equations 4A and 4B, the oxidation-reduction
      reaction resulting from equations 11 and 12 takes place at an
      enhanced rate compared to the oxidation-reduction reaction
      indicated by equations 5 and 6. Likewise, the oxidation-reduction
      reaction resulting from equations 11A and 12A takes place at an
      enhanced rate compared to the oxidation-reduction reaction
      indicated by equations 3 and 4.<br>

      <br>
      [0044] The net result of the oxidation and reductions shown in
      equations 11 and 12 will be equation 13, which results in the
      production of a colloidal metal in its elemental state plus a
      non-metallic oxide plus acid [mathematical formula - see original
      document]<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Likewise, the net result of the oxidation and reductions
      shown in equations 11A and 12A will be equation 13A, which results
      in the production of a colloidal metal in its elemental state,
      plus elemental oxygen, plus acid. [mathematical formula - see
      original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The colloidal elemental metal that has been produced is
      believed to undergo reaction with the metal ion of the substance
      that contains the metal to be reduced, which will be represented
      as Me&lt;+&gt; . Me&lt;+&gt; can represent the oxidized form of
      any metal, which can be present in any oxidation state. Equation
      14 illustrates this reaction where the oxidized form of the metal,
      Me, is an oxide, but in reality can be any compound that contains
      the metal, Me, in its oxidized form.<br>

      2M+MeO+H2O-&gt;2M&lt;+&gt; +Me+2OH&lt;-&gt; (14)<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The reaction illustrated by equation 14 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is more reactive
      than the metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 14 will
      proceed most efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is above the
      metal, Me, on the electromotive series of metals. The hydroxide
      ion produced in equation 14 will react with the hydrogen ion
      produced in equation 13, or in equation 13A, to produce water as
      indicated in equation 15.<br>
      <br>
      2H&lt;+&gt; +2OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O (15)<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Since the acid produced in the electrochemical reaction
      depicted in equations 11 and 12, or in equations 11A and 12A, is
      neutralized by the base produced in the thermal reaction
      represented by equation 14, the entire reaction system remains at
      a pH close to 7 throughout. The combining of equations 11, 12, 14,
      and 15 results in the net process illustrated by equation 16,
      which represents the production of the elemental metal, Me,
      produced by a reduction reaction, and the formation of an oxide of
      a non-metal, ZO2, produced by an oxidation reaction. [mathematical
      formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0049] If the non-metal, Z, is not used, the combining of
      equations 11A, 12A, 14, and 15 results in the net process
      illustrated by equation 16A, which represents the production of
      the elemental metal, Me, produced by a reduction reaction, and the
      formation of elemental oxygen, produced by an oxidation reaction.

      [0050] The reactions shown in equations 11 and 12, or in equations
      11A and 12A, seem to occur best when the colloidal metal, M, is as
      low as possible on the electromotive series of metals. However,
      the reaction depicted by equation 14 takes place most efficiently
      when the colloidal metal, M, is as high as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals. The net reaction illustrated by
      equation 16, which is merely the sum of equations 11, 12, 14, and
      15, or by equation 16A, which is merely the sum of equations 11A,
      12A, 14, and 15, could, in fact, be maximally facilitated by
      either colloidal metals of higher activity or by colloidal metals
      of lower activity than the metal being reduced. The relative
      importance of the reaction illustrated by equations 11 and 12, or
      by equations 11A and 12A, compared to the reaction shown in
      equation 14, determines the characteristics of the colloidal metal
      that would best assist the net reaction in equation 16, or in
      equation 16A. It has been found that the net reaction indicated in
      equation 16, or in equation 16A, proceeds at a maximal rate when
      the colloidal metal is of maximum activity; that is, when the
      colloidal metal is as high as possible on the electromotive series
      of metals. It has been found that the more reactive colloidal
      metals, such as, but not limited to, colloidal aluminum ion or
      colloidal magnesium ion, produce the most facile reduction
      processes for the reduction of cationic metals. It is also
      believed, although not yet shown analytically, that the overall
      reaction may proceed even more favorably when two colloidal metals
      are used, especially where one is higher and one lower on the
      electromotive series than the metal being reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In addition, it has also been found that the inclusion of a
      small amount of a salt leads to a rate increase in the reaction
      represented by equation 16, or by equation 16A. The salt has been
      found to have a maximal effect when it includes a cation of a
      metal of higher activity than the metal being reduced; that is,
      one that is higher (more reactive) on the electromotive series of
      metals. The salts that have been found most effective are aluminum
      sulfate, Al2(SO4)3, magnesium sulfate MgSO4, and potassium
      aluminum sulfate, KAl(SO4)2; however, in theory, any salt could
      potentially have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Thus, under ambient thermal conditions, the oxide of any
      metal can be treated with hydrogen peroxide and a non-metal, and
      can be converted to its metallic elemental state, with the
      concurrent formation of the oxide of a non-metal and water. Since
      the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (equation 12 or equation 12A)
      is more favorable than the oxidation of water (equation 6 or
      equation 4), the rate of metal reduction should be significantly
      increased when hydrogen peroxide is used in the place of water.
      This must be balanced by the fact that hydrogen peroxide is a more
      costly reagent to supply. In those cases where the rate of the
      metal reduction is the most critical factor, the use of hydrogen
      peroxide will offer a significant advantage. It is still believed
      that the thermal stability of the oxide of the non-metal, ZO2,
      lowers the endothermicity of the process, and allows the reduction
      of the oxidized metal to proceed at reasonable temperatures. The
      supplying of additional energy leads to an acceleration of the
      reaction rate for the process. When additional energy is supplied,
      it can be supplied in the manner of thermal energy, electrical
      energy, radiant energy or the like. When the additional energy
      supplied is in the form of thermal energy, one is limited by the
      boiling point of the solvent. In aqueous systems, this would
      provide a maximum temperature of 100[deg.] C. Under pressures
      higher than one atmosphere, however, temperatures higher than
      100[deg.] C. could be obtained, and would provide an even more
      enhanced reaction rate. It has been found that the increase in
      reaction rate is most significant when additional energy is
      supplied in the form of electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] A further alternative to the above involves the
      introduction of a different reducing agent into reaction medium
      104. Formic acid has been found to be an effective reducing agent
      for this process. With the addition of formic acid to reaction
      medium 104, equations 3 and 4 are replaced by equations 17 and 18.

      CH2O2-&gt;2H&lt;+&gt; +CO2+2e&lt;-&gt; (18)<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Due to the fact that formic acid has a larger (in fact,
      positive) oxidation potential than water, or than hydrogen
      peroxide, as indicated in the comparison of equations 4A, 4B and
      4C, the oxidation-reduction reaction resulting from equations 17
      and 18 takes place at an enhanced rate compared to the
      oxidation-reduction reaction indicated by equations 3 and 4, or by
      equations 11A and 12A.<br>

      Volts (4C)<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The net result of the oxidation and reductions shown in
      equations 17 and 18 will be equation 19, which results in the
      production of a colloidal metal in its elemental state plus carbon
      dioxide plus acid [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The colloidal elemental metal that has been produced is
      believed to undergo reaction with the metal ion of the substance
      that contains the metal to be reduced, which will be represented
      as Me&lt;+&gt; . Me&lt;+&gt; can represent the oxidized form of
      any metal, which can be present in any oxidation state. Equation
      14 illustrates this reaction where the oxidized form of the metal,
      Me, is an oxide, but in reality can be any compound that contains
      the metal, Me, in its oxidized form.<br>
      <br>
      2M+MeO+H2O-&gt;2M&lt;+&gt; +Me+2OH&lt;-&gt; (14)<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The reaction illustrated by equation 14 will take place
      most efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is more reactive
      than the metal, Me. That is, the reaction in equation 14 will
      proceed most efficiently when the colloidal metal, M, is above the
      metal, Me, on the electromotive series of metals. The hydroxide
      ion produced in equation 14 will react with the hydrogen ion
      produced in equation to produce water as indicated in equation 15.<br>
      <br>
      2H&lt;+&gt; +2OH&lt;-&gt; -&gt;2H2O (15)<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Since the acid produced in the electrochemical reaction
      depicted in equations 17 and 18 is neutralized by the base
      produced in the thermal reaction represented by equation 14, the
      entire reaction system remains at a pH close to 7 throughout. The
      combining of equations 17, 18, 14, and 15 results in the net
      process illustrated by equation 20, which represents the
      production of the elemental metal, Me, produced by a reduction
      reaction, and the formation of a carbon dioxide, produced by an
      oxidation reaction. [mathematical formula - see original document]<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The reactions shown in equations 17 and 18 seem to occur
      best when the colloidal metal, M, is as low as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals. However, the reaction depicted by
      equation 14 takes place most efficiently when the colloidal metal,
      M, is as high as possible on the electromotive series of metals.
      The net reaction illustrated by equation 20, which is merely the
      sum of equations 17, 18, 14, and 15, could, in fact, be maximally
      facilitated by either colloidal metals of higher activity or by
      colloidal metals of lower activity than the metal being reduced.
      The relative importance of the reaction illustrated by equations
      17 and 18, compared to the reaction shown in equation 14,
      determines the characteristics of the colloidal metal that would
      best assist the net reaction in equation 20. It has been found
      that the net reaction indicated in equation 20 proceeds at a
      maximal rate when the colloidal metal is of maximum activity; that
      is, when the colloidal metal is as high as possible on the
      electromotive series of metals. It has been found that the more
      reactive colloidal metals, such as, but not limited to, colloidal
      aluminum ion or colloidal magnesium ion, produce the most facile
      reduction processes for the reduction of cationic metals. It is
      also believed, although not yet shown analytically, that the
      overall reaction may proceed even more favorably when two
      colloidal metals are used, especially where one is higher and one
      lower on the electromotive series than the metal being reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In addition, it has also been found that the inclusion of a
      small amount of a salt leads to a rate increase in the reaction
      represented by equation 20. The salt has been found to have a
      maximal effect when it includes a cation of a metal of higher
      activity than the metal being reduced; that is, one that is higher
      (more reactive) on the electromotive series of metals. The salts
      that have been found most effective are aluminum sulfate,
      Al2(SO4)3, magnesium sulfate, MgSO4, and potassium aluminum
      sulfate, KAl(SO4)2; however, in theory, any salt could potentially
      have a similar effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Thus, under ambient thermal conditions, the oxide of any
      metal can be treated with formic acid, and can be converted to its
      metallic elemental state, with the concurrent formation of carbon
      dioxide and water. Since the oxidation of formic acid (equation
      18) is more favorable than the oxidation of water (equation 4), or
      the oxidation of hydrogen peroxide (equation 12A), the rate of
      metal reduction should be significantly increased when formic acid
      is used in the place of water, or in the place of hydrogen
      peroxide. This must be balanced by the fact that formic acid,
      while less costly than hydrogen peroxide, is a more costly reagent
      to supply than is water. In those cases where the rate of the
      metal reduction is the most critical factor, the use of formic
      acid will offer a significant advantage. It is believed that the
      thermal stability of the oxide of the carbon dioxide that is
      formed lowers the endothermicity of the process, and allows the
      reduction of the oxidized metal to proceed at reasonable
      temperatures. The supplying of additional energy leads to an
      acceleration of the reaction rate for the process. When additional
      energy is supplied, it can be supplied in the manner of thermal
      energy, electrical energy, radiant energy, or the like. When the
      additional energy supplied is in the form of thermal energy, one
      is limited by the boiling point of the solvent. In aqueous
      systems, this would provide a maximum temperature of 100[deg.] C.
      Under pressures higher than one atmosphere, however, temperatures
      higher than 100[deg.] C. could be obtained, and would provide an
      even more enhanced reaction rate. It has been found that the
      increase in reaction rate is most significant when additional
      energy is supplied in the form of electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Finally, while all equations depicted here involve the use
      of just a single metal, Me, it has been shown that all of the
      reactions discussed herein can be carried out using an elemental
      metal in addition to the oxidized form of the metal being reduced,
      Me&lt;+&gt; . It has been shown, in fact, that in some cases the
      use of multiple metals results in a significant increase in the
      rate, as well as a significant increase in the yield of metal
      reduction. In experiment #13, experiment #16 and experiment #17,
      for example, elemental iron in the form of small iron nuggets is
      used to aid the reduction of oxidized aluminum, Al&lt;+3&gt; . In
      each of these cases, a sizable yield of metallic aluminum results
      from a completely thermal, non-electrolytic process requiring, at
      most, the input of only a small amount of thermal energy. It is
      not clear at this point what causes these impressive enhancements
      in the rate of the process as well as in the yield of reduced
      metal that results. It is possible that the elemental metal takes
      part in the reaction mechanism to provide a more complicated
      mechanism having a greater number of steps, but a lower net
      activation barrier. Another possibility is that the elemental
      metal might provide a surface where the reduced metal, Me, could
      reform more efficiently. Whatever the actual explanation is, the
      results from experiments #13, #16 and #17 very clearly demonstrate
      that the effects resulting from the addition of an elemental metal
      different from Me can be quite significant in its effect upon
      metal reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Experiments #13, #16 and #17 each result in a sample of
      iron that has become plated with elemental aluminum. Since this
      technology should be valid for pairs of metals other than iron and
      aluminum, what could result is a general method for the plating of
      surfaces with a metal without the use of electrolysis.
      Experimental Results:<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Several experiments have been conducted using combinations
      of embodiments of the technology described above. The results of
      those experiments are given below: Experiment #1 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0065] An experiment was conducted using 150 mL of iron (III)
      chloride in an aqueous solution (commonly used as an etching
      solution, purchased from Radio Shack) as the starting materials.
      Initially, 10 mL of 93% concentration sulfuric acid (H2SO4) was
      added to the solution, at which point no reaction occurred. About
      50 mL of colloidal magnesium and 80 mL of colloidal lead, each at
      a concentration believed to be about 20 ppm, were then added, at
      which point a chemical reaction began and the bubbling of gases
      was evident at ambient temperature. The production of gas
      accelerated when the solution was heated to a temperature of about
      65[deg.] C. The product gas was captured in soap bubbles and the
      bubbles were then ignited. The observed ignition of the gaseous
      product was typical for a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Since, it is believed, the production of hydrogen gas could
      only be produced with a concurrent oxidation of iron, it is
      evident that the iron (III) had to be initially reduced before it
      could be oxidized, thereby providing strong evidence of the
      reduction reaction. This experiment has subsequently been repeated
      with hydrochloric acid (HCl) instead of sulfuric acid, with
      similar results. Experiment #2 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0067] An experiment was conducted using 100 grams of Fe3O4 (this
      sample was found to contain roughly equal amounts of Fe2O3 and FeO
      plus a small amount of elemental carbon), 50 mL of 5% H2SO4, plus
      40 mL of colloidal magnesium and 40 mL of colloidal lead in water.
      Immediately a stream of gas was evolved that was identified as
      carbon dioxide by gas chromatography. The mixture was then heated
      to a temperature of 90[deg.] C. for a period of about three hours.
      At this point, the stream of gas being evolved was again analyzed
      by gas chromatography. This gaseous mixture was found to contain
      40% hydrogen and 60% carbon dioxide. Since, it is believed, the
      production of hydrogen gas could only be produced with a
      concurrent oxidation of iron, it is evident that the iron had to
      be initially reduced before it could be oxidized, thereby
      providing strong evidence of the reduction reaction. Experiment #3
      Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0068] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Al2(SO4)3.18H2O
      plus 40 mL of colloidal magnesium and 40 mL of colloidal lead in
      water. Upon being heated to about 75[deg.] C., a stream of gas,
      presumed to be elemental oxygen, was produced that did not ignite,
      and also did not extinguish a flame. After 45 minutes of heating,
      the gas was found to ignite very slightly when it was exposed to a
      flame, indicative of the production of a small amount of elemental
      hydrogen. Since, it is believed, the production of hydrogen gas
      could only be produced with a concurrent oxidation of aluminum, it
      is evident that the aluminum had to be initially reduced before it
      could be oxidized, thereby providing strong evidence of the
      reduction reaction. Experiment #4 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0069] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Fe2O3 plus 40 mL
      of colloidal magnesium, 40 mL of colloidal lead and 80 mL of 3%
      aqueous H2O2. Almost immediately a small amount of a gaseous
      product was produced. As the temperature was increased, over a
      period of ten minutes, the yield of gas increased with a maximum
      yield of gas being realized at the maximum temperature of about
      75[deg.] C. The product gas was found to contain a substantial
      amount of hydrogen, based upon the manner in which it ignited when
      a flame was applied. Since, it is believed, the production of
      hydrogen gas could only be produced with a concurrent oxidation of
      iron, it is evident that the iron had to be initially reduced
      before it could be oxidized, thereby providing strong evidence of
      the reduction reaction. Experiment #5 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0070] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Al(OH)3 plus 40 mL
      of colloidal magnesium, 40 mL of colloidal lead and 80 mL of 3%
      aqueous H2O2. Almost immediately a small amount of a gaseous
      product was produced. As the temperature was increased, over a
      period of ten minutes, the yield of gas increased with a maximum
      yield of gas being realized at the maximum temperature of about
      75[deg.] C. The product gas was found to contain a substantial
      amount of hydrogen, based upon the manner in which it ignited when
      a flame was applied. Since, it is believed, the production of
      hydrogen gas could only be produced with a concurrent oxidation of
      aluminum, it is evident that the aluminum had to be initially
      reduced before it could be oxidized, thereby providing strong
      evidence of the reduction reaction. Experiment #6 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0071] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Al2(SO4)3.18H2O
      plus 40 mL of colloidal magnesium, 40 mL of colloidal lead and 80
      mL of 3% aqueous H2O2. Almost immediately a small amount of a
      gaseous product was produced. As the temperature was increased,
      over a period of ten minutes, the yield of gas increased with a
      maximum yield of gas being realized between the temperatures of
      50[deg.] C. and 75[deg.] C. The product gas was found to contain a
      substantial amount of hydrogen, based upon the manner in which it
      ignited when a flame was applied. Since, it is believed, the
      production of hydrogen gas could only be produced with a
      concurrent oxidation of aluminum, it is evident that the aluminum
      had to be initially reduced before it could be oxidized, thereby
      providing strong evidence of the reduction reaction. Experiment #7
      Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0072] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Fe2O3 plus 40 mL
      of colloidal magnesium, 40 mL of colloidal lead and 1 gram of
      elemental carbon in water. The mixture was heated to a temperature
      of about 90[deg.] C. for a period of 72 hours. A metallic-like
      material was produced and collected that reacted with sulfuric
      acid to produce an ignitable gas presumed to be hydrogen gas. The
      metallic material is believed to be elemental iron. Experiment #8
      Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0073] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Al(OH)3 plus 40 mL
      of colloidal magnesium, 40 mL of colloidal lead and 1 gram of
      elemental carbon in water. The mixture was heated to a temperature
      of about 90[deg.] C. for a period of 72 hours. A metallic-like
      material was produced and collected that reacted with sulfuric
      acid to produce an ignitable gas presumed to be hydrogen gas. The
      metallic material is believed to be elemental aluminum. Experiment
      #9 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0074] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Fe2O3, 40 mL of
      colloidal magnesium and 40 mL of colloidal lead in water. A 12
      volt, 10 amp power source was then applied for a period of 5
      minutes to a pair of lead electrodes that had been introduced into
      the solution. A metallic-like material that was produced and found
      on the bottom of the apparatus was collected. The metallic
      material reacted with sulfuric acid to produce an ignitable gas
      presumed to be hydrogen gas. The metallic material has been
      tentatively identified as elemental iron. Experiment #10 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0075] An experiment was conducted using 5 g of Al(OH)3 plus 40 mL
      of colloidal silver and about 0.1 g sodium hydroxide in water. A
      12 volt, 10 amp power source was then applied for a period of
      about thirty minutes to an iron anode and a carbon cathode that
      had been introduced into the solution. After about five minutes,
      the solution was titrated to a pH of about 7 using H2SO4. A
      metallic-like material that was produced and found attached to the
      anode was collected. The metallic material reacted with sulfuric
      acid to produce an ignitable gas presumed to be hydrogen gas. The
      metallic material has been tentatively identified as elemental
      aluminum. An X-Ray Photoelectric Spectrum (XPS) was taken of this
      material that indicates the presence of some elemental aluminum in
      this material. Experiment #11 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0076] An experiment was conducted using an initial solution
      comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35%
      concentration HCl that was reacted with 25 g of Al2(SO4)3.18H2O
      plus 80 mL of colloidal lead. Over a period of thirty minutes, the
      reaction mixture was heated on a hot plate, and the temperature
      increased to a value of 75[deg.] C. Over this period, a small
      amount of an ignitable gas presumed to be hydrogen gas was
      produced. Since, it is believed, the production of hydrogen gas
      could only be produced with a concurrent oxidation of aluminum, it
      is evident that the aluminum had to be initially reduced before it
      could be oxidized, thereby providing strong evidence of the
      reduction reaction. Experiment #12 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0077] An experiment was conducted using an initial solution
      comprising 10 mL of 93% concentration H2SO4 and 30 mL of 35%
      concentration HCl that was reacted with 25 g of Al2(SO4)3.18H2O
      plus 80 mL of colloidal lead, and 80 mL of 3% aqueous H2O2. Over a
      period of thirty minutes, the reaction mixture was heated on a hot
      plate, and the temperature increased to a value of 75[deg.] C.
      Over this period, an impressive amount of an ignitable gas
      presumed to be hydrogen gas was produced. The rate of gas
      formation at this point was measured to be 80 mL per minute, or
      4.8 L per hour. Since, it is believed, the production of hydrogen
      gas could only be produced with a concurrent oxidation of
      aluminum, it is evident that the aluminum had to be initially
      reduced before it could be oxidized, thereby providing strong
      evidence of the reduction reaction. Experiment #13 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0078] An experiment was conducted using an initial solution
      comprising 80 mL of 90% aqueous formic acid, CH2O2, that was
      reacted with 25 g of Al2(SO4)3.18H2O plus 80 mL of colloidal lead.
      Over a period of thirty minutes, the reaction mixture was heated
      on a hot plate, and the temperature increased to a value of
      75[deg.] C. Over this period, a small amount of an ignitable gas
      presumed to be hydrogen gas was produced. There was then added to
      the reaction mixture 80 g of metallic iron. The rate of gas
      formation was found to increase drastically to a measured rate of
      80 mL per minute or 4.8 L per hour. After an additional hour of
      gas formation at a temperature of 75[deg.] C., the reaction
      mixture was allowed to cool to a temperature of 20[deg.] C. The
      iron metal was examined and was found to have metallic aluminum
      plated over the iron. The aluminum was identified by its reaction
      with water in an aqueous solution of NaOH to produce an ignitable
      gas presumed to be hydrogen. Experiment #14 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0079] An experiment was conducted using an initial solution
      comprising 20 mL of 90% aqueous formic acid, CH2O2, that was
      reacted with 20 mL of colloidal lead and one gram of metallic
      aluminum. Over a period of thirty minutes, the reaction mixture
      was heated on a hot plate, and the temperature increased to a
      value of 75[deg.] C. No significant amounts of gases were emitted
      and, in fact, no noticeable chemical reaction of any kind was
      observed to occur under these conditions. Since metallic aluminum
      does not react significantly under these reaction conditions, it
      would be likely that if elemental aluminum were to be produced
      under similar conditions, the aluminum could be isolated.
      Experiment #15 Summary:<br>
      <br>
      [0080] An experiment was conducted using an initial solution
      comprising 40 mL of 90% aqueous formic acid, CH2O2, that was
      reacted with 40 mL of colloidal lead and 40 g of metallic iron.
      Over a period of thirty minutes, the reaction mixture was heated
      on a hot plate, and the temperature increased to a value of
      75[deg.] C. Over this period, a moderate amount of gas was
      produced. There was then added to the reaction mixture log of
      Al2(SO4)3.18H2O, and the rate of gas formation was found to
      increase significantly. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool
      to a temperature of 20[deg.] C. The iron metal was examined and
      found to have metallic aluminum plated over the iron. The aluminum
      was identified by its reaction with water in an aqueous solution
      of NaOH to produce an ignitable gas presumed to be hydrogen. <br>

      [0081] An experiment was conducted using an initial solution
      comprising 80 mL of colloidal lead that was reacted with 30 g of
      Al2(SO4)3.18H2O plus 1 g of metallic iron. The reaction mixture
      was heated using a hot plate to a temperature of 75[deg.] C., and
      this temperature was maintained over a period of 24 hours. The
      reaction mixture was allowed to cool to a temperature of 20[deg.]
      C. The iron metal was examined and was found to have metallic
      aluminum plated over the iron. The aluminum was identified by its
      reaction with water in an aqueous solution of NaOH to produce an
      ignitable gas presumed to be hydrogen. A different iron nugget
      from the same reaction mixture was then studied using Energy
      Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDX), and was found to contain
      approximately 9% elemental aluminum by mass. <br>
