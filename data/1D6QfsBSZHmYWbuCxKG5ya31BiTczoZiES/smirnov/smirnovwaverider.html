      We have the solution to protect you from EMR exposure. The
      WaveRider is a patented invention of Dr. Igor Smirnov who invented
      the Molecular Resonance Effect Technology (MRET) that has helped
      thousands of people to stay healthy. Since its launch in January
      2014, many users have&nbsp; benefited from its use. <br>
      <br>
      WaveRider is a well-tested device that has been validated by
      reputed laboratories across the United Sates and has been proven
      to show its effectiveness against EMR exposure within a lab-tested
      distance of 9 metres spherically. <br>
      <br>
      This small and elegant device can be placed in your home, school,
      workplace or almost anywhere, where protection is needed from the
      harmful effects of today's modern-day wireless environment. Since
      its global launch in January 2014, many users from all over the
      world have benefited by having WaveRider in their homes and
      workplaces. WaveRider's latest ground-breaking resonance
      technology uses its own proprietary frequencies (molecular
      resonance effect technology) to provide healing effects to the
      body and protects it from the effects that EMR field does to
      living cells...<br>
      <br>
      <b>WHAT BENEFITS CAN YOU SEE AFTER USING THE WAVERIDER?</b><br>
      <br>
      WaveRider affects different people differently. Every individual
      has a different set of health and physical characteristics and
      needs. Users of WaveRider mostly report that upon using the
      WaveRider, they are able to sleep better, more deeply, and
      longer.&nbsp; Many report that they wake up feeling more
      refreshed.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      A common feedback is that they feel more mentally alert, less
      fatigued and clearer in their thinking. &nbsp;<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      All these, despite not reducing their workload or time at the
      computer or cell phone calls.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      According to Dr. Igor Smirnov, the beneficial and health
      frequencies in the WaveRider will lead to a gradual general
      improvement in our health over a period of time.&nbsp; There is
      likely to be an increase in energy levels and a boost to the
      immune system over time.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Dr. Smirnov has put into the WaveRider a package of frequencies
      that causes a positive resonance for the brain.&nbsp; This is
      likely to reduce lethargy, increase motivation to solve problems
      and enable the brain to function more effectively. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      The WaveRider also has frequencies targeted at improving the
      immune system.&nbsp; When our immune system improves, we can
      expect that some diseases and illnesses will diminish over
      time.&nbsp; One user of the WaveRider who had prematurely
      menopaused, reported that her menstruation started again after she
      started&nbsp; using the WaveRider. This is an indication that the
      body is returning back to its natural and normal state...<br>
      <br>
      The WaveRider technology's efficacy has been tested and certified
      by independent laboratories in the US, including MET laboratories
      whose certificates are widely accepted by more than 30 countries
      worldwide.&nbsp; Their scope of testing includes most cellular and
      PCS handsets that require Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) testing.
      WaveRider has been shown to absorb up to 40% of SAR on your mobile
      phone.&nbsp; Thus using WaveRider to be part of your daily life
      will mean less stress to your body with the use of mobile
      phones...<br>
      <br>
      The WaveRider technology is the brainchild of Dr Igor Smirnov who
      is also an early pioneer in the exploration of electromagnetic
      radiation and its affect on the human body.&nbsp; A brilliant
      scientist-inventor with a background in nuclear physics and
      nuclear engineering, Dr Smirnov specializes in advanced research
      on the influence of low frequency electromagnetic oscillations on
      human cellular physiology. Dr Smirnov is most well-known for his
      pioneering invention of the Molecular Resonance Effect Technology
      (MRET). His MRET technology has helped heal people suffering from
      a wide range of diseases, from cancer, diabetes, Alzheimer
      disease, to psoriasis and chronic fatigue syndrome. Dr Smirnov is
      a nuclear engineering graduate from St Petersburg Naval Academy,
      where he also obtained a MSc in Mechanical and Bioengineering. He
      received a PhD in Clinical Psychology from St Petersburg State
      University. Dr Smirnov has written for many international
      scientific publications including European Journal of Scientific
      Research, International Journal of Biophysics, Journal of Research
      in Biology, among others.<br>

      <br>
      The present invention provides devices and methods that protect
      against exposure to remote sources of electromagnetic radiation
      (EMR). As such, the devices provide protection against a plurality
      of electrical equipment used in ordinary households and employment
      settings. The device includes a housing, a solenoid operably
      connected to a driver and a polymer. The solenoid generates
      incident radiation which results in the polymer emitting
      electromagnetic oscillations at frequencies that counter adverse
      effects associated with the subject's exposure to the
      electromagnetic radiation<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to devices and methods for
      protection against exposure to electromagnetic radiation and more
      specifically to a stand alone device that generates protective
      frequencies by inducing the oscillation of a polymer at
      frequencies that counter adverse effects associated with
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0002] Every operating electrical and electronic device emits
      electromagnetic radiation (EMR). The power of this emission varies
      depending on the size and electrical strength of the device and
      the electrical current it carries. High voltage power lines are
      significant emitters, and their field strength is sufficiently
      high to cause adverse effects on humans, animals and plants even
      hundreds of feet away. Smaller devices, such as computers,
      television sets, cellular phones and microwaves, emit lesser
      quantities of EMR, but the effect on humans can still be
      significant because people are in much closer proximity to such
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Adverse effects on the health of humans that have been
      reported as attributable to long-term EMR exposure include
      occurrence of certain cancers, multiple sclerosis, headache, and
      sleep disruption, impairment of short term memory, autism, and
      significant increases in the frequency of seizures in epileptic
      children. Reported adverse effects on animals have included
      stillbirths of young and reduction of milk production in cattle.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Although the effects of electromagnetic radiation on human
      health are not always easily quantifiable it is the desire of many
      prudent people to eliminate or reduce their exposure to EMR. There
      exist various methods of protecting from EMR that rely on reducing
      the magnitude (or strength) of the radiation that enters human
      body. Most commonly these utilize some sort of protective shield
      that enclosures the emitting apparatus hereby reducing the energy
      that is radiated by the EMR emitting device. Alternative approach
      is disclosed by Smirnov (U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,399), which describes
      an EMR shielding material that is composed of an electromagnetic
      radiation optimum neutralized polymer (MRET-Shield). MRET-Shield
      material does not reduce the power of electromagnetic fields. It
      “shields” the cellular structures of the body against the harmful
      biological effects of EMR. The radiation is still entering the
      body but the neutralizing effect of MRET-Shield material reduces
      the adverse effects associated with exposure. However, MRET-Shield
      required the design of a protective shell that encloses the EMR
      emitting device. While personal communications devices, such as
      cell phone or Blackberry, can be easily adapted to fit into such
      protective shell as a part of their design, enclosing larger
      electric appliances (inter alia personal computers, game consoles)
      is often impractical. Further, replacement of current EMR sources
      such as power lines would be cost prohibitive. Therefore, there
      remains a need to protect against EMR emitted from devices that do
      not provide a protective shell.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] The present invention addresses deficiencies in current
      methods for the protection against electromagnetic radiation and
      provides related benefits. In one aspect of the present invention
      a device for protecting a subject against exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation emitted from a remote source is
      provided. The device includes a housing, a solenoid operably
      connected to a driver and a polymer. The solenoid generates
      incident radiation which results in the polymer emitting
      electromagnetic oscillations at frequencies that counter adverse
      effects associated with the subject's exposure to the
      electromagnetic radiation. In one embodiment, the polymer includes
      a polar matrix, an oxidated hydrocarbon emulsifier, a galvanic
      salt, a dye or stain, and a polysaccharide. The solenoid is
      provided in various configurations. In some embodiments, the
      solenoid includes a two frequency mode that generates at least one
      carrier frequency of incident radiation. In other embodiments, the
      solenoid includes a two frequency mode that generates two carrier
      frequencies of incident radiation, wherein the carrier frequencies
      are at higher frequencies than the oscillation frequencies.
      Carrier frequencies may independently or collectively induce
      oscillation of the polymer materials. In some embodiments, the
      solenoid is positioned circumferentially around an inner cylinder
      that houses the polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The device of the present invention will have particular
      utility for the protection against radiation emitted from
      electronic devices such as a computer, a computer peripheral, a
      cellular telephone, a television, an audio system, a household
      appliance, and the like. Further, the device may protect against
      any intentional or unintentional sources of electromagnetic
      radiation with Effective Radiation Power (ERP) limited in
      compliance with FCC regulations.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In another aspect of the invention, methods of protecting a
      subject against exposure to electromagnetic radiation from a
      remote source are provided. The methods include providing a device
      as provided by the present disclosure within an effective radius
      of the subject, and operating the device, such as by activating
      the solenoid driver. In some embodiments, the device is positioned
      within a same room as the subject. In other embodiments the device
      is placed from about five feet to about twenty feet from the
      subject. In other embodiments, a plurality of devices is provided
      within a plurality of locations.<br>

      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0008] FIG. 1A is a cutaway view of an exemplary embodiment
        shown in FIG. 1B, including housing 10, a solenoid 20 operably
        connected to a driver 30, a polymer 40 and a power adapter 60.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0009] FIG. 2 depicts one exemplary circuit schematic
        diagram for the generation of incident radiation including
        carrier frequencies according to the present invention.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0010] FIG. 3A depicts pictorial images of EIS analysis of
        the brain and displays the corresponding data tables from EIS
        testing of a representative subject: <br>
      </b>Control 1 and after exposure to electromagnetic radiation from
      a cellular telephone placed in close proximity to the subject's
      right ear without the protective apparatus of the present
      invention. FIG. 3B provides representative data from the same
      subject: Control 2 and after exposure to electromagnetic radiation
      from a cellular telephone placed in close proximity to the
      subject's right ear in combination with the protective apparatus
      of the present invention. As seen pictorially in FIG. 3A
      (following the exposure to RF phone without the protective
      apparatus of the present invention (labeled TREO—NO MARNF), the
      subject's right frontal lobe showed abnormal values along with the
      abnormal values from hypothalamus, and they were pictorially
      displayed as yellow and blue colors respectively. Yellow color
      corresponds to elevated conductivity, reduced viscosity or acute
      inflammation and blue color corresponds to decreased conductivity,
      increased resistance, increased viscosity, organ hypoxia or
      chronic inflammation. The comparison with experimental data for
      Control 1 showed that after the exposure to electromagnetic
      radiation of a cellular phone all parameters deteriorated.
      However, when using the protective device MARNF of the present
      invention in combination with the cellular telephone (labeled
      TREO—with MARNF) the positive effects were identified at the right
      temporal lobe and more significantly the right frontal lobe (FIG.
      3B). After the 15 minutes rest period the second control scan was
      taken (left image, Control 2). The values of all parameters
      drifted to the normal state, but did not reach the normal ranges.
      Following the 10 minutes exposure to RF phone in combination with
      MARNF (right image, TREO—with MARNF additional positive effects
      were detected in blood pressure, blood viscosity, ATP values and
      mitochondrial activity, oxygen levels, carbon dioxide levels and
      all parameters normalized. FIG. 3C depicts a pictorial images of
      EIS analysis of the cardiovascular system and displays the
      corresponding data tables from EIS testing of a representative
      subject: Control 1 and after exposure to electromagnetic radiation
      from a cellular telephone placed in close proximity to the
      subject's right ear without the protective apparatus of the
      present invention. FIG. 3D provides representative data from the
      same subject: Control 2 and after exposure to electromagnetic
      radiation from a cellular telephone placed in close proximity to
      the subject's right ear in combination with the protective
      apparatus of the present invention. As seen pictorially in FIG. 3C
      (Control 1) the subject's heart has reduced function in the
      inferior vena cava and depressed venous pressure. All other
      cardiac tissue appear remaining normal. After exposure to RF
      phone, proximal to the subject's right temporal lobe, mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) rose above normal range activating the
      baroreceptor reflex, as shown in yellow and blue color (right
      image, TREO—NO MARNF) and cardiac rate frequency dropped by 25%.
      However, the positive effects were identified when using the
      protective device MARNF of the present invention in combination
      with the cellular telephone (labeled TREO—with MARNF, FIG. 3D).
      After the fifteen minutes rest period the second control scan was
      taken (left image, Control 2). The baroreceptor reflex returned to
      normal values and all cardiac tissue except for the inferior vena
      cava appear normal. After the ten minutes exposure to RF phone in
      combination with MRET Random Field Generator (right image,
      TREO—with MARNF) the mean arterial pressure remained stable and
      identical to control 2 scan, and cardiac rate frequency dropped
      insignificantly by 7.5% (compare to 25% drop without MARNF
      protection).<br>

        “phantom head” during the study which detected SAR (Specific
        Absorption rate) values of electromagnetic radiation from
        cellular phone in combination with and without the apparatus of
        the present invention.</b> FIG. 4A displays the results from the
      control test, where the phantom head is exposed to EMR of cellular
      phone without the MRET Random Field Generator. FIG. 4B displays
      the test results where the phantom head is exposed to EMR of
      cellular phone in combination with protective MRET Random Field
      Generator. A ‘hot spot’, characterized by the elevated amplitude
      depicted by darker red, is clearly present in both scans (FIGS. 4A
      and 4B). Comparing FIGS. 4A and 4B, it is clear that the presence
      of the protective device does not alter or redistribute the
      location of the hot spot within the phantom head. However, the
      amplitudes within the hot spot are decreased in about 80% of data
      points. About 65% of data points showed significant reduction of
      SAR values in the range of about 10% to 40%. Thus, the presence of
      MRET Random Field Generator protective device leaded to the
      reduction of the majority of SAR values.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] The present invention addresses deficiencies in current
      technologies for the protection against electromagnetic radiation
      and provides related benefits. It is an object of the present
      invention to provide a device that protects against exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation. It is another object of the present
      invention to provide a device that is portable, which allows
      placement in an area that includes an increased or deleterious
      amount of EMR. Thus the device may be continuously operated for
      continued protection against EMR from remote sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The present invention protects against remote sources of
      EMR and is therefore protective against any EMR emitting device
      operating in frequencies as devices disclosed herein. Non-limiting
      examples include a computer, a computer peripheral, a cellular
      telephone, a personal communications device, a television, an
      audio system, or any household appliance that may intentionally
      and/or unintentionally emit electromagnetic radiation. The term
      “remote source” refers to a source of EMR that is remote from the
      device of the present invention. The present invention may protect
      against EMR emitted from indoor or outdoor power lines.
      Accordingly, the device of the present invention may be placed in
      proximity to the user when operating or exposed to devices that
      emit EMR. In some embodiments, the device is positioned within the
      same room as the EMR emitting device and in some embodiments the
      device protects against EMR emitting devices from different rooms
      or outdoors. In some embodiments, the device is positioned within
      about twenty feet from the subject requiring protection; however,
      the protective distance can be significantly higher when using
      carrier frequencies discussed herein and the like. Though operable
      outdoors, the present invention may have particular use indoors to
      provide protection within an indoor room, such as within a 12×12
      square foot room or a 40×20 square foot room. The number of
      subjects that may be protected with the present device is only
      limited by the protected area. Thus, a single device may protect a
      plurality of subjects within the operating area. The area of
      operation can be increased by increasing the amplitude of the
      emitted frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The present invention operates by generating incident
      radiation, which induces oscillation of a polymer. The oscillation
      frequencies emitted by the polymer are demonstrated herein to
      protect users against remote sources of EMR. These emitted
      protective frequencies prevent or reduce the ordinarily
      deleterious effect from EMR exposure, such as high frequency EMR,
      on biological processes. Among the deleterious effects protected
      against may include changes in viscosity, pressure or water
      content of bodily fluids such as interstitial fluid, blood, and
      the like. The present invention may also protect against changes
      in body pH, oxygen content, hydration, mitochondrial activity,
      hormone levels and the like. The present invention may prevent or
      reduce the accumulation of free radicals in response to exposure
      to EMR. The incident radiation acts as a carrier frequency, which
      carries oscillations emitted by the polymer; thus delivering
      protective frequencies to the intended recipient. Alternatively,
      protective frequencies are generated separate from the incident
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In one aspect of the present invention a device for
      protecting a subject against exposure to electromagnetic radiation
      emitted from a remote source is illustrated in FIGS. 1A and 1B.
      The MRET Random Field Generator device 5 comprises a housing 10
      constructed of a plastic material permeable to appropriate
      frequencies; a solenoid 20 operably connected to a driver circuit
      30 and capable of generating incident radiation; and a polymer 40
      that upon exposure to the incident radiation emits electromagnetic
      oscillation frequencies that counter adverse effects associated
      with the subject's exposure to the electromagnetic radiation.
      Preferably, the polymer 40 is provided in cylindrical form, such
      as within a cylindrical shell 50 constructed of a material,
      preferably plastic, permeable to appropriate frequencies that fits
      inside the inner circumference of the solenoid 20 as illustrated
      in FIG. 1A. Although the amount of polymer is non-limiting, a
      range from about 5 g to about 100 g may be desirable. In a
      preferred embodiment 34 g of polymer was used. Preferably, the
      MRET Random Field Generator device is powered by a 12V wall DC
      power supply 60 as shown in FIG. 1B; however, one skilled in the
      present art would be able to substitute a suitable power source or
      power supply.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Referring to FIG. 1A, the solenoid 20 operates at an
      appropriate current rating to provide suitable incident radiation.
      As an exemplary embodiment, a solenoid may be constructed from
      multiple turns of thin wire and in some embodiments may have a
      current rating of about 300 mA and may have a frequency response
      adequate for operating in the frequency range between about 7.0 Hz
      and 15.0 Hz. The experimental data provide evidence of the peak
      interference spectra for Calcium and Sodium ion transportation for
      the following applied frequency “windows” of 7.8 Hz and 15 Hz. The
      housing 10 is constructed of a plastic material permeable to the
      appropriate incident frequencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] The protective features of the device 5 may act by
      targeting or affecting Calcium and/or Sodium ions in the user's
      body by emitting and optionally carrying the protective
      frequencies. The device 5 and methods may affect localization of
      Calcium and/or Sodium ions in the body; ion pumps and/or ion
      channels; chemical or biological reactions involving the
      interaction, binding or transfer of Calcium and/or Sodium; and the
      like. Calcium is very important for the function of the organism.
      Ca&lt;2+&gt; ions contribute to the activity of many enzymes,
      synaptic transfer, secretion, muscular contraction, proliferation,
      growth and development by interaction with cells or proteins, such
      as calmodulin and troponin. Sodium ions (Na&lt;+&gt;) provide for
      a naturally balanced acid-alkaline medium in the organism and
      excitation signal transfer processes along the nerve cells.
      Na&lt;+&gt; ions are involved in the function of the “ion pumps”
      that produce an electrical potential difference across the cell
      membranes by increasing the density of Sodium in the extracellular
      medium. The protective effects of the instant invention may affect
      the localization of ions such as Sodium or Calcium, activity of
      ion pumps or ion channels, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The protective features of the device 5 may act by
      affecting or organizing clathrate structures of the cellular
      fluids within the body that leads to support of normal
      biochemistry of intracellular water. By affecting or organizing
      clathrate structures the instant invention prevents adverse
      reactions from exposure to EMR.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The solenoid driver 30 is a microprocessor controlled drive
      circuit, such as illustrated in FIG. 2, which provides voltage of
      varying amplitude and frequency to the Solenoid Polymer Assembly.
      The circuit 30 comprises a microcontroller 100, nonvolatile memory
      module 105 for storing the operating code, triple DIP switch 110
      that controls functions of the solenoid driver, pre amplifier 115,
      dual power amplifiers 125 and 130 that are operably connected to a
      driver to solenoid 20, power mode feedback control circuit 120,
      and status three color LED 150.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The user controls the operation of the solenoid driver 30
      preferably by setting individual switches in triple-row DIP switch
      bank 110. The switch functions are as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The first row of DIP switch 110 has two states RUN and
      RESET. The RESET is the initial startup mode to ensure the proper
      initialization of the Solenoid Driver circuit. This function is
      also used to reset the internal Time of life counter. To reset the
      counter typically the unit is powered down and powered back up
      with the switch #1 of the DIP switch bank 110 in the RESET
      position.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] RUN is the normal operation mode and is enabled by setting
      the switch # 1 into RUN position. Once the unit is taken out of
      the RESET and put into RUN mode the microcontroller will ignore
      the RESET switch state, except during the power-up period.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The second row of the DIP switch 110 controls current draw
      of the unit. The LO and the HI switch states correspond to the 140
      mA low-current draw and 280 mA high current draw settings
      respectively. To ensure proper operation of the unit this switch
      must be left in its state during operation. If current mode change
      is desired typically the unit is first powered down in order to
      change the switch state.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The third row of the DIP switch 110 controls frequency mode
      of operation. The 2F setting denotes the dual-frequency mode of
      operation. When dual-frequency mode of operation is selected the
      LOW and the MID frequency components of the incident radiation are
      being generated by the driver circuit.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] In the preferred embodiment, the solenoid driver module
      features a LED assembly 150; comprising of the three color RGB LED
      155, green LED 160 and red LED 165 for providing visual feedback
      during its operation to the user.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The RGB LED 155 operates as follows: green color indicates
      that the low frequency of the incident radiation is being
      generated; yellow color indicates that the MID frequency of the
      incident radiation is being generated. Red color state of the RGB
      LED 155 indicates calibration failure. During the power up stage
      the microcontroller performs calibration procedure where it
      checks, inter alia, the presence of solenoid, power mode and
      frequency mode switch settings. If calibration failure occurs, the
      unit is typically powered down and reset. Once the unit has
      successfully passes the calibration sequence, the green LED 160 is
      illuminated for the duration of the unit operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The microcontroller records the period of time that the
      solenoid driver circuit is in operation in a ‘Time of Life’
      counter. The lifetime of useful operation will vary depending on
      factors such as the particular polymer used and the like. As
      general guidance, it is estimated that the lifetime of useful
      operation of the MRET-Shield polymer is approximately 17,000
      hours. Accordingly, upon the completion of 17,000 hours the
      microcontroller may issue a warning to the user by flashing
      (periodically turning on and turning off) the red LED 165. After
      an additional 200 hours of operation the red LED may stop blinking
      and stay illuminated. This indicates ‘end of life’ of the
      MRET-Shield polymer and the circuit will stop operating. The times
      provided are exemplary only.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In the preferred embodiment the polymer of the present
      invention is the MRET-Shield polar polymeric material disclosed in
      Smirnov, U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,399 which is incorporated by
      reference herein in its entirety. In its most basic form the
      preferred substance is a polymeric material in which the polymeric
      substance contains small quantities of several components: an
      oxidized hydrocarbon emulsifier, a galvanic salt, an alkaloid, a
      dye or stain, and a polysaccharide. Collectively the components
      form a unique composition that displays a characteristic behavior,
      when activated by exposure to EMR, to generate its own
      electromagnetic oscillations at frequencies that resonate with
      living cellular structure and effectively counteract the harmful
      aspects of the EMR. The polymer that forms the matrix of the
      preferred MRET-Shield polymer material can be any polar
      thermosetting or thermoplastic polymer that has a high value of
      relative permittivity (dielectric constant). The polymer can be
      cast into a mold consistent with configurations discussed in the
      present disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The EMR shielding material MRET-Shield was proven to
      produce the biological protective effect. This polar polymer
      material was tested by Underwriters Laboratories and received a UL
      recognition mark in March 2001. EMR shielding material does not
      reduce the intensity (power) of electromagnetic fields. It
      “shields” the cellular structures of the body against the harmful
      effects of EMR. The radiation still enters the body but the
      neutralizing effect of this polar polymer reduces harmful effects
      associated with EMR. The EMR shielding polar polymer can
      neutralize negative effects of EMR by changing the quality or
      effect of the electromagnetic field rather than reducing its
      power, which provides benefits over alternative approaches. In
      contrast, devices that claim to reduce the power of
      electromagnetic fields create distortion of transmitted signals
      and worsen the reception of cellular phones, because these devices
      are based on ferromagnetic materials or high density metals.
      Besides they reduce the radiation only by 15-20%. They also can
      create even worse problems for the cellular structures of the body
      because electromagnetic processes in the cells are thousand times
      weaker then electromagnetic fields generated by any electronic
      appliances. Taking into consideration that most of the appliances
      (cellular phones, computers, etc.) are usually located in a very
      close proximity to the human body, it is reasonable to admit that
      shielding devices, which reduce electromagnetic fields, first of
      all will suppress and disturb electromagnetic processes in living
      cells.<br>

      <br>
      [0030] EIS analysis was conducted at an independent testing
      facility to assess the biological effects of electromagnetic
      radiation from a cellular telephone on the human body and whether
      effects would differ if providing a MRET random field generator
      (MARNF) within about 3.3 meters (10 feet) from the subject during

      Generator or MARNF (labeled TREO—with MARNF).<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0033] The test results in FIG. 3A show that the subject displays
      hyperactivity of the right frontal lobe during Control 1. After 10
      minutes exposure to radiation of TREO 650 cellular phone (referred
      as TREO RF), all parameters demonstrate negative changes (opposite
      from normal range): intercellular pH (icpH) begins to drop, as
      interstitial fluid pH (ipH) rose due to the influx of potassium
      from within the cellular membranes. ATP increased with the applied
      EMR field, as edema increases and hydrostatic pressure similarity
      increases to remove the excess of water in the blood vessels.
      Overall there are negative effects due to proximity to a
      non-ionizing RF phone. While the hypothalamic region remains
      mostly within the normal parameters it is becoming hypo-functional
      in respect to the changes in the function of the sympathetic
      nervous system (C8-L4). The state of sympathetic nervous system
      changed from normal to reduced function. Overall there are
      indications of negative cerebral effects due to exposure to RF
      phone. The subject's right frontal lobe showed abnormal values
      along with the abnormal values from hypothalamus, and they were
      pictorially displayed as yellow and blue colors respectively.
      Yellow color corresponds to elevated conductivity, reduced
      viscosity or acute inflammation and blue color corresponds to
      decreased conductivity, increased resistance, increased viscosity,
      organ hypoxia or chronic inflammation. Thus, after the exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation of a cellular phone all parameters
      deteriorated.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The test results shown on FIG. 3B were taken following the
      15 minutes break down. The image and data for Control 2 indicate
      that the values for the right front lobe began to normalize as a
      result of rest in the absence of EMR exposure. Based on the
      previous experience it was expected that this positive trend will
      be interrupted or reversed upon the re-application of EMR.
      However, scans taken after 10 minutes exposure to the EMR of TREO
      RF while simultaneously exposure to MARNF (MRET Random Field
      Generator) indicate continuing normalization of all parameters
      within the tissue. Additionally, enervation to the sympathetic
      nervous system (C8-L4) is improved after exposure to MARNF,
      despite relative proximity of the TREO RF to the subject's right
      temporal and frontal lobes. The positive effects were detected
      also in blood pressure, blood viscosity, ATP values and
      mitochondrial activity, oxygen levels and carbon dioxide levels
      when using protective MRET Random Field Generator of the present
      invention. Results of these scans suggest that MARNF has a
      measured positive cerebral effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Another example shown in FIG. 3C provides pictorial
      evidence of the measured negative effect of RF phone on the
      cardiovascular system of the subject. The EIS Control 1 scan
      indicates reduced function in the inferior vena cava and depressed
      venous pressure. All remaining cardiac tissue appears normal.
      After exposure to RF phone, proximal to the subject's right
      temporal lobe, his mean arterial pressure (MAP) begins to rise,
      activating the baroreceptor reflex, as shown in yellow (right
      image). MAP increases from 72.5 for the Control 1 and to 76.2 for
      TREO—NO MARNF and cardiac rate frequency dropped by 25%. It
      indicates measured negative cardiovascular effect following the RF
      phone exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The scan images shown in FIG. 3D provide evidence that the
      exposure to EMR of RF phone in combination with MRET Random Field
      Generator (MARNF) has no negative effect on the cardiovascular
      system of the tested subject. The second control scan of the
      subject was performed after the fifteen minute rest period. The
      baroreceptor reflex returned to normal values and all cardiac
      tissues except for the inferior vena cava appear normal. The image
      labeled TREO—with MARNF shows the scan after ten minutes exposure
      to RF phone in combination with MRET Random Field Generator. Mean
      Arterial Pressure remains stable and identical to Control 2 scan.
      It indicates positive cardiovascular effect of MRET Random Field
      Generator and cardiac rate frequency drops insignificantly by only
      7.5% (compare to 25% drop without MARNF protection).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and Methods</b><br>
      <br>
      [0037] The experiments detected changes in brain chemistry using
      Electro Interstitial Scanning (EIS). EIS gives a comprehensive
      overview of the reactions of the body. 3D models of the full body
      and various different parts of the body are created based on the
      electro interstitial gram (EIG). The models are color coded to
      indicate where areas of imbalance are hyper-functioning or
      hypo-functioning. In essence, EIS provides a functional assessment
      of the main organs, with report screens that show interstitial
      biochemical values and an evaluation of body composition including
      lean mass, fat mass and hydration data. Measurements are further
      extrapolated to provide report screens with hormone, electrolyte,
      neurotransmitter and oxidative stress analyses. More specifically,
      the EIS system operates as a biosensor, which analyzes the
      interstitial fluid locally in vivo by application of a D.C.
      current between cutaneous zones using electrodes. In use, the EIS
      introduces electric signals of low intensity (1.28V D.C.) through
      the human body via 6 electrodes. This is painless and has no
      negative effects to the patient. About 22 measurements are taken.
      The scanning results are recorded by EIS software, which analyzes
      and interprets the test results and produces a variety of
      informative models, graphs and data for interpretation by a
      medical practitioner.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] A TREO 650 cellular telephone (referred to herein as TREO
      RF), which operates at frequencies of about 1851.25-1908.75 MHz
      (PCS and CDMA frequencies) was used as a typical source of EMR.
      The MARNF (MRET Random Field Generator) included a housing, a
      solenoid operably connected to a driver and a polymer. The polymer
      included a polar matrix, an oxydated hydrocarbon emulsifier, a
      galvanic salt, a dye or stain, and a polysaccharide. The present
      example used 34 g of polymer.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The subject was scanned at four time points. First scan
      (Control 1) was conducted before any exposure to EMR. Second scan
      (NO MARNF) was performed after the subject was exposed to the TREO
      RF, which was placed next to the right ear of the subject. The EIS
      scan was performed after 10 minutes of exposure to the TREO RF.
      The thirds scan (Control 2) was conducted after the subject rested
      for approximately 15 minutes as a second control. The last scan
      (with MARNF) was taken after the subject was exposed to the same
      TREO 650 cellular telephone for 10 minutes while simultaneously
      being exposed to the MARNF protective generator, placed about 3.3
      meters (10 feet) away.<br>

      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>The Demonstration of Protective Effect of MRET Random Field
        Generator During Exposure of a Phantom Head to Electromagnetic
        Radiation from a Cellular Telephone</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] The example (depicted in FIGS. 4A and 4B) demonstrates the
      protective qualities of the present invention by measuring
      Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) values of electromagnetic radiation
      absorbed by a “phantom head,” which mimics the human head muscle
      and brain tissue composition. The SAR values were measured and
      “hot spots” localization of electromagnetic radiation generated by
      RF phones was investigated. The results in FIG. 4B show a measured
      reduction of the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by muscle
      and brain tissue, but no significant shift in localization of “hot
      spots” which indicates that MRET Random Field Generator
      successfully reduces potential harmful effects on brain chemistry
      following the electromagnetic radiation exposure. The study was
      performed using a variety of wireless RF phones and is described
      in more details below.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] To assess the protective effects of the present invention
      against exposure to radiation, a “phantom head” was used to mimic
      the brain and muscle composition within the head. The “phantom
      head” was produced using a combination of hydroxyethylcellulose
      (FEC) gelling agent and saline solution. The mixture was
      calibrated to obtain proper dielectric constant (permittivity) and
      conductivity of the simulated tissue. The dielectric constant at
      about 835 MHz was about 40 and at about 1900 MHz, was about 39.
      The conductivity at about 835 MHz was about 0.88 mho/m, and the
      conductivity at about 1900 MHz was about 1.43 mho/m. An APREL
      Laboratories ALSAS system with a dosimetric E-field probe E-020
      was used for measurements. The dipole was oriented parallel to the
      body axis. The investigation was conducted on cellular phones
      including Qualcomm Model QCP-2035a, Kyocera Wireless Model 2325
      and Samsung Model SCH-A670.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Wireless mobile phones were evaluated in this experiment
      for localized specific absorption rate (SAR) for controlled
      environment/occupational exposure limits specified in ANSI/EEE
      Std. C95.1-1992 and had been tested in accordance with the
      measurement procedures specified in IEEE 1528-2003 and OET
      Bulletin 65. The RF phone was placed into simulated transmit mode
      using the manufacturer's test codes. Such test signals offer a
      consistent means for SAR and are recommended for evaluating of SAR
      data. Each SAR measurement was taken with a fully charged battery.
      In order to verify that each phone was tested at full power,
      conducted output power measurements were performed before and
      after each SAR test to confirm the output power. SAR measurement
      results were obtained, analyzed and compared to provide the
      scientific conclusion of the experiment: These measurements are
      taken to simulate the RF exposure effects under worst-case
      conditions. Precise laboratory measures were taken to assure
      repeatability of the tests. The tested device complies with the
      requirements in respect to all parameters subject to the test. The
      installation and function of MRET Random Field Generator at the
      distance of 7 feet from the “phantom head” does not significantly
      affect the air measurements of the RF phone signals and
      subsequently does not lead to any significant distortion of
      transmitted RF signals. In each experiment, SAR values were
      measured in 242 points around the phone within the “phantom head.”
      The effect of MRET Random Field Generator on the “phantom head”
      showed that the “hot spots” remained in the same location as
      without MRET Random Field Generator and the amplitudes decreased
      in 80% of the data points. In 65% of the data points there was
      observed a significant decrease of SAR values in the range of 10%
      to 40%. The installation and function of MRET Random Field
      Generator at the distance of 7 feet from the “phantom head” leads
      to the reduction of the majority of SAR values.<br>

      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      EMR is emitted by every operating electrical and electronic
      device. The power of EMR emission varies depending on the size and
      electrical strength of the device and the electrical current it
      carries or employs. High voltage power lines are significant
      emitters of EMR, and field strengths sufficiently high to have the
      potential for causing adverse EMR effects in humans, animals and
      plants can be detected hundreds of feet away. Smaller devices such
      as computers, television sets, microwave ovens and the like emit
      lesser quantities of EMR, but the effect on humans can still be
      significant because people are in much closer proximity to such
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      While there has been controversy over whether significant health
      effects in humans has been proven or disproved by various studies,
      there is no doubt that EMR fields do surround power lines and
      common electrical and electronic devices. It is therefore the
      desire of many prudent people to protect themselves, their animals
      and plants against whatever health risks might be involved by
      their exposure to EMR over extended periods of time.
      Unfortunately, effective and convenient devices for shielding
      against EMR have not been generally available. Essentially the
      only defense against EMR has been removal of persons, animals and
      plants from proximity to the EMR-emitting devices. For major
      emitters such as power lines or electrical substations, this has
      usually meant that one has had to move to a different house or to
      a different job location away from the power line or substation,
      which commonly means substantial expense and inconvenience. The
      adverse costs and inconveniences are similar to farmers and
      ranchers who must move animals and crops to locations remote from
      the power lines or stations. For devices such as microwave ovens
      or computers, it has meant that a person must sit or stand at an
      awkward distance from the device, which can impair the person's
      ability to use the device in an optimum manner.<br>
      <br>
      Because there is a magnetic field component to EMR, conventional
      shielding which might provide protection against electrical shock
      is not effective to shield against the effects of the generated
      magnetism on a human, animal and plant bodies and health.<br>
      <br>
      Adverse human health effects which have been reported as
      attributable to long-term EMR exposure include occurrence of
      certain cancers, multiple sclerosis and autism. Reported adverse
      effects on animals have included stillbirths of young and
      reduction of milk production in cattle.<br>
      <br>
      It would therefore be advantageous if there were a device
      available which could effectively shield people, animals and
      plants against harmful, adverse health consequences which may be
      inherent in prolonged or extended exposure to EMR.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      I have now invented a material which may be fabricated in numerous
      embodiments and which when worn, carried or otherwise kept in
      proximity to persons, animals and even plants, serves to lessen
      adverse health effects caused by EMR from power lines, computers,
      mobile telephones, microwave ovens, televisions and numerous other
      electrical and electronic devices. These EMR shielding materials
      and devices can be fabricated and used in many different
      embodiments. This enables the invention to be used effectively in
      many locations and under many circumstances where prior art
      devices were simply unavailable or ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      Key to the present invention is a polymeric body into which are
      incorporated small quantities of inorganic and organic materials,
      those materials when placed in an EMR magnetic field, respond to
      that EMR by emitting natural electromagnetic oscillations which
      are beneficial to humans, animals and plants, and which at least
      in part counteract the harmful aspects of the EMR on the human,
      animal or plant. The polymeric material may be formed into devices
      of a wide variety of embodiments, including block solids, fibers,
      fabrics, particulate, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      Specifically, the invention herein comprises a material to reduce
      adverse effects of electromagnetic radiation exposure of a human,
      animal or plant body, comprising a polymeric matrix having high
      relative permitivity and having incorporated therein a) an
      oxydated hydrocarbon emulsifier; b) a galvanic salt; c) an
      alkaloid; d) a dye or stain; and e) a polysaccharide; the material
      upon exposure to incident electromagnetic radiation responding
      thereto by emission of electromagnetic oscillations at frequencies
      which counter the adverse effects of the incident electromagnetic
      radiation on the body. In a preferred embodiment the polymer is an
      epoxy polymer.<br>
      <br>
      In preferred embodiments the material's composition comprises, in
      parts per 1000 parts by weight of the polymer:<br>

      the dye or stain&nbsp; 2.3&nbsp; parts by weight<br>
      the polysaccharide&nbsp; 1.2&nbsp; parts by weight.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      In its most basic form, the invention here is a polymeric material
      in which the polymeric matrix contains small concentrations of
      several different types of components-an oxydated hydrocarbon
      emulsifier, a galvanic salt, an alkaloid, a dye or stain, and a
      polysaccharide. Collectively these components and the polymer form
      a unique composition which has the unusual ability, when activated
      by exposure to EMR, to generate its own electromagnetic
      oscillations at frequencies which resonate with cellular
      structures and effectively counteract the harmful aspects of the
      EMR. Thus when a person, animal or plant is exposed to EMR, having
      a device made of the present material on one's person or in close
      proximity will reduce the harmful effects which one may suffer
      from prolonged exposure to the EMR. As an example presented below
      shows, substantial reductions in the adverse effects on human
      blood by EMR exposure can be obtained by having a device made of
      the present material present in proximity to the exposed blood.<br>
      <br>
      The polymer which forms the matrix of the present can be any polar
      thermosetting or thermoplastic polymer which has a high value of
      relative permitivity (dielectric constant). Numerous polar
      polymers are described in the literature; of particular preference
      in the present compositions are the epoxy polymers. As the matrix,
      the polymer will form the bulk of the present materials. The
      concentrations of the components discussed below are stated with
      respect to 1000 mg of the polymer.<br>
      <br>
      A first component of the material is an emulsifier having solvent
      properties, which facilitates the incorporation of the components
      into the polymeric matrix. Numerous suitable emulsifiers are
      disclosed in the literature. Preferred in these compositions are
      glycol ethers or salts thereof. A particularly useful emulsifier
      is ethylene glycol monobutyl ether or its acetate salt (both
      available commercially under the respective trade names "Butyl
      Cellusolve" and "Butyl Cellusolve Acetate"). The emulsifier will
      be present in a concentration of 1-25 milliliters, preferably
      about 10 mL.<br>
      <br>
      A second component is a galvanic salt which imparts galvanic
      properties to the composition. Numerous inorganic (and some
      organic) salts may be used, including the alkali metal and
      alkaline earth metal salts. The more reactive salts such as the
      sodium salts are preferred. The anions of the salts may be
      galvanically active ions such as the various forms of phosphates.
      Particularly preferred is dibasic sodium phosphate. The galvanic
      salt will be present in a concentration of 0.1-3.0 mg., preferably
      about 1.3 mg.<br>
      <br>
      The third component will be an alkaloid which has
      parasympatholytic properties, and thus counteracts stimulation of
      the parasympathetic nervous system. Preferred alkaloids are
      atropine and its derivatives. Particularly preferred is tropine
      (C8H15NO) which is obtained by hydrolysis of atropine. The
      alkaloid will be present as 1.0-5.0 mg, preferably about 2.5-2.7
      mg.<br>
      <br>
      The fourth component will be a dye or stain, preferably
      fluorescein or a derivative thereof. Particularly preferred is
      rose bengal (C20H2O5I4Cl4Na2), also known as
      4,5,6,7-tetrachloro-2,4',5'7'-tetraiodofluorescein (sodium salt)
      and as "Acid Red 94". The dye or stain will be present as 0.5-3.0
      mg, preferably about 2.0-2.5 mg.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the basic compositions herein will also contain a
      polysaccharide, preferably a phycocolloid. Particularly preferred
      are the phycocolloids derived from algae, such as seaweed.
      Preferred is agar (also known as agar-agar), which is a
      phycocolloid derived from the red algae such as Gelidium or
      Gracilaria and is a polysaccharide mixture of agarose and
      agaropectin. The polysaccharide will be present as 0.1-3.0 mg,
      preferably 1.0-1.5 mg.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric materials of this invention are easily manipulated
      and can be formed into a wide variety of shapes and have a variety
      of different sizes. Two types of embodiments have been found
      particularly useful; see FIGS. 1-3. The first is to have the
      material formed as a unitary small device, such as a disk 2. In
      the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the disk is formed as a hollow
      cylinder about 1'' (2.5 cm) in diameter and [1/2]' (1.2 cm) high
      with a wall 4 which forms a container into which the material 6 is
      placed. The material 6 being in a liquid form before the
      polymerization can be placed into the hollow interior where it
      hardens because of the polymerization reaction, or it can be in
      granular or powdered form and be packed into the interior. A cover
      8 (shown in phantom) may be placed onto the disk 2 after placement
      of the polymeric material 6 if desired, but the cover is not
      required. The disk 2 may conveniently be mounted on a common
      object that a person would carry on his or her person or in a
      purse, such as a box 10 (perhaps a compact, keycase or the like),
      by use of a layer of adhesive 12. Larger or small versions of the
      disk may also be used.<br>
      <br>
      In the alternative embodiment shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the
      polymeric material is formed (such as by extrusion) into a fibrous
      form 14 from which it can be woven into a fabric 16. The
      individual fibers in the fabric 16 may all be made of the
      polymeric composition, but more preferably fibers of the polymeric
      composition will be distributed among a larger number of fibers of
      conventional fabric materials such as cotton or wool. Since the
      compositions of this invention are effective in relatively small
      quantities, as evident from the description of the disk 2 above,
      it will be understood that the fabric can be made into a garment
      to be worn, in which the garment is largely composed of the
      conventional fibers in the fabric, and that fibers of the present
      polymeric composition are a minor part of the actual garment.<br>
      <br>
      While the mechanism of operation of the present materials and
      devices made therefrom is not known exactly, it is believed that
      the following may be applicable (but is not to be construed as
      limiting of the invention). The polar nature of the polymer allows
      both bonding and non-bonding electrons in the molecular structure
      of the polymer to be readily displaced by exposure to an external
      electromagnetic field. Thus the external electromagnetic field of
      the EMR creates in the molecular structure of the polymeric
      composition the excitation of electromagnetic forces which in turn
      amplifies the corona discharge effect of the polymer and
      assortment components. The result of this amplification is an
      emission of subtle electromagnetic oscillations originated by the
      polymer itself. It is these subtle electromagnetic oscillations
      which are beneficial to the adjacent human, animal or plant bodies
      and which serve to counteract or compensate for the negative
      effects on the various bodies. The recent discoveries in
      biophysics proved that certain subtle low frequencies can resonate
      with cellular structures and improve cellular function and
      metabolism. The different combinations of the inorganic and
      organic components incorporated into the polymeric matrix cause
      variations in the frequencies of the electromagnetic oscillations
      of the polymer, and thus produce varying effects in the different
      human, animal and plant organisms.<br>
      <br>
      The beneficial effects of this material on humans exposed to EMR
      is illustrated by the following example. Blood samples were taken
      from twenty-two adult subjects. Each sample was divided into three
      parts. The first part was used as a control and was not exposed to
      EMR. The two remaining parts were exposed to the VLF (very low
      frequency) EMR emitted by an operating 14'' computer monitor
      screen for one hour, positioned at a person's normal viewing
      distance of the screen. One of the two remaining parts was exposed
      to that VLF EMR without any shielding being present. The other
      part was exposed to that VLF EMR while a sample of the present
      material in the form of a solid body was positioned proximate to
      and directly below the screen. The specific composition used
      comprised an epoxy polymer with the following components (usually
      reported as mg per 1000 mg of the epoxy polymer): ethylene glycol
      monobutyl ether ("Butyl Cellusolve": 10 mL), sodium phosphate (1.3
      mg), tropine (2.6 mg), rose bengal (2.3 mg) and agar (1.2 mg).
      After separation all three groups of sample parts were subjected
      to standard blood testing. The test and their results (N=22) are
      reported in the Table below. The tests, as abbreviated in the
      Table, were as follows:<br>

      The striking result which is evident from the above data, and
      which is reflected graphically in FIGS. 5 and 6, is the
      significant reduction in the decline of granulocyte content of the
      blood which was irradiated but shielded by the presence of the
      material of this invention. FIG. 5 illustrates the decline in
      granulocyte count in blood samples exposed to EMR for one hour
      without (-[Delta]-) and with (- -) shielding by the material of
      this invention, as compared to the granulocyte content of the
      non-exposed control samples (---). FIG. 6 reflects the same data
      and illustrates the spread of the decline of the individual
      samples. As compared to the control the shielded group had
      one-third less decline in granulocyte content from the EMR
      exposure than did the non-shield group. Since granulocytes are a
      critical component of blood, and play one of the most important
      roles in the immune systems of the body. it is evident that the
      presence of the material of this invention protected the blood
      samples from significant amounts of harmful effects (i.e., content
      decline of granulocytes) resulting from the EMR exposure. The
      special point of interest is the significant increase of the red
      blood cells (RBC) in the shielded group. These cells play the
      major role in the process of oxygenation of the body. This result
      shows that the installation of the shielding device can positively
      affect the process of cellular oxygenation and as a result improve
      metabolism.<br>
      <br>
      The increase of lymphocytes above normal level can also contribute
      to some negative effects such as leukemia, lymphomas, skin rash,
      etc. As compared to the control group the shielded group has about
      40% less increase in lymphocytes content than the non-shielded
      group.<br>
      <br>
      Another example of the effectiveness of the present compositions
      is illustrated in FIG. 4. The three views in this Figure are
      drawings of photographs of the leaves of a plant made by
      high-voltage photography. High-voltage photography is a process
      which allows the corona discharge effect of a body to be detected
      and captured for visual observation. The first view A is of the
      coronal discharge of a typical leaf of the plant before exposure
      to the VLF EMR from the computer monitor mentioned above. The
      solid image of the leaf indicates that all of the cells of the
      leaf are alive and functioning. In view B a leaf was exposed to
      the EMR for 30 minutes but in the presence of a shielding device
      of the present invention. The detect coronal discharge shows that
      about 80% of the cells have survived. In contrast, in view C,
      which shows a leaf exposed for the same 30 minutes but without the
      presence of the shielding device, in which only 40% of the cells
      have survived.<br>
      <br>
      It will be evident that there are numerous embodiments of the
      present invention which are not expressly described above, but
      which are clearly within the scope and spirit of the invention.
      The above description is therefore to be considered exemplary
      only, and the actual scope of the invention is to be defined
      solely by the appended claims.<br>

      A device and method are disclosed which activate aqueous liquids,
      particularly water, and liquid polymers, resulting in enhanced
      properties in chemical and biological processes in which the
      activated liquids are used. The device includes a liquid
      reservoir; an activation body formed of a polymeric matrix
      containing a number of finely divided materials, with the body
      disposed in a strong (2,500-25,000 Oersted) magnetic field and
      responsive to visible electromagnetic radiation having a frequency
      of 7.2-7.8 Hz and a wavelength of 400-800 nm, and with one end
      disposed proximate to the surface of the liquid; and an electrical
      circuit adjacent the other end of the body, activating diodes to
      emit flashes of light having that wavelength and frequency, so
      that the materials and the polymeric body are energized and emit
      low frequency oscillations, which activate the liquid contained in
      the reservoir. Polymers include polyurethanes and epoxies.
      Materials include metals, metal salts, organic compounds, and
      natural minerals and mineral containing bodies. Concentrations are
      in the range of 0.04-30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of
      polymer. Also described are a number of methods of use of
      activated liquids, particularly water, including reducing
      alkalinity, acidity or hardness of water, reducing bacterial
      content of contaminated water, enhancing the setting time and
      compressive strength of concrete, and enhancing the growth rate
      and viability of plants. Physiological effects on cells and
      viruses as well as in humans have been observed with water
      activated as described.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The invention herein relates to activated liquids, such as water
      and liquid polymers, having exceptional chemical and physiological
      properties. More specifically, it relates to the method of
      production of activated liquids, to a device for such production,
      and to methods of using the activated liquids to obtain the
      benefits of the enhanced properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Water is a critical factor in most chemical and biological
      processes. It has been known that water quality can have a
      significant effect upon those processes. Therefore, considerable
      time and effort has been spent to purify water from various
      sources. Such purification processes, while useful, merely remove
      much of the dissolved and suspended foreign matter in water, but
      do not alter the nature of the water itself. While this is of
      advantage in reducing the opportunities for the foreign materials
      to adversely affect the chemical and biological processes, such
      purification techniques do not overcome the fundamental limitation
      that the water itself imposes on the process.<br>
      <br>
      No process has previously been known which can alter the water
      itself, so that enhanced properties of altered water can
      advantageously be used to improve the basic functions of the
      chemical and biological processes in which the altered water would
      be used.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, liquid polymers are routinely used to manufacture a
      wide variety of products. The liquid polymers are carefully
      produced and transported to insure that contaminants do not get
      into the polymeric liquids before the liquids are used for
      production of such products. It is well known that if there are
      contaminants in the polymeric raw materials, the plastic products
      made (usually by molding) from the contaminated raw materials will
      be substandard and may be susceptible to breakage, dimensional
      distortion, and many other defects. However, as with water, while
      much effort has gone into producing pure polymers, there has been
      no process for altering the properties of the polymers themselves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      I have now developed a device and method which alters liquids,
      specifically aqueous liquids, preferably water, and liquid
      polymers, by activating them. These liquids when activated with
      the device and using the method described and claimed herein
      develop distinctively enhanced properties which are beneficial in
      numerous chemical and biological processes in which the activated
      liquids are used in place of some or all of the normal water or
      liquid supply. Enhancement is in the form of improved results from
      the processes, as compared to the same processes when performed
      with non-activated water or liquid polymer.<br>
      <br>
      For example, the device and method of this invention have been
      used successfully to reduce alkalinity, acidity or hardness of
      water, reduce bacterial content of contaminated water, enhance the
      setting time and compressive strength of concrete, and enhance the
      growth rate and viability of plants. There is also limited
      indication that ingesting activated water may have advantageous
      physiological effects on humans, including but not limited to
      treatment of viral infections and dysmenorrhea.<br>
      <br>
      Key to the present invention is an activation device which
      includes a polymeric body into which are incorporated small
      quantities of inorganic and organics materials, those materials
      when placed in a strong magnetic field being responsive to
      electromagnetic radiation having a particular range of frequency
      and wavelength. When this device irradiates a body of the target
      liquid through operation under the defined conditions of magnetic
      field strength and radiation frequency and wavelength, the liquid
      becomes activated. The activated liquid can then be used an a
      partial or complete substitute for non-activated liquid in
      numerous industrial chemical and biochemical reactions. Such use
      has been found to improve the efficiency of such reactions.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, in one broad embodiment the invention is of a device
      for the production of activated liquids which comprises a liquid
      reservoir and an activation member, the activation member
      comprising an elongated column having first and second axial ends
      and an annular wall having an exterior and enclosing a hollow
      interior of the column, the first end projecting toward the
      reservoir and the second end being disposed outside the reservoir,
      at least one magnet pair disposed along the exterior of the
      column, the two magnets of each pair being disposed opposite each
      other across the column, the at least one magnet pair generating a
      magnetic field in the range of 2,500-25,000 Oersteds, a polymeric
      composition filing the interior of the column, the polymeric
      composition comprising a polymer having a linear chain length of
      at least 38 monomer units and having dispersed therein, in finely
      divided form, 0.04-30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of
      polymer of a mixture of materials selected from at least two of
      the groups of (a) metals and metal salts comprising metals,
      oxides, nitrates, sulfates or tartrates of Groups 1a, 3a, 4a, 5a,
      5b, 6b and 8b elements, (b) silicates and carbonates, (c)
      inorganic acids, (d)aminoaldehydes and pyridines, and (e)
      analgesics; the materials being responsive to electromagnetic
      radiation having a frequency in the range of 7.2-8.2 Hz and a
      wavelength in the range of 400-800 nm; and an electrical circuit
      disposed adjacent to the second end of the column, the circuit
      including a light emitting member which emits flashes of light
      having a wavelength in the range of 400-800 nm at a frequency of
      in the range of 7.2-8.2 Hz, the emitted flashes of light being
      directed at the second end of the column; such that when the
      reservoir contains a liquid and the electrical circuit operates
      and causes the light emitting member to flash at the wavelength
      and frequency, and the materials in the polymer are subject to the
      magnetic field, the polymer and minerals become energized and emit
      low frequency oscillations which causes the liquid to become and
      remain activated.<br>
      <br>
      In another broad embodiment the invention is of a method of
      activating a liquid which comprises providing a liquid reservoir
      and an activation member, the activation member comprising an
      elongated column having first and second axial ends and an annular
      wall having an exterior and enclosing a hollow interior of the
      column, the first end projecting into the reservoir and the second
      end being disposed outside the reservoir, at least one magnet pair
      disposed along the exterior of the column, the two magnets of each
      pair being disposed opposite each other across the column, the at
      least one magnet pair generating a magnetic field in the range of
      2,500-25,000 Oersteds, a polymeric composition filing the interior
      of the column, the polymeric composition comprising a polymer
      having a linear chain length of at least 38 monomer units and
      having dispersed therein, in finely divided form, 0.04-30 parts by
      weight per 100 parts by weight of polymer of a mixture of
      materials selected from at least two of the groups of (a) metals
      and metal salts comprising metals, oxides, nitrates, sulfates or
      tartrates of Groups 1a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 5b, 6b and 8b elements, (b)
      silicates and carbonates, (c) inorganic acids, (d) aminoaldehydes
      and pyridines, and (e) analgesics; the materials being responsive
      to electromagnetic radiation having a frequency in the range of
      7.2-8.2 Hz and a wavelength in the range of 400-800 nm; and an
      electrical circuit disposed adjacent to the second end of the
      column, the circuit including a light emitting member which emits
      flashes of light having a wavelength in the range of 400-800 nm at
      a frequency of in the range of 7.2-8.2 Hz, the emitted flashes of
      light being directed at the second end of the column; subjecting
      the polymer and incorporated materials in the activation member to
      the magnetic field of 2,500-25,000 Oersteds from the at least one
      magnet pair; positioning the first end of the activation element
      proximate to the liquid in the reservoir while maintaining the
      magnetic field; operating the electrical circuit to cause the
      light emitting member to flash at the wavelength and frequency;
      whereby the materials and polymer become energized and emit low
      frequency oscillations which causes the proximate liquid in the
      reservoir to become and remain activated.<br>
      <br>
      In a particularly preferred embodiment, the materials which are
      incorporated into the polymer in the activation device are
      responsive to electromagnetic radiation having a frequency on the
      order of 7.8 Hz and a wavelength on the order of 585 nm.<br>
      <br>
      Other embodiments and details will be described below.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION AND PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention is best understood initially by reference to the
      drawings. Considering first FIG. 1, the device 2 of the present
      invention is made up of a liquid reservoir 4, a cap 6 which
      includes a vertical housing 8 in which the column 10 containing a
      unique "filled" or `impregnated" polymer body 12 is encased, and a
      removable chamber 14 which is attached to housing 8 and which
      contains radiation emitting diodes 16 and an electrical circuit 18
      to activate the diodes. In the top of the chamber 14 is a socket
      20 for a battery which is used to power the circuit 18. Socket 18
      can also be adapted to be a receptacle for an external electrical
      power line which leads to an external source of low voltage DC
      power (not shown). The latter configuration will be of advantage
      for an activating device which is intended to be at least
      semi-permanently disposed in a fixed location, and will avoid the
      necessity to regularly replace batteries for the device.<br>
      <br>
      To use the device, as shown in FIG. 1, the reservoir 4 is largely
      filled with liquid 22, which is normally in at least a moderately
      pure state. It is preferred to use thoroughly purified liquid in
      the reservoir 4, so that foreign materials in the liquid will not
      adversely affect or retard the activation process. However, as
      will be exemplified below, activation itself will serve to purify
      the liquid to a certain extent.<br>
      <br>
      The liquid to be activated will be an aqueous liquid, preferably
      water, or a liquid polymer. For brevity herein, the invention will
      be exemplified in the discussion below by water as the liquid to
      be activated. It will be understood, however, that the invention
      is not limited only to activation of water but also applies to the
      activation of other aqueous liquids and liquid polymers.<br>
      <br>
      The lower end 24 of casing 8 contains openings 26 to allow the
      body 12 to emit low frequency oscillations toward the water 22.
      Casing 8 is positioned with its lower end 24 facing toward the
      water surface 21 and disposed such that the distal end 46 of the
      polymeric body 12 is spaced apart from the water surface 21 by a
      distance D of at least about 1" (2.5 cm). The cap 6 is removably
      mounted by mating screw threads 28 to the top neck 30 of reservoir
      4 so that it can be easily unscrewed to fill or empty the
      reservoir. Similarly, the chamber 14 is attached by mating screw
      threads 32 to the upper end of housing 8 so that it can be removed
      to permit access to the interior of housing 8 for insertion,
      removal or replacement of the column 10. In addition, removal of
      chamber 14 allows access to the diodes 16 and circuitry 18 for
      maintenance or repair.<br>
      <br>
      The column which houses the polymeric body is best illustrated in
      FIGS. 2-4. These Figures show the column 10 with magnets 34 in
      place but with the polymeric body 12 removed so that the interior
      of the column 10 can be observed. Formed in the side walls of
      column 10 are laterally opposed pairs of cylindrical recesses 36
      in which magnets 34 are seated. In the embodiment shown there are
      seven pairs of magnets 34, but the number of magnet pairs may be
      any number from one to ten or more. The number of magnet pairs
      will be selected so that the total magnetic field generated is in
      the range of 2,500-25,000 Oersteds. The magnet pairs may be
      replaced by electromagnets which provide magnetic induction of
      about 4000 gauss for each magnet, to produce an equivalent
      magnetic field. The magnet pairs are disposed so that the
      north-south orientation of the poles are reversed from pair to
      pair, such that each pair has the opposite north-south alignment
      as the adjacent pairs on either side of it, as indicated by the +
      and - signs in FIGS. 3 and 4. The lower end 38 of the column 10 is
      open so that when the polymeric body 12 is present it can emit low
      frequency oscillations toward the water 22 at the lower end of the
      column 10. The top end of the column 10 is formed with an annular
      flange 40 which in use rests on and is supported by the top end 42
      of housing 8.<br>
      <br>
      The electrical circuit 18 is shown schematically in FIG. 5. Each
      of the components is identified with conventional standard symbols
      in FIG. 5 and is labeled with representative values for its
      properties, such that no further description is needed. Those
      skilled in the art will also of course recognize that standard
      component substitutions can be made, as long as the changes do not
      materially affect the ability of the diodes to flash with the
      critical frequency and wavelength which will be discussed below.
      The circuit is normally powered by a 9V battery which is seated in
      socket 20 and makes contacts with the contacts 44 of circuit 18.
      The circuit 18 is designed to cause the diodes 16 to emit visible
      light radiation at a visible wavelength .lambda. in the range of
      400-800 nm and a frequency in the range of 7.2-8.2 Hz. In a
      preferred embodiment the visible wavelength .lambda. is on the
      order of 585 nm and has a frequency on the order of 7.8 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      These values for frequency and wavelength of the light radiation
      emitted from the diodes 16 and the magnetic field to which the
      polymer and materials are simultaneously subjected are critical to
      the present invention, since the polymeric body 12 and its
      contained materials are particularly responsive to these
      frequencies and wavelengths of the radiation while in the magnetic
      field, and, in turn, resonate to provide the activating energy to
      the body of water 22. The specific predominant frequency,
      wavelength and magnetic field will be dependent upon the liquid to
      be activated and the purpose for which it is to be activated. For
      instance, for suppression of bacteria in water a magnetic field of
      about 2,500 Oersteds, a predominant wavelength of about
      .lambda.=585 nm (a yellow-green color) and a predominant frequency
      of about 7.8 Hz was found to be quite suitable.<br>
      <br>
      While applicant does not wish to be bound by any particular theory
      for the mechanism of the present invention, it is believed that
      the criticality of the 7.2-8.2 Hz frequency, with preferably 7.8
      Hz predominant, is related to the fact that 7.8 Hz is a basic
      frequency of the earth's magnetic field, known as the Shuman
      frequency. As will be mentioned below, the activating ability of
      the present device is believed to be related to the earth's
      natural magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric body 12 is composed of a polymer matrix in which the
      polymer has a linear chain length of at least 38 monomer units.
      Both thermosetting and thermoplastic polymers may be used. It is
      preferred to use polymers which possess comparatively high values
      of relative permittivity (dielectric constant), since that
      provides for easier displacement of both bonding and non-bonding
      electrons in these polymers by the external magnetic field and
      thus enhanced continuity with the electromagnetic and optical
      response of the incorporated materials. The polymers selected
      must, however, be capable of absorbing visible light radiation
      (v=400-800 nm); absorption of optical (visible) radiation occurs
      in the polymers by irreversible non-radiative loss effects.
      Polymers which exhibit this capability include polyurethanes,
      epoxies and furans. Polyurethane resins are well known polymers
      and are widely described in the literature. Typical descriptions
      can be found in Mark et al. (eds.), KIRK-OTHMER CONCISE
      ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY, "Urethane Polymers", pp.
      1211-1212 (1985); Rubin (ed.), HANDBOOK OF PLASTIC MATERIALS AND
      TECHNOLOGY, chs. 41 and 42, pp. 501-524 (1990); and Juran (ed.),
      Modern Plastics Encyclopedia 88, 64:10A, pp. 97-98, 122,124, 546
      (October 1987). Similarly, epoxy polymers can be found described
      in many references, including the aforementioned Mark et al.
      (eds.), KIRK-OTHMER CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY,
      "Epoxy Resins", pp. 431-433 (1985); Rubin (ed.), HANDBOOK OF
      PLASTIC MATERIALS AND TECHNOLOGY, ch. 72, pp. 829-844 (1990); and
      Juran (ed.), Modern Plastics Encyclopedia 88, 64:10A, pp. 114,
      516-517 (October 1987). Also, furan (or furfuyl) polymers can be
      found described in many references, including the aforementioned
      Mark et al. (eds.), KIRK-OTHMER CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL
      TECHNOLOGY, "Furan Derivatives", pp. 542-544 (1985).<br>
      <br>
      Incorporated throughout (i.e., impregnated or filled into) the
      body of the polymer resin matrix, in finely divided form, are a
      number of different materials, all selected so that the polymeric
      activation body containing these materials when subjected to the
      2,500-25,000 Oersteds magnetic field responds to the 7.2-8.2 Hz
      frequencies and 400-800 nm wavelengths of the emitted light and
      resonates to produce electromagnetic oscillations of low frequency
      which enhance and intensify the normal coronal discharge of the
      incorporated materials within the polymeric matrix. The frequency
      of these resultant oscillations are generally in the range of
      0.5-5.0 Hz.<br>
      <br>
      The incorporated materials are selected from several classes of
      compounds, of which at least two classes must be dispersed in the
      impregnated or filled polymer, in finely divided form, and at a
      concentration of from 0.04-30 parts by weight per 100 parts by
      weight of polymer, to form the activating body. These classes of
      compounds are (a) metals and metal salts comprising metals,
      oxides, nitrates, sulfates or tartrates of Groups 1a, 3a, 4a, 5a,
      5b, 6b and 8b elements; (b) silicates and carbonates; (c)
      inorganic acids; (d) aminoaldehydes and pyridines, and (e)
      analgesics. Specific examples of various mixtures of compounds
      will be described below. The specific mixture of compounds and
      their precise concentrations will vary according to the liquid to
      be activated and the use to which the activated liquid is
      subsequently to be put. It will, however, from the information
      herein, be well within the ability of a person of ordinary skill
      in the art to select the appropriate mixture of materials for the
      specific task intended by such person, with no more than routine
      minor experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      It will be recognized that the selection of these materials and
      their concentration in the polymeric matrix will be a function of
      their ability to participate in the resonance and to have their
      normal coronal discharge energies intensified by the resonance
      effect in the 7.2-8.2 Hz frequency range and 400-800 nm wavelength
      range. The person skilled in the art will also be able readily to
      determine the appropriate frequency and wavelength, again with
      only routine experimentation, for optimum performance of the task
      intended for the activated liquid.<br>
      <br>
      The metals and metals salts which have been found useful in this
      invention are the metals, oxides, nitrates, sulfates or tartrates
      of elements of Groups 1a, 3a, 4a, 5a, 5b, 6b and 8b, preferably
      aluminum, antimony, boron, chromium, iron, lead, nickel, niobium,
      osmium or potassium.<br>
      <br>
      Also included in the polymeric matrix are a number of different
      minerals, which also are selected for their ability to undergo
      resonant intensification of their coronal discharge. These may
      include materials from the calcite family, quartz family and jade
      family, as well as from shells of marine organisms, which are
      primarily carbonates and silicates of elements such as calcium,
      copper, sodium and aluminum, as well as various forms of silica
      itself.<br>
      <br>
      The third class of compounds useful herein are the inorganic
      acids. Most preferred are the weaker inorganic acids (pH
      .gtoreq.3.0, preferably .gtoreq.4.5), such as boric acid (pH=5.2).<br>
      <br>
      The fourth class of compounds for the present invention are
      organic aminoaldehydes and pyridines.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the fifth class of compounds are those which have an
      analgesic physiological effect.<br>
      <br>
      The various compounds selected from at least two of the five
      classes will be present in a total concentration of approximately
      0.04-30 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the polymeric
      matrix. (Unless otherwise noted, all concentrations mentioned
      herein in the Specification and claims are stated in parts by
      weight of a named material per 100 parts by weight of the
      polymeric matrix.) It will be recognized that the various
      concentrations of the individual compounds can be varied to obtain
      the total defined concentration range as long as the resonant
      response of the filled polymeric body 12 to the 7.2-8.2 Hz
      frequency and 400-800 nm wavelength is maintained when the body is
      in the strong magnetic field provided by the magnet pairs.<br>
      <br>

      Other examples of beneficial end uses of the present invention
      will be described below.<br>
      <br>
      The device may be constructed in any convenient size. For
      instance, I have found that a device in which the column 10 is
      approximately 8" high by 1" in diameter (20.times.2.5 cm) and the
      reservoir 4 is approximately 61/2" high by 31/2" in diameter
      (16.times.9 cm), with a liquid volume of approximately 2 pints (1
      liter), is quite satisfactory for making small amounts of
      activated liquid, especially water.<br>
      <br>
      The device of the present invention is operated by activating the
      electrical circuit 18 by connection to a battery or adapter in
      socket 12. An off-on switch (not shown) can be provided if
      desired. The electrical circuit 18 then causes the diodes 16 to
      emit radiation in the 400-800 nm frequency range with a wavelength
      in the 7.2-8.2 nm range. Of course the specific frequency and
      wavelength will be determined by the values of the components on
      the circuit. Those skilled in the art of circuit design will be
      readily able to select the appropriate values for the components
      of a circuit equivalent to that shown in FIG. 5, in order to
      obtain the frequency and wavelength values desired. The flashing
      light emitted by the diodes 16 is directed toward the adjacent end
      44 of the polymeric body 12. The response of the body 12 and its
      incorporated materials to the light is resonant, and under such
      resonance the body 12 in turn emits the aforementioned low
      frequency radiation from its distal end 46 toward the body of
      water 22 in the reservoir 4. This continues for a period of time
      (usually 30-45 minutes) until the proton dispersion in the water
      reaches an increased value in the range of about 3.4-6.2 ppm. That
      range has been found to indicate when treated water can be
      considered to be adequately activated.<br>
      <br>
      Other improved water properties produced by the activation of this
      invention have been observed. For instance, in one experiment
      after 30 minutes of activation calcium content decreased by 72%
      and magnesium content decreased by 18%, thus reducing the hardness
      (combined Ca and Mg reduction) of the water by 45%. Similarly, 15
      minutes of activation of alkaline water (pH=7.69) reduced the pH
      to 7.48, a 30% reduction alkalinity as compared to neutral water
      pH DEG =7.0. In another experiment a reduction of pH from 7.65 to
      7.25 (62% reduction in alkalinity) was observed after 30 minutes
      of activation. Similarly, acidity of water is also reduced by
      activation. In an experiment after 15 minutes of activation the pH
      of acidic water was increased from 6.73 to 6.89 (a 35% increase
      relative to neutral water pH DEG =7.0). Finally, water activated
      for 30 minutes in another experiment showed a 3% increase in
      conductivity.<br>
      <br>
      The following are examples of the beneficial and heretofore
      unknown effects of the activation of the water by the present
      process.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 4<br>
      Enhanced Soy Bean Growth<br>
      <br>
      Two groups of common soy beans were divided into a test group and
      a control group, each with about 20 beans. The test group was
      irrigated with activated water produced in accordance with the
      description of the process herein. The control group was irrigated
      with regular, non-activated water. Except for the activation, the
      waters were otherwise equivalent. Similarly, equivalent methods
      and times of irrigation with the test waters were used for both
      groups of beans. All other factors related to the growth test were
      maintain equivalent during the course of the experiment. After 15
      days only 7 of the 20 control group beans had sprouted, and the
      average sprout length was about 4" (10 cm). In contrast, after the
      same period, 13 of the 20 test beans had sprouted, with a maximum
      sprout length of 9" (23 cm).<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 5<br>
      Enhanced Concrete Setting and Strength<br>
      <br>
      Comparative tests of concrete samples made with activated water
      and normal water were made by a construction industry consultant.
      Normal concrete compositions and mixing and setting procedures
      were used, with the exception of the substitution of the activated
      water in one half of the samples. One test showed that after 7
      days concrete made from the activated water had 11% higher
      compressive strength than the control, normal water concrete,
      while a subsequent 8 day test with other samples showed a 36%
      improvement in compressive strength in the activated sample.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 6<br>
      Bacterial Reduction in Contaminated Water<br>
      <br>
      Laboratory tests of bacteria-contaminated water showed that
      activation could reduce the level of harmful bacteria
      substantially. For instance, activation of contaminated rain water
      for 30 minutes in one test resulted in an 86% reduction in total
      and fecal coliforms in the water. In another test bacterial
      colonies in contaminated lake water were reduced by 44% after 15
      minutes of activation.<br>
      <br>
      EXAMPLE 7<br>
      Possible Physiological and Medical Effects<br>
      <br>
      Several tests involving subjects diagnosed as having various
      cancers provided anecdotal evidence that ingestion of activated
      water in place of regular water over a 1-2 month period by such
      subjects reduced the debilitating effects of the cancers on the
      subjects' general health. Similarly, a woman suffering from
      apparent early menopause was reported to have resumed regular
      menstrual function after a two-week regimen of ingestion of
      activated water in place of regular water.<br>
      <br>
      As noted, while applicant does not want to be bound to any
      specific mechanism, it is believed that the results found in
      experiments are consistent with a mechanism in which the activated
      water enhances the natural electromagnetic field of inorganic
      objects, which can be detected by Kirlian photography, and which
      is often referred to as the coronal discharge effect. The
      incorporation of the inorganic compounds and minerals in the
      polymeric matrix results in intensification of the effect by the
      resonance of the polymeric molecular chains to the visible
      (.lambda.=400-800 nm) light radiation at the 7.2-7.8 Hz
      frequencies while the polymer is in the high intensity magnetic
      field within the column 10.<br>
      <br>
      It will be evident from the above that there are other embodiments
      of the present invention which, while not expressly set forth
      above, are clearly within the scope and spirit of the invention.
      The disclosure above is therefore to be considered exemplary only,
      and the actual scope of the invention is to be determined solely
      by the appended claims.<br>

        <b>COMPOSITIONS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION
          EXPOSURE </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The present invention provides compositions for the protection
      against electromagnetic radiation. The compositions include a
      polymeric material including a polyamide such as nylon 6 or nylon
      6, 6, barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate. The polymeric material
      upon exposure to incident electromagnetic radiation emits subtle
      electromagnetic oscillations at probiotic frequencies that counter
      adverse effects of incident electromagnetic radiation. The
      polymeric material may be formed into a protective housing for
      electronic devices and may be formed into protective fabrics.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to compositions for the protection
      of living cells or organisms against electromagnetic radiation and
      more particularly to polymeric materials including a polyamide,
      barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate capable of preventing adverse
      effects associated with exposure to electromagnetic radiation and
      products formed therefrom.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) is a self-propagating wave in
      space with electric and magnetic components. These components
      oscillate at right angles to each other. EMR is classified into
      types according to the frequency of the wave: these types include,
      in order of increasing frequency, radio waves, microwaves,
      terahertz radiation, infrared radiation, visible light,
      ultraviolet radiation, X-rays and gamma rays.<br>
      <br>
      EMR is emitted by every operating electrical and electronic
      device. The power of EMR emission varies depending on the size and
      electrical strength of the device and the electrical current it
      carries or employs. High voltage power lines are significant
      emitters of EMR, and field strengths sufficiently high to have the
      potential for causing adverse EMR effects in humans, animals and
      plants. Effects can be detected hundreds of feet away. Smaller
      devices such as computers, television sets, microwave ovens and
      the like emit lesser quantities of EMR, but the effect on humans
      can still be significant because people are in much closer
      proximity to such devices.<br>
      <br>
      Electromagnetic radiation carries energy and momentum, which may
      be imparted when it interacts with matter. Thus once struck, the
      matter can be affected. While the effect may vary depending on
      frequency and amplitude, there are biological effects that can be
      modulated by exposure to electromagnetic radiation. Among the
      effects believed to be associated with exposure to electromagnetic
      radiation include the disruption of hydrogen bonding. Thus,
      exposure to such radiation may disrupt the natural hydrogen
      bonding of compounds or molecules. This also affects the hydrogen
      bonding of water molecules. Therefore there is a particular
      concern regarding the exposure of areas of the body that are
      highly fluid, such as within the brain or blood stream. Thus while
      the effects of electromagnetic radiation are not widely accepted
      by all, it is nonetheless the desire of many prudent people to
      protect themselves, their animals and plants against whatever
      health risks might be involved by their exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation. Adverse human health effects that have
      been reported as attributable to long-term electromagnetic
      radiation exposure include but are not limited to occurrence of
      certain cancers, multiple sclerosis and autism. Adverse effects on
      animals have including stillbirths of young and reduction of milk
      production in cattle have also been reported.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, effective and convenient devices for shielding
      against EMR are not generally available. Essentially the only
      defense against EMR has been removal of persons, animals and
      plants from proximity to the EMR-emitting devices. For major
      emitters such as power lines or electrical substations, this has
      usually meant that one has had to move to a different house or to
      a different job location away from the power line or substation,
      which commonly means substantial expense and inconvenience. The
      adverse costs and inconveniences are similar to farmers and
      ranchers who must move animals and crops to locations remote from
      the power lines or stations. For devices such as microwave ovens
      or computers, it has meant that a person must sit or stand at an
      awkward distance from the device, which can impair the person's
      ability to use the device in an optimum manner.<br>
      <br>
      The inventor of the present invention has proposed compositions
      for such protection in the past. U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,399 teaches
      compositions for the protection against electromagnetic radiation.
      The compositions include a material including an oxydated
      hydrocarbon emulsifier; a galvanic salt; an alkaloid; a dye or
      stain; and a polysaccharide. Although the compositions did
      demonstrate protection against electromagnetic radiation, the
      preparation of such a material was complex and therefore its
      widespread adoption was hindered. Thus there remains a need to
      develop compositions capable of protecting against electromagnetic
      radiation that are less complex and easier to adapt to a variety
      of uses.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention addresses the need to provide compositions
      for the protection against electromagnetic radiation and provides
      related benefits. Thus it is the primary object of the present
      invention to provide compositions that protect against adverse
      effects associated with exposure to electromagnetic radiation. It
      is another object of the present invention to provide housings or
      portions thereof for electronic devices that emit electromagnetic
      frequencies to reduce adverse effects associated with the use of
      such electronic devices. It is yet another object of the present
      invention to provide fabrics and protective garments capable of
      protecting against exposure to electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect of the present invention a polymeric material is
      provided to reduce adverse effects of electromagnetic radiation
      exposure. The polymeric material includes a polyamide such as
      nylon 6 or nylon 6, 6, barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate. The
      polymeric material upon exposure to incident electromagnetic
      radiation emits subtle electromagnetic oscillations at probiotic
      frequencies that counter or reduce adverse effects of incident
      electromagnetic radiation. The polymeric material may be used for
      the protection of humans, animals, plants, eukaryotic cells or
      organisms and the like. The polymeric material may be formed into
      a protective housing for electronic devices and may be formed into
      protective fabrics.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention, a housing for an
      electronic device that emits electromagnetic radiation is
      provided. The housing includes a polymeric material including a
      polyamide, barium sulfate, and magnesium sulfate in an amount
      suitable to reduce exposure to such radiation. The housing, upon
      exposure to incident electromagnetic radiation, emits subtle
      electromagnetic oscillations at probiotic frequencies that protect
      the user against incident electromagnetic radiation. In some
      embodiments the polyamide is nylon such as nylon 6 or nylon 6, 6.
      Examples of electronic devices that may benefit from the housing
      include wireless telephones, cordless telephones, audio players
      such as MP3 players and others, wireless headsets, headphones,
      computers, televisions and the like.<br>
      <br>
      In another aspect of the present invention a fabric or a
      protective garment constructed from fabric is provided to protect
      against exposure to electromagnetic radiation. The fabric includes
      a polymeric material including a polyamide, barium sulfate and
      magnesium sulfate. Fabrics of the present invention are believed
      to emit subtle electromagnetic oscillations at probiotic
      frequencies when exposed to incident electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      FIG. 1A depicts a pictorial image of EIS analysis of the brain and
      FIGS. 1B-1C depict the corresponding data tables from EIS testing
      of a representative subject after exposure to electromagnetic
      radiation from a cellular telephone placed in close proximity to
      the subject's right ear, with and without a polymeric material of
      the present invention. As can be viewed pictorially in FIG. 1A and
      by consideration of the data provided in FIGS. 1B-1C, in the
      control (without the polymeric material of the present invention),
      the subject's right frontal lobe showed abnormal values along with
      abnormal values from the left temporal lobe, hypothalamus, and
      left amygdala, and were pictorially displayed as yellow, which
      corresponds to elevated conductivity, viscosity or acute
      inflammation. However, positive effects were identified when using
      the polymeric material of the present invention in combination
      with the cellular telephone (labeled TREO-MRET) at the right
      temporal lobe and more significantly for the right frontal lobe.
      Additional positive effects were detected in blood pressure, blood
      viscosity, ATP values and mitochondrial activity, oxygen levels,
      and carbon dioxide levels when using the polymeric material of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 2A and 2B depict heat maps of a representative “phantom
      head” study, which detected the intensity and localization of
      electromagnetic radiation upon exposure from a cellular telephone
      incorporating a polymer with and without the polymeric material of
      the present invention. Thus, the “phantom head” study provides SAR
      testing of representative embodiments of the present invention.
      FIG. 2A displays results from exposing the “phantom head” to the
      control cellular telephone (no polymeric material included within
      the test polymer) and FIG. 2B displays results from exposing the
      “phantom head” to a cellular phone with a polymer including 1 gram
      of the polymeric material (referred to as MRET) As can be viewed
      in FIGS. 2A and 2B, the effect of incorporating 1 gram of the
      polymeric material on the “phantom head” showed that the “Hot
      Spots” remained in the same location as without the polymeric
      material; however, the amplitudes decreased in 80% of the data
      points. About 60% of the data points were observed to have a
      significant decrease in SAR values in the range of 10% to 50%.
      Thus, the incorporation of the polymeric material in the “phantom
      head” study demonstrated a reduction in the majority of SAR
      values. 12 SAR values out of 16 meaningful SAR values in this
      experiment were reduced in the range of 16.5%-32.6%, and only 3
      SAR values increased by 1.0%-5.6%.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As an introduction, the present invention provides polymeric
      materials and compositions formed therefrom to protect against
      exposure to electromagnetic radiation, such as electromagnetic
      frequencies emitted from electronic devices, power lines and the
      like. Compositions provided herein have been tested for their
      ability to protect against electromagnetic radiation by measuring
      a variety of biological indicators associated with brain chemistry
      in the interstitial fluid and have demonstrated the ability to
      reduce or counteract abnormal shifts identified upon exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation. In view of the present disclosure, one
      skilled in the art to which the present invention belongs will be
      able to provide a variety of protective housings, structures,
      fabrics and the like that provide as an element, a polymeric
      material including a polyamide in combination with barium sulfate
      and magnesium sulfate. Thus the polymeric compositions of the
      present invention can be adapted for use as a protective barrier
      against exposure to electromagnetic radiation; as protective
      housings or portions thereof for electronic devices that emit
      frequencies that adversely effect biological systems; and can be
      woven into fabrics for production of protective garments. The
      following description provides various preferred embodiments and
      uses for the polymeric material described herein. The various
      embodiments are intended to be nonlimiting since the polymeric
      materials may be varied or adapted for many protective uses.<br>
      <br>
      In one aspect of the present invention a polymeric material is
      provided to reduce adverse effects of electromagnetic radiation
      exposure. The polymeric material includes a polyamide such as
      nylon 6 or nylon 6, 6, barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate.
      Though nonlimiting, the polymeric material of the present
      invention is believed to emit subtle electromagnetic oscillations
      at probiotic frequencies that counter adverse effects of incident
      electromagnetic radiation. The polymeric material has been
      demonstrated as useful in reducing exposure to electromagnetic
      radiation and can be thus be provide to protect humans, animals,
      eukaryotic cells, plants and the like.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to the new combination of compounds and the beneficial
      results described herein, the present invention utilizes a
      polymeric material including a polyamide, barium sulfate and
      magnesium sulfate. The polymeric material is capable of reducing
      the effects of exposure from electronic devices and can be
      incorporated into a variety of housings, fabrics and protective
      structures. Though nonlimiting, the preferred polyamide is nylon-6
      or nylon-6, 6. In the preferred embodiment the ratio by weight of
      the polymeric material is about ten parts by weight polyamide,
      about two parts by weight barium sulfate, and about one part by
      weight magnesium sulfate. However other embodiments include
      variations on these ratios. In some embodiments, the amount of one
      or more of the compounds varies by about 10%. In another
      embodiment, the amount of one or more of the compounds varies by
      about 15%. In still other embodiments, the amount of one or more
      of the compounds varies by about 20%. Thus the ratios provided
      herein correspond to preferred embodiments found during
      development but are not intended to limit the scope of the present
      invention. One may determine the particular desired ratio by
      varying ratios of each compound, forming a protective structure
      such as a housing or fabric and testing the ability to protect
      against electromagnetic radiation. In some embodiments, electro
      interstitial scan (EIS) analysis can be used to test for
      protective properties. In alternative embodiments a “phantom head”
      or “phantom body” study may be used to assess affects against
      electromagnetic radiation.<br>

      The polyamide provides the primary polymer backbone to which the
      barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate interact or bind to form the
      polymeric material of the present invention. Polyamides are
      monomers of amides linked by peptide bonds. Although some
      polyamides occur naturally, such as those found in wool and silk,
      others are formed artificially. Polyamide polymers are frequently
      produced by condensation reactions between an amino group on one
      polymer and a carboxylic acid or acid chloride group on the
      opposing polymer. These reactions typically eliminate water,
      ammonia or hydrogen chloride thereby resulting in a polyamide
      chain. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
      polyamide provided in the polymeric material is a nylon. Nylons
      are some of the most common polymers used as synthetic fibers and
      thus compositions of the present invention may be provided as
      substitutions for nylons for the preparation of fibers if the
      protective features of the present invention are desired. Nylons
      are commonly used in the clothing industry and the plastics
      industry. Most preferably, the polyamide of the present invention
      is nylon 6, 6 or nylon 6.<br>
      <br>
      Nylon-6, 6, which is also referred to those skilled in the present
      art as polyamide 6-6 or PA66, is a semicrystalline polyamide
      commonly used in fiber applications such as carpeting, clothing
      and tire cord. It is also used as an engineering material in
      bearings and gears due to its good abrasion resistance and
      self-lubricating properties. Nylon-6, 6 includes repeating units
      of the formula C12H22O2N, has a molecular weight of about 226.32
      g/mol and can be formed by condensation reactions of a diamine and
      a dicarboxylic acid or acid chloride, such as hexamethylene
      diamine and adipoyl chloride, so that peptide bonds form at both
      ends of the monomers. The numerical indications within nylons
      indicate the number of carbons donated by the monomers; the
      diamine first and the diacid second. Thus nylon-6, 6, refers to
      the donation of 6 carbons from the diamine and 6 carbons from the
      diacid to form the polymer chain and is a repeating unit of
      alternating monomers, one after another. The polymer reaction is
      typically performed in an aqueous solvent.<br>
      <br>
      Nylon-6, also referred to as polyamide 6 or PA6, is a
      semicrystalline polyamide used most commonly in tire cord. Nylon-6
      has a lower melting temperature compared to nylon 6, 6 and in
      general is believed to have better affinity towards dyes, tends to
      be more elastic and tends to be more resistant to weathering. Thus
      in some instances one may prefer to use nylon-6 depending on the
      resulting material, housing, structure, fabric and the like. The
      determination of which to use is well within the ability of one
      skilled in the present art. Referring back to the compound,
      nylon-6 is repeating unit of C6H11ON with a molecular weight per
      unit of 113.16 g/mol. Nylon-6 is not a condensation polymer but
      instead is formed by a ring-opening polymerization reaction of the
      monomer caprolactam. Like nylon 6, 6, the technique for preparing
      nylon 6 is well known in the art. Nylon-6 was developed by DuPont
      and may be obtained from a variety of sources such as
      Sigma-Alderich (St. Louis, Mo.).<br>
      <br>
      Barium sulfate is often provided as a fine white powder and has
      the chemical formula BaSO4. Generally it is poorly soluble in
      water and other traditional solvents but is soluble in
      concentrated sulfuric acid. Barium sulfate is commercially
      available through a variety of vendors including Sigma-Aldrich
      (St. Louis, Mo.). The preferred ratio of barium sulfate to
      polyamide is 20 grams barium sulfate to 100 grams nylon 6 or nylon
      6, 6. The preferred embodiment is nonlimiting and thus more or
      less barium sulfate may also be used as long as protective
      properties are maintained. In one embodiment the ratio of barium
      sulfate to polyamide is about 20-25 grams of barium sulfate per
      100 grams of polyamide. In another embodiment the ratio of barium
      sulfate to polyamide is about 25-30 grams of barium sulfate per
      100 grams of polyamide. In another embodiment the ratio of barium
      sulfate to polyamide is about 15-20 grams per 100 grams of
      polyamide. In another embodiment the ratio of barium sulfate to
      polyamide is about 10-15 grams per 100 grams of polyamide. Thus
      the ratios are intended to provide various useful ranges, which
      may be considered by one skilled in the art for the particular
      use, and are intended to be nonlimiting.<br>
      <br>
      Magnesium sulfate is often provided as transparent crystals or a
      white powder and has the chemical formula MgSO4. It can also be
      found as a heptahydrate, MgSO4.7H2O. Magnesium sulfate is
      available through a variety of vendors including Sigma-Alderich
      (St. Louis, Mo.). The preferred ratio of magnesium sulfate to
      polyamide is 10 grams per 100 grams polyamide. In another
      embodiment the ratio of magnesium sulfate to polyamide is 10-15
      grams per 100 grams polyamide. In another embodiment the ratio of
      magnesium sulfate to polyamide is 15-20 grams per 100 grams
      polyamide. In another embodiment the ratio of magnesium sulfate to
      polyamide is 7-10 grams per 100 grams polyamide. In another
      embodiment the ratio of magnesium sulfate to polyamide is 3-7
      grams per 100 grams polyamide. Thus the ratios provided herein are
      useful as guidance for the formation of protective materials,
      housings, structures and fabrics but are intended as nonlimiting
      with respect to scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      Compositions according to the present invention are formed by
      preparing the protective polymeric material then casting, molding
      or manipulating the material to form the desired product. In
      general, the polyamide is formed into a polymer chain then the
      barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate are added to the chain. The
      polyamide polymer may be purchased as single monomers or polymers
      and may be polymerized using chemistries that correspond to the
      particular polyamide or desired polymer. In one example, a
      condensation reaction is used to form a polyamide including
      nylon-6, 6. In another example ring opening polymerization is
      performed using caprolactam to form a nylon-6 polymer. After
      forming a polymer backbone, conventional chemistries can be used
      to form ester linkages or covalent bonds between the polymer
      backbone and the barium sulfate or magnesium sulfate. Once
      combined and allowed to react, a polymer incorporating the
      polyamide, barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate is formed. The
      resulting polymeric material is viscous slurry, which can be
      further processed to form desired protective housings, structures,
      fabrics and the like. As a nonlimiting exemplary embodiment,
      formation of the polymeric material may include mixing magnesium
      sulfate, barium sulfate and the polyamide at ratios provided
      herein and adding the mixture to a compounding machine. The
      operation of compounding machines for the preparation of polymeric
      materials is well known to those skilled in the present art and is
      intended to be nonlimiting. The mixture is heated to melt the
      polyamide and to absorb or combine with the magnesium sulfate and
      barium sulfate. Temperatures may vary depending on the melting
      temperature of the polyamide and may be about 250 degrees C. The
      mixture can then be forced through holes for the production of
      thread-like materials which can be cooled and cut into desired
      sized threads, pieces, granules and the like. Once cut the product
      may be collected for desired applications. The polymeric material
      may be further processed or formed as desired.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to the magnesium sulfate and barium sulfate, the
      polymeric material may also include compounds that affect the
      characteristics of the resulting composition according to the
      desires of the user. In some embodiments, one or more dyes are
      added to enhance or alter the coloring of the composition. In
      other embodiments, fillers are added to increase or decrease the
      density of the resulting polymeric matrix. In still other
      embodiments, compositions are coated with a coating to enhance
      sheen or reflective properties.<br>
      <br>
      As will become apparent to one skilled in the art to which the
      present invention belongs, the polymeric materials of the present
      invention may be cast or molded to form a variety of shapes and
      therefore a variety of protective housings. Thus it is another
      aspect of the present invention to provide a housing for an
      electronic device that is capable of protecting a user against
      electromagnetic radiation emitted from the electronic device. The
      housing includes a polyamide, such as nylon 6 or nylon 6, 6;
      barium sulfate; and magnesium sulfate. It is believe that the
      housing upon exposure to incident electromagnetic radiation emits
      subtle electromagnetic oscillations at probiotic frequencies that
      protect the user against the incident electromagnetic radiation.
      Casting and molding techniques are well are known in the plastic
      and polymer arts and are incorporated herein. Thus although the
      present invention provides increased protection against
      electromagnetic radiation, features such as viscosity and molding
      characteristics remain largely unchanged allowing conventional
      casting and molding techniques to be utilized. As with many
      nylons, the polymeric material of the present invention may also
      be provided as fibers or in a fibrous configuration for the
      preparation or weaving of protective fabrics. Thus one skilled in
      the art would readily acknowledge the present invention is not
      limited by a composition's size or configuration as the polymeric
      material may be formed in any suitable size or shape using known
      casting or molding techniques.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric material of the present invention has particular
      utility as a protective housing for electronic devices. Many
      electronic devices emit electronic radiation. Thus in some
      preferred embodiments of the present invention the polymeric
      material is formed into a rigid housing to house an electronic
      device. It is believed that by encasing the electronics in a
      housing according to the present invention, the effect of
      frequencies generated by such devices on humans, plants and the
      like will be minimized. It is believed that the frequencies
      emitted from the electronic device will act as a carrier allowing
      the delivery of the subtle low frequencies emitted from the
      polymeric material to occur in combination with the harmful
      frequencies generated from the electrical device. Thus by
      delivering the protective frequency in combination with the
      harmful frequency, the overall effect from the electrical device
      is reduced or minimized. In some embodiments the polymeric
      material does not make up the entire housing but instead only a
      portion of the housing. In these embodiments, the polymeric
      material may be used in the front, back, top, bottom, side or any
      portion thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The examples demonstrate beneficial features of the present
      invention as a protective housing. More specifically, the examples
      describe experiments conducted where harmful effects were reduced
      or minimized by adapting an electronic device such as a cellular
      telephone with a polymeric material according to the present
      invention. The examples also demonstrate the ordinary use of
      traditionally housed cellular telephones effect the chemistry in
      the brain. Particular abnormal activity was found in the frontal
      and temporal lobes. In addition, abnormal shifts in minerals and
      hormones were also observed. However, when the housing was adapted
      with a polymeric material according to the present invention,
      activity in the frontal and temporal lobe was deemed normal or
      more normal than without. Also, the abnormal shifts identified in
      minerals and hormones were not observed when using a housing
      according to the present invention. Thus, the studies demonstrate
      through EIS analysis, that a polymeric material including a
      polyamide, barium sulfate and magenesium sulfate is effective at
      protecting humans against electromagnetic radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Housings of the present invention are not limited to cellular
      telephones but instead are intended for use with a variety of
      electronic devices that emit EMR, The polymeric material of the
      present invention may be formed into a housing or portion thereof
      for a number of household appliances including refrigerators,
      microwaves, blenders, coffeemakers, food processors and the like.
      Moreover the housings may be used for entertainment devices such
      as televisions, stereos, portable audio players such as MP3
      players, and computers. Housings of the present invention may also
      be used for electronic devices such as telephones, cordless
      telephones, headphones, wireless headphones and the like. Thus any
      electrical device that emits a frequency similar to any of the
      devices provided herein may be adapted with a housing according to
      the present invention. In some embodiments, the housing of the
      present invention is provided to protect against frequencies in
      the MHz range. In other embodiments, housings according to the
      present invention are provided to protect against frequencies in
      the GHz range. If testing is desired, electro interstitial
      scanning is one method that may be used to detect changes in
      biological state after exposure to the electronic device with and
      without the protective housing. Another method is to test the
      protective capabilities using a “phantom head” or “phantom body”
      that mimics the conductivity or dielectric constant of the exposed
      region.<br>
      <br>
      The polymeric material of the present invention also provides a
      particular utility as a fabric in preparation of protective
      garments and the like. If exposed to electromagnetic radiation,
      the protective garment may help reduce or minimize adverse effects
      associated with exposure. Examples of particular garments are any
      known in the art and may include hats, jackets, shirts or blouses,
      pants, gloves, boots or shoes and the like. The garments may have
      particular utility in industries where electronic device
      manufacturing or testing occurs. It is therefore another aspect of
      the present invention to provide a fabric for the protection of a
      user against exposure to electromagnetic radiation. The fabric
      includes a polyamide, such as nylon-6 or nylon-6, 6; barium
      sulfate; and magnesium sulfate. The fabrics provided herein, upon
      exposure to incident electromagnetic radiation are believed to
      emit subtle electromagnetic oscillations at probiotic frequencies
      that protect the user against the incident electromagnetic
      radiation. Since the present invention retains many of the
      characteristics as conventional nylons, the methods used to form
      fibers and fabrics from nylons may also be used with the present
      invention. In particular the methods of forming fibers and fabrics
      from nylon-6, 6 and nylon-6 can be used with the present
      invention. As general guidance, once the polymer material
      including the polyamide, barium sulfate and magnesium sulfate is
      formed, the material may be extruded into fibers through pores,
      such as those provide in an industrial spinneret. During extrusion
      the individual polymer chains tend to align because of viscous
      flow. If subjected to cold drawing afterwards, the fibers align
      further, increasing their crystallinity, and the material acquires
      additional tensile strength. In practice, fibers incorporating the
      polymeric material of the present invention for fabrics are most
      likely to be drawn using heated rolls at high speeds. The
      resulting fibers may then be woven into fabric and thus used the
      preparation of garments having protective features.<br>
      <br>
      The preferred embodiments have described a variety of compositions
      useful for the protection against electromagnetic radiation.
      Though nonlimiting, the polymeric material of the present
      invention is believed to oscillate upon incident radiation. The
      oscillation is believed to generate a subtle, low frequency,
      non-coherent electromagnetic field (random field) that can affect
      the hydrogen lattice of the molecular structure of water and thus
      modify the electrodynamic properties of water. The low frequency
      oscillation is of a frequency lower than the incident radiation.
      It is believed these low frequency oscillations emitted from the
      polymeric material can be carried by higher frequencies generated
      by electronic devices, without adverse interaction and thus can be
      delivered in combination with the harmful frequency for desired
      protection.<br>
      <br>
      The biological effect of exposure to electromagnetic radiation is
      not fully understood however it is believed the electromagnetic
      radiation affects the water molecules and hydrogen bonds within
      the body. It is believed the oscillations generated by the
      compositions of the present invention protect against such effect
      by causing the reorganization of the water clathrate structures.
      This reorganization is believed to be beneficial and help prevent
      adverse reactions from exposure to the higher frequencies emitted
      from electronic devices.<br>
      <br>
      It will be evident to one skilled in the art that there are
      numerous embodiments of the present invention that are not
      expressly described herein, but which are clearly within the scope
      and spirit of the invention. The description is provided to
      demonstrate a variety of preferred embodiments only.<br>

      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Electro Interstitial Scan (EIS) Comparison Between Exposure
        to Commercially Available Cellular Telephone (RF Phone) and
        Cellular Telephone with MRET Housing Among Human Subjects</b><br>
      <br>
      EIS analysis was conducted at an independent testing facility to
      assess the biological effects of electromagnetic radiation from a
      cellular telephone on the human body and whether effects would
      differ if using a cellular telephone housed in a polymeric
      material of the present invention (herein referred to as MRET). In
      summary it was found that exposure to the cellular telephone
      without MRET caused significant shifts in brain chemistry within
      the right frontal and temporal lobe; whereas exposure to the
      cellular telephone with MRET did not show the adverse shifts. A
      representative example is provided as FIGS. 1A-1C. In addition
      levels of insulin, ACTH and TSH were also believed to be adversely
      effected after exposure to the cellular telephone without MRET.
      The adverse shifts in brain chemistry due to the exposure to the
      cellular telephone worsened over time. Although initial effects
      were difficult to detect, after 20 minutes from halting exposure,
      the biological effects continued to deteriorate, which suggest the
      effects from cellular phone usage continue beyond the initial
      exposure. The majority of the deleterious effects were lessened or
      mediated after use with the cellular telephone using MRET
      suggesting MRET plays an important role in preventing or
      correcting adverse effects from exposure to electromagnetic
      radiation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and Methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The experiments detected changes in brain chemistry using Eletro
      Interstitial Scanning (EIS). Subjects were scanned at four time
      points. The first scan was conducted before any exposure. The
      second scan was conducted after 5 minutes of exposure to a TREO
      650 cellular telephone (referred to herein as TREO RF) which
      operates at frequencies of about 1851.25-1908.75 MHz (PCS and CDMA
      frequencies). The TREO RF was placed next to the individual's
      right ear. The subject was then scanned after waiting 20 minutes.
      A TREO 650 cellular telephone adapted with a housing including the
      polymeric material of the present invention (referred to as
      TREO-MRET) was then used. The last scan occurred after 20 minutes
      of exposure to TREO 650 MRET.<br>
      <br>
      EIS gives a comprehensive overview of the reactions of the body.
      3D models of the full body and various different parts of the body
      are created based on the electro interstitial gram (EIG). The
      models are color coded to indicate where areas of imbalance are
      hyper-functioning or hypo-functioning. In essence, EIS provides a
      functional assessment of the main organs, with report screens that
      show interstitial biochemical values and an evaluation of body
      composition including lean mass, fat mass and hydration data.
      Measurements are further extrapolated to provide report screens
      with hormone, electrolyte, neurotransmitter and oxidative stress
      analyses. More specifically, the EIS system operates as a
      biosensor, which analyzes the interstitial fluid locally in vivo
      by application of a D.C. current between cutaneous zones using
      electrodes. In use, the EIS introduces electric signals of low
      intensity (1.28V D.C.) through the human body via 6 electrodes.
      This is painless and has no negative effects to the patient. About
      22 measurements are taken. The scanning results are recorded by
      EIS software, which analyzes and interprets the test results and
      produces a variety of informative models, graphs and data for
      interpretation by a medical practitioner.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results from Subject 1: 42 yr Old Female</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Initial EIS showed reduced conductivity (hypo-activity) in the
      right and left frontal lobes, intra-cranial vessels and right
      temporal lobe before exposure. This was believed to be
      stress-related. Thus the effect of 5 minute exposure to the TREO
      RF was initially not conclusive. Further analysis showed
      endogenous chatecholamines sharply decreased after exposure to
      TREO RF, which corresponds to low adrenal medullary hormone and
      thus TREO RF appears to adversely affect neurotransmitter
      activity. Dopamine levels after TREO RF also dropped.<br>
      <br>
      Despite abnormal values for frontal lobes, temporal lobes,
      intra-cranial vessels and amygdalas from measurements taken after
      20 minutes from the earlier scan, positive effects after TREO-MRET
      exposure included: decreased cranial blood pressure; decreased
      cranial blood viscosity, decreased carbon dioxide levels, and
      decreased intra-cranial blood pressure. The values, which were
      statistically below the norm for the general population, were
      deemed positive in proportion to the subject's low values overall.
      An increase in phosphorous and a decrease in calcium was detected
      suggesting mineral balance may be slightly affected by the
      TREO-MRET however no shift in hormone levels was identified.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results from Subject 2: 48 yr Old Female</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The initial scan showed reduced oxygen levels and increased carbon
      dioxide levels believed to be associated with a fast paced
      lifestyle. Immediately after exposure to TREO RF, reductions in
      elevated values for the frontal lobe were identified. Blood
      pressure, H2O content, and ATP levels were adversely increased in
      the right temporal lobe. These adverse effects are believed to be
      associated with exposure to TREO RF.<br>
      <br>
      After waiting 20 minutes and before exposure to TREO-MRET, EIS
      showed significant abnormal values in the right temporal lobe,
      left temporal lobe, hypothalamus and left amygdala. Abnormal
      values in insulin, ACTH and TSH were also identified. In addition,
      measurements of the vertebral column suggesting nerve supply
      worsened. It is believed the negative effects associated with TREO
      RF continued over time.<br>
      <br>
      After exposure to the TREO-MRET, positive effects were identified
      for blood pressure, blood viscosity, ATP values and mitochondrial
      activity, oxygen levels and carbon dioxide levels. In addition,
      positive effects were detected in values of insulin, ACTH,
      cortisol, thyroid hormone and TSH. Improvement in the vertebrae
      was also identified.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results from Subject 3: 42 yr Old Male</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The initial scan showed abnormal levels in the right frontal lobe
      prior to testing. In addition, elevated intra-cranial blood
      pressure and hyperactivity of the temporal lobes was also shown.
      Because of the initial heightened values it was difficult to
      assess whether some of the changes in brain chemistry immediately
      after 5 minute exposure to the TREO RF occurred.<br>
      <br>
      After waiting 20 minutes and before exposure to TREO-MRET, EIS
      showed abnormal values in potassium, ACTH, insulin and cortisol.
      Abnormally high values were observed for dopamine. Abnormally low
      values were observed for catecholamine and serotonin. After
      exposure to TREO-MRET, insulin levels were improved but still
      below normal. Levels of cellular potassium, ACTH, catecholamine,
      dopamine and serotinin were normal after exposure to TREO-MRET.<br>

      The present example demonstrates the ability of the polymeric
      material of the present invention to reduce the effects of
      electromagnetic radiation on a “phantom head,” which mimics the
      human head muscle and brain tissue composition. The intensity and
      localization of electromagnetic intensity was measured. The
      results showed a significant decrease in electromagnetic radiation
      intensity but no significant shift in localization indicating the
      polymeric material successfully reduces potential harmful effects
      on brain chemistry due to electromagnetic exposure. The study was
      performed using a variety of wireless mobile phones and is
      described in more detail below.<br>

      To assess the protective effects of using the polymeric material
      of the present invention against exposure to radiation, a “phantom
      head” was formed to mimic the brain and muscle composition within
      the head. The “phantom head” was produced using a combination of
      hydroxyethylcellulose (FEC) gelling agent and saline solution. The
      mixture was calibrated to obtain proper dielectric constant
      (permittivity) and conductivity of the simulated tissue. The
      dielectric constant at about 835 MHz was about 40 and at about
      1900 MHz, was about 39. The conductivity at about 835 MHz was
      about 0.88 mho/m, and the conductivity at about 1900 MHz was about
      1.43 mho/m. An APREL Laboratories ALSAS system with a dosimetric
      E-field probe E-020 was used for measurements. The dipole was
      oriented parallel to the body axis. The investigation was
      conducted on cellular phones including Sanyo Model PM-8200(S),
      Kyocera Wireless Model 2325 and LG Model VX6000.<br>
      <br>
      Wireless mobile phones were evaluated in this experiment for
      localized specific absorption rate (SAR) for controlled
      environment/occupational exposure limits specified in ANSI/EEE
      Std. C95.1-1992 and had been tested in accordance with the
      measurement procedures specified in IEEE 1528-2003 and OET
      Bulletin 65. The RF phone was placed into simulated transmit mode
      using the manufacturer's test codes. Such test signals offer a
      consistent means for SAR and are recommended for evaluating of SAR
      data. Each SAR measurement was taken with a fully charged battery.
      In order to verify that each phone was tested at full power,
      conducted output power measurements were performed before and
      after each SAR test to confirm the output power. SAR measurement
      results were obtained, analyzed and compared to provide the
      scientific conclusion of the experiment.<br>
      <br>
      The protective polymers were prepared with and without the
      polymeric material according to the present invention. In the
      experimental polymer, about 1 gram of polymeric material was used
      (referred to as MRET polymeric material), whereas the control
      contained no MRET polymeric material. The resulting polymers were
      placed in an exposed jack then positioned next to the phantom head
      for measurement. Control and the experimental conditions were
      compared to determine differences in electromagnetic radiation
      intensity and localization of signal. The results were displayed
      as a heat map, which demonstrates the positioning and intensity of
      signal as hot spots and cool spots.<br>
      <br>
      Referring to FIGS. 2A and 2B, the analysis of “Hot Spot” Area Scan
      data provides evidence that the incorporation of 1 gram of MRET
      polymeric material in the protective polymer for the RF phones
      affects the amplitude of emission but does not change location of
      the “Hot Spot”. More specifically, the incorporation of 1 gram of
      MRET polymeric material protected the “phantom head” against the
      intensity of the electromagnetic radiation, while showing that the
      signal remained in substantially the same location as without the
      MRET polymeric material. Thus intensity was largely affected,
      whereas localization was not. The intensity of electromagnetic
      radiation when incorporating the MRET polymeric material decreased
      the amplitude in 80% of the data points. 60% of the data points
      were observed to have a significant decrease in SAR values in the
      range of 10% to 50%. Thus the incorporation of the MRET polymeric
      material in the “phantom head” leads to the reduction of the
      majority of SAR values. 12 SAR values out of 16 meaningful SAR
      values in this experiment were reduced in the range of
      16.5%-32.6%, and only 3 SAR values increased by 1.0%-5.6%.<br>
