        <p><b>Mark Roberts/The Advance</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>September 2nd 2008 </p>
      <p>The Queens Co. inventor of an emissions free engine – depending
        on the fuel source - has been negotiating with an
        out-of-province investment group to keep his technology in
        Nova&nbsp; Scotia. </p>
      <p>Sheldon Robar says, “We finally passed one of the many hurdles
        of the negotiations. Nova Scotia comes first. This is where I
        want to start and after five weeks, they reluctantly agreed. The
        good part is one guy in that group understands the
        thermodynamics of refrigerants. He understands it (technology)
        will work, which you can’t read out of a book because this book
        hasn’t been written yet. </p>
      <p>One reason Robar says he is remaining loyal to the province is
        he is happy at this point with the response of the
        Progressive-Conservative government. </p>
      <p>“We’re waiting for a meeting with the Energy Minister (Richard
        Hurlburt), which we feel confident will occur through (Human
        Resources Minister) Carolyn Bolivar Getson’s office.” He adds
        Bolivar-Getson has been helpful as well. </p>
      <p>Robar has spent over 27 years developing an engine that relies
        on a heated refrigerant propellant that’s ozone friendly. The
        closed loop system releases no emissions and requires extremely
        low heat temperatures for vapourization to occur and expand to
        generate the force needed to move a vehicle, generator and many
        other forms of machinery. Utilizing waste heat, as one example,
        is a potentially huge market, Robar says. </p>
      <p>He says he spurned other offers because of the thermodynamics
        expert mentioned above. Because of business negotiations, The
        Advance-confirmed investment group must remain anonymous, as
        usually occurs. </p>
      <p>Robar adds it hasn’t hurt that a former version of the
        technology has been patented at the United States Patent Office.
      </p>
      <p>The expert actually received a physical copy of a spring The
        Queens County Advance in which an article appeared about the
        invention, understood the potential and contacted Robar. </p>
      <p>Representing the group, he, and possibly others, is visiting
        Nova Scotia early this month to work on the business details. </p>
      <p>Robar says, “The article sparked his interest. He said he
        ‘always knew it could be done;’ he just didn’t know how to do
        it.” </p>
      <p>Since the article, Robar has also talked to at least two
        government-funded agencies. </p>
      <p>“They’ve only been an hindrance, which didn’t discourage me at
        all. It took 27 years to build this; I’m not about to quit in 27
        months.” </p>
      <p>Now, however, he says, “We’ve got a formidable task ahead of
        us. There are a lot of regulations and guidelines in place and
        we want to abide by them.” </p>
      <p>He is hoping a board of directors will be formed by the end of
        the month. </p>
      <p>After three decades, people would expect the inventor to be
        excited by this news but he appears to be calm about his dream.
      </p>
      <p>“When we pound this through and see it on the market, then I’ll
        be excited. The biggest thing is I stuck to my guns. It’s my
        feeling Nova Scotia needs this more than any other province
        because so much is coal fired.” </p>
      <p>He adds he is proud to be taking action --- instead of just
        talking about it --- that is expected to help both the
        environment and economy at the same time. </p>
      <p>Information about timelines, jobs and other business details
        will be released in the future, he says. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> An engine system using refrigerant fluid is
        capable of utilizing the heat produced by an external
        high-efficiency hydrocarbon fuel combustion process. The heat
        from that process is utilized to transform the refrigerant fluid
        from a liquid state to a gaseous state in a cycle which includes
        extracting work from the fluid in the gaseous state in a
        high-compression-ratio piston engine. The cycle further includes
        transforming the fluid in the gaseous state back to the liquid
        state in a condenser, and then feeding that fluid under pressure
        to a heating chamber where the combustion process heat again
        returns it to the gaseous state at high pressure and
        temperature. The engine system has a higher efficiency than
        hydrocarbon fuel combustion engines, and has particular
        application to use in automobiles. One preferred refrigerant
        fluid for this engine system is
        2,2,Dichloro-1,1,1,Trifluoro-Ethane. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an engine system, and more
        particularly, to an engine system that utilizes a refrigerant
        fluid as a working fluid. </p>
      <p>Two drawbacks of conventional internal combustion engines are
        their inefficiency in utilizing increasingly-scarce hydrocarbon
        fuels and their creation of airborne pollutents. These factors
        are related in that an internal combustion engine, no matter how
        finely tuned, cannot fully utilize the combustion process.
        Rather, such an engine expels undesirable high-temperature
        combustion products, such as nitrogen oxides (NO.sub.x), carbon
        monoxide (CO), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). If an engine
        system could be developed that more fully utilized hydrocarbon
        fuels, such a system would have the twin advantages of taking
        more energy from the fuels while creating more acceptable
        byproducts. </p>
      <p>The engine system of the invention produces these advantages by
        utilizing a refrigerant fluid, i.e. a fluid of the type normally
        utilized with refrigeration equipment, as a working fluid. A
        hydrocarbon fuel or other heat source, utilized in a
        high-efficiency combustion process, provides heat to a heating
        chamber into which the working fluid is directed. The working
        fluid is there transformed from a liquid phase to a gaseous
        phase. The gaseous working fluid is then directed to a
        two-stroke engine having a high-compression ratio; in some cases
        it may be possible to utilize a conventional diesel engine. As a
        portion of the pistons of the engine are driven downward by the
        pressure of working fluid that has entered through synchronized
        inlet valve means, the other pistons expel working fluid through
        synchronized outlet valve means. The working fluid, then at a
        reduced pressure, is directed to a condenser where it is
        returned to the liquid state by removal of heat. From the
        condenser the working fluid is ready to be pumped once again to
        the heating chamber. The efficiency of this engine system is
        estimated to be at least twice that of conventional
        hydrocarbon-fuel internal combustion engine systems. </p>
      <p>In one form, the invention is an engine system that is adapted
        to employ a refrigerant fluid as a working fluid and comprises a
        condenser, a pump, a heating chamber, a heat source, and a
        two-stroke high-compression-ratio piston engine. The condenser
        removes heat from the working fluid such that the fluid is
        transformed from a gaseous state to a liquid state. The working
        fluid in the liquid state is pumped by the pump from the
        condenser to the heating chamber. The heat source supplies heat
        to the heating chamber such that the working fluid is
        transformed from the liquid state to the gaseous state. </p>
      <p>The working fluid in the gaseous state drives a
        high-compression-ratio piston engine having reciprocating
        pistons connected to a rotatable crankshaft. The crankshaft has
        a series of journals each connected by a respective connecting
        rod to a respective one of the pistons. Each piston is housed in
        a cylinder having a working fluid inlet valve means and a
        working fluid outlet valve means, the total of the inlet valve
        means controlling flow of the working fluid to the engine from
        the heating chamber, and the total of the outlet valve means
        controlling the flow of the working fluid to the condenser from
        the engine. The rotation of the crankshaft determines the
        opening and closing of each of the inlet and outlet valve means.
        Each inlet valve means is open between approximately one-quarter
        and approximately one-half of the downward motion of the
        associated piston, and each outlet valve is open for
        substantially all of the upward motion of the associated piston.
      </p>
      <p>The engine may be a two-stroke engine with an even number of
        cylinders. The crankshaft may have a series of journals arranged
        in pairs such that one of each pair extends in a direction
        angularly-opposed on the crankshaft from the other of that pair.
        Each pair of journals may occupy a respective one of a series of
        planes that together divide a circle normal to and centred on
        the crankshaft into a set of equiangular segments.
        Alternatively, all of the pairs of journals may occupy the same
        plane through the axis of the crankshaft; in this arrangement,
        as half of the pistons are moving through top-dead-center (TDC)
        the other half of the pistons are moving through
        bottom-dead-center (BDC). </p>
      <p>It is also possible for the engine to be a two-stroke engine
        having an odd number of cylinders, although such engines are
        more difficult to build and balance than are engines with even
        numbers of cylinders. </p>
      <p>The engine system may have a compression ratio of between
        approximately 12-to-1 and approximately 15-to-1. The pump may be
        driven by the piston engine, and may also have a throttle
        assembly for controlling the quantity of working fluid flowing
        to the piston engine from the heating chamber. If the engine
        system is installed into an automobile, the condenser may be a
        fan-cooled radiator and the piston engine may have at least four
        cylinders. The heating chamber may be one chamber of a heat
        exchanger having two chambers each on an opposite side of a heat
        conductive wall, combustion gases produced by the heat source
        being passed through the other chamber. The heat source may
        include a propane, gasoline or natural gas storage tank and an
        associated burner element. The engine system may further
        comprise a starter engine connectable to the crankshaft of the
        piston engine and powered by an electrical power storage means.
      </p>
      <p>The pressure of the working fluid between the pump and the
        heating chamber and between the heating chamber and the piston
        engine may have a value between approximately 300 p.s.i.g.
        (pounds per square inch gauge) and approximately 800 p.s.i.g.
        The pressure of the working fluid between the piston engine and
        the condenser may have a value between approximately 0 p.s.i.g.
        and 50 p.s.i.g. </p>
      <p>The engine system may further comprise a centrifugal
        advancement mechanism for advancing the opening and closing of
        each of the inlet and outlet valve means relative to the
        rotation of the crankshaft. The mechanism comprises a shaft
        connected to rotate with the crankshaft, a concentric cylinder
        mounted to surround the shaft, and a pair of arms mounted on the
        cylinder such that each arm extends diametrically opposite the
        other on the cylinder. The concentric cylinder is connected to a
        camshaft that determines the opening and closing of the each of
        the inlet and outlet valve means. Each arm is pivotally mounted
        on the cylinder such that a larger end of each arm moves
        outwardly on the cylinder against bias with increasing
        rotational speed of the cylinder. A second smaller end of each
        arm has a portion extending generally radially inwardly into the
        shaft. An increase in the rotational speed of the shaft results
        in a rotation of the arms which in turn results in the
        concentric cylinder rotating slightly relative to the shaft to
        advance the opening and closing of the inlet and outlet valve
        means relative to the rotation of the crankshaft. </p>

      </p>
      <p>With initial reference to FIG. 1, a liquid rerefrigerant fluid
        11 sits in the bottom of a condenser 12. The liquid refrigerant
        fluid utilized in this embodiment is the commercially-available
        product known as "FREON 114", although other refrigerant fluids
        with better thermodynamic characteristics are presently under
        development for use in this process. An emergency relief valve
        13 is fixed to condenser 12; it will only open if the pressure
        in condenser 12 should exceed a very high limit such as 1000
        pounds per square inch (p.s.i.g.) due to a fire or similar
        cause. Condenser 12 may be air-cooled or liquid-cooled and could
        take the form, for instance, of the air-cooled radiator that is
        found in most automobiles. A pump 14 draws fluid 11 from
        condenser 12 and increases the pressure on that fluid to
        approximately 600 p.s.i.g. in a conduit 15, that . pressure
        being controlled by pressure relief valve 16, which opens to
        allow excess fluid 11 in conduit 15 to return to condenser 12.
        For an effective engine system, the pressure downstream of pump
        14 could be set as low as approximately 300 p.s.i.g. or as high
        as approximately 800 p.s.i.g. The value chosen depends on the
        strength of the materials employed in constructing the engine
        system and on the performance required from the system. </p>
      <p>The flow of fluid 11 out of conduit 15 is also controlled by a
        pressure control valve 17 which meters the amount of fluid 11
        passing through an injector 18 into an annular combustion
        chamber 20. Heat is transferred to chamber 20 from the
        combustion of propane fuel stored in tank 21 by means of a
        burner element 22; it is possible to alternately use other
        fuels, such as natural gas, gasoline, oil or other hydrocarbon
        fuels. The heat is applied to combustion chamber 20 until the
        temperature of the fluid 11 in chamber 20 is approximately 300
        degrees Fahrenheit. As with the pressure values selected, this
        temperature value is selected for purposes of the preferred
        embodiment; a greater or lesser value could be selected. A heat
        sensor 24 senses the temperature in chamber 20 and provides a
        controlling feedback signal to burner element 22. Burner element
        22 is anticipated to be a complete-combustion
        very-high-efficiency unit of the type commonly now being
        installed in home heating furnaces. </p>
      <p>When pressure control valve 17 is opened, liquid refrigerant
        fluid 11 is injected through injector 18 into combustion chamber
        20 at the 600 p.s.i.g. pressure in conduit 15. As fluid 11 comes
        into contact with the heated chamber 20, it is transformed from
        the liquid phase into the gaseous phase. A pressure sensor 26
        senses the pressure in chamber 20 and provides a controlling
        feedback signal to pressure control valve 17 to limit the
        pressure in chamber 20 to approximately 500 p.s.i.g. A pressure
        as high as 800 p.s.i.g. might be selected if appropriately
        strong materials were utilized for chamber 20. </p>
      <p>To start a two-stroke high-compression-ratio engine generally
        designated as 30 in FIG. 1, a pressure control valve 31 is
        slowly opened. Control valve 31 could be a throttle assembly as
        shown in FIG. 3, the operation of which will be subsequently
        described. Engine 30 of the preferred embodiment has an even
        number of cylinders 31, each having a piston 33 with rings 34
        connected by means of a connecting rod 35 to a crankshaft 36. An
        engine with an odd number of cylinders could also be
        implemented; however, such an engine would be more complex
        because of the careful balancing required. In the preferred
        embodiment of the engine 30, the journals are arranged in pairs,
        one member of each pair extending in a direction
        angularly-opposed on crankshaft 36 from the other member of the
        pair. Each pair of journals occupy a respective one of a series
        of planes that divide a circle normal to and centred on the
        crankshaft into a set of equiangular segments. For instance, in
        a four-cylinder engine the journals extend at 90-degree
        intervals, whereas in a six-cylinder engine the journals extend
        at 60-degree intervals, etc. A crankshaft associated with a
        six-cylinder engine using this arrangement is shown in FIG. 4A.
        It is also possible, although less preferred, to place all of
        the journals of crankshaft 36 into a single plane, such that
        half of the journals of crankshaft 36 are positioned
        angularly-opposite the other half of the journals relative to
        the axis of rotation of crankshaft 36. A crankshaft associated
        with a six-cylinder engine having this arrangement is shown in
        FIG. 4B. With this arrangement, when half of the pistons 33 in
        engine 30 are at top dead center, the other half of the pistons
        33 are at bottom dead center. For purposes of more even power
        distribution, an engine having the staggered journal position
        illustrated by FIG. 4A is preferred. </p>
      <p>Associated with each cylinder 31 is an inlet valve 38 and an
        outlet valve 39, as shown in FIGS. 1, 2A and 2B. The opening and
        closing of the valves 38 and 39 is controlled by a cam member
        (not shown) that is connected to crankshaft 36 through a
        centrifugal advancement mechanism which is illustrated in FIG. 5
        and described more fully subsequently. The opening and closing
        of engine inlet and outlet valves by means of cam member
        rotation is assumed to be known to those skilled in the art of
        engine construction and is not further described. </p>
      <p>As the gaseous refrigerant fluid 11 (at 500 p.s.i. g. in this
        embodiment) enters those cylinders 31 that have their inlet
        valves 38 open, fluid 11 creates a downward pressure on the
        pistons 33 in those cylinders. Each inlet valve 38 is connected
        to a cam member on the crankshaft such that it remains in the
        open state during the time that the respective piston 33 moves
        from a few degrees past top dead center (TDC) to a value between
        approximately one-quarter and approximately one-half of the
        downward motion of the associated piston. Experimentation has
        found that acceptable engine performance is obtained over a
        range extending from approximately 30 degrees past TDC to
        approximately 120. degrees past TDC. As each piston 33 moves
        past BDC the outlet valve 39 on its respective cylinder 31 opens
        (due to cam member position at that time). Because the engine
        utilized in this system is a high-compression-ratio engine
        having a compression ratio of at least 12-to-1, the pressure of
        refrigerant fluid 11 at the point at which outlet valve 39 opens
        has been reduced to a value between approximately 0 p.s.i.g. and
        50 p.s.i.g. due to the downward motion of the piston 33. The
        actual value of the pressure of fluid 11 in cylinders 31 at BDC
        depends upon the ambient temperature of the air surrounding the
        engine system and the type of refrigerant gas used. For each
        piston 33 that is commencing its upward motion in its respective
        cylinder, another piston 33 is commencing its downward motion in
        its respective cylinder (the two pistons being angularly-opposed
        on crankshaft 36). The cam member is shaped such that the outlet
        valves 39 remain open for expulsion of the refrigerant fluid 11
        during approximately the whole upward motion of each piston 33,
        i.e. from the time the piston 33 passes through BDC to almost
        the time it passes through TDC. To avoid contact between a
        piston 33 and an inlet valve 38 or an outlet valve 39 as the
        piston passes through TDC, the valves are either recessed into
        the head of the engine or the face of each piston is shaped to
        accommodate the valves. FIGS. 2A and 2B illustrate the downward
        and upward motion of the pistons 33, respectively, and the
        relative position of inlet valves 38 and outlet valves 39. </p>
      <p>From the outlet valves 39, the `spent` refrigerant fluid 11
        moves at a pressure of between 0 p.s.i.g. and 50 p.s i.g. and a
        temperature of approximately 90 degrees Fahrenheit through an
        exhaust conduit 40 to the condenser 12. In condenser 12 heat is
        removed from fluid 11 through air-cooling or other means, and
        fluid 11 is transformed from the gaseous state into the liquid
        state. Fluid 11 then repeats its working cycle. Conduit 41
        provides flow communication between the inside of crankcase 42
        of engine 30 and the inside of condenser 12 for preventing a
        build-up of pressure within crankcase 42. Engine 30 has an oil
        pump (not shown) for pumping oil 43 from the base of crankcase
        42 through channels terminating in the walls of the cylinders
        31. A pressure relief valve 44 ensures that if the pressure in
        combustion chamber 20 exceeds 500 p.s.i.g. by more than a
        defined margin, valve 44 opens and the excess refrigerant gas is
        passed through conduit 45 directly to condenser 12. Between
        conduit 46 carrying fluid 11 into engine 30 and conduit 40
        carrying fluid 11 away from engine 30 is a vacuum break 47,
        which is a small valved conduit which opens to allow fluid 11 to
        flow from conduit 40 to conduit 46 whenever the conduit 46
        experiences a negative pressure above a predetermined value.
        Vacuum break 47 is necessary for the smooth operation of engine
        30 during those times when throttle 31 is closed. </p>
      <p>The preferred embodiment of the two-stroke engine has an even
        number of cylinders, i.e. 2, 4, 6, 8, etc., with parallel flow
        communication between the pressure control valve 31 and all of
        the inlet valves 38. Similar parallel flow communication exists
        between all of the outlet valves 39 and the condenser 12. The
        amount of working fluid power available to the engine is
        maintained at a generally constant level by means of feedback
        through heat sensor 24 and pressure sensor 26. Heat sensor 24
        signals burner element 22 to increase the amount of heat
        provided if the temperature in combustion chamber 20 drops below
        approximately 300 degrees Fahrenheit. Similarly, pressure sensor
        26 signals pressure control valve 17 to increase the flow rate
        of working fluid to injector 18 if the pressure in combustion
        chamber 20 drops below approximately 500 p.s. i.g. Control valve
        31 is used to vary the amount of available working fluid power
        that is actually transmitted to engine 30. </p>
      <p>One construction of control valve 31 suitable for use with an
        engine system installed in an automobile is shown in FIG. 3. The
        depression of a foot pedal 50 rotates a lever arm 51 clockwise,
        raising a tapered plunger 52 from an annular seat 53 to allow a
        controlled amount of fluid 11 to flow to engine 30. An idle
        by-pass line 55, with an associated idle control valve 56, may
        be built into the system to allow a small amount of fluid 11
        sufficient for idling to flow to engine 30 even at times when
        valve 31 is closed. </p>
      <p>FIG. 5 illustrates a centrifugal advancement mechanism that may
        be used to advance the opening and closing of the inlet valves
        38 and outlet valves 39 as the rotational speed of crankshaft 36
        increases. Shaft 60 is connected to crankshaft 36 through a belt
        or chain to rotate directly with crankshaft 36. Disc 61 is
        mounted on shaft 60 such that it can rotate slightly relative to
        shaft 60. Mounted to disc 61 to rotate with that disc is a cam
        member (not shown) on which a cam follower rides for opening and
        closing the inlet valves 38 and outlet valves 39. A pair of arms
        62 are each rotatable on a respective heavy pivot pin 63. Each
        arm 62 has an ear 64 extending into a complementary groove in
        the side of shaft 60. A spring 65 is connected between the one
        end of each arm 62 and a pin on the rotational axis of shaft 60.
        A pair of stops 66 limit the outward movement of the arms 62.
        Slight relative rotational movement between shaft 60 and disc 61
        occurs as shaft 60 increases its rotational speed. By this
        arrangement, the inlet valves 38 open a few degrees before TDC
        at high rotational speed of crankshaft 36; this allows the
        working fluid 11 to enter the cylinders at an earlier point than
        would be possible without this mechanism. When the engine 30 is
        just starting to rotate, the springs 65 hold the arms 62 at
        their most inward position which results in the inlet valves
        opening at TDC or just past TDC. </p>
      <p>In an automobile incorporating this engine system, the
        condenser 12 is replaced by an air-cooled radiator similar to
        the radiator in existing automobiles but larger. Also, an
        electric starter engine may need to be utilized for starting
        engines in which the crankshaft has its journals all in one
        plane (as exemplified by the crankshaft of FIG. 4B). For engines
        in which the crankshaft has journals angularly distributed about
        its axis (as exemplified by the crankshaft of FIG. 4A), such a
        starter engine is not required. An electric pump (powered by a
        battery in the automobile) is required for initial
        pressurization of the refrigerant fluid 11 in conduit 15. After
        starting of the engine, the pressurization of that fluid may be
        transferred to a mechanical pump driven by the engine. </p>
      <p>FIG. 6 illustrates an experimental apparatus which was built to
        test the feasibility of the engine system described. Engine 70
        is a four-cylinder Volkswagen diesel engine with a
        compression-ratio of approximately 15:1. This type of engine has
        a crankshaft with four journals all extending in the same plane
        in a similar manner to the arrangement of FIG. 4B. The diesel
        fuel injectors and glow plugs of engine 70 were left in position
        but were left unconnected for the experiments. A pulley 71,
        secured to the end of a crankshaft 72, drives a pair of belts 73
        and 74. The belt 73 extends around a pulley 77 which, through a
        linkage inside of casing 78, controls the opening and closing of
        the inlet and outlet cylinder valves of engine 70. The belt 73
        also extends around a pulley 79 driving an oil pump (not shown),
        and around an idler pulley 80 mounted for free rotation on block
        82 of engine 70. The belt 74 extends around a pulley 83
        connected to a pump 84 which pumps refrigerant fluid in the
        liquid state from a radiator means generally designated 85 to a
        heater means generally designated 86. Pump 84 is secured to the
        block 82 by a bracket 87. </p>
      <p>With further reference to the experimental apparatus
        illustrated in FIG. 6, the radiator means 85 is comprised of two
        radiator elements 89 and 90 secured together at an angle so as
        to create a wedge-shaped central cavity. Each of the radiator
        elements 89 and 90 comprises in part a continuous metal tube,
        each tube having a series of segments extending in parallel
        within the respective radiator element. Each of the
        semi-circular segments 91 that extend from the end of the
        radiator elements 89 and 90 connect a respective pair of the
        parallel segments of the continuous tube extending through the
        respective radiator element. A fan (not shown) is used to blow
        air across radiator means 85. </p>
      <p>The refrigerant fluid 11 in the liquid phase was pumped from
        radiator means 85 along conduit 93 by pump 84. Pump 84 raised
        the pressure of fluid 11 from approximately 20 p.s.i.g. in
        radiator means 85 to approximately 600 p.s. i.g. in a downstream
        conduit 94. The conduit 94 extended into the heater means 86,
        which in the experiment consisted of a modified propane storage
        tank 95 within which was fitted an electrical heating element
        (not shown) connected to an electrical powercord 96. The
        refrigerant fluid 11 was transformed from the liquid phase to a
        gas having a pressure of approximately 500 p.s.i.g. by means of
        the heat supplied by the heating element within tank 95. The gas
        pressure was monitored by a pressure gauge 97 fitted to an
        output conduit 98 of tank 95. A control valve 99 was fitted into
        conduit 98 to control flow of the refrigerant fluid 11 to the
        input manifold 100 of engine 70. The input manifold 100 provided
        a reservoir for the refrigerant gas being introduced into the
        four cylinders of the engine through the inlet valves on those
        cylinders. The refrigerant gas leaving the cylinders through the
        outlet valves entered the output manifold 101 at approximately
        20 p.s.i. g., and was then carried by a conduit 103 back to the
        radiator means 85. A pressure gauge 104 monitored the pressure
        in conduit 103. </p>
      <p>The refrigerant fluid that was utilized for the experiments was
        dichlorotetrafluoroethane, which is known commercially to
        refrigeration engineers under the trademark "FREON 114".
        However, new `environmentally-friendly` refrigerant fluids will
        shortly be commercially available that will have both higher
        operating pressures and lower condensation pressures. Although
        the engine system of the invention is a closed system in which
        there is no more leakage to the environment than results from
        use of the ordinary household refrigerator, the new
        refrigeration fluids presently under development do not use
        fluorohydrocarbons. One such `ozone-friendly` gas which is close
        to commercial production is 2,2,Dichloro-1,1,1,TrifluoroEthane,
        which is being developed by Dupont Chemical Company and will
        carry the trade-mark "HCFC 123". </p>
      <p>The engine system of this invention has been found to operate
        at least twice as efficiently in terms of output energy to input
        energy as conventional hydrocarbon-fuel internal combustion
        engine systems in use in automobiles. </p>
