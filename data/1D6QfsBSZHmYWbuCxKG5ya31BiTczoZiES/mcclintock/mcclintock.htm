        David McClintock created a free energy device known as the
        McClintock Air Motor (U.S. Patent No. 2,982,261) which is a
        cross between a diesel engine with three cylinders and a
        compression ratio of 27-to-1, and a rotary engine with solar and
        plenary gears. It burns no fuel, but becomes self-running by
        driving its own air compressor. </p>

      <p>A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the 'McClintock Air
        Motor' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between a
        diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression ratio
        of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and planetary
        gears). It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running by driving
        its own air compressor. This engine also generates a lot of
        heat, which could be used to heat buildings; and its very HIGH
        TORQUE makes it ideal for large trucks, preventing their slowing
        down when climbing hills. [David McClintock is also the REAL
        original Inventor of the automatic transmission, differential,
        and 4-wheel drive.] </p>

    <blockquote><b>Description</b>
      <p>This invention relates to improvements in engines and more
        particularly to an engine operated by fluid presssure and the
        expansion forces thereof at operating temperatures of the
        engine. </p>
      <p>The objects and advantages of the invention will become
        apparent as the description proceeds and the invention consists
        essentially in the novel combination and arrangement of parts
        hereinafter described in detail and illustrated in the
        accompanying drawings. </p>
      <p>In the accompanying drawings: </p>

      </center>
      <p>Referring now more particularly to the drawings: </p>
      <p>In the preferred embodiment of the features of my invention as
        here shown, reference numeral 1 indicates a stationary
        cylindrical housing closed at both ends by end walls 2 adn 3 and
        provided with suitable supporting legs indicated generally at 4.
        An engine shaft 5 extends entirely through the housing 1 and is
        journalled in anti-friction bearings 6 and 7 secured to the end
        walls 2 and 3 respectively. The planet gears are enmeshed at all
        times with a sun gear 15 keyed or otherwise secured as at 16 to
        the inner end of a sleeve 16A freely rotatable about the engine
        shaft 5. The opposite or outer end of the sleeve terminates in a
        clutch element 16B cooperating with a manually disengageable
        companion clutch element 16B by any approved type of actuating
        mechnaism such as the rollers 19 and handle 19A. The outer end
        of the engine shaft is provided with an internal ring gear 21
        meshing at all times with a driving gear 22 secured to one end
        of a shaft 23 of a starting motor (not shown). </p>
      <p>The shafts 12, 13 and 14 of the planet gears are rotatably
        mounted in bearings respectively 24, 25 and 26, formed in a
        carrier 27 in the form of a disc which provides one end wall 28
        of a cylindrical housing 29 disposed within the main housing 1
        closed by an opposing end wall 30 and freely rotatable about the
        engine shaft 5 by means of anti-friction bearings 31. </p>
      <p>An intermediate wall 32 is secured within the cylindrical
        housing 29 and is provided with a central concentric opening 33.
        Securely mounted as at 34 to the wall 32 are three motor
        cylinders 35, 36 and 37, each provided, respectively, with
        pistons 35A, 36 and 37, each provided, respectively, with
        pistons 35A, 36A and 37A operatively mounted therein. The
        pistons are connected by their pitmans 35B, 36B and 37B to crank
        discs 35C, 36C and 37C. The crank discs are secured to or formed
        integral with the shafts 12, 13 adn 14, respectively, of the
        planet gears 9, 10, and 11. </p>
      <p>The head of each cylinder is provided with a conduit 38
        extending through the wall 32 and in open communication with an
        annular tubular pressure manifold 38A. A hub 39 having a
        circumferential groove 40 therein is secured as at 41 to the
        housing wall 2 and partially supports the bearing 6. A ring 42,
        ported as at 43, is secured as at 44 to and rotatable with the
        wall 30 of the rotatable housing 29. The port 43 is connected as
        at 45 to and in communication with the manifold 38A by means of
        a duct 46. The bottom of the ring 42 is ported as at 47 and
        thereby in communication by means of a pressure line 48 with a
        source of fluid pressure (not shown). </p>
      <p>The head of each cylinder 35, 36 adn 37 is provided with a
        centrally disposed poppet valve 50 seated as at 51 and provided
        with a stem 52 extending downwardly into its respective cylinder
        whereby each valve will be intermittently opened by contact with
        the top of its respective piston as the piston nears the
        completion of its up-stroke. </p>
      <p>With the parts in their positions shown in Figure 2, the piston
        37A of cylinder 37 is starting its downward or power stroke;
        piston 36A in cylinder 36 is substantially midway of its power
        stroke; piston 35A in cylinder 35 is substantially midway of its
        power stroke. Pressure from the main manifold 38A through the
        conduits 38 is fed progressively and automatically to the
        cylinders 35, 36 and 37 by the opening of their intake valves
        50. Since the cylinders and their respective pistons and valves
        are identical, as is also their operation, a description of one
        will suffice for all. For example, and with particular reference
        to cylinder 37 it will be seen that as piston 37A (assuming it
        is now arriving at the top of its stroke) strikes the valve stem
        52, the valve 50 will be lifted from its seat to admit into the
        cylinder a full charge of pressure from the conduit 38. As the
        piston starts its downward stroke, the valve 50 will close,
        allowing the piston to complete its power stroke, at the end of
        which the residual pressure will exhaust through the ports 64. </p>
      <p>In the end wall 30 of the internal cylindrical rotatable
        housing 29 I provide one or more exhaust openings 66 open to the
        atmosphere through one or more openings 67 formed in the end
        wall 2 of the stationary main housing 1. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing it will be apparent that actual transmission
        of power by air from the main manifold to the motor cylinders at
        high velocity and with very slight loss by friction and the
        magnitude of forces created by the lever advantages between the
        pistons of the motor cylinders, planet gears, planet carrier,
        sun gear, and engine shaft are simple and effective and that
        since air devolops heat on compression, the resultant expansion
        forces of the air within the motor cylinders will augment the
        power output generated by their mechanical operation. </p>
      <p>While I have shown a particular form of embodiment of my
        invention, I am aware that many minor changes therein will
        readily suggest themselves to others skilled in the art without
        departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. having
        thus described my invention, I claim ... [ Claims not included
