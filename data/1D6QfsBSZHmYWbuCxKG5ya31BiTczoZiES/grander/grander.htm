      <br>
      (* 24. April 1930 in Jochberg in Tirol; † 24. September 2012[1])
      war ein österreichischer Unternehmer.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Leben</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Grander wurde als zweites von fünf Kindern geboren und hatte eine
      karge Kindheit. Mit 13 Jahren wurde er von der NS-Kreisleitung
      schulfrei gestellt und für Arbeiten in der Landwirtschaft
      eingesetzt.[2]<br>
      <br>
      Er entwickelte ein Verfahren zur „Wasserbelebung“. Dabei soll die
      Wasserstruktur verbessert werden, so dass ein gesundes Milieu für
      nützliche Mikroorganismen gegeben sein soll. Es ist inzwischen
      wissenschaftlich erwiesen, dass die Grander-Technologie zur
      „Belebung von Leitungswasser“ wirkungslos ist[3] und sie darf laut
      einem Gerichtsurteil als „esoterischer Unfug“ bezeichnet
      werden.[4] 1978 gab er seinen Beruf auf und gründete ein Jahr
      später das Grander-Familienunternehmen Vertrieb für Original
      Grander Technologie.[2]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Auszeichnungen</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Grander erhielt im September 2000 das Silberne Ehrenzeichen der
      Russischen Akademie der Naturwissenschaften (eine 1990 gegründete
      private Organisation), 2001 wurde er für sein Lebenswerk mit dem
      Österreichischen Ehrenkreuz für Wissenschaft und Kunst
      ausgezeichnet. Im Juni 2008 wurde eine parlamentarische Anfrage
      von Abgeordneten der Grünen, LIF, SPÖ und FPÖ an das
      Wissenschaftsministerium hinsichtlich der Prüfung der Verleihung
      aufgrund nicht vorhandener wissenschaftlicher Leistungen
      eingebracht. Die Aberkennung des Ehrenkreuzes wurde jedoch von
      Wissenschaftsminister Johannes Hahn abgelehnt.[5] Johann Grander
      wurde im September 2009 im Rahmen des 30-jährigen Firmenjubiläums
      von der Wirtschaftskammer Tirol für seine Verdienste und
      Leistungen mit dem Ehrendiplom ausgezeichnet.[6]<br>

      Process for the treatment of microorganisms or a medium contg.
      them, comprises, either the direct addn. to the microorganism
      contg. medium, or the indirect effect upon this medium, of a water
      or medium whose electromagnetic structure has been changed by
      altering the magnetic nuclear resonance properties and by the
      formation of super-molecular complexes between the mols. in the
      vibrating state. The appts. for this process is also claimed,
      comprising a double-walled vessel whose outer mantle is filled
      with the altered water or medium, which acts indirectly upon the
      microorganism medium present in or flowing through the inner
      section.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The invention relates to a method and apparatus for the
      treatment of a medium containing micro-organisms or
      micro-organisms and specific uses of the inventive method.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] In order to reduce the use of disinfecting agents,
      preservatives, bactericides, fungicides, and other micro-organisms
      influencing means and thereby relieve the nutritional cycle the
      floor and the waste water is constantly looking for new means and
      methods, the influence of microorganisms without side effects
      permit.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The object of the invention is therefore to find a way to
      side-effects affecting microorganisms, so that the use of
      disinfectants, preservatives, bactericides, fungicides and similar
      acting on microorganisms substances can be reduced can be or waive
      its right to use any .<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The object is achieved in that in the method mentioned in
      its electromagnetic structure acts by changing the nuclear
      magnetic resonance properties and by the formation of
      supramolecular complexes between the molecules in its vibrational
      state changed water or medium indirectly to the containing the
      microorganisms medium or this is added directly. According to the
      invention, an apparatus to be used, consisting of a jacketed
      vessel, which is filled in its electromagnetic structure and in
      its vibration state modified water or medium in the outer jacket,
      and thus acting without direct contact to the microorganisms in
      the medium, that in the inner coat or is the inner sheath flows.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The primary activation of liquids, wherein, while cooling,
      and entry of the treatment energy, a higher energy content is
      imposed by converting a portion of the internal energy, is per se
      known. It has also succeeded in its electromagnetic structure to
      convert water so that both by modification of the nuclear magnetic
      resonance properties (change of spin-spin coupling constants) as
      well as by induction of electro-magnetic vibration condition was
      modified by formation of supramolecular complexes between
      individual water molecules. These electromagnetic oscillations are
      responsible for the emergence of an electromagnetic field at a
      defined frequency, phase and amplitude, which propagates uniformly
      in all directions.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Surprisingly, it has been found that larger particles and
      groups of molecules are broken down in such a electromagnetic
      field into small groups of molecules, thereby reducing the
      viscosity, among other things, pollutant molecules can be resolved
      and the like. Most surprising is that the energy state of the
      activated liquid is maintained, that is, does not decay.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Such fluids have been previously activated, used in a
      method of reducing the fuel consumption and exhaust gases in
      internal combustion engines, which is described in EP-A 389 888.
      In this known arrangement, an activator is used in the fuel supply
      to the combustion chamber is arranged, having a flow-through of
      fuel chamber and at least a column filled with a stationary medium
      chamber, wherein the electromagnetic structure by modifying the
      magnetic nuclear resonance properties and the vibration state by
      forming supermolecular complexes between is changed to the
      molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Through the above-mentioned electromagnetic field is
      carried out influence on other liquids, the effect of passing
      through walls and can thereby reduce molecular groups, so that
      pollutant molecules are dissolved. This also provides more
      complete combustion of motor and heating fuels with a drastic
      reduction in the emission of pollutants takes place. The more
      complete combustion of fuel can also be saved.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is completely surprising that the microorganisms
      contained in the medium can be changed by the liquid which has
      been activated in the above manner, outgoing properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The micro-organisms present in the medium usually consist
      of many individual compounds. These are merging into so-called
      large colonies because they draw ecological benefits from it.
      Surprisingly, it was the big colonies in many tiny individual
      colonies battered by the outgoing of the activated liquid
      properties. This results in the medium to an increase of total
      count.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The advantage of the inventive method lies in the fact that
      these individual colonies formed by busting to disinfectants and
      other microbicidal acting media, but also to temperature increases
      are much more sensitive than the large colonies. The bacteria can
      thus be already at very low concentrations of disinfectants in
      their growth inhibited (bacteriostasis) or completely destroyed
      (bactericides). This results in a significant saving of
      disinfectants.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] A growth inhibition or a destruction of microorganisms can
      be done by that once-battered large colonies flow repeatedly
      circulated through the device of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] It is known that the destruction of large colonies are also
      caused by ultrasound in single colonies. Depending on the exposure
      time all existing large colonies are destroyed and thus achieved a
      number of bacteria optimum. Upon further exposure to this high
      frequency sound energy, what ultimately even to a kill the
      microorganisms. The curve in a diagram (ordinate: number of
      bacteria. Abscissa: time of exposure) corresponds to a Gaussian
      bell curve.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] ie outgoing from the stationary medium of the activated
      liquid of the inventive arrangement features but differ
      significantly from the effect of ultrasound: If the sonicated
      sample immediately afterwards examined bacteriologically, then
      immediately is a bacterial count increase by the formation of
      single colonies detectable. Other hand, a flowing medium is passed
      through the device of the invention and subsequently studied
      bacteriological immediately, no change from the initial stage is
      first detectable, which means that large colonies are present in
      even without decomposition proposed manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] but it Makes the medium flowing outside of the area are 24
      to 96 hours, then the formation of single colonies and the number
      of bacteria associated increase after this residence are
      bacteriologically detectable. It is concluded that the hazards
      arising from static medium property is not applied in the form of
      energy to the microorganisms, but in the form of an energy
      information transfer. From the medium at rest, therefore no energy
      is radiated. Just so is to explain why after 11 years of
      observation time (the experiments were started in 1983) which at
      that time assembled device today still works.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In the European Patent 389 888 it is stated "that larger
      particles and groups of molecules are broken down in such a
      electromagnetic field into smaller groups of molecules."<br>
      <br>
      [0017] This will explain why there is a drastic reduction in the
      emission of pollutants in motor and heating fuels. Under no
      circumstances is thus the present invention mentioned here busting
      microbiological large colonies meant in sensitive single colonies,
      as power and heating fuels are free of microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In the above-mentioned EP patent is with the destruction of
      larger particles and molecular groups into smaller groups of
      molecules refers to the physical transformation of compounds
      contained in fuel oil to reach the goal of better combustion and a
      reduction of unwanted emissions.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The subject invention deals exclusively with the
      destruction of micro-organisms - ie the conversion of large
      aggregates into single cells.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] With the present invention demonstrated the influence of
      the resting medium for microorganisms, it is the first time become
      possible to also pictorially demonstrate the outgoing of this
      medium effect using bacteriological methods.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] This change in microorganisms is achieved even if the
      altered in its electromagnetic structure of water is added
      directly to a water containing microorganisms. This arrangement,
      while the bacteriological detection technique used and the results
      obtained are set out in the form of an example:<br>
      <br>
      [0022] used a system is free-flowing from the tap water, which
      contains a bacterial count of approximately 10 colony forming
      units per milliliter with good quality. When bacteria count or
      colony count the number of 6 is in accordance with the drinking
      water regulations of each country generally - to 8-fold magnifier
      magnifying visible colonies set which, peptone from the present in
      1 ml of the examined water bacteria in pour plate cultures or by
      the membrane filter method with nutrient-rich Culture media (1%
      meat extract, 1% peptone) at a incubation temperature of 20 +2
      [deg.] C and 36 +1 [deg.] C after 44 +4 hours of incubation form.
      In the membrane filter method bacteria-membrane filters are used
      with a pore size from 0.2 to 0.45 [micro] m and a diameter of 55
      mm for the plate count. The water to be analyzed will have
      filtered through by the membrane filter. The bacteria and fungi in
      this water remain on the filter. Subsequently, this filter is
      placed on a culture medium, incubated as described above and then
      counted the bacteria colonies formed. The membrane filter method
      is a standard procedure according to DIN 38 411-K5 "Determination
      of replication-competent bacteria by membrane filter method,"
      corresponds to the German standard methods for water, waste water
      and sludge (DEV).<br>
      <br>
      [0023] First, a bacteriological output value using the technique
      described above is determined by the drinking water. Thereafter, 1
      ml of sterile water is added to a liter of this drinking water,
      which was changed in its electromagnetic structure as defined in
      EP 389 888.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] For the blank determination is introduced into a second
      vessel 1 liter of this drinking water without any addition. Both
      vessels will now be available to stand for 12 to 96 hours,
      covered. It is important that both vessels are at least 10 m
      apart, so that the vessel inoculated no influence on the blank
      vessel can occur. After this time a colony count of the two
      vessels, is carried out by means of the membrane filter process
      again. It is shown that the bacterial count of at 21 [deg.] C for
      44 hours agar plates incubated the inoculated solution is
      decreased by about 90% compared to the blank. The same applies to
      the at 37 [deg.] C for 24 hours incubated plates.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] If the agar plate now longer than 44 hours at 21 [deg.] C
      incubated, then contact to surprisingly new and first tiny
      colonies which are fully developed after a maximum of 120 hours of
      incubation. Compared to the colonies of the untreated water these
      emerging colonies are changed in their appearance: they are either
      yellow or opaque white colored, much smaller and a colony like the
      other, ie, species diversity in the appearance of colonies as the
      untreated water shows, has been lost. The number of bacteria after
      120 hours of incubation may be about thousand CFU / ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] If the exposure time extended (in this example 12 hours),
      to several days, then no more starting colonies are usually
      detected by three days, that is, within the first 44 hours of
      incubation at 20 to 22 [deg.] C show mostly no more colonies.
      These occur only after prolonged incubation in the manner
      described above, the daughter colonies. At 37 [deg.] C incubation
      temperature occurs even after prolonged incubation, no more colony
      formation, since the individual colonies formed are very sensitive
      to temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] According to the invention is explained these
      microbiological changes as follows: Microorganisms, and
      specifically bacteria live in a medium, such As water, rarely as a
      single individual. The merger of several single individuals to a
      parent structure has advantages in terms of energy use, substrate
      utilization and survival. If such parent entity is brought into
      contact with a change in its electromagnetic structure of water,
      then it can be shown after a residence time above that of a mother
      colony a number of daughter colonies formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] According to the invention could also be demonstrated that
      these daughter colonies have a much poorer chance of survival and
      are killed by disinfectants in very low concentrations. These
      concentrations are considerably lower than those necessary to kill
      parent colonies. The lower survival of the daughter colonies are
      also reflected in the fact that they require a much longer
      incubation period (ie more than 40 hours) to form colonies on agar
      plates. These daughter colonies are much more temperature
      sensitive than the parent colonies. At 37 [deg.] C die from it.
      The formation of such a sensitive daughter colonies is also
      observed when bakterienhältige liquids with UV rays are charged,
      but the dose is chosen so that a destruction not yet occurred.
      This is known from such studies in which the UV lamps were
      weakened by the formation of deposits in their effect. By
      sublethal addition of H2O2 can also be observed formation of
      daughter colonies. These observations are also reports in which
      the concentration of H2O2 was too low due to an insufficient
      stability to act inactivating. That daughter colonies can also be
      formed by a modified in its electromagnetic structure of water,
      however, is surprising and new.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] For industrial use is selected, a device in which the
      changes in its electromagnetic structure of water is added
      directly. Rather, this is filled and sealed in a rigid jacket.
      This double casing encloses a pipe through which flows the medium
      to be treated then with a certain speed. In this device, the same
      phenomena were prepared as described above, observed: decrease in
      the mother colonies, formation of daughter colonies. If the medium
      to be treated out in this arrangement in the circuit, then it is
      possible to reduce after an appropriate dwell time, the daughter
      colonies even without the addition of disinfectants or ultimately
      even completely kill.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] From this effect of the altered in its electromagnetic
      structure of water on microorganisms accumulated a wealth of
      practical applications can be derived, which will be described
      below by way of example: Example 1: application in the area of
      ??the swimming pool.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] A private swimming pool with dimensions of 12 m length, 4 m
      width, 1.50 m depth, volume, therefore, 72 m &lt;3&gt;, was born
      on 30 Sampled in July 1994 to raise the bacteriological actual
      state.<br>
      <br>
      Results: 95 CFU per ml + 1 Mushroom colony on Plate Count Agar,
      incubation, 22 [deg.] C, 48 hours. 5 CFU per ml at 24 hours of
      incubation at 37 [deg.] C. pH of 8.2. Chlorine content
      undetectable. Appearance of water: yet clear incipient algae
      growth on the pool walls. When the circulator operating the pool
      water was directly treated with 20 ml of a modified in its
      electromagnetic structure of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] Bacteriological result on 08.03.1994 (three days after
      seeding) No more mother colonies after 48 hours incubation at 22
      [deg.] C, for this is a myriad of small, emerged with the naked
      eye just recognizable colonies. After 60 hours of incubation can
      be about 500 daughter colonies counted out. After 90 hours
      incubation the plate is completely overgrown and no more single
      colonies counted. pH of water: 8.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] 10/08/1994: Heavily frequented bathing. pH 8.6. The bath
      water becomes turbid on. Significant growth of algae on the pelvic
      floor. Bacteriological examination: 6 mother colonies and an
      uncountable number of daughter colonies. To stop the growth of
      algae, a disinfectant (Sauerstoffabspalter base to acetic acid)
      was added and the pH adjusted to 7.0. Disinfectant concentration
      in the pool water: 0.0005%!<br>
      <br>
      [0034] 08/12/1994: The water is completely clear again.
      Bacteriological examination: Plate count zero.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] 22/08/1994: Plate count zero. As before, strong bathing. pH
      7.1. Water clear.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] 09/20/1994: pH 7.8. The water is turbid, clear algae. Plate
      count: 3 mother colonies and uncountable daughter colonies.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Summary of the results: By adding a very small amount (20
      ml for 73 m &lt;3&gt;) to a change in its electromagnetic
      structure of water to the pool water was causing the bacterial
      counts were reduced during an observation period of two months by
      95%. This technique produced daughter colonies were against the
      added chlorine-free disinfectant on acetic basis so sensitive that
      a 0.0005% by weight final concentration in the swimming pool was
      enough to reduce the bacterial count to zero (neither mother nor
      daughter colonies detectable) and this status despite intense
      swimming carries (very hot summer of 1994) and in spite of 26
      [deg.] C water temperature for 14 days to maintain. Even after
      2-month observation period, the information delivered to the water
      could still be detected by the changes in its electromagnetic
      structure of water at hand to a range of daughter colonies. Algae
      growth could not be altered by the addition of such water.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] This experiment for 50 days shows the effects and
      advantages of the method: Waiver of chlorine-based disinfectants
      Reduction of disinfectant additive more than 70% Priority use of
      algicidal agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In spite of an intensive swimming carries (6 persons, about
      4 bath daily transitions) and water temperatures up to 26 [deg.] C
      did not increase after inoculation of the water, the bacterial
      count. Only the growth of algae was not inhibited by the
      inoculation. But this made a targeted and in its amount
      significantly reduced use of chemical means necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] If the pool water inoculated directly, but a double-walled
      vessel - as described above - built into the circuit of the
      circulation pump, then the formation of daughter colonies
      detectable after 7 to 14 days. The fastest and at the same time
      lasting effect is achieved when the pool water inoculated one hand
      directly and the other a double jacket vessel is built into the
      circuit of the circulation pump.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2: odor removal in manure and increasing the fertilizer
        value.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0041] The mammalian remote, fresh slurry has a pH between 6.5 and
      7.5 and is odorless. Due to the high urea content, the slurry is a
      very good, bacteriological culture medium. In the bacterial
      hydrolysis of urea is first converted to ammonia and carbon
      dioxide. Only by this microbial conversion manure starts to reek
      of ammonia. Simultaneously, the pH rises to 10 to 12. The manure
      is in this state, strongly alkaline, so pflanzenunverträglich and
      may not be applied agriculturally so. If the ammonia-containing
      slurry stirred vigorously to supply their oxygen, then the ammonia
      with the aid of microorganisms (nitrifying bacteria) converts into
      the pH-neutral nitrate. Through this nitrification, the pH drops
      back into the neutral range, the manure does not smell and is now
      perfectly compatible with plants with high fertilizer value.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments have now surprisingly found that by direct inoculation
      of the manure with a in its electromagnetic structure according to
      the invention modified water - or by hanging an inventive double
      coat rod into the slurry pit - or by passing the slurry through a
      double-walled vessel (built into the cycle of slurry circulation
      pump) - or by a combination of the specified methods -
      nitrification occurs much more rapidly than without interference.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In laboratory studies with the same output manure could at
      that vessel in which a double-jacketed rod was mounted and the
      addition was inoculated directly compared to the blank value
      following can be stated: The pH fell significantly faster in the
      neutral range. The CO2 evolution was significantly stronger and
      the nitrate content increased significantly faster.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0043] Advantages of it:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      The period in which odor is possible is drastically reduced. In
      practical tests, this was a self-detectable for the user
      experience of success: The manure does not smell! The time before
      the spreading of manure is shortened.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Particularly successful were those practical experiments in
      which the manure 1 pumped, 2 made a direct inoculation and 3 a
      double-walled rod was permanently installed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3:</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0045] odor control, bacterial plaque formation and overshooting
      bacterial growth in pipes with nutrient-rich media with reference
      to dental chairs.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Dental chairs have an abundance of water supply, drainage
      and suction lines. Saliva and blood of patients make the
      wastewater nutrient-rich. This microorganisms can proliferate
      particularly strong in the piping system of dental chairs. This
      may cause an odor. At the same time the risk of infection
      increases.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] The water for filling the Mundspülglases is automatically
      removed from the drinking water supply in a storage vessel at 37
      [deg.] C heated and pumped into the tumbler as needed. From the
      literature it is known that this particular mouthwash highly
      aeruginosae by keeping it warm during the treatment periods and
      the stagnant standing overnight with Pseudomonas is contaminated
      with germs. Infections and changes in the oral flora in patients
      are the result.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In order to reduce the risk of infection, one tries this
      water add a disinfectant, such As a stabilized 0.7% hydrogen
      peroxide solution. This has the disadvantage that the washing
      water gets an unpleasant taste (after gargle). In bacteriological
      tests showed that by under-dosing - whether through lack of
      stabilization of H2O2 concentrate or a faulty metering - the
      bacterial content was only slightly reduced. Pseudomonads were
      often entwikkelt by the under-dosing and resistance had become
      less sensitive to H2O2. A lasting solution has not yet been found.
      Although a higher dosage of the disinfectant was able to reduce
      the number of bacteria in the mouth rinsing, but it was the taste
      was unacceptable to the patient.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In addition, especially pseudomonads in flowing systems
      form bacterial plaque. This consists of several cellulose units,
      sticky pads adhere very well to the wall and simultaneously form a
      breeding ground for new pseudomonads. This coating also has the
      advantage that they are protected from the effect of the added
      disinfectant for the microorganisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Also from the literature it is known that pipelines, where
      such bacterial plaque are present, can not be disinfected. Only by
      mechanical removal of the pads, the bacteria can be eliminated
      permanently.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In the case of a dentist, the inventive arrangement in the
      form of a double-jacketed flow device was installed in those
      drinking water pipe that leads to the heating storage tank for the
      mouthwash. Additionally, this reservoir was inoculated with a few
      drops of the altered in its electromagnetic structure of water.
      Just three days after this inoculation was bacteriologically the
      effect detected: There were no mother colonies longer detectable.
      The daughter colonies after incubation for 60 hours at 21 [deg.] C
      detectable. Your plate count was about 1500/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] 7 days after the start of the heated reservoir was opened,
      and found that at the bottom of this vessel detached, bacterial
      plaque and limestone had accumulated. These were removed and
      closed the reservoir again. In the following weeks, a steady
      decrease in the bacterial count of the daughter colonies was
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] Two months after the commencement of the bacterial count of
      the daughter colonies had fallen below 100 CFU / ml. The water had
      its natural drinking water taste. On the addition of disinfectants
      could be dispensed with entirely in the sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] After three months, the reservoir was opened again: The
      walls were clean and free of deposits. A remnant of exfoliated
      surfaces and lime was observed at the bottom only and removed
      this. Mother colonies, as these were found in the inflowing water,
      were no longer detectable in the patient's mouth rinsing.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In addition to this renovation of drinking water range
      dental treatment plant was also trying to rehabilitate the
      water-supplying or other discharge lines bacteriologically. This
      also affects the suction equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Recently, shall be installed by legal requirements in the
      drainage area of ??dental treatment plants so-called amalgam.
      These are devices that are intended to prevent amalgam radicals as
      scrap from the manufacture of seals or the boring old amalgam
      fillings, are flushed into the sewer system. Especially fresh
      amalgam or glass that is very finely distributed in the boring old
      amalgam fillings can cause an increase in the soluble mercury
      content in waste water. Amalgam, the amalgam contained herein may
      be separated from other waste, for example, built centrifuges. The
      amalgam is collected in storage vessels, and these are supplied to
      a recycling process after reaching a certain filling level.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] From a hygienic point of view of the installation of an
      amalgam separator means an additional flow resistance. The
      necessary reservoir for amalgam cause sewage stops overnight in
      these containers, and that it can multiply microorganisms
      contained strong. This proliferation simultaneously leads to
      increased mucus and film formation. This switch sensors are coated
      for the amalgam and make this inoperable. On the other hand, can
      result in a formation of unpleasant odors in the dental office.
      Both are undesirable.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Heretofore, combats the growth of microorganisms and
      formation of slime and deposits by the addition of disinfectants.
      To replace pads reinforced one has used often strongly alkaline
      disinfectant (pH 11 to 12). The plaque formation was thus indeed
      reduced. This highly alkaline solutions but also gets into the
      storage vessel of the amalgam separator, ie, where the amalgam to
      centrifuged residues are kept.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The fine surface of this amalgam residues and by the
      strongly alkaline solutions, there was an increased solubility of
      mercury and thus the opposite has been achieved exactly what we
      wanted to prevent the installation of an amalgam separator: The
      amalgam does have the solid amalgam deposited , strongly alkaline
      disinfectant, however, have a portion of the solid amalgam
      dissolved again and thus dissolved amalgam entered into the
      channel. The waste water emission regulations limit the content of
      soluble mercury in the wastewater with a maximum of 0.01 mg / l.
      These values ??were exceeded by far.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] jacketed flow vessels were built to novel solution to this
      problem in all water-supplying pipes of dental treatment unit and
      in addition the amalgam reservoir of the separator inoculated
      directly with a change in its electromagnetic structure of water =
      experimental chair. The second chair of the experimental dentist
      as had previously been treated with disinfectants = comparison
      chair. The bacteriological examination was carried out once a week
      from the waters of the amalgam reservoir in the separator unit.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] One week after the start of the experiment was found when
      attempting device that has in stock the amalgam separator vessel,
      above the heavy amalgam residue deposited an abundance of organic
      deposits. These have apparently replaced lately. Also, the amalgam
      container itself indicated its walls corresponding release traces
      of these coverings. The detached coverings were removed. The first
      bacteriological examination revealed a significant increase of
      daughter colonies, but in addition were sporadically mother
      colonies detectable.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The comparison chair, however, showed no increased
      formation of detached surfaces. Among the mother colonies were
      approximately 100 CFU / ml of fluorescent pseudomonads
      (fluorescence at 366 nm).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Four weeks after the start of the lines of the experimental
      chair inside were completely clean, especially the walls of the
      amalgam reservoir and the sensors in the intake area. During this
      time there was no failure of the deposition and no odor. After 4
      weeks, no mother colonies were detectable. The daughter colonies
      had a bacterial count of 1000/ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] The comparison device, however, showed a slight increase in
      the mother colonies and the usual deposit formation. 20 g of a
      powdery disinfecting agent to the agent based on a
      Sauerstoffabspalters were dosed daily.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] This disinfectant solution was added to 1%, pH 10.0.
      Mercury content in waste water: 0.03 to 0.1 mg / l<br>
      <br>
      [0066] After 6 months of experiment time, the result remained in
      the experiment constant stool: a new fouling, no disturbing smell
      and a strong formation of daughter colonies with more than 1000
      cfu / ml. An additional dose of disinfectants was not necessary.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The inventive apparatus and method described here can show
      the following advantages in dental treatment units: 1 Extensive
      waiver to the addition of disinfectants. 2 No resolution of
      deposited mercury, as described, for As is done by alkaline
      disinfectant. 3 No odors out of the hoses. 4 No deposit formation
      and thus ensure trouble-free operation of the treatment unit, in
      particular the amalgam separator.<br>

      [0068] Prevention of bacteriological contamination and the change
      in taste of drinking water that is entrained in tropical
      destinations in plastic storage containers.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The purification of drinking water in tropical destinations
      is a general problem. In order not to rely on sometimes dubious
      sources of drinking water, is particularly at car travel, the
      desire to fill native drinking water of good quality in plastic
      container to have this available for the entire trip. But not even
      the best drinking water is free of microorganisms, it can cause a
      severe contamination particularly by elevated temperature and
      solar radiation, but also favored by the plastic container and
      possibly contained therein plasticizer. Even algae formation is
      possible. All this can lead to a Genussuntauglichkeit of drinking
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Various methods are known to make drinking water preserved
      for these purposes. One of these methods is the addition of a
      product sold under the trademark "Micropur" the company Katadyn
      Germany GmbH. It consists of a light-stable, water-soluble
      sodium-silver chloride-complex. This powder dissolves in water
      completely. After dissociation of sodium chloride, the released
      silver causes the disinfection of drinking water. The required
      concentration is 1 g of powder to 100 liters of water. Is a
      complete disinfection intends to 10 g of powder are to be dosed up
      to 100 liters of water. The exposure time is given 1 to 2 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] A second possibility is the filtration of water through
      germ-proof membrane filter. To this end, a hand pump with
      appropriate filters is offered by the same company.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Despite the advantages offered by these products is not to
      overlook the fact that the water is a foreign substance is added
      in the form of a silver salt. In the filtration process, a device
      is always carried and the filtration itself is relatively
      cumbersome. In addition, the filter once used can become
      contaminated - therefore is placed on a frequent filter
      replacement value.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In the case in trial it came to determine whether, to the
      water of the storage tanks the wholesomeness of drinking water can
      be obtained even under tropical conditions by the addition of
      sterile water, which was changed in its electromagnetic structure
      and in its vibrational state.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] For a four-week vacation in the northern Sahara 12 plastic
      containers were each filled with 10 liters of perfect, fresh
      spring water for two travelers.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] The bacteriological examination of this water gave the
      following values: Plate count at 22 [deg.] C incubation under 5
      CFU / ml. Plate count at 37 [deg.] C incubation with 2 CFU / ml.
      Absence of Escherichia coli, coliform bacteria and enterococci.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] The plastic canister consisted of opaktransparentem
      polypropylene screw cap with self. For each of these vessels 1 ml
      of sterile-filtered (0.2 [micro] m) and in its electromagnetic
      structure was added altered water, sealed the container and
      shaken. Through the journey time was to ensure that a contact time
      was assured of at least 3 days. The water containers were
      transported for reasons of space on the roof rack of the car and
      were therefore full of sun and exposed to outside temperatures.
      There were water temperatures up to 42 [deg.] C measured.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] After 4 weeks sojourn under the above conditions was by
      travelers reported the following: The taste of the water was -
      apart from the heat - unchanged. The taste was very safe to be
      assessed especially after a cool night in the morning. In none of
      the 12 plastic container algae growth could be detected.
      Extraneous water was not refilled into the container!<br>
      <br>
      [0078] The present in each container after four weeks remaining
      amount of water (about 50 ml) was also examined bacteriologically
      and found the following: After 48 hours of incubation at 22 [deg.]
      C null germs. With 120 hours of incubation at 22 [deg.] C about 30
      smallest daughter colonies.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] This demonstrates a good efficiency of the added and
      modified in its electromagnetic structure of water. At 37 [deg.] C
      incubation temperature were observed no colony forming units.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] It is essential for the assessment of this practice test
      are two criteria: At 22 [deg.] C incubation temperature caused no
      colonies on the agar plate within an incubation period of 48
      hours. Tiny daughter colonies were seen only after 120 hours of
      incubation. Again, the number of colonies was greatly reduced with
      about 30. At 37 [deg.] C incubation temperature caused either
      after 48 hours or after 120 hours of incubation colonies on the
      agar plate. Pathogens and hygienic concern all nuclei are adapted
      to the human body temperature. To assess the hygienic quality of
      the water just this incubation temperature is very essential.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] limits for drinking water according to drinking water
      regulations: maximum of 100 CFU / ml at 22 [deg.] C after 48 hours
      and maximum of 100 CFU / ml at 37 [deg.] C. for 48 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] To ensure accurate representation of the germ-speed curve
      after addition of drinking water with a sterile water, which was
      changed in its electromagnetic structure, has been carried out in
      the laboratory, the following experiment: The same water that was
      used for the tropical trip described above were bacteriological
      voruntersucht and then added to 1 ml of a modified in its
      electromagnetic structure of water to 10 liters of drinking water.
      An aliquot of sample was placed in a 1 liter bottle, which was
      also made from polypropylene. After 3 days standing time at room
      temperature, in turn, a bacteriological examination was performed
      while about 2300 daughter colonies at an incubation temperature of
      22 [deg.] C observed after 120 hours. After 48 hours at 22 [deg.]
      C. and after 48 hours at 37 [deg.] C have shown no colony forming
      units.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] After these three days, the 1 liter bottle was at 37 [deg.]
      C placed in the incubator, and again carried out bacteriological
      tests after each week. The following counts for daughter colonies
      were found: After one week 250 100 After two weeks, three weeks
      and four weeks 50 10 CFU / ml. Incubation, 22 [deg.] C, 120 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] This experiment shows that the daughter colonies formed are
      temperature sensitive. Already after one week hold time at 37
      [deg.] C could be counted at 90% less colony-forming units than at
      the beginning of the temperature load.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The bacterial count during the parallel entrained blank
      (pure drinking water without additives) the following table shows:

      <br>
      [0086] The advantages of this method: For the preservation of
      bacteriological quality no chemical additives are necessary. The
      water retains its natural flavor. By destroying the parent
      colonies and by the temperature sensitivity of the daughter
      colonies formed therefrom the bacteriological status of the
      drinking water is enhanced effect of temperature.<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      <b>Scientist won trial at the "Oberlandesgericht Wien" (High Court
        Vienna,Austria)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Vienna (APA-OTS, 2006-09-06) - In a case that made national news,
      the High Court in Vienna, Austria, ruled in favour of Viennese
      biologist Dr. Erich Eder, after three years of trial. The Tyrolean
      company U.V.O., distributor of the GRANDER® products that
      supposedly "vitalize" water, had taken legal action against Dr.
      Eder as he had criticized their products as being "esoteric
      humbug".<br>
      <br>
      Scientists and consumer protection organizations have known for
      long about the inefficacy of the Grander® devices: "It remains
      unexplained to me why these devices still are allowed to be sold.
      They obviously have no effect whatsoever", says Dr. Eder, an
      author and reviewer for the well-regarded scientific journal
      'Hydrobiologia', and last year’s winner of the distinguished
      Science Encouragement Prize of the City of Vienna.<br>
      <br>
      The final ruling of the Court: Dr. Eder is allowed to state that
      Grander technology and/or the Grander water are nothing but
      pseudoscientific humbug originating from esoteric ideas. Likewise,
      Dr. Eder's moral reproach of the fact that people suffering from
      serious diseases like boreliosis or cancer could be brought to
      trust the effects of the "miracle water" and do without urgently
      required medical treatment, was considered as justified.<br>
      <br>
      Regarding a clear case of fraud, the Court regarded Dr. Eder's
      proof as insufficient, citing the Grander® distributor's three
      month free return "satisfaction guarantee" provided to the
      customers. Eder: "This part of the ruling is purely a legal
      technicality - I am proud of having cleared up this company's
      wrong allegations". Dr. Eder doubts that customers would recognize
      the inefficacy of the Grander devices fast enough for them to
      return them within three months.<br>
      <br>
      Evidence put forward by scientific experts requested by the
      tribunal confirmed Dr. Eder's statement that no effect of Grander®
      water could be proven scientifically. The High Court has ruled in
      favour for Dr. Eder in a total of 88% of the claims. Recently in
      2005, Grander® "technology" distributor Ecoworld NZ Ltd has been
      fined $60,000 in the Hamilton District Court for misleading people
      about the benefits of the Grander® water "treatment" system. The
      court also ordered compensation to be paid to consumers who
      purchased the product during the period under investigation. Dr.
      Eder: "I demand and explanation from the Austrian Science
      Minister, Elisabeth Gehrer: Why was Johann Grander, whose
      ineffective "invention" now has been officially ruled 'esoteric
      humbug', awarded with the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science?
      When will this distinction be revoked?"<br>

      <br>
      Science is defined as a systematically ordered body of known
      facts, and regulation for obtaining and ordering further
      knowledge. Not all information presented as science or 'known
      fact' is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Particularly on the
      World Wide Web, a lot of hoaxes and misunderstandings circulate.
      These hoaxes presented as fact are called pseudoscience. On this
      page, we present a number of known hoaxes and myths concerning
      water, specifically water composition, drinking water, and water
      flows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Water composition</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Structure Altered Water (SAW)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Many claims are made when it comes to water, but none were so
      unmistakably proven wrong, as the claim that SAW was good for our
      health. Some people claiming to be scientists attempted to sell to
      the public water with altered water clusters, supposedly better
      for your health because it would remove toxic compounds from the
      body. These water clusters would be larger, smaller, or
      differently shaped. The scientific community did not support these
      claims. Influencing water in such a way is impossible, given that
      water clusters do not even have any observable properties.
      Scientists claim that statements to the effect of altering water
      clusters were only made as a sales trick.<br>
      <br>
      Now, we want to focus on one of the claims concerning water
      cluster alterations, specifically. It is stated that SAWs promote
      cellular hydration. This seems to be a remarkable claim, when you
      look at it from a chemist’s point of view. Cellular hydration, or
      adding water to cells, is only possible when osmotic pressure
      inside the cells is higher, for instance when more salts are
      present inside the cell. Now, would altered water clusters,
      chemical formula H2O be able to alter cellular osmotic pressure?
      We think this is a rather obvious misunderstanding, and other
      claims as to the mechanism of SAW may be, as well. Examples
      include that drinking SAW would reverse ageing, enhance removal of
      toxins from the body, energize the body, and aid treatment of
      breathing disorders such as asthma. All are questionable, and
      unproven scientifically.<br>
      <br>
      We want to pay attention to one case specifically, namely that of
      Johan Grander. He claimed that water has a memory, and that this
      memory can aid in cleaning water to such an extent that it would
      actually cure people. The mechanism was simple: make water with a
      clean memory (so-called revitalized water), and let it pass
      polluted water in counter-flow. The memory of the polluted water
      would than be influenced by the unpolluted water, revitalizing it
      and cleaning it. People drinking this revitalized water claimed
      their illnesses were cured, such as acne, joint pains and hernias.
      However, the actual mechanism of the revitalized water was never
      proven, and many claim this is a typical case of placebo effect.<br>
