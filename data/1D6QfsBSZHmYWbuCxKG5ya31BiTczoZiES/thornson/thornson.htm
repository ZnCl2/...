      This clip submitted by Dr. Gennady Shipov demonstrates the
      Thornson Inertial Engine - an off-center rotator design shown
      propelling a canoo through a swimming pool during testing by
      Brandson R. Thornson. The Thornson drive is one of many
      mechanical-implementations inertial propulsion concepts, and this
      clip appears to support proponents claims about its workability...<br>
      <br>
      In US Patent #4631971, inventor Brandson R. Thornson published
      schematics indicating that a force-balanced off-center rotator
      could produce a net-directional thrust without expelling
      reaction-mass -- a familiar concept investigated by a number of
      inventors, including Robert Cook, James E. Cox, and many others.
      Dr. Tom Valone described the Thornson test in detail with the
      comment, "In 1990, a 16 foot Grumman canoe and two passengers with
      a gross weight of 450 pounds demonstrated a low acceleration rate
      and propulsion of one mph after traveling 75 feet in a swimming
      pool. The 60 pound Thornson prototype was totally sealed inside a
      plywood case..."<br>
      <br>
      The scientific basis for inertial propulsion is generally
      attributed to Mach's Principle, which states that "the inertia of
      any system is the result of the interaction of that system and the
      rest of the universe". However, recent experimental research by
      Dr. James Woodward and colleagues has called into question the
      conventional wisdom that Mach's Principle can be tested using
      mechanical systems. In Woodward's view, the problem becomes an
      issue of phase-matching that is best solved by a conventional
      electromagnetic ineraction that serves as the basis for his
      "Mach-Lorentz Thruster" technology. <br>

      The Thornson drive is composed of eccentric masses which, when
      rotated properly, causes a cancellation of all forces except in
      one direction.<br>
      <br>
      The Thornson Inertial Engine (TIE) uses the force from a rotating
      inertial mass (the centrifugal force) for producing a linear
      impulse.<br>
      <br>
      An inertial propulsion engine (IPE) is a mechanical device which
      uses a standard electrical motor drive for producing a motion.<br>
      <br>
      Some tests and measurements conducted on Thornson Drive prototype
      have suggested that the IPE force-to-power ratio can be up to
      2000% -- i.e., 20 times higher than a conventional jet engine.
      (see the document from Thomas Valone "Inertial propulsion: the
      Thornson EZKL drives" and also the document from the same author
      "Inertial Propulsion: Concept and Experiment")<br>
      <br>
      Some detailed pictures about the TIE prototype. You may notice the
      four "slider" fixed on the base, for a successfull experiment, the
      TIE device must run on a clean and smooth surface like glasse.<br>
      <br>
      The total weight of the TIE V1.0 is 220 gr. The two spinning
      masses have a very light weight M=1.5 g (each)<br>
      <br>
      I have noticed that a high speed gives better results than heavy
      rotating masse, because the unidirectional trust is more constant
      and this reduces the jerky motion.<br>

      The Thornson Inertial Engine has been put in a plastic box with
      its own power supply so the TIE box was able to move freely on the
      surface of the water.<br>
      <br>
      The weight of the TIE box with the power supply was 862 g.<br>
      <br>
      The two spinning masses have a very light weight M=1.5 g (each)<br>
      <br>
      I have noticed that a high speed gives better results than heavy
      rotating masse, because the unidirectional trust is more constant
      and this reduces the jerky motion.<br>
      <br>
      The measured speed is about 24 meters per hour<br>
      <br>
      This test seems also to confirm the fact that the Thornson
      Inertial Engine produces an unidirectional thrust.<br>
      <br>
      In spite of the light rotating weights used (2x1.5 g), the TIE
      device is able to move itself on smooth surface (for the 220 g TIE
      slider version), and on water (for the 820 g TIE floating box
      version)...<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A propulsion
      device comprises two symmetrical wheels mounted in the same plane
      for rotation about parallel axes at right angles to the plane and
      driven synchronously in opposite directions. Each wheel carries a
      pair of gearwheels which rotate around the axis of the wheel with
      the wheel and support eccentrically a pair of planet masses. The
      masses are arranged such that their distance from the axis of
      rotation of the wheel increases and decreases under control of the
      gearwheels. At a position immediately prior to the maximum
      distance of the planet from the axis, an electromagnetic device
      restrains outward movement of the planet mass so that when
      released the planet mass provides whip-like action inducing a
      resultant force in a direction at right angles to the plane
      containing the axes of the wheels.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to an apparatus for developing a propulsion
      force, which force can be used to propel the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Propulsion of an object without contact with a relatively fixed
      body for example the ground or a planet surface is generally only
      obtained by movement of air or other gases in opposite direction
      to the movement of the object under the effect of jet or propellor
      systems. In the absence of a suitable atmosphere, for example in
      space, propulsion is generally obtained by rocket systems or by
      other systems which involve the projection of particles at high
      velocity from the object. Such systems of course require the
      consumption of fuel since the fuel must form the particles to be
      projected.<br>
      <br>
      Attempts have been made for many years to develop a propulsion
      system which generates linear movement from a rotational drive.
      Examples of this type of arrangement are shown in a book entitled
      "The Death of Rocketry" published in 1980 by Joel Dickenson and
      Robert Cook.<br>
      <br>
      However none of these arrangements has in any way proved
      satisfactory and if any propulsive effect has been obtained this
      has been limited to simple models.<br>
      <br>
      It is one object of the present invention, therefore, to provide
      an improved propulsion system which obtains propulsive force in a
      resultant direction without the necessity for the opposite
      projection of particles.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the invention provides an apparatus for developing a
      propulsion force comprising two symmetrical bodies, support means
      mounting the bodies for rotation about parallel spaced first axes
      and driving means for synchronously rotating the symmetrical
      bodies about the respective axes in opposite directions, each body
      including a pair of planet masses, means mounting each planet mass
      on the respective body, said mounting means being arranged such
      that the respective mass can freely rotate eccentrically about a
      second axis parallel to the first and such that the second axis
      rotates with the body about the first and moves radially relative
      to the first in timed relation to the rotation of the body so as
      to move during each cycle of rotation of the body from a position
      of minimum spacing to a position of maximum spacing and back to
      the position of minimum spacing from the first, and means for
      cyclically inhibiting and releasing rotation of the planet mass
      about the respective second axis so as to cause the planet mass to
      pivot inwardly relative to the first axis whereby said releasing
      causing a force outwardly of the first axis with the bodies
      arranged such that a reultant force from said forces lies at right
      angles to a plane adjoining the axes.<br>
      <br>
      The inhibiting means preferably is arranged on the body for
      rotation therewith and uses electromagnetic forces to restrain the
      movement of the planet mass. In addition the positioning of the
      electromagnetic restraining device is such that the planet mass is
      released immediately prior to its position of maximum spacing from
      the first axis so that it provides a whip-like action while
      travelling at its maximum velocity.<br>
      <br>
      The use of this basic technique can be incorporated into a vehicle
      propulsion system by providing four such bodies with the axes
      arranged at the corners of a rectangle so that by changing the
      body with which each body is associated in a pair from one
      adjacent body to another adjacent body forces in four different
      directions can be obtained. This effect can be further enhanced by
      mounting the bodies in pairs around the periphery of a circular
      support frame.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably the bodies are in form of wheels or discs which support
      the planet masses and gearwheels for controlling the movement of
      the axes of the planet masses.<br>
      <br>
      With the foregoing in view, and other advantages as will become
      apparent to those skilled in the art to which this invention
      relates as this specification proceeds, the invention is herein
      described by reference to the accompanying drawings forming a part
      hereof, which includes a description of the best mode known to the

      <br>
      Referring firstly to FIGS. 1, 2 and 3, one example of a body or
      EZKL is illustrated and comprises a housing 10 formed in three
      sections 11, 12 and 13. The section 11 comprises a relatively
      thick plate having a pair of bores 15 formed approximately half
      the way through the plate, the bores being of such a dimension
      that they intersect adjacent the centre of the circular plate 14
      and approach approximately the outer wall thereof. The bearings
      incorporating a ball-race, support a pair of discs 18, 19 for
      rotation in the plate.<br>
      <br>
      The second portion 12 comprises a circular plate concentric with
      the plate 14 so as to close the bores 15 and similarly provides
      counter bores for receiving a pair of bearing rings 20, 21
      symmetrically to the bearing rings 16, 17. Similarly, the bearing
      rings 20, 21 support discs 22, 23 for rotation about the same axes
      as the discs 18, 19. The discs 18, 22 are linked by a pin 24 so
      they co-rotate and similarly the discs 19, 23 are mounted upon a
      shaft keyed to a respective gear wheel 26, 27 for co-rotation with
      the respective disc. The shaft is also mounted in bearings 28, 29
      provided in the third section 13 of the housing.<br>
      <br>
      In this way, two separate wheels, one provided by the discs 18,
      22, the pin 24, the shaft, the gear wheel 26 and mounted for
      rotation in three bearings, and the other being provided
      symmetrically by the other discs and co-operating portions are
      provided. The two wheels are driven in the same direction by a
      co-operation with a stationary gear 30 mounted in bearings 31
      provided on the portion 13 while the body as a whole is rotated by
      a shaft 32 driven by means (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      It will be noted that the pins 24, 25 are mounted eccentrically
      relative to the axis of rotation of the respective wheel. It will
      also be noted that the wheels are driven in opposite directions at
      the same rate of rotation and hence remain in synchronism.<br>
      <br>
      The pins 24, 25 are mounted near the periphery of the discs and
      each supports a respective planet mass 33, 34 each of which is, as
      shown in FIG. 1, circular in plan view and mounted eccentrically
      relative to the pin such that its centre of mass is spaced from
      the axis of the respective pin. The bores 15 are of such a
      dimension that under normal rotation of the discs 18, 19 about the
      respective rotation axis, the respective mass 33, 34 is flung
      outwardly so as to lie along a radius joining the rotation axis
      and the pivot axis of the respective body. The dimension of the
      bore 15 is chosen such that it is circular with a radius slightly
      greater than the distance of the furthest point of the mass 33, 34
      from the respective rotation axis.<br>
      <br>
      The movement of the gears 26, 27 and the crank pins 24, 25 through
      180 DEG of the body movement at 45 DEG spacing is illustrated in
      FIGS. 11 through 15 and it will be seen that each crank or pin
      varies in distance from the axis of the stationary gear 30 with
      the greatest distance of the crank 24 in FIG. 11 and the shortest
      distance in FIG. 15.<br>
      <br>
      Also in each of the plates 14 is provided a partly annular cut-out
      35, 36 each of which contains an electromagnetic coil 37, 38,
      powered by a power source and timing device schematically
      indicated at 39. The electromagnets 37, 38 act to inhibit the
      outward movement of the respective mass, one of which is indicated
      in FIG. 4 in various positions of its movement.<br>
      <br>
      The path of the rotational movement of the pin 25 is indicated 251
      and the rotation axis of the disc 19 comprising part of the wheel,
      is indicated 252. The path of movement of rotation axis 252 is
      indicated at 301. Four positions of the mass 34 are indicated
      respectively at A through D and it will be noted that the position
      C is inhibited inwarwdly of its normal position so that the centre
      of mass of the planet mass 34 in the positions B and C is no
      longer on the radius joining the rotation axis 252 and the pivot
      axis 25.<br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 5, the position D is shown and also at D1 is shown the
      position immediately prior to the position D where it will be
      noted that the centre of mass of the planet mass has been drawn
      inwardly relative to the rotation axis 252 and rearwardly relative
      to the motion of the pin 25.<br>
      <br>
      It will be noted that the effect of the electromagnets or coils
      36, 37 is limited to one portion of the cycle of the wheels and
      immediately downstream of the effect of the coils, the mass is
      free to swing outwardly about the pivot axis or pin 25 and
      relative to the rotation axis 252.<br>
      <br>
      The pulling force is produced by the whip-like increased momentum
      of a dense mass provided by the bodies magnified through a
      centrifugal force when each body completes this acceleration phase
      with an abrupt stop upon its return to its normal orbit path and
      simultaneously it resumes normal orbiting. This very brief abrupt
      stopping action produces the pulling impulse caused in effect
      within the device and transfer this unidirectional force to that
      which the device is anchored or attached upon.<br>
      <br>
      The bodies are concentrically, bearing mounted upon the crank
      portion of the discs. The motion of the planets is of a
      pendulum-type nature through 360 DEG. The device therefore
      comprises two planets mounted opposite each other and contained
      within their own half section of the device. The action of each
      planet is contained in its own section area. The main drive shaft
      32 is mounted on bearings (not shown) and secured, by means not
      visible in the section of FIG. 2, to the frame 10. The gear 30 is
      fixed to bearing 31 and thence to a control mechanism (not shown)
      to maintain it stationary at controlled positions such that the
      shaft 32 can rotate relative to the gear but is meshed relative to
      the gears 26, 27 to ensure their maintaining of positioning of the
      crank shafts during operation. The housing 10 rotates around the
      gear 30 so that the gears 26, 27 complete two rotations each as
      the housing 10 completes one rotation. When the three gears are
      aligned vertically with the crank portion or pin in an extended or
      outward position and away from the device main axle 32.
      Arrangement of this positioning with the device rotating, creates
      a new planetary orbit within the device. From external
      observation, this orbit takes on the appearance of an illusionary
      wheel within the device but its illusionary axis is away from the
      axis of the shaft 32.<br>
      <br>
      The electromagnets 36, 37 have the ability to influence and hold
      each planet, when activated. The rotation carries the planets to
      and away from the electromagnetc field. The electromagnets act to
      maintain a short radius of the planet relative to the device axle
      during a specific rotation of the planet orbit and through a
      special electronic timing device cease magnetic activity releasing
      the planet at a specific location to return to its orbit where its
      mass, ending is interrupted journey, produces the pulling force,
      prior to resuming its normal orbit path and resuming into the
      cycle. This pulling force release point location is isolated to
      that position where the radius between the planet and the device
      axle is at its greatest distance. The velocity of each planet is
      in a constant harmonious cycle of change.<br>
      <br>
      As the rotation of the housing 10 is held constant, the planet
      velocity is at a maximum at the release point as the radius to
      that of the axle 32 is at its most extended point. Its velocity
      decreases as its gear brings the planet closer to the axle 32.
      Upon one half turn of the device, the planet crank shaft gear has
      completed one complete rotation and reduced the radius of the
      planet relative to the axle 32 to its minimum length therefore
      reducing the planet's orbit velocity to its slowest orbit speed.
      The planet orbit velocity continuously increasing then decreasing
      takes on a cycle wave length like pattern in regard to momentum
      forces. This pattern is in balance conversely with the opposite
      planet actions occurring simultaneously. One planet balances the
      actions of the other laterally but not perpendicularly.<br>
      <br>
      Operating in a 0 gravity field, a single device as shown would
      conform to Newtonian law and simply oscillate around its centre of
      mass as there would be no stabilizing factor to aid the device.
      The pulling force emittor would cause the device to travel in a
      circular path due to initial lack of stability or footing to push
      against.<br>
      <br>
      Hence it is of necessity that a device rotating in a clockwise
      motion is linked and joined together with a second device as shown
      in FIG. 7 rotating in a counter-clockwise rotation, vertically
      aligned, with their pulling pulsations directed together in one
      direction perpendicular to the centre line of their main axles
      laterally aligned. The opposite rotating devices are controlled by
      a device schematically indicated at 40 to rotate synchronously in
      opposite directions and are turned to emit their pulsations timed
      exactly together. All lateral movement that occurred with a single
      device has now been neutralized or negated due to opposite and
      equal action and reaction and is balanced through the interaction
      of one device upon the other. The perpendiclar motion of the
      tandem devices has not been neutralized and when magnets are not
      activated, each device moves forward and backward between its
      centre of balance. An inching forward effect may be experienced in
      operation during that period where magnets are not activated in 0
      gravity. These tandem devices with magnet actuation combined with
      the lateral stabilization through interaction balancing maintain
      balance as each planet is held in, maintaining the short radii
      between the planet and device axle uniformly during the planet
      loading cycle portion of orbit. The pulling forces at the release
      points of the two devices are greater than that momentum force of
      the opposite planets at their minimum radii to the device's axle,
      thereby creating movement in one direction of the devices.
      Therefore, any objects attached to the tandem devices is carried
      in that direction of the pulling force release point.<br>
      <br>
      The acceleration of the craft in a 0 gravity or normal gravity
      field remains constant if rotation is maintained and hence the
      velocity continuously increases.<br>
      <br>
      Under 0 gravity conditions, decrease of velocity is achieved
      through reversing the direction of the pulling force release
      points of the device in the opposite direction.<br>
      <br>
      Manoeuverability is attained in a similar manner through the
      control of the stabilizing gears of the devices together with the
      rate of rotation and the magnetic field strength of the
      electromagnets.<br>
      <br>
      Acceleration of the device can be controlled by varying the rate
      of revolution of the device, and the magnetic strength of the
      electromagnets. Momentum acceleration is logarithmically
      continuous during the operation of the device.<br>
      <br>
      A directional change over 360 DEG plane is attained through
      adjusting the position of the stabilizing gear 30 which re-locates
      the release point of the pulling pulsations of the planets.<br>
      <br>
      To cease movement, that is to effect a stopping action of the
      device and of any objects attached thereto, the stabilizing gear
      30 of the device is reversed in direction. The pulling pulsations
      then act at 180 DEG relative to the initial direction to bring the
      device to a stop.<br>
      <br>
      It is to be noted that each device must be tuned to operate
      properly. With the planet in the 6 o'clock position (as shown in
      FIG. 6 with the shortest radius between the planet and the axle
      32), the corresponding gear 27 turns in the same direction as the
      wheel. The crank portion carrying the free moving planet begins to
      take the planet back to the electromagnetic field. The magnetic
      force takes hold of the planet restricting the planet from
      maintaining its centrifugally created position. The planet pickup
      begins at the 5 o'clock position. This action restricts the radius
      between the centre of the planet to the main wheel axle to assure
      the length compared to its natural centrifugally held position.
      This holding action is maintained until that line from the centre
      of the main wheel axle and the centre of the crank gear axle
      reaches the approximate position of 1 o'clock. Depending upon the
      r.p.m. of the device and the momentum affecting the size of the
      planet mass, the timed deactivation of the magnet will occur
      within an advance and retard control. When the planet is released
      at 1 o'clock, the timing must be such that mass reaches its
      extended centrifugal position upon reaching the 12 o'clock
      location.<br>
      <br>
      The range of pulling force strength is determined by the size of
      the device and its maximum usable rate of revolution. Each pair of
      devices delivering a greater pulling force than their weight on
      earth determine the number of such devices to be used to
      accomplish the work required.<br>
      <br>
      The most adaptable and suitable method of installation to power a
      vehicle craft utilizing this pulling force only for craft mobility
      will be circular and internally mounted for servicing access. The
      pairs of devices will be matched opposite each other at the ends
      of diameter at the periphery of the circle of devices. This is
      illustrated in FIGS. 8 and 9 where the pairs are illustrated
      schematically at 41 and the circular frame at 42 the mate or pair
      to each device can be interchanged depending upon the need for
      craft manoeuverability. Thus for example a mating of the wheels 43
      and 44 in a pair will cause an upward force while changing the
      mated pair to 43 and 45 will cause a sideways movement. Thus the
      pairs formed by wheels 41, 43, 45 and 46 form a rectangular cell
      of wheels indicated generally at 451. Two pairs of wheels 431 are
      arranged in a plane at right angles to that of the wheels 41, 43,
      45, 46 to provide maneuverability around the axis of the frame 42.
      The functions of the devices would be computer controlled,
      particularly with regard to the rate of revolution, magnetic field
      strength, advance and retard of magnetic release and central
      stabilizing gear direction.<br>
      <br>
      The motion of the planets of the pair of devices is schematically
      illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
      <br>
      The planet is taken into its orbit through its attraction to the
      electromagnets causing a warping effect on the planet visual orbit
      path as shown. As explained previously, the pendulum mounted
      planet is turned 90 DEG away from its natural centrifugally
      created position through the effect of the electromagnets on its
      motion. The planet's momentum and velocity are at their greatest
      during this orbit phase and the momentum is magnified as the
      planet is released by the electromagent allowed through
      centrifigal force to return to the original centrifugally created
      orbital path at the top of the cycle or the release point. The
      velocity of the planet now beings deceleration action until it
      reaches that point opposite and furthest away from the release
      point which is referred to as the 0 point or shortest radius
      between the planet and the main wheel frame axle.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore, as the main wheel retains a set continuous rotation, it
      is observed that the momentum of the planet is a variable,
      increasing and decreasing pulsations within the wheel.<br>
      <br>
      Visualizing the main wheel and describing the planet's position,
      with the magnets not activiated, it is noted that their relative
      momentum is equal at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. It is further
      noted that at the 0 point or 6 o'clock position, the momentum of
      the planet mass is less than that relative to the mass momentum at
      3 and 9 o'clock positions. The planet velocity at the release
      point or 12 o'clock position is at its greatest.<br>
      <br>
      When the electromagnets are activated, there is produced a visual
      warping of this orbit path as shown in FIG. 6. This effect is
      produced by a magnet holding the planets steadfast after leaving
      the 0 point where it begins the acceleraton portion of the cycle.
      Therefore, the planet's momentum remains constant and does not
      increase during this holding portion of the orbit's cycle. The
      planet is out of its centrifugal balance position. Prior to the
      planet reaching the release point area, allowing the planet to
      return to its centrifugal position. During the planet's return, it
      is observed that the velocity of the planet has been further
      increased through centrifugal force as the planet pendulums itself
      to its original orbit path. The inertia of the kinetic energy of
      the planet mass is dispersed at the end of its momentum
      acceleration completion at the release point position resuming its
      orbit position and again begins its next orbit velocity changing
      cycle.<br>
      <br>
      The planet therefore produces a pulling effect upon the disc to
      which it is attached and this pull is transferred to the main
      wheel frame to which it is seccured.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIG. 10 there is shown a modified arrangement
      incorporating a wheel generally indicated at 50 of the type
      illustrated in FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 incorporating the stationary gear
      30 and the rotating gears 26 and 27 which provide the axes which
      rotate around the shaft 32 (not shown in this figure). In place of
      the planet masses 33 and 34 which are formed as simple pendulums
      eccentrically mounted on the gears, the planet masses of this
      arrangement are provided by weights 51 and 52 which are
      constrained to move within a pair of rings 53 and 54. The rings
      are carried on the rotating gears 26 and 27 eccentrically relative
      thereto so that again the masses 51 and 52 are constrained to move
      relative to the wheel 50 in a path illustrated in dotted line at
      55. In view of the eccentricity of the mounting of the rings on
      the gears, the path lies closer to the axis of the fixed gear 30
      at the 6 o'clock position as illustrated at 52 than it does at the
      12 o'clock position as illustrated at 51. Thus the planet is
      moving at a maximum velocity at the largest distance at the 12
      o'clock position. The use of rings in place of the rigid eccentric
      mounting of the pendulums of the earlier embodiment enables a
      greater degree of freedom of the movement of the masses 51 and 52
      so that a greater kink or distortion of the path can be obtained
      by the electromagnetic restraining devices schematically indicated
      at 56 and 57.<br>
      <br>
      The position of the rings on the gears can be adjusted so as to
      vary the eccentricity whereby the movement of the masses can be
      tuned for greatest efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      In addition in this embodiment the electromagnetic devices 56, 57
      have a plurality of separate fingers or portions 58 which can be
      separately actuated in order to control the timing and positioning
      of the electromagnetic effect. It will be appreciated that as the
      angular velocity of the wheel 50 changes under control of the
      device 40 illustrated in FIG. 7, the path of the planet masses 51
      and 52 will vary and therefore in order to properly tune the
      device the position and timing of the electromagnetic effect must
      also be variable.<br>
      <br>
      The device shown in FIG. 8 is in a suitable propulsion system for
      a vehicle. A simplified propulsion system can be obtained using
      two rectangular cells of the type indicated at 451 each of four
      wheels and arranged at right angles. This can be mounted in a
      propulsion pack including a suitable power source in the form of
      electric motor for driving the wheels.<br>
      <br>
      In a further alternative arrangement (not shown) one or more of
      the rectangular cells formed by four such wheels could be mounted
      on a belt or harness which could be particularly effective in
      supporting a parapelegic or other person who would otherwise
      immobile.<br>
      <br>
      Since various modifications can be made in my invention as
      hereinabove described, and many apparently widely different
      embodiments of same made within the spirit and scope of the claims
      without departing from such spirit and scope, it is intended that
      all matter contained in the accompanying specification shall be
      interpreted as illustrative only and not in a limiting sense.<br>
