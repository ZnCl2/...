      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some metals, metalloids,
          alloys and metallic compounds, when placed in near Absolute
          Zero thermal environments, undergo significant decreases in
          ohmic resistance; at a certain temperature, or within a narrow
          range of temperatures -- termed a material's "transition
          temperature" or "transition temperature range" -- the ohmic
          resistance falls abruptly to practically zero. For a conductor
          of a given length and cross-sectional area with a measured R
          ohms of resistance at 25º C., the resistivity is determined to
          be a certain magnitude. As the ambient temperature of teh
          conductor is decreased, it has been found that there occurs a
          linear decrease in resistivity with temperature. Such linear
          behavior, however, is not the phenomenon of superconductivity.
          Superconductivity is the term applied to the sudden departure
          from linear behavior and the abrupt attainment of near zero
          ohmic resistance. At this point, it is said that the conductor
          has entered the "superconducting state", and it has been found
          that said conductors in said state are capable of passing very
          large magnitudes of current with a minimum of applied voltage.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although it has been
          theorized that ambient or room temperature superconductivity
          might be possible, until now this has remained theory only
          although such diverse uses as high voltage long distance
          transmission lines, heat transfer means for heat pumps, and
          by-passes of damaged nerves in the spinal colum have been
          envisioned.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To investigate Carroll's
          prediction of elctrical superconductivity at normal ambient
          temperatures in thin filaments of bismuth metal, a technique
          was developed to create filamentary conductors from metal
          colloids suspended in a thermosetting resin. The application
          of an electrical field across the colloidal suspension as
          found to force migration of metal particulates parallel to
          electric field lines. The application of heat to the molten
          mixture was found necessary to ensure uniform distribution of
          suspended particles.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In order to bypass the very
          high voltage requirements to obtain filaments of at least one
          centimeter length, a technique of electrode extension was
          developed whichinvolved the application of about 1 kv
          potential and slow retraction of one of the electrodes through
          the colloidal suspension. the retractile electrode was usually
          a thin metal strip. As the pin electrode was drawn fron the
          metal strip, molten particulates migrated toestablish a
          filament between the pin tip and a point on the metal strip.
          Exptended filament lengths were easily obtained withno
          increase in applied voltage. It was also found that
          multiplicities of such filaments could be formed
          simultaneously if several pin electrodes were used. Formation
          curent was about 1 mA for each filament.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The time required for the
          prodcution of filmanets depends on the length desired. For
          filaments of one centimeter length, formation time ws found to
          be about 30 minutes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It was determined that a 10
          to 15% by volume mixture of bismuth to resin was sufficient
          for this procedure. Since molten particulates were desired,
          the mixture was heated to well beyond the melting point of the
          metal, typicaly 300º C.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the early stage of
          experimentation, electrical tests revealed abrupt drops in
          resistance to extremely low values once a tansition volage was
          attained, which was usually 3 volts dc or less. Reversing
          direction of current resulted in equal behavior. Subsequent
          improvement in separation tecnique resulted in filaments with
          no measurable resistance.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It wa found that curent as
          high as 0.5 A could be passed comfortably by teh Bi filament
          and ohmic contacts at its ends. Excessive Joule heat generated
          in the ohmic contacts resulted in system failure at higher
          currents, but it was found that a filament could pass as high
          as 10 A prior ro loss of continuity.</font> </p>

          On the basis of the Carroll theory, the experimental findings
          indicate that large superconducting components of current have
          been obtained in thin filaments of the metal made by this
          process. The theory predicts that filaments of about 10 atomic
          diameters cross-section will provide complete
          superconductivity, but such filament uniformity has not been

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates to
          electrical conductors and a method of forming the same and
          more particularly to electrically conducting filaments of
          submicron diameter for superconducting of electricity

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION:</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some metals, metalloids,
          alloys and metallic compounds, when placed in near Absolute
          Zero thermal environments, undergo significant decreases in
          ohmic resistance; at a certain temperature, or within a narrow
          range of temperatures--termed a materials's "transition
          temperature" or "transition temperature range"--the ohmic
          resistance falls abruptly to practically zero. For a conductor
          of a given length and cross-sectional area with a measured R
          ohms of resistance at 25.degree. C., the resistivity is
          determined to be a certain magnitude. As the ambient
          temperature of the conductor is decreased, it has been found
          that there occurs a linear decrease in resistivity with
          temperature. Such linear behavior, however, is not the
          phenomenon of superconductivity. Superconductivity is the term
          applied to the sudden departure from linear behavior and the
          abrupt attainment of near zero ohmic resistance. At this
          point, it is said that the conductor has entered the
          "superconducting state", and it has been found that said
          conductors in said state are capable of passing very large
          magnitudes of current with a minimum of applied voltage.</font>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF
          INVENTION:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">After much research and
          study into the phenomenon of superconductivity and the
          problems associated therewith in obtaining the same at ambient
          temperature, the present invention has been developed which
          accomplishes this condition at 25 to 30 degrees Centigrade.
          This is done through the use of extremely fine filaments
          having a diameter of between 10 and 1,000 A formed from
          elements which normally have a high resistance to current
          flow. Through practice of the method taught by the present
          invention, it is now practical to consider not only building
          electrical transmission long lines, spinal cord by-passes and
          improved heat transfer means for heat pumps, but also many
          other applications in such fields as microelectronics and
          computer technology.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In view of the above, it is
          an object of the present invention to provide a method of
          producing a filament which will superconduct at temperatures

          length L centimeters and cross-sectional area A square
          centimeters in an ambient temperature environment of T
          .degree.C. by means of an ammeter it is found that a current
          of I amperes is passed by the conductor. By means of Ohm's
          Law, the resistance R ohms offered to the passage of electric

          to the conclusion that resistance is determined by the

          cooling materials, the resistivity is decreased. The reduction
          in resistivity is attributed to the reduced rates of lattice
          vibrations resulting in increased drift velocity. For many
          materials, a plot of resistivity versus temperature as the
          material is cooled to very low temperatures reveals a linear
          relationship. Some materials, however, on approaching absolute
          zero (0.degree. K.), suddenly lose nearly all trace of
          electrical resistance. It is said that the materials have then
          entered the "superconducting state". The temperature at which,
          or the range of temperature within which this practically
          resistanceless condition is attained is called the material's
          "transition temperature(s)". Most metals which have been found
          to exhibit this behavior do so below 10.degree. K.; many of

          Although a sudden drop in resistance is observed at that

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The conducting behavior of a
          material below its transition temperature is described on the
          basis of the "two-fluid" model of superconductivity: one
          "fluid" consists of electrons in a normal conduction process
          expected at the particular ambient temperature of the
          conductor; the other consists of high speed electrons whose
          passage along the conductor is apparently unimpeded.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From the work of J. Bardeen,
          L. N. Cooper, and J. R. Schrieffer Physical Review, 108, 1175
          (1957), the high speed electron flow component consists of
          paired electrons with oppositely directed spins. These pairs
          can pass along the conductor with velocities in excess of the
          thermal agitation velocity tending to disrupt their flow. It
          has been postulated that the fast electron component has a
          flow velocity of the order of 10.sup.7 cm/sec.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It appears reasonable to
          treat conduction electron flow as a fluid flow. Considering
          the conduction electron density of copper found in (6), the
          particle density is within range of particle densities in
          fluid media.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">All fluids exhibit
          viscosity, or internal friction (resistance). Just as a
          coefficient of viscosity (fluid resistivity) can be determined
          for a material fluid, R. L. Carroll The Eternity Equation
          (1976) derived an expression for a coefficient of electronic
          viscosity (electrical resistivity). The form is ##EQU5## Where

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">.mu.=coefficient of
          electronic viscosity, spin/cm.sup.3</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It can be deduced from (9)
          that if paired electrons with opposite spins can be formed, N
          can be reduced, and, subsequently, .mu.(electrical
          resistivity). The attractiveness of Carroll's development is
          that resistivity reduction is not temperature dependent:
          pairing of electrons with opposite spins should be possible at
          any temperature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Carroll (ibid.) suggested
          that the desired pairing could be effected if electrons were
          forced into proximity upon entry into an extremely narrow
          conductor: said conductor would have to be of a material
          wherein electron flow velocities under normal conditions of
          conduction were quite high. If extremely narrow conductors
          could be created of such a material, the thermal agitation
          velocity at ambient temperatures would have little effect on
          the electron pairs. Carroll further expected that forced
          proximity would cause the electron to pair in an orientation
          of least potential; i.e., with spins annulling.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since the attainment of
          superconductivity, or a close approximation to it, at normal
          temperatures is very desirable, laboratory investigations of
          Carroll's theories were performed. The material selected for
          the thin conductors were bismuth since the metal is known to
          contribute only one conduction electron per 10.sup.5 to
          10.sup.6 atoms. This places a restricton on N in equation (9).
          The atomic density of bismuth is 2.82.times.10.sup.22
          atoms/cm.sup.3. If the mid-range of conduction electron
          contribution is taken to be one per 5.times.10.sup.5 atoms,
          then the conduction electron density in bismuth is ##EQU6##</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From equation (5), if one
          microampere (10.sup.-6 ampere) is passed along a bismuth
          conductor of cross-sectional area 10.sup.-10 cm.sup.2, the
          drift velocity is found to be ##EQU7##</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Comparison of (11) with (4)
          reveals that the drift velocity in bismuth is quite high and
          that a thin wire of the order of 10.sup.-6 cm diameter or less
          can be expected to provide a drift velocity of the order of
          10.sup.8 cm/sec, or higher; if a current flow velocity of this
          magnitude could be attained, a large fast-electron component
          should be attainable at normal temperatures.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The literature of solid
          state physics was found to contain a few references to
          resistivity anomalies discovered in thin bismuth wires of
          10.sup.-4 cm diameter: Eucken and Forster, "Gottinger
          Nachrichten", Math. Phys. Klasse, Fachgruppe 2, 1, 43 (1934);
          and 10.sup.-5 cm diameter: Gurvitch, Journal of Low
          Temperature Physics, 38, 5/6, 777 (1980). Suppositions have
          been made to explain the anomalous behavior in these thin
          bismuth wires but there is no general acceptance of any one
          reason. If Carroll's spin interaction theory is applied to
          interpret the observed behavior: due to the high speed current
          flow in a contracted space, some electrons--by virtue of their
          proximity--are forced to pair in an orientation of least
          resistance; the increase in the number of pairs with annulled
          spins results in a decrease of resistivity. In view of the
          experimental evidence, it appeared that Carroll might be
          correct, and it was expected that significant resistivity
          anomalies would occur in bismuth wires of diameters less than
          10.sup.-5 cm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The thinnest bismuth wires
          that have been produced by mechanical techniques are claimed
          by Gurvitch (ibid). The employment of his techniques to form
          wires of 10.sup.-6 cm diameter, however, would require the
          application of approximately 22,000 pounds per square inch of
          pressure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">No practical procedure
          existed prior to this invention to form wires, or thin
          conducting filaments, with diameters less than 10.sup.-5 cm.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Filaments were formed with
          diameters within the range of 10-1000A; following their
          formation, tests were performed at room temperature by
          applying various magnitudes of low DC voltage across the ends
          of the filaments, and graphs were made of the recorded current
          flow through them and the effective resistance offered to
          current flow by them.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">From equation (2), and
          taking the value of the resistivity of bismuth at 20.degree.
          C. given in the herein table of resistivities of various
          metals, the resistance expected from the filaments ranged from
          10.sup.5 to 10.sup.6 ohms. In addition, extrapolation of
          well-known tables of maximum allowable current carrying
          capacities of conductors of various cross-section led to the
          expectation that current of the order of picoamperes
          (10.sup.-12 ampere) should be the maximum order of magnitude
          of current passed by the filaments. It was found, however,
          that the filaments were capable of passing much higher
          currents, and most electrical tests were performed by passing
          currents through each filament within a range of 100-500
          milliamps. In some cases, as much as 2 amperes were passed
          through single filaments.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A typical graph of the
          increase in current flow with an increase in voltage for many
          of the samples is provided in <a href="#fig1">FIG. 1</a>. It
          is observed that at some threshold voltage, the current
          appears to increase without bound.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In many samples it was
          observed that, once the threshold voltage was attained, the
          current flow suddenly increased, as shown in <a href="#fig1">FIG.













            1</a>, but the voltage drop across the filaments decreased
          as the current approached a maximum allowed by power supply.
          This behavior is illustrated in<a href="#fig2"> FIG. 2</a>.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As the threshold voltage was
          attained, the increase in current flow toward the maximum was
          sudden. If 100 milliamps were passing through a filament just
          prior to reaching the threshold voltage, for example, current
          rose from that value to the maximum available from the power
          supply within a fraction of a second as the threshold voltage
          was reached.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If the graph is made of the
          apparent resistance offered to the current flow as said
          current is increased in most of the samples, it is seen that
          the resistance is decreased to near zero, as shown in <a
            href="#fig3">FIG. 3</a>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For most samples, the
          threshold voltage was found to be between one and five volts.
          If a voltage exceeding the threshold was applied to the
          filaments, and if the power supply was capable of delivering
          high current, it was found that the filaments passed the
          permitted currents instantly and the voltage drops across the
          conductors instantly tended toward zero as illustrated in <a
            href="#fig4">FIG. 4</a>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A few samples exhibited
          extremely low resistance during the testing. For them, it was
          found that the application of only a few millivolts was
          sufficient to render them to behave in a fashion illustrated
          in FIG. 1, except that the threshold voltage was much lower,
          as shown in <a href="#fig5">FIG. 5</a>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Some samples exhibited no
          apparent resistance to current flow. The application of a
          voltmeter across the ends of these filaments as 500 milliamps
          was passed through them indicated zero voltage drop at an
          accuracy of 10.sup.-6 volt.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><a href="#fig6">FIG. 6</a>
          illustrates the basic filament forming apparatus. A voltage is
          applied across the pin points 11 and 12, and as the filament
          material is introduced between the points, the intense
          electrical field forces particles of filament material to
          migrate between points. Sufficient current is passed through
          the aligned particles to cause them to fuse into a solid wire.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The attached leads and pins
          are of ohmic materials, so they will offer some resistance to
          current flow. Ohmmeter measurements made of the pins and
          connected leads yielded a total least resistance of one-tenth
          (0.1) ohm. Following the formation of the practically
          zero-resistance bismuth filaments, ohmmeter measurements
          yielded total resistance values of less than one-tenth ohm.
          When placed in test circuits, graphs made of the applied
          voltage to the recorded current passed by the filaments and
          their associated pins and leads resulted in the discovery that
          the effective resistance was of the order of one-hundreth
          (0.01) ohm.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If R.sub.o is the measured
          resistance of a filament and its attached leads and pins prior
          to its placement in a test circuit, a graph of resistance

            href="#fig7">FIG. 7</a> when the filament and its associated
          leads and pins were placed in test circuits.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The least resistance
          expected was that offered by the pins and the leads, but the
          discovery that the effective resistance was reduced by a
          factor of ten lead to the conclusion that the superconducting
          component was extracting energy from the conductor. The most
          obvious energy that could be extracted was thermal energy
          since its extraction would result in decreased resistance to
          current flow. If this were in fact occurring, it should be
          possible to detect a higher temperature at one pin than the
          other. Currents of up to two amperes were passed through the
          filaments and attached leads, and it was found that
          significant heat transfer did in fact occur. The hotter
          junction was found to be that of the electrode of positive
          potential. Considering that the electrons enter the filament
          at the point of negative potential and are accelerated upon
          entry into the filament toward the positive electrode, and
          considering that the electrons absorb thermal energy from the
          filament and negative electrode as they pass through them, the
          electrons' sudden entry into the ohmically resistive positive
          electrode and subsequent decelerations would cause them to
          radiate the thermal energy that they had absorbed from the
          filament and negative electrode. As the thermal energy is
          radiated into the positive electrode and dissipated into the
          ambient environment, the overall effect is that of cooling the
          conducting path to provide decreased resistance to current
          flow. This leads to the conclusion that if heat could be
          removed from the hot junction at a greater rate than is
          possible in a static air environment of 20.degree. C.
          temperature, the thermal agitation at the hot junction would
          be decreased to provide an even lower negative resistance
          effect.</font> </p>

          transfer along the newly forming filaments. The passage of
          between one and two milliamps through each filament has been
          found to result in the formation of excellent filaments; this
          suggestion, however, is not intended to exclude other
          possibilities. What is important is that sufficient current be
          passed along newly-forming filaments to cause them to become
          thin solid wires threading through a solid insulating and
          supporting material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The terminals designated 18
          and 19 are components by which voltage from source 20 is
          supplied to electrodes 11' and 12' respectively. If 11' and
          12' represent single electrodes, terminals 18 and 19 would
          simply be the points to which leads of opposite potential from
          the basic electrical energy supply circuit--consisting of
          voltage source 20, a current-limiting resistor 17, an ammeter
          16, and associated component connecting conductors--are
          attached.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If 11' and 12' represent a
          multiplicity of electrodes providing for the formation of
          numerous filaments between opposite electrode points
          simultaneously, then terminals 18 and 19 can represent
          conducting plates to which the electrodes are attached, or it
          can represent the point at which each electrode is connected
          to the energy supply. What is important for the formation of a
          multiplicity of filaments is to provide a potential at point
          or points 11 that is opposite to the potential at point or
          points 12. The creation of fields of sufficient intensity will
          result in the simultaneous formation of numerous filaments as
          the conductor particles migrate between electrode termination
          points.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Should it be desirable to
          form filaments of lengths beyond those that can be produced by
          the action of the electric field, or fields, alone, one
          electrode can be retracted with respect to another, or both
          can be retracted, under the continued application of voltage.
          It has been found that increase in filament length by a
          process of electrode retraction is a function of increased
          applied voltage. What is important is to maintain the
          continued migration of conductor particles as the distance of
          separation between electrode termination points 11 and 12 is
          increased.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The molten mixture of
          conductor and insulator is prepared by either of the following
          methods. The conductor can be melted within a molten
          insulator, such as amorphous glass, although this choice of
          insulator is not intended to exclude other insulator
          materials. A ten to fifteen percent by volume mixture of
          conductor to insulator has been found to be adequate for
          filament formation, although other ratios are not excluded.
          The introduction of the well-stirred, nearly homogeneous
          molten mixture between electrode points 11 and 12, across
          which voltage is applied, will result in the formation of thin
          filaments, as above described.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The mixture may also be
          prepared by heating a fine powder form of conductor material
          within a molten insulator to high temperatures until the
          particles have been reduced to the desired cross-sections.
          Certain epoxy resin melting compounds have been used as
          insulator material for this method with excellent results,
          although this suggestion is not meant to exclude the
          employment of other insulator materials. Introduction of this
          mixture between points 11 and 12 under applied voltage will
          also result in permanent solid filaments within a solid
          insulator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The choice of conductor
          materials for the filaments is restricted to those materials
          that can be rendered superconducting, or nearly so, at normal
          ambient temperatures. It has been found that conducting
          materials that contribute very few electrons to the conduction
          process per unit volume, and that do not possess a resistivity
          to correspond to the low conduction electron contribution, are
          those that will exhibit superconducting behavior as current is
          passed along very thin filaments made of the materials. In
          bismuth, for example, the conduction electron contribution is
          of the order of one per hundred thousand atoms, yet the
          metal's resistivity at normal temperatures is about 10.sup.-4
          ohm-cm. For comparison, copper contributes one conduction
          electron per atom, and its resistivity at normal temperatures
          is about 10.sup.-6 ohm-cm. The conduction electron
          contribution of bismuth is of the order of
          one-hundred-thousandths that of copper, yet bismuth's
          resistance to current flow is only one hundred times greater
          than that of copper's. Based on its conduction electron
          contribution, it would be reasonable to expect that bismuth
          ought to be of the order of 100,000 times more resistive than
          copper, but the fact that it is only 100 times more resistive
          than copper places it in the category of normal ambient
          temperature superconductive materials. If n is the ratio of
          conduction electrons contributed per quantity of atoms, an
          order of magnitude for bismuth yields ##EQU8## If n is
          multiplied by the material's resistivity, .rho., at normal
          ambient temperatures, we have an order of magnitude for
          bismuth of ##EQU9## It appears that the elements possessing
          desirable products are those designated the metalloids,
          although some alloys and metallic compounds can also be used
          as filament materials. The use of bismuth for the filament
          material is attractive due to its low melting point
          (271.3.degree. C.), its nonhazardous property, and its 31/3%
          expansion on solidification. Bismuth's expansion on cooling
          assures that the ends of the formed filaments will not become
          disengaged from the electrode termination points 11 and 12 of
          <a href="#fig8">FIG. 8</a>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The following is an example
          of the method of producing one specific type of fiber which
          exhibits properties of electrical superconductivity at ambient
          room temperature.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">An insulating material such
          as epoxy resin is heated to approximately 280.degree.
          Centigrade for at least fifteen minutes. Depending on the
          application and use of the product being formed, a hardening
          catalyst can be added at this time. Next a conducting material
          is added to the liquid insulator. When Bismuth is used as the
          conductor, this is added at 10 to 15 percent by volume to the
          insulator. The insulator and conductor are well mixed to an
          almost homogeneous solution and the mixture is then heated to
          a temperature of between 280.degree. and 310.degree.
          Centigrade for a period of from one to three hours. This
          heating reduces the size of the conductor particles to
          colloidal dimensions having diameters of less than 10,000 A.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Preferably a flat plate type
          electrode corresponding to 11 in <a href="#fig8">FIG. 8 </a>is














          provided within the insulator/conductor solution. Once this
          solution has been heated as described above, one or more pin
          type electrodes corresponding to 12 of <a href="#fig8">FIG. 8</a>
          are placed in the solution near electrode 11 while a voltage
          of between 800 and 1100 volts at between 0.5 and 2 milliamps
          is being applied. When the electrodes approach to within 0.15
          to 3 millimeters of each other, they will generate an intense
          field to cause the conductor material to align between such
          electrodes thus forming a filament. A voltmeter can be
          provided within the voltage circuit to tell when continuity is
          established which takes only a few seconds.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">By the above process, the
          filaments formed are only between 1.5 and 3 millimeters in
          length. The voltage required to establish longer filaments
          very quickly becomes impractical as compared to the small
          increased length obtainable.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To overcome the above length
          limitation and to form filaments of lengths greater than that
          which can be produced by the electrical field alone, the
          electrodes are moved apart from each other in a linear motion.
          It has been determined that a rate of approximately 0.5
          millimeter per minute allows filaments up to 1 centimeter to
          be produced while still maintaining applied voltage in the 800
          to 1100 volt range.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Although filaments of up to
          1 centimeter have been produced by the method hereinabove
          described, greater lengths can, of course, be produced with
          the real limiting factor being determined largely by the
          solidifying properties of the surrounding fluid insulator
          material.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The applied voltage is
          maintained throughout the forming period which, using epoxy
          resin, ordinarily ranges between 30 and 45 minutes. As
          indicated above, a harden catalyst can be used as determined
          appropriate although in many instances is not necessary
          because of the heat applied during the process.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Due to random distribution
          of impurities within the conductor powder, some filaments have
          been found not to initially exhibit the desired conductivity
          after formation. It has been determined that through the
          application of between 200 and 600 volts with a current of up
          to 100 milliamps across such filaments will order the lattice
          structure of the same and sufficiently decrease its
          resistivity to provide the desired conductivity approaching
          that of superconductivity.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is obvious from the above
          that an advantage of the present invention is that the
          conducting behaviors which have until this invention been
          obtained only at extremes of low temperatures can now be
          obtained at normal temperatures. A further advantage is the
          elimination of the need of expensive and high-energy consuming
          refrigeration devices to obtain low resistive high velocity
          electron flows. Since power dissipation by electrical
          conductors is the product of current squared and resistance
          (I.sup.2 R), a still further advantage is to provide for large
          charge transfer with low power dissipation. An even further
          advantage is to provide means by which changes in electron
          flow velocities can be effected at normal temperatures to
          transfer heat.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention may,
          of course, be carried out in other specific ways than those
          herein set forth without departing from the spirit and
          essential characteristics of the invention. The present
          embodiments are, therefore, to be considered in all respects
          as illustrative and not restrictive and all changes coming

              Second International Symposium on Non-Conventional Energy
              Technology</i> (1983)</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What I should like to do
            is to review with you the field of superconductivity. As you
            know, superconductivity at this time is a phenomenon that is
            found to occur at the extremes of low temperature. For those
            of you who are comfortable with the Fahrenheit scale, we are
            talking about electrical behavior which occurs at around 400
            degrees below zero on the Fahrenheit scale. We're talking
            about 0 degrees, or something close to 0 Kelvin, or about
            minus 273 Celsius.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Kammerlingh Onnes is
            attributed with the discovery of superconductivity in 1911.
            Now there were a few things that occurred prior to this
            discovery. In 1908, Kammerlingh Onnes was the first, as far
            as I have been able to determine, to liquefy helium. In
            1908! And he was able thereby to obtain temperatures near 1
            degree Kelvin, which had never been attained before.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Of course, there was
            considerable theory at the time of how metals might behave
            as the ambient thermal environment was reduced, and so his
            first work, as far as I am able to determine, was with
            platinum. He took platinum, cooled it down to his new found
            temperature, and found, essentially, a linear decrease in
            resistivity with reduction in temperature. When he made
            tests specifically with pure platinum and impure platinum,
            he found that the resistivity reduction was a function of
            purity of material.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, the point that I want
            to emphasize is this; the reduction in resistivity with
            temperature was no surprise. That had been expected. The
            near-zero resistance which was measured at these extremes of
            low temperature was low because he was already close to zero
            resistance anyway. So there was not a significant finding in
            that particular case.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now when he used mercury,
            he wanted to use a material with extremely high purity, and
            mercury, at the time, was the metal known with the highest
            purity. He cooled it down and he found the resistivity
            reduction essentially as he had found in the platinum,
            except that when he got down to about 40 Kelvin, he got a
            little surprise. The material dropped abruptly in resistance
            to measurably zero value. (I emphasize the measurably zero
            value because what it actually is we really don't know, but
            measurably it has a zero value.) He conducted some tests
            with impure mercury and found exactly the same behavior.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That's quite an important
            point. In the case of platinum, he found that resistivity
            reduction was a function of temperature; in the case of
            mercury he found that it really didn't matter whether the
            material was pure or impure - it dropped in resistivity
            exactly the same way. So it didn't appear to matter to the
            mercury whether it was pure or impure.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">You're already close to
            zero anyway when you get down to these extremes of low
            temperature, so I have often questioned the gain [of the
            measuring instruments - ed.) measuring the drop in
            resistance to a measurably zero value, especially when you
            consider the expense of cooling the materials to that degree
            of temperature.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let's have a general
            review of the types of superconductors that are presently in
            existence. One is the Type One superconductor, which is
            essentially a metallic superconductor. Those materials have
            been found to enter the superconducting state at
            temperatures typically below 10 degrees Kelvin. We find that
            the superconductivity is a surface effect. The current wants
            to travel on the surface. The electron drift velocities have
            been determined to be something of the order of 10 to the
            5th cm/sec. The thickness of the conducting sheath has been
            found to be something of the order of 10 to the -5th cm.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At one time it was thought
            that if you took a highly pure crystalline solid and, as you
            attained the absolute zero of temperature, the thermal
            vibrations would reduce in such a way that the mean free
            pass of the conduction electrons would be practically
            infinite, and so it was thought, you see, that the metal
            would provide almost perfect conductivity through the
            material - through the crystalline solid.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">However, this is not what
            occurs. It you take a pure metal of the highest purity you
            can obtain, ninety nine point nine nine out to the tenth
            decimal place somewhere, you find that the superconduction,
            that is this almost perfect conductivity, does not occur
            through the material.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And yet the thermal
            vibrations at something of the order of a few degrees Kelvin
            is supposed to be significantly reduced, but when you crank
            the values of temperature through the equation, you find
            that the thermal agitation of electrons in the conduction
            band is still something of the order of 10 to the 6th
            cm/sec. Now, you see, you've got a surface velocity of 10 to
            the 5th.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, apparently, you have a
            higher agitation in the structure, and that might be one of
            the reasons why the electrons are forced to the surface. As
            far as the theory was concerned at the time, what I want to
            emphasize is that a pure crystalline structure was expected
            to provide near infinite or near perfect conductivity at
            near absolute zero temperatures, which we have not found.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another type of
            superconductor is called Type Two superconductor. Type Two
            superconductors are essentially alloys and metallic
            compounds. Can you think of any conducting structure less
            ordered than an alloy or metallic compound?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">These materials have been
            found to enter the superconducting state at as high as 23
            degrees Kelvin. In these highly disordered structures we
            find that the superconductivity is through the material, and
            when we examine what's going on we find that there are
            naturally forming thin current filaments is something of the
            order of 10 to the -6ths cm. This is all in the literature.
            It also has been determined that the superconduction speed
            is of the order of 10 to the 6th cm/sec.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So, the highly disordered
            structures that were supposed to provide all of this
            resistance, these imperfect structures which were supposed
            to contain all sorts of defects and impurities were never
            expected to provide the superconductivity that they do, yet
            we find that they superconduct at higher temperatures than
            the metals, and that the conducting speed of the
            superconduction current is increased by a factor of at least
            10 times.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So you see that, when I
            saw all of that coming out in the literature years ago, I
            began to question. What is resistance? Wouldn't you? You're
            told for years and years and years that resistance is a
            function of thermal agitation of metal ions in the lattice.
            Resistance is a function of collisions of conduction
            electrons between each other.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Resistance is a function
            of crystal defects. I could go on and on, but you know this
            as well as I. And yet we find that when we cool the
            imperfect materials down to as high as 23 degrees Kelvin,
            resistance goes to zero, or measurably so. So what happened
            to all of this resistance that's supposed to be provided by
            the defects in the structure, and the impurities, and the
            thermal vibration?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Because, as I told you a
            while ago, the thermal agitation velocities occurring in the
            conduction band in the metals near 1 degree Kelvin or below
            is found to be something of the order of 10 to the 6th
            cm/sec. What I didn't tell you is that, at room temperature
            those vibrations are of something of the order of 10 to the
            7th. So we find a reduction in thermal agitation velocity of
            only a factor of 10. And yet we get all of this high
            conductivity in the alloys.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Apparently, you see, when
            the material enters the superconducting stage the defects
            don't evaporate, the impurities don't evaporate, everything
            is still right there. They have found no changes whatsoever
            in the structure of the material. So what caused the
            resistance in the first place? You say, 'Well, the thermal
            agitation in the structure has reduced significantly.'</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Really? You call reduction
            by a factor of 10 significant? You're going from 10,000,000
            cm/sec thermal agitation in the conduction band down to
            1,000,000 - that's a significant reduction?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So what's happened? Well,
            it appears the key to a high temperature superconductor
            might be in that thin filament existing in the Type Two
            superconductor. We'll explore that a little bit later.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Let's talk about some of
            the general properties of superconductors. This is very
            important. The first general property is extremely high
            current, something of the order of 10 to the 5th amps per cm
            squared. 10 to the 6th amps per cm squared is no surprise.
            As a matter of fact, they get up much higher than that, but
            you're talking about current densities that are truly
            anomalous.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The superconductors have
            extremely long electron mean free path, which means they can
            go for a long, long way without colliding into anything,
            whatever that means. I never have understood how twolike
            charged particles like electrons could collide anyway, but
            it's in the literature, and those of you who have read the
            textbooks on electrical theory know it's there. You've seen
            the word 'collision' all over the place, and yet you know
            that chance collisions can't possibly happen.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electrons have high
            electron drift. Obviously we're talking about something to
            the order of 10 to the 5th cm/sec in a Type One and 10 to
            the 6th cm/sec in a Type Two. When you calculate the
            electron drift velocity in a copper wire, say 20 gauge, at
            room temperature, you find something of the order of 1/100th
            of a cm/sec. Even that's pretty liberal; I think it's quite
            less than that, depending on how much current we're passing
            through, of course. So you can see a significant increase in
            order of magnitude.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Next point is the
            generation of extremely high magnetic fields - in the Type
            One material, something of the order of 600 gauss; in the
            Type Two material, something of the order of 200,000 gauss.
            That's in the literature, Niobium-Tin, for instance, has a
            field of 200,000 gauss.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next point is
            extremely enhanced diamagnetism, and we've heard
            diamagnetism mentioned frequently here. What is it? You
            approach a diamagnetic material with a magnet, it has a
            tendency to run away from you. So, extremely high
            diamagnetism. It repels any incoming magnetic field.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next point is
            extremely poor thermal conductivity.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next point is that if
            you make thin film 'chips' with this material, you find that
            when they enter the superconducting state, they do so at a
            particular temperature and they measure certain current
            magnitude and they also measure certain magnitude of
            magnetic field. Then, as you probably know, if you increase
            the current to a value that is called the 'critical
            current', then you lose the superconductivity, or, if you
            apply a magnetic field in excess of its particular value,
            you find that you lose the superconductivity. But they have
            found - the sides (tapered edges - ed.) of the chip continue
            superconducting.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The fields required to
            lose the superconductivity in the edges are significantly
            higher than in the rest of the chip. The current drift along
            the edges is much higher than it is in the remainder of the
            chip. But you know what they do; they feel that the sides
            are causing them all kinds of difficulty, so what they do is
            they clip them off.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That is a fact. Because,
            you see, those darn sides are causing them to get erroneous
            measurements. The blasted things just won't go out of
            superconductivity. It just destroys the magnetic effects on
            the chip so when they want to force re-entry of the chip
            into the normal conducting state, they have to cut the
            things off.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What they ought to do is
            keep the edges and throw the rest away.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What I want to discuss,
            basically, is a field called 'superfluidity.' I'm not going
            to go over all the details of superfluidity, except to say
            this. When you take helium and you cool it and you get down
            to about 4 degrees Kelvin, about 4.2 degrees, to be exact,
            it enters the liquid state, which is no surprise.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">But then, if you keep
            cooling and cooling and cooling, you get to a point at 2.17
            degrees Kelvin where you have a completely inviscid fluid.
            Zero viscosity.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That means that it has no
            internal friction and, once you get it going, it won't stop.
            They have passed liquid helium through extremely fine
            apertures, something of the order of a few Angstroms
            diameter. A few Angstroms - an atomic diameter is an
            Angstrom or a couple of Angstroms, or three, or something
            like that, and we're talking about a capillary of five to
            ten Angstroms through which you are passing liquid helium!</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And you measure no
            reduction in pressure from the point of input to the point
            of output. No loss in pressure. What does that mean? That
            means that there was no friction between the capillary walls
            and the liquid. There was also no viscosity - no internal
            friction in the liquid. There was nothing to slow it down.
            No dissipation of energy whatsoever.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">They have determined that
            the superfluid state is due to the pairing of helium atoms
            in an orientation of antiparallel spin. What that means,
            basically, is that one rotates clockwise, adjacent to
            another that is rotating counterclockwise.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, if you look at
            Bernoullis' theorem, what does he say ought to happen when
            you have parallel flow lines? Think of two ships out at sea
            that get too close to each other. You get parallel flow
            lines. What happens to the water in between? Parallel flow
            lines, in essence in an antiparallel configuration. What
            happens? You get attraction. Those of you who have ever
            sailed know exactly what I'm talking about.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, these gentlemen here,
            Tilly and Tilly, have written a wonderful textbook called
            'Superfluidity and Superconductivity', and they have found
            some interesting parallels between electrical
            superconductivity and the field of superfluidity. What
            they're talking about is essentially this: Isn't it
            interesting that in the field of superconductivity three
            men, Bardeen, Shriefer and Cooper, in 1957 generated an
            acceptable theory for a phenomenon that was discovered in
            1911, and, I believe, were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1972.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What did they find? They
            found that the basic superconducting unit is antiparallel
            spinning electron pairs. So these gentlemen here, you see,
            said, 'Look! You've got antiparallel spins leading to
            attraction of conduction electrons. You have essentially the
            same kind of thing happening at extremes of low temperature
            in liquid helium.'</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And so what they have done
            is to apply equations from superconductivity to superfluids,
            and some of the predictions they were able to make are
            wonderful. That is about a 250 page to 300 page book, and
            it's absolutely delightful for those of you who might be
            interested.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I'm just giving you a
            background now, some of the things that I was seeing over
            the years, which eventually led to the research that I
            performed.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the fields of whiskers
            and filaments, Howard L. Cobb, in 1946, reported finding
            some whiskers growing off of capacitors that were able to
            short out radio units. Sydney Arnold, at Bell Laboratories,
            in 1956, was talking about 'tin whiskers' that were able to
            short out large capacitors.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">He conducted resistance
            measurements and found drops in resistance, very anomalous
            drops in resistance from what is expected from the standard
            law of resistivity. And he made this statement: 'The current
            magnitudes exceeded those expected by a factor of 100.'</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Those of you in the
            electrical and electronics fields know that we try not to
            pass any more than 100 amps/cm squared through a wire. You
            just don't pass more than that; otherwise it's going to
            evaporate. Arnold found 200,000 amps/cm squared. And that
            was found about 1951 and the man, I'm sure, had to think a
            long time before he published his results. But he published
            them in 1956.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There was a book by
            Bogenschultz in 1974 that talked about all of the problems
            that were being provided by metallic whiskers and thin
            filaments. These things were just shorting everything out.
            Well, why didn't somebody look at those fibers at the time
            and say, 'Might it be that we have something that' trying to
            superconduct at normal ambient temperatures and higher
            temperatures?' - because these capacitors are at quite high
            temperatures, as you know.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">What they should have done
            is stopped all of this work that was going on at the
            extremes of low temperatures and the helium refrigeration
            devices and so on and so forth, and gone to work on these
            thin whiskers and filaments. Stanford R. Ovshinsky, in 1966,
            received a United States patent for a symmetrical current
            controlling device and what the man found was this; he was
            able to make a chip which offered resistance in the several
            millions of Ohms.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">When he got to a certain
            threshold voltage, he found that the resistance went down to
            something far less than one Ohm, and the only way that he
            could explain what was going on was to hypothesize the
            creation of very thin current filaments inside his chip. The
            drop in resistance from several million Ohms down to less
            than one occurred instantaneously and there was no excessive
            generation of heat in te devices. So much for i square r
            heating.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Article by Marcus and
            Rottersmann in 1967. They found that in making chips they
            were making thin stripe conductors going all over the chip -
            and they were being shorted out. They examined the situation
            and found extremely thin filaments that had grown inside the
            thin film conductors themselves.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Now, those thin film
            conductors were something of the order of 200 to 1,000
            Angstroms in diameter. If there were thin filaments forming
            inside that, how big were they? They had to be significantly
            less than 1,000 Angstroms in diameter. That's in the
            literature. A.K. Jonscher, in 1969, found thin filaments in
            glassy insulator substrate material. It seems that nature is
            going to find a path of least resistance whether we provide
            it or not.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">D.E. Thomson in 1980, in
            'Science News,' reported work with Saran wrap. Those of you
            who have ever seen Saran wrap under an electron microscope
            know that there are fibrils going all over the place. If you
            put an Ohmmeter across the thing, you'll measure several
            millions of Ohms. But take it and stretch it; align those
            fibrils inside the material and you find that the resistance
            drops down by several orders of magnitude, like 10 to the
            5th or 10 to the 6th, resistance drops by a factor of about
            1,000,000. What's the size of them? Roughly 500 Angstroms in
            diameter.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">IBM at the present time is
            doing some work on nanobridges, extremely fine line
            conductors on chips. These things are about 20 to 200
            Angstroms in cross-sectional diameter. That is one
            particular method at this time of making very thin film
            strips. Bell Labs is presently working with quantum well
            wires. It's a rectangular thin film conductor that has a
            thickness of 200 Angstroms and a width of about 200
            Angstroms. The length is as long as you want to make it.
            M.I.T. is making what it calls 'narrow lines'. All of these
            people are making narrow lines of essentially the same
            dimensions. My question is why are they making them but they
            are not reporting resistance?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My method of making thin
            filaments is to prepare a chemical colloidal suspension. I
            take extremely fine metallic particulates and I suspend them
            in high dielectric mediums such as an epoxy resin.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I heat the mixture to the
            melting point of the metal, which in the case of bismuth is
            something of the order of 271 degrees Kelvin. The only
            reason for doing that is to bring the particle into the
            molten or semi-molten state.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then you apply the
            voltage, which in some cases can be several thousand volts,
            wait awhile, and you'll get conductivity in just a matter of
            a minute or so.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Then you retract one set
            of electrodes as far as you want to go. If you'll take cross
            sections of your mixture, you'll find little thin fibers
            going all over the place.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It's a very easy way to
            make filaments. As far as controlling the diameters and the
            lengths, I'm still working on that. I'm trying to get into
            the Ph.D. program in Materials Science at North Carolina
            State University, and hope that if I'm invited back next
            year that I will have some good reports for you. But this is
            presently what I'm doing.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I do have a United States
            patent for the process. What it's doing at the present time
            is nothing, but there is a publication next month, the
            Bismuth Institute, which is headquartered in La Paz,
            Bolivia, has gotten very interested in my findings, and has
            decided to publish a very long abstract of the patent. The
            publication center for the Bismuth Institute is in
            Brussells, Belgium.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There are several theories
            of high temperature superconductivity. The Soviet theories
            say this: That if you make an extremely thin filament
            process, or film, and you encapsulate it by a polarizable
            medium, then the high current flow, assuming there will be
            one through the thin filament process, will induce positive
            charges all over the surface of the thin filament. And that
            extremely high positive fields will serve to reduce the
            repulsive effect between electrons, and let those natural
            spin forces take over. And they must be extremely short
            range. They are saying basically that you create a positive,
            attractive field for the electrons. So you can get pairing
            that way.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another theory, as
            expressed by my old professor, Dr. Robert Carroll, says that
            if you take a thin film of material that normally
            contributes very few electrons to the conduction process,
            and yet presently contains high drift velocities, you ought
            to be able to confine the electrons into an extremely thin
            channel and force them to pair thereby. Just upon entry to
            an extremely thin channel.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">And so, what I started
            doing was to look around for materials. All this seemed very
            exciting to me. It seemed there was a lot of theory saying
            that these things outght to superconduct at normal ambient
            temperatures. And also the findings with the edges on thin
            films and with the whiskers. If I could speak with Mr.
            Arnold of Bell Laboratories, I would ask him this: 'How come
            that first whisker that made contact with the ground did not
            evaporate?'</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This man was talking about
            capacitors in the order of a hundred microfarad. What about
            the instantaneous current drain through the whisker? It must
            have been truly enormous. So you see, you look at all those
            things and then a picture begins emerging, and that is that
            if you can make extremely thin conductive filaments, they
            ought to superconduct, or you ought to see something akin to
            superconductivity at normal ambient temperatures, and
            possibly higher temperatures.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This is what I did. I
            started looking at bismuth, which has a resistivity that is
            about 100,000 tiems less than what it should be according to
            its conduction electron density. The resistance is high, but
            not as high as it ought to be..</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Also, the electron mean
            free path, that is, the distance between collisions, to use
            the present vocabulary, is extremely long, so you have
            extremely long mean free paths in the bismuth. This is in
            bulk, at normal ambient temperatures.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Bismuth is the most
            diamagnetic of all of the metals. If you don't believe it,
            approach it with a magnet and see what happens, I did that
            on purpose. I made extremely thin filaments that I could
            see, put them on a tabletop, approached them with a magnet -
            and off the tabletop they went, instantaneously.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If that's not
            diamagnetism, I don't know what is. Also, bismuth, in the
            bulk form, has the next to the lowest thermal conductivity
            of all the metals.. And also, another of the things that I
            liked about bismuth is that it has extremely low wear
            resistance, or a very low coefficient of friction.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Remember the first list I
            gave you and compare it with what I've just given you. So
            then I thought that if I could make bismuth filaments down
            to a couple of hundred Angstroms in diameter, I ought to be
            able to observe superconductivity behavior at ambient
            temperatures. All of the details are in the patent.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I worked and I worked and
            I worked and I was down to a micron diameter of fibers. I
            noticed that I needed a certain voltage, and then suddenly,
            I got very rapid oscillations all over the place, tremendous
            instability, and then I would increase the current just by a
            little bit, and the needles would just go out of sight.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The voltage went down to
            practically zero, as far as I could measure; the current
            tended to rise to infinity. Now, I didn't like the idea of
            having a voltage drop - they tell you, you're not supposed
            to have a voltage drop in a superconductor. So I worked to
            eliminate the voltage drop.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So I learned to prepare a
            colloidal suspension having smaller particulates suspended,
            and worked at that and, my wife can tell you, I will never
            forget the day that this happened - I succeeded in making
            the suspension; I went ahead and formed the fibers as I had
            normally done; I took resistance measurements at the end of
            the trials, and they measured ZERO RESISTANCE.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">That was one of the
            happiest days. I immediately ran out of that laboratory,
            took my wife out and we had some wonderful wine and a
            wonderful meal, and just had a great time. I have made
            hundreds of these, and I can tell you that it works as I say
            it does. I have not measured resistance. I am not exactly
            certain what's going on, and that's why I'm going on into
            this program and hopefully doing some additional work.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As far as the magnetic
            field is concerned, I don't need to get into details. You
            can surmise what they would be as well as I can. Potential
            applications include the obvious computer applications. One
            application which might not be so obvious is the possibility
            of developing a synthetic spinal cord bridge. That excites
            me more than anything. If we are able to find a way to make
            something that will not generate resistance and i square r
            heating in the body, insert a material that would be
            accepted by the body (and, by the way, bismuth is very nice)
            and bridge gaps in the spinal cord where fibers have not
            regenerated, wouldn't that be wonderful?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We've got a lot of work to
            do. There's a possibility of very thin microelectrodes for
            single neuron studies, which they desperately need. You have
            a zero resistance electrode - think of the activity that you
            could measure in the individual neurons. The extended
            lengths of fibers - think of the possibility of low loss
            cables. Think of the possibilities of the generation of high
            magnetic fields, without auxiliary refrigeration mechanisms.
            Think about windings for motors and generators. And I could
            go on and on, but I've got to quit at some point. Thank you
            all very much.</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Question: In one of your
            comments you were surprised that the voltage dropped to
            zero. Why did you not want this? And second question, can
            you comment on 'frozen-in' fields in superconductors?</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Answer: Are you talking
            about the so-called 'fluxoids'?</font> </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Questioners Answer: Yes.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Continued first answer:
            Regarding the first question - I wanted a voltage drop to
            zero. If I said that, I certainly didn't mean it. When I
            found initially a voltage drop I didn't want it because I
            knew that in order for a material to be superconducting, it
            would have to provide no potential drop. Regarding the
            second question, in superconductors you can have a
            persistent field which stays there and 'locks' the
            superconducting filament in place. In my case, we are
            talking about a single one of those filaments. So we are not
            talking about exactly the same thing.<br>
