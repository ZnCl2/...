        <p><b>MAGNATRON, FUSION MAGNETIC MOTOR</b> </p>
        <p><b>by</b> </p>
        <p><b>Gerald Orlowski</b> </p>
        <p><b>Presented at the 3rd International Symposium on New
            Energy, April 25-28, `96 at Denver, CO.</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Scientists from Descartes to Einstein sought to find the
        correct DESCRIPTION of the NATURE of all physical substance. </p>
      <p>I believe Rory Johnson was one of the greatest visionaries of
        this century, and his operating Magnatron Fuel Cell motor was
        showing us the principle of attract-attract in motion - the
        nature of all physical substance. </p>
      <p>Rory Johnson designed and operated a 525 HP fuel cell motor
        without any of the hardware that is presently used in current
        state-of-the-art electric motors, such as AC Induction series or
        compound wound DC motors which use the accepted principle of
        attract-repel, an energy form that doesn't utilize the magnetic
        field to its greatest advantage. He capitalized on the magnetic
        field to its greatest advantage by utilizing the principle of
        ATTRACT-ATTRACT. </p>
      <p>There is no way to explain ATTRACT-ATTRACT using contemporary
        electrical theory, how his relatively small motor could produce
        this tremendous horsepower. Over the past 10 years, I used the
        Johnson hardware as a textbook to help gain an understanding
        about this NEW electrical-magnetic energy theory. Johnson
        capitalized on the magnetic field to its greatest advantage. He
        used a top and bottom rotor in his motor. First, the top rotor
        attracted, released, then the bottom rotor attracted, released.
        The action of attract, taking place between upper and lower
        magnets, using the windings to complete the attract field. </p>
      <p>THIS ACTION is difficult to understand if present electrical
        theory is the knowledge base. I know this to be true because I
        listened to a teaching tape by Rory Johnson, and my mindset
        about electricity would not let me HEAR him. Surely as
        electricity was caused to be generated by ONE of the windings,
        the other winding used it. How else could it work? The answer to
        his statement that he RECYCLES a stabilized energy could not be
        understood if he somehow TAKES APART and then RE-ASSEMBLES the
        electron itself, UNBELIEVABLE! </p>
      <p>Yes, Dr. Johnson was showing the world the `Principle of
        Motion" that had been sought by scientists from Descartes to
        this day. This is ATTRACT-ATTRACT. </p>
      <p>Many `scientists of old' tried to say if the electron GETS
        FORMED, then it MUST have a core structure. For example, Dr.
        Heaviside stated the following, "As the Universe is boundless in
        one way toward the great, so it is equally boundless to the
        other way, toward the small; and important events may arise from
        what is going on in the inside of atoms, and again in the inside
        of ELECTRONS. How electrons are MADE has not yet been fully
        understood." </p>
      <p>This subject is covered in greater depth later, but for now let
        us review my involvement with Rory Johnson and his 525 HP from
        Laser (Defraction Prism) Activated Motor that had a range of
        100,000 mi. Operating on 2 lbs of deuterium and gallium. </p>
      <p>After I saw the Magnatron motor, my life changed. I was no
        longer a happy camper working by myself in a wonderful, fully
        equipped research machine shop for the Greyhound/Armour Corp. In
        Arizona. While on a business trip, I saw this motor running in
        the showroom at the Magnetron Co. Located in Elgin. IL. </p>
      <p>During my 15 years of electric motor repair, among the hundreds
        of motors I repaired, I rewound a 500 HP electric motor. That
        motor had wires exiting it that were the size of a garden hose.
        The Johnson motor being shown had NO wires. Surely this motor
        was unreal, a con-job to get money for dealerships. Yes, there
        he was. Rory Johnson standing next to his sealed self- contained
        Electric motor. </p>
      <p>Upon returning to the Greyhound Towers and telling them what I
        had seen, they instructed me to call Mr. Johnson. Greyhound
        wanted Johnson to put forth a plan to install a motor in one of
        their buses for testing purposes. </p>
      <p>I called Johnson. He was delighted that a Greyhound employee
        had seen the motor running, and replied that the testing idea
        was acceptable. He would set a time frame for just when a bus
        should be delivered to him. </p>
      <p>Two years went by, with no business proposal from Johnson.
        Then, his former business partner, Mike Marzicola, called to say
        Johnson had passed away. He wanted me to work with him to get
        one of the motors running. I flew to Orange Co., CA, saw the
        motor took pictures, and put forth a plan to Greyhound. Subject
        to a contract with Marzicola, one of the old worn motors would
        be brought to the research shop. I would then very carefully
        reconnect the generator wires that Johnson had cut off prior to
        moving from Elgin, IL to CA. </p>
      <p>Discussions with Marzicola brought out that the US government
        (given the authority by the Congress of `52) had issued a GRAB
        order to take Johnson's motors. Rumor has it, the DOE is run by
        US oil companies, and OPEC and they want no competition, period.
        Because of this grab order, Johnson had cut the generator wires
        then put his `total shop', with motors and all, on several
        U-Haul trucks and left Illinois in the middle of the night and
        went to Calif. To re-establish his business, but before he could
        get a motor running, he passed away. </p>
      <p>Surely, g\Greyhound would agree to let me re-start one of
        Johnson's motors. The wonderful proposal put forth to greyhound
        was rejected by mail. Very agitated, I went to the top office at
        Greyhound demanding an explanation. I was met at the door with
        the comment, "We know why you are here." Knowing the potential
        savings to the bus company, surely they could have only one
        reason for rejecting the proposal. They must have believed I was
        not qualified to start up the motor. </p>
      <p>The top legal advisor stated he was present when the Greyhound
        board met and discussed my written proposal. He stated the
        following, "At NO time was the thought put forth that you would
        not succeed. In fact, we discussed all of the hardware designed
        and constructed by you, and started the conversation from what
        happens when Greyhound has a running motor". We contacted a
        State Rep. Who felt this motor should not be allowed to be used
        in 4,000 + buses. The loss in tax dollars for fuel alone would
        be a very huge sum. He then asked me to leave, stating he was
        sorry that he had to tell me the reason the plan was rejected. </p>
      <p>Telling Marzicola of the rejection, I offered to personally put
        in a few thousand dollars toward the parts to get one motor
        running. In return, I would be assigned the dealership for the
        Phoenix Metropolitan area. We signed legal papers in exchange
        for the money agreed on, and went to work. (I still have the
        signed dealership.) </p>
      <p>The first thing I noticed was that someone had been working on
        repairing the motors. Three motors already had new commutator
        assemblies installed. Each assembly consisted of 3 commutator
        assemblies on one insulated tube with a metal case to secure it
        to the shaft. </p>
      <p>One motor still had the old worn commutator assembly, as it had
        not yet been repaired. Out of curiosity, I took a string, held
        it to the center of the top shaft and stretched it to one of the
        stationary magnets on the motor not yet repaired. This winding
        was uniquely different from anything I had ever seen. After
        winding probably a hundred armatures of all sizes (during my
        early motor repair years), I never saw mica between bars as
        thick as what Johnson used -1/8' thick. By turning the rotor and
        holding one brush in place, it was easy to se that the brush
        sent energy into one commutator bar just as the TWO wire SLOTS
        arrived in front of one magnet (let's say north). The mica
        thickness supplied OFF TIME before the next bar contacted the
        brush and the SAME WIRE SLOT now moved in front of a south
        magnet. The mica thickness was not just for insulation but to
        control the movement when the slot of wire arrived at another
        magnet. </p>
      <p>The newly installed commutator had insulation between bars that
        was so thin i could hardly see it, I asked Marzicola who had
        supplied these new commutators. He said, " I ordered them and
        have a large supply in the store room." He said the thickness of
        the mica had to do with the voltage, and this unit operated on
        less than 50 volts. The makers of the commutators simply went by
        the VOLTAGE requirement given them. They were not permitted to
        see the actual motor. I tried to explain to Marzicola that with
        the thicker mica it afforded OFF-TIME, to gain an instantaneous
        polarity reversal from one rotor coil to its mating coil on the
        other rotor. He said if I wanted to help him, I should stop
        making trouble, the commutators were PERFECT. He insisted we
        work together to finish one of the rotors that already had a new
        commutator installed. It seemed to me that we were defeated
        before we started. Unfortunately my observation proved to be
        accurate. </p>
      <p>Years later, I still pondered how this OFF-TIME could have
        accomplished more than just this instantaneous polarity
        reversal. Faraday had a great teaching on this subject, he
        stated, "When a current suddenly ceases, it can INDUCE a current
        IN THE SAME WIRE which is stronger than the original current.
        Thus, by conservation of force, there must be some force
        present, AN OPERATIVE, other than electric force. This force is
        probably the MAGNETIC FORCE." Science had this enlightening
        teaching over 150 years ago! Unbelievable! </p>
      <p>Back to Johnson's motor. There were two separate windings, the
        driver rotor on the bottom, and the generator winding on top. A
        curved piece of metal that closely resembled aluminum (but did
        not drill like aluminum) was secured for 360 degrees around,
        centered between the two windings. This metal most definitely
        was a conductor of electricity. There were 52 small holes
        drilled, equally spaced, around the center of this curved metal
        (possibly magnesium). These holes were sized to be a snug fit to
        the #23 wires from The generator winding coils. </p>
      <p>My electrical background deduced that these wires must
        certainly malfunction by being GROUNDED to the curved metal. To
        just solder extension wires to the cut-wires at the inside
        location would be a POOR repair job. I convinced Marzicola that
        we must do a good job. We would carefully pull the generator
        wires back to the outer surface, number them and replace them
        through the same holes. Only this time we would use insulation
        tubing. </p>
      <p>Marzicola said they already thought of that, but insulation
        tubing wouldn't fit along with the wires. I told him that by
        holding a piece of copper tubing (as a safety guard) between the
        windings, I could position a drill directly in each hole and
        enlarge it. Then we could insert tubing with the #23 wire
        inside. We did just that. </p>
      <p>After two days of hard work, we had all the generator wires
        connected to the commutator. None were grounded to this metal;
        it was a perfect ELECTRICAL circuit path. We had just negated
        the action of Johnson's Fuel cell. Why? </p>
      <p>The 1/8" copper pipe that exited his fuel cell was positioned
        in such a way as to be secured to the inside surface of the
        housing with the "end flow point" directly across from the
        center of this metal. ALL of the fuel cell generated power
        became captured in this curved metal (located between rows of
        permanent magnets above and below). </p>
      <p>The metal was designed to feed energy directly into each
        generator wire that was in direct contact with the metal. The
        modest pulse from the generator coil served the purpose of a
        catalyst to cause this energy to join in the flow to the
        Commutator and on to the lower winding. This metal was like a
        massive capacitor, and we did a great job of disconnecting it
        with insulation tubing. </p>
      <p>Why go through all this? We will never understand how the
        Johnson motor functions without the firm understanding of the
        characteristics of this energy. We must think MAGNETIC not
        ELECTRIC. </p>
      <p>Electrical knowledge won't help us construct the Ro-Mag unit.
        For example, can this same FORM of energy be released inside a
        motor without an energy piping system to put the energy
        someplace? Why not release the energy at the location where it
        is actually needed? </p>
      <p>The Johnson motor has the fuel cell located directly in the
        heart of a massive magnetic field, where it PULSES as needed, to
        feed the Unit's RELEASED MAGNETIC POWER. So what is different
        between these two energy FORMS? As we know, electrical flow
        argues, that is, it sparks, short circuits, and must be
        CAREFULLY insulated, Magnetic structures, rather, want to SHARE
        their flow, and are compatible to the Universal Force. This new
        energy FORM responds when it is needed as well as HOW it is
        needed, manifesting as a MEASURABLE current. <br>
        Thus, in defining these different energies, it is important to
        understand that although electrical and magnetic (energy) work
        with similar ATTITUDES, the MANNER in which they work, sets up a
        differing energy effect. THINK MAGNETIC THINK MAGNETIC. Let us
        have a short magnetic school. </p>
      <p>QUESTION: Does magnetism have a pulse rate? Do not say "no,"
        because if it does, then much of what is called phenomena will
        be self-explained. </p>
      <p>QUESTION: Does CHANGING a pulse change the polarity which also
        changes the intensity? </p>
      <p>WHY ASK THESE QUESTIONS? </p>
      <p>Because this is HOW present electrical theory took its present
        place, and when we were satisfied enough, we stopped asking
        questions. </p>
      <p>QUESTION: In the field of magnetism would alternating the
        magnetic attract become a FUNCTION of this energy? WHY ASK? Why
        do we have alternating electrical currents? Well, ask the same
        about magnetic energy. </p>
      <p>Judging from the present day electrical theory, magnetic energy
        is now relegated to being a by-product that is unnecessary or of
        NO USE. This is like saying a chicken is OK, but throw the eggs
        away. Why can what it is--it is only a by-product. </p>
      <p>QUESTIONS: Is the energy now called electricity a VIOLENT
        MAGNETIC REACTION o the troubling or interferences in its field
        that is simply then manifested as SPARK? <br>
        This being so, is electricity then the by-product of a troubled
        ....[hiccup in manuscript].... accept the fact that a
        solid-state device has been constructed for magnetic field? It
        most certainly is. THINK: All things considered does this show a
        unity of forces? The unit of force we are NOW discussing is
        Compressed Magnetism (wrongfully called gravity). With gravity
        being compressed magnetism, there is only one force-magnetism.
        This force is CAPTURED by magnetic action inside the Johnson
        motor. </p>
      <p>The coils in the Johnson Motor are charged and discharged. This
        action is called a COIL COLLAPSE TIMING because of the pulsing
        system that activates the energy flow inside Johnson's motor. As
        we understand that this ACTION is NECESSARY, we can construct
        other magnetic devices that function utilizing the same BASIC
        PRINCIPLE. </p>
      <p>Let us now do a historical study about energy and how it
        relates to the construction of the Johnson Motor. The unit
        constantly recycles a stabilized Magnetic Electro energy. Is
        this statement in CONFLICT with past science teaching? Yes, it
        is; however, one scientist seemed to think otherwise. Dr. Lodge
        stated (about 1890) that. "Any form of ENERGY can be followed in
        TRANSFERENCE.' We say magnetic molecular structures are forming
        and reforming. If we drive a wire through a magnetic field, we
        TROUBLE the field, causing structures called electrons to form
        and flow. These electrons DO A JOB and discharge back into
        magnetic molecular structures having BASICALLY A NEUTRAL charge.
        Thus, hopefully at some point in time, we will be allowed to
        observe this transference action as Dr. Lodge stated. </p>
      <p>We seem to be far off course. What happened? </p>
      <p>We had a great scientific foundation, that is up until J.J.
        Thomson put forth his theory in 1890. Thomson identified the
        cathode rays as a building block of atoms and called them
        electrons. Until then, a good teaching was in place, the law of
        action and reaction. </p>
      <p>What does one have to do with the other? Dr. Lorentz (about
        that time) stated that between radiating electrons,, the law of
        action and reaction could not hold. He stated, "When a moving
        electron radiates it slows down, thus losing momentum. It is
        some time later before the radiation hits other electrons. Thus,
        there can be no immediate reaction in other electrons to the
        creation of the radiating electron. And, all of the radiation
        will not be absorbed by electrons in hits, some will be
        scattered. Thus between ELECTRONS. The equality of action and
        reaction will not hold." <br>
        Scientists of OLD did not want to be burdened with the thought
        that an electron has a core structure. WHY? SAME REASON TODAY!!
        Because this thought then the mind to ask, "What holds he
        electron together?" Fifty years ago scientist, Dr. Ehrenhaft
        stated. "It is purely magnetic force which permeates throughout
        the known Universe." Did he conduct any tests to prove his
        statement? Printed in Nature, Jan 4, `41, Dr. Ehrenhaft stated,
        "There must also be a STATIONARY MAGNETIC FIELD in the beam of
        LIGHT with potential differences since SUPERPOSED MAGNETIC
        FIELDS accelerate or retard the MAGNETO-PHOTOPHERISIS. It can be
        observed that some particles stay at rest and that their motion
        stops suddenly, or that moving particles appear to change their
        velocity, even reverse it due to changes of CHARGE. The movement
        of magnetic ions in a homogeneous magnetic field is a MAGNETIC
        CURRENT." </p>
      <p>All of this same action could be happening inside the fuel cell
        of the magnatron. We could say Magnetism is the property that
        unlocks the molecular lock. Therefore, surely magnetism is also
        the property that holds all structures together (electrons
        included). </p>
      <p>Just what is necessary to CAPTURE this magnetic current to PUT
        IT TO WORK? first, we want this energy to move about as MAGNETIC
        BUBBLES, and this can be accomplished while the Johnson fuel
        cell has a vacuum interior. Why pull a vacuum to Fuel Cell? On
        reason is to allow the bubbles to move freely and not break.
        Keep in mind that the effects of compressed magnetism (gravity)
        are greatly reduced and this downward force being somewhat
        alleviated, allows a certain kind of FREEDOM to the bubble flow.
        A MORE IMPORTANT reason is the magnetic energy in the fuel cell
        came about because of an assembly of DIFFERENT CHARGED
        PARTICLES. These particles need to maintain their IDENTITY as
        highly complex interactions take place within the fuel cell. If
        air were inside, it would tend to NEUTRALIZE these charges, a
        condition that would then interfere with the correct particle
        joining process. </p>
      <p>SHOULD THE FUEL CELL LIGHT UP? In 1905 Einstein made the
        suggestion that, "light travels from EMITTER to ABSORBER in
        discrete particle-like BUNDLES." NO TOO BAD OF AN IDEA! If
        Einstein had finished the thought and said, "the bundles are
        composed of MAGNETISM AND LIGHT which travel SIDE BY SIDE, with
        there being NO light without the magnetism,"' he would have been
        accurate. Magnetism is a CONSTANT- it does not come from
        somewhere. BECAUSE it is already in place-everywhere. As a
        Vibratory change is caused to happen in magnetism, it then
        creates an ENERGY CHANGE that the human eye can see, visible
        matter called LIGHT. </p>
      <p>SO WHAT HAPPENS AS THE LIGHT STOPS? When light is not needed
        any longer, it returns to its original form. It stops its
        manifestation of light while the magnetism continues manifesting
        as it always did. </p>
      <p>Inside Johnson's motor, I saw a great display of light as
        magnetic charges moved from one place to another. This action of
        having the fuel cell LIGHT UP might help to further explain the
        "Unity of Forces," (if we allow our minds o expand). </p>
      <p>MAGNETIC BUBBLES transport a MASSIVE AMOUNT of energy, yet this
        energy does not NEED to be circuited by HEAVY wire. Why not? Are
        we saying that magnetic energy is transferred primarily in the
        FIELD AROUND the WIRE? This must be true, Johnson used #23 wire,
        a wire size ordinarily used to operate an electric motor having
        less than a fraction of one horsepower. If this wire is equated
        to horsepower in present day motors, Then his motor COULD NOT
        WORK. I saw all the worn commutators, brushes and bearing. His
        motors undoubtedly ran for YEARS. Anyone could observe minimal
        wear on commutators, brushes, and other parts. </p>
      <p>JUST WHAT KIND OF WORK CAN A MAGNETIC FLOW ACCOMPLISH? Back to
        the Magnatron Motor. Here is a sample of the magnet size and
        wire size. The same size as used inside Johnson's motor. His
        magnets, when magnetically charged could be designated as `weak'
        in flux power. These magnets, to respond with greater POWER
        required energy from his fuel cell. They then acted as CHARGING
        CAPACITORS with their ENERGY DISCHARGE setting up a given PULSE
        RATE, which created the action of RELEASE TIMING. And what did
        this do? This release timing element goes on to affect the
        revolutions. The revolutions affect the pulsing. The pulsing
        determines the input. The input determines the outlay of the
        magnetic current flow. </p>
      <p>Yes, the magnets Johnson used had weak flux power, however,
        without the flux power, everything would be stationary. Yes, the
        flux power not only helps the released magnetic energy, it
        ENCOURAGES IT. Yet, it is not a MATTER OF FLUX POWER. It is a
        matter of TRANSMUTABILITY and this has to do with molecular
        structures. </p>
      <p>Mr. Johnson stated that the FUEL is caused to work by blending
        Deuterium and Gallium. Scientists already had the NAME of the
        energy that it manifests as these two elements are blended.
        Johnson used a spark energy that became focused after going
        through a dark, smoky defraction prism. The scientists were
        convinced that Johnson could not produce THEIR already named,
        newly discovered energy FORM with a MINIATURE cold fusion fuel
        cell small enough to fit inside his motor. This was their
        position, and they never wanted a challenge to the teaching they
        spent YEARS memorizing. </p>
      <p>CONFUSION-CONFUSION! IS WHY WE HAVEN'T ADVANCED IN THIS
        TECHNOLOGY! Newton's law states, "A change in substance is a
        change in molecular structure."" </p>
      <p>As we focus on the thought that there is nothing BUT energy
        which manifests as magnetic molecular structures constantly
        forming and reforming, just using the words, "a change in
        substance" has no application. All processes go through a
        process of forming and reforming. THEN, any given visible
        substance could be perfectly reproduced, isotropic in every
        respect, yet be the product of DIFFERENT MOLECULAR STRUCTURE. </p>
      <p>SO WHERE IS THIS THOUGHT LEADING US? Each electron has an
        identifiable core structure of its own which can be identified
        as its place of origin. Today, electrons are FORMED at the
        Earth's energy zone, the ionosphere. </p>
      <p>HERE IS A FULL SIZE ISOMETRIC VIEW OF THE FUEL CELL INSIDE THE
        UNIT. Why is this center acrylic tube called a Fuel Cell? The
        action accomplished inside this unit could be used to expand the
        name to a Molecular Vibratory Exchanger Unit. </p>
      <p>Why call it by this name? What is it exchanging? It is
        exchanging the matter (liquid) into a pure energy form. </p>
      <p>Q. Why go into the details of this magnatron motor? A. To make
        sure this very significant technology doesn't get buried in a
        dead-end file. If the the human species is to survive, the
        fossil fuel extravaganza must be curtailed and magnatron motors
        can take its place. </p>
      <p>What is vibrating? Vibrations come off both magnets from below
        the FUEL CELL and cause a SOUND OF VIBRATION as magnetic waves
        BOUNCE off the energy field that is already inside the vacuum
        chamber. This action sets up a given RESONANCE. </p>
      <p>SOUND TURNS INTO WAVES but the magnetic energy comes out as
        PULSES. THIS ACTION gives a vibratory change to the structure of
        the liquid. This is all a random action; however, the RANDOMNESS
        IS THE DESIRED ORDER. </p>
      <p>Next, we note that the energy wants to escape without doing
        work. WHAT IS Magnetic work? We want the molecular structures to
        be used to their maximum potential. This only gets accomplished
        as we CAUSE a "molecular break-down" by circuiting The energy in
        such a manner as to drive it to this point of MAXIMUM POTENTIAL,
        that is, its breakdown. THIS NEW MAGNETIC ACTION inside the fuel
        cell accomplishes this response, which then causes a point of
        transference that forms a NEW molecular structure. This new
        structure is associated with the conductive action of the red
        brass cover. THUS, the action taking place inside the fuel cell
        is a continuous process of COMBUSTION. </p>
      <p>Faraday had a thought that is worth remembering. He stated,
        "The very progress which science makes as a body, is a continued
        correction of ignorance, i.e., a state which is ignorance in
        relation to The Future, though wisdom and knowledge in relation
        to the past." </p>
      <p>We can only CLAIM the use of wisdom and knowledge about the
        past, as we ADMIT the errors of the past. Planet Earth is in
        dire need of repair because the POWERS TO BE will not use wisdom
        and knowledge to address the PAST. </p>
      <p>Why is it necessary for someone OUTSIDE TRADITIONAL DISCIPLINE
        to step inside in order to gin a new freedom of thought? A
        former astronaut, Captain Edgar D. Mitchell stated it quite well
        when he said, "History has shown time and again that important
        scientific discoveries generally happen only when someone steps
        outside the limits of his traditional discipline and looks at
        something from a fresh point of view. Then what should have been
        obvious all along comes into focus." </p>
      <p>Thus such great Technology has been suppressed for almost 20
        years. First the U.S. Department of Energy issued a "gag" order
        and then a "grab" order (See Appendix 2), which is why Rory
        Johnson moved all his motors and technology out of his lab in
        the middle of the night and moved to California, and shortly
        thereafter he mysteriously died. Some inside information
        revealed that OPEC had been keeping track of all competitive
        technology and he was #1 on their Hit List! He was about to
        manufacture the motors through a nationwide dealership. Some
        motors still exist but the owner wants several million dollars
        for them. </p>

      <p>In the late 1970s, Rory Johnson, a brilliant inventor in Elgin,
        Illinois, created a cold-fusion, laser-activated, magnetic motor
        that produced 525 horsepower, weighed 475 pounds and would
        propel a large truck of bus 100,000 miles on about 2 pounds of
        deuterium and gallium. This was years before either Pons &amp;
        Fleischman or Dr. James Patterson entered the scene with their
        cold-fusion technology. Johnson entered negotiations with the
        Greyhound Bus Company to install this revolutionary motor in
        several buses in order to demonstrate fuel savings, maintenance
        reduction and, hence, the possibility of greater profits for
        Greyhound. </p>
      <p>Little did he know, however, that OPEC keeps close track of any
        potential competition to its oil business and that he was number
        one on its hit list. His first mistake was publicizing, in many
        magazines, his plans to manufacture and distribute his
        revolutionary motor. (The writer has spoken with a few people
        who even signed up for distributorships.) </p>
      <p>After a year of hearing nothing but silence from Johnson,
        Greyhound agents tried to contact him-only to be notified that
        he had passed away unexpectedly. This is a particularly
        troubling part of the story, since he had been in his early
        fifties and in robust health. Later, Greyhound learned that
        shortly before he died, Johnson had inexplicably moved our of
        his laboratory in the middle of the night and taken all of his
        motors and technology to California. </p>
      <p>Another bizarre fact then surfaced: The U.S. Department of
        Energy had placed a restraining order on Johnson's company,
        Magnatron, Inc., prohibiting it from producing the Magnatron
        engine. </p>

      <p>The February issue of the Roseau, Minnesota Farmers Union Oil
        Company News Letter carried a front page account of a new
        self-contained electric motor that will power a car for 100,000
        miles on less than 2 pounds of fuel, will produce 525 horsepower
        and is self-contained with a weight of 475 pounds. We were at
        once skeptical and yet so extremely interested that our
        publisher, Nick Marzicola hopped a jet to Chicago to gather
        information, photos and have a look in person. </p>
      <p>Rory Johnson, President of Magntron, Inc., and inventor of the
        proposed laser-activated power source said that the early report
        was factual and described his invention as being a combination
        electric drive and generator with a fuel cell to supply constant
        power. </p>
      <p>The fuel concept is new, using Deuterium and Gallium fused by a
        miniature laser prism. The fuel cell is guaranteed by Magnatron
        to last 100,000 miles in normal use and the motor parts will be
        warranteed for 15,000 or 15 months, whichever comes first. </p>
      <p>Johnson said that the motor rpm is 8,000 with a gear ration of
        2:1. Lubrication for the sealed, no exhaust, no emissions, motor
        is Mobil 1 synthetic which will not need changing and will not
        use a filter due to the non-introduction of foreign materials
        such as carbon and varnish which are found in the internal
        combustion piston engine. </p>
      <p>Fuel for the new power source is plentiful, since Deuterium is
        derived from water and Gallium is derived from Aluminum Bauxite,
        three parts per million all over the face of the earth. </p>
      <p>Potential uses and markets seen by Magnatron are in
        transportation and energy production such as a replacement for
        steam boilers, turbines and auxiliary power for industry with
        home generator usage possible. Johnson, being located in Elgin
        Illinois, privately feels the first units should be power farm
        tractors and trucks with personal transportation vehicles being
        fitted second. Magnatron says the new power source would be
        highly adaptable to boats, ships, and air use. </p>
      <p>A public demonstration of the new power source-is scheduled for
        the very near future, says Johnson, with four Magnatron-equipped
        vehicles traveling across the USA in such a manner that
        practically every citizen will have a chance to see the new
        motor on a first-hand basis. Also, one special vehicle will take
        a surprise route coast-to-coast on an unannounced schedule,
        while itineraries for the other vehicles will be publicized
        prior ro arrival. </p>
      <p>Production is proposed to begin after the public demonstration
        and with current facilities Magnatron estimates a maximum of 100
        units per day could be constructed. Plans are in the worls to
        construct a larger manufacturing plant on a 65-acre plot in
        Illinois with national distribution to follow. </p>
      <p>In addition to the driving tests, Magnatron plans to send three
        motors to independent labs for testing and install several
        others on various farm equipment including grain storage and
        drying equipment, Popular Performance Boat Magazine will have an
        updated story next issue including the drive plan itinerary.
        Magnatron stated that due to the volume of mail being received,
        only those inquiries with self-addressed stamped envelopes will
        be answered. </p>

      <p><font color="#000000">An engine which reportedly operates on
          electricity generated from chemical reaction, first previewed
          in the Daily Courier news more than a year ago, is now on
          display to the public.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The inventor, who still requests
          anonymity for security reasons, says there will be a public
          demonstration of the engine soon, perhaps as early as
          Wednesday.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Early this morning, the heavy blinds
          which closed off the interior of Magnatron, inc., 161 S. Grove
          Ave., Elgin, from the rest of the world were raised.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Behind the plate glass window is the
          chassis of an old car, set up on blocks.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">And inside the engine housing is a motor
          completely unfamiliar in size, shape, and description.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">That engine is the one described in the
          Daily Courier News on Aug. 12, 1977.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Its inventor claimed it was a
          revolutionary new source of power derived from the chemical
          reaction of deuterium and gallium.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">That controlled reaction results in the
          fusion of two atoms forming a new atom, he says. In the
          process, electricity is released and that is what powers the
          engine, the inventor claims.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The engine emits no pollutants and uses
          no fossil fuel in its operation. The only lubricant is
          synthetically produced and the engine needs no petroleum
          products for operation, the inventor claims.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">While the inventor will not detail the
          exact operation, he says that 17 ounces of deuterium, a
          hydrogen product which can be manufactured, and an ounce and a
          half of gallium, a heavy metal which is a well known donor
          source for electricity, is all that is needed to power the
          engine for 100,000 miles.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The flow of the gallium and deuterium is
          controlled by magnetic tunnels and where to two meet or
          strike, a laser beam forces their fusion.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The inventor says numerous problems have
          delayed his original target date of late 1977 for display of
          the engine.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But after a few setbacks and some
          unforeseen problems, he says this first production model is
          ready and functioning.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The engine is not in mass production yet,
          and will not be until funding is obtained, he said early this
          week.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The engine can be seen from the sidewalk
          in front of the shop.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The inventor says that when he has the
          demonstration of the motor, investors and prospective
          Magnatron customers may present themselves.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The engine is in operation, the inventor
          says, however, it is not hooked up to the car’s transmission
          for safety reasons, he claims.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In a closed demonstration attended by the
          Daily Courier News, the engine was turned on, but as it was
          not hooked up to the car’s transmission, it was not possible
          to verify its power, reported to be 525 horsepower.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">There did not appear to be an external
          power supply and a regular car battery used to power the car’s
          accessories was disconnected on request. Removing the battery
          did not cause any noticeable depreciation of power.</font> </p>

          crews from ABC in Chicago and ABC network television taped
          interviews, did see the engine run. What they saw was the
          engine turn belts to operate an alternator and power steering
          unit. The engine was not connected to the drive shaft of the
          old Chevrolet in which it was mounted, because company

      <p><font color="#000000">Two television personalities, one from

          saw the engine in operation and interviewed Johnson. Both gave
          the impression that they were skeptical about his claims as to
          the performance of the engine and did not appear to be
          satisfied by some of his explanations.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Their reactions mirrored those of some of

          well, it’s possible, anything’s possible.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“But this explanation does not sound even

      <p><font color="#000000">Dr Jack Volkers, an Elgin physicist, said
          he sincerely doubted that the engine would work as Johnson
          claims it will.</font> </p>

          agree.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“They’ve had me convinced for a long
          time. I’ve been hearing about this for quite a while. We know
          someone who’s getting a dealership”.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Simpson said he had not seen the engine
          run but it didn’t really matter to him.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I know someone who said he saw it run. I
          can understand why he didn’t run it today. It didn’t really
          bother me that I didn’t get to see it run”, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But not everyone was so satisfied.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I’m interested in it, but would have
          been more believable to me if I could have seen it running”,
          said Trecile Huddleston of southern Illinois, who said he
          first heard of the engine about a year ago.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Both Leo Hohmann and Harold Gottman of
          Elgin said they had not come to any conclusion about the
          engine or its validity.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I didn’t get enough information about
          it. I want to know how much he’s going to ask per share (on
          investments), if you get a trade-in credit when you convert
          your engine, things like that. I thought the demonstration was
          very poorly handled. I asked questions and no one seemed to
          know the answers. I didn’t see anything run. They should have
          showed how it works”, said Gottman.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Both said they were hopeful, but neither
          was convinced.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“It sounds a little farfetched to me. I
          believe anything’s possible. We can always advance our
          technology, but I didn’t see anything here that really
          convinced me”, said Orville Shelton, a former Elgin resident
          now living in Arkansas.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“If this is for real, and it looks like
          it is, then it’s great. I am convinced that we’re due for
          something like this”, said Vince Frisby of Aurora.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I was convinced it worked even before it
          ran”, said Bill Grant of Elgin, who stood outside Magnatron
          early Wednesday afternoon and saw the engine run for camera
          crews.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“They made a believer out of me”, he
          said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I think it’s going to revolutionize the
          world. I was convinced before I saw it run”, said Walter
          Rodholm, of Elgin, who also saw the demonstration.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I’ve been interested since I first heard
          about it. I’ve been convinced for a long time that it actually
          works”, said M. Christensen of rural Elgin.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I have lots of doubts about this”, said
          Brian Getzelman of Elgin.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I asked him (the man making the
          demonstration) what te byproducts of this reaction were and
          said there weren’t any. That means everything inside is
          converted to energy. Not even the sun can do that”, he said.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I read the story in the paper and I’m
          even more skeptical now that I’ve seen it”, said Paul Larson
          of Elgin.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“I can’t believe these small bottle
          contain enough fuel to power a car for that distance. The fact
          that I didn’t get to see it run really had a negative effect
          on me”, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson is undaunted by the non-believers
          and said his next step is to put together 25 engines which he
          will submit for testing and demonstration.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">He mentioned the federal Bureau of
          Standards, Underwriter’s Laboratory and Ralph Nader’s group as
          possibilities to conduct tests.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But he admitted to one interviewer that
          people may be skeptical about investing in his engine until
          those tests are complete.</font> </p>

      <p><b><font color="#000000">Incomplete article (presumably <i>Daily






              Courier News</i>, date unknown) ---</font></b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><b><font color="#000000"><font size="+1">Magnatron Motor</font></font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font color="#000000">(Continued from A-1)</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">… “laboratory that everybody recognized,
          such as Underwriter’s laboratory”, Johnson said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson, a native of Dennison, Texas,
          said that he has been trained in both physics and electrical
          engineering at the University of Darmstadt in West Germany. He
          and is wife, Marilyn, live in Elgin and have three children,
          Eric, 25, Sherry, 23, and Randy, 21.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson’s wife is originally from Morton
          and his in-laws, the Rev. and Mrs J.W. Davis, live in
          Metamora. Davis was a Mennonite minister for 44 years.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“He’s (Johnson) been married to our
          daughter for 25 years”, Mrs Davis said. “He’s a very
          intelligent man and what he says, he’ll do”.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson said he lived in Tremont for 7 or
          8 years in the early ‘50s when he worked for the Department of
          Defense. He said he spent most of that time flying to
          different defense installations around the country, but would
          not say what his work entailed.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">He later worked in research and
          development at several companies, including Motorola, which
          brought him to Elgin.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Magnatron Motor discovery occurred by
          accident about 11 years ago, Johnson said. He was developing a
          new type of electronic circuit using deuterium oxide and
          gallium when he noticed the two materials were producing
          energy on their own. He said e could not figure out what was
          triggering the energy production for quite a while. He finally
          discovered it was light.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">In his Magnatron motor, the two elements
          are fused together by using a diffraction prism (“Not a
          laser”), Johnson said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The Magnatron is sealed, however, so
          ‘light’ is provided from photon energy produced from coils
          tied directly to the motor, Johnson said. “It’s more or less a
          pulse-generated system”, he added.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson would not say how the energy is
          converted to electricity to power the motor. He said that is
          his secret discovery and he fears if he lets the knowledge out
          it could be used for weapon production. “The Defense
          Department is working on producing a missile that generates
          and emits its own electrical power. I don’t want to produce
          another weapon”, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">He added that he has applied for a patent
          on his invention, but would not give the application number
          and said it is listed under another name. He also said his
          patent attorneys are working on 22 other patents for his
          invention to protect it.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Some persons in Roanoke have offered him
          land for his plant, he said, but he plans to stay in the Elgin
          area. He doesn’t want to compete with Caterpillar for shippers
          and jobbers, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">His present two-story, stone-and-brick
          building at 150 S. Grove can produce 100 units per day, but he
          has an option on 95 acres for expansion, he said. He plans to
          produce 110,000 units in the first year of full production,
          slated to being in the fall. At present he employs only 8
          persons.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">All the Magnatron parts are produced by
          subcontractors, Johnson said, so his plant would just be an
          easily expandable assembly operation.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson said he has taken money from
          investors and has invested about $7 million of his own money,
          but will not take money from people who want to buy an engine
          (he claims to have 130,000 orders on file). “I don’t want
          their money, I just want their backing”, he added.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">One of the investors is Lyle Smith, who
          farms 700 acres near Eureka with his brother and enphew.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“The thing that’s important is whether
          the energy situation is true”, Smith said. “Why can’t people
          get grants to study things like this (the Magnatron)?”, he
          asked.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Is Smith worried about his investment?</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“Being a farmer, I take a gamble ever
          year”, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">But evidently someone is worried about
          his money. The Illinois attorney general’s Consumer Protection
          Office in Chicago is conducting an investigation of Magnatron
          Inc.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“It’s been underway for several months”,
          according to William Oberhardt, as assistant attorney general.
          Oberhardt said he talked to Johnson personally once, when
          Johnson was subpoenaed.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson said the investigator was “lazy”.
          He said the information he wanted could have been obtained
          from material he has filed with state offices (Magnatron is a
          Delaware corporation).</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">When Johnson’s claims were explained to
          Dr Charles Baker, director of Argonne National Laboratory’s
          Fusion Power Program, Baker provided a two-word answer:
          “Sounds crazy”.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Baker said fusion power for commercial
          applications has been studied since the early 1950s. He said
          fusion probably won’t be available for commercial use until
          after the turn of the century.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The smallest fusion power unit developed
          by experimenters would be the size of a large room, baker
          said. He added that powering automobiles through fusion isn’t
          even being contemplated at present.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">One problem with car-sized units would be
          containment of the high temperatures needed for the fusion
          process, Baker noted. Fusion, which is how our sun and other
          stars produce energy, requires temperatures at hundreds of
          millions of degrees, he said.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson, of course, is highly critical of
          government programs like the one at Argonne and government
          agencies and politicians as a whole.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“There have been very few startling
          things that have come from a large organization. You don’t get
          anything practical out of a government-sponsored laboratory
          such as Fermi and Argonne”.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson believes watching a budget as
          required by government-funded programs stifles creativity and
          the ability to take a chance.”</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The DOE s termed a rip-off by Johnson.
          “Right now our government is not looking for energy in any
          form.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“A tremendous amount of money is spent
          (on DOE) every year and so far I haven’t seen anything out on
          the road or helping heat your home or helping reduce the cost
          of your utilities or anything else”, Johnson added.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">Johnson on politicians: “I’ve met several
          politicians so far and I can’t believe a word they say”.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">The debate over whether Johnson’s
          invention works as he claims will become moot if Phase I takes
          place as planned.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“Regardless of what the news media says,
          this is the only step that we will take before mass production
          of our units”, Johnson said in a leaflet describing Phase I.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">And criticism doesn’t bother Johnson.
          “You know who the Wright brothers are. Give me the name of one
          of the men who criticized them.</font> </p>
      <p><font color="#000000">“It’s sure a good thing some of us are
          stubborn enough to realize some things are not impossible”.</font>
