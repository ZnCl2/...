        <p style="text-align: left;">A Sydney soft drinks producer has
          been inundated with demand for his latest product, a
          mineral-rich water which doubles the life of cattle and is
          claimed to cure ailments like arthritis and osteoporosis.
          Developed by former vet Russell Beckett, who has a doctorate
          in biochemical pathology, "Unique Water" has just gone on sale
          after testing by 100 Australians. One is Paul Sheehan, a
          respected Sydney journalist, who said in the <i>Sydney
            Morning Herald</i> at the weekend how it has cured him of a
          series of long-term autoimmune diseases. A letter from
          Sheehan's doctor said: "He has anklyosing spondylitis, and is
          now undergoing investigation for lupus erythematosis. He
          suffers constant back and neck pains, florid facial rash,
          extreme fatigue and shoulder pains." </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">The illness is incurable and
          requires constant treatment. But Sheehan said after taking
          Beckett's water for two years, he was no longer consuming
          drugs of any kind, suffered no back or neck pain nor any of
          the other symptoms of the diseases. "For someone with a
          cocktail of chronic conditions, I feel suspiciously normal and
          relatively pain-free," he said. A number of prominent people
          are said to have undergone similar cures since starting to
          drink what they call "magic water", which is richer in some
          minerals and found naturally in some places. None has a
          financial interest in the product. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Beckett, who has spent 20 years
          researching it, has been granted patents in Australia and in
          the United States where the Patent and Trademark Office
          describes it as "A method of preventing or treating
          inflammatory diseases or degenerative diseases in a mammal."
          His claimed breakthrough is based on the proposition that
          acids formed from carbon dioxide produced by the body
          contribute to fatigue and degeneration and are the building
          blocks for all inflammatory diseases. They are key factors in
          rheumatoid and osteo-athritis, osteoporosis and some cancers
          and skin diseases. Beckett’s key breakthrough is claimed to be
          the anti-acid magnesium bicarbonate in the water which travels
          down the individual cells where it acts as a protective buffer
          against excess carbon dioxide and acid. He tried to prove his
          theories by testing the ingredients on sheep for many years
          before realizing that such water must occur naturally
          somewhere. He found it, by coincidence, in the Monaro region
          of the Snowy Mountains near Canberra where farmers had known
          for years about the longevity of cattle and sheep. The
          government-run Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
          Organisation had been researching for 35 years why some
          animals lived twice as long, and most lived at least 30%
          longer. </p>
        <p style="text-align: left;">Despite the success of the trials
          in Sydney, Beckett acknowledges his theory will take many
          years and many thousands more people to prove. But through a
          Sydney soft drinks manufacturer Bert’s Soft Drinks, Beckett
          has organized commercial sales of the water. "We have been
          absolutely inundated with calls for it since it went on sale
          on Saturday," said Bert's managing director Arthur Shelly. "It
          has gone from nowhere to our top selling product overnight."

      <p>TECHNICAL FIELD </p>
      <p>This invention relates to an aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution, a process of preparing the aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution and a method of preventing and treating certain
        inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases and viral diseases
        in mammals. </p>
      <p>Generally the certain inflammatory diseases, degenerative
        diseases and viral diseases in mammals are those that require
        extracellular or intracellular acidic conditions or
        extracellular or intracellular proton concentrations at some
        point in disease process or disease pathogenesis. </p>
      <p>Typically the certain inflammatory diseases, degenerative
        diseases and viral diseases in mammals are those that require
        the activities of carbonic anhydrase enzymes and/or the
        activities of acid (aspartic) protease enzymes and/or the
        activities of endosomal or lysosomal acid-requiring-enzymes
        and/or the activities of V-type ATPase proton pumps at some
        point in disease process or disease pathogenesis. Typically the
        certain inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases and viral
        diseases in mammals are represented by the diseases of arthritis
        and influenza; </p>
      <p>This invention relates to a method of using an aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution to decrease senescence and to increase
        longevity in mammals. Generally senescence is decreased and
        longevity is increased in mammals by improving the buffering
        capacity of the extracellular and intracellular fluids of the
        body. Generally senescence is decreased and longevity is
        increased in mammals by the improved buffering capacity causing
        a decrease in proton concentrations in the extracellular and

      <p>BACKGROUND ART </p>
      <p>Certain inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases and viral
        diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality in mammals.
        Typically these diseases are represented by the diseases of
        arthritis and influenza. </p>
      <p>Arthritis is any inflammatory condition of the joints,
        characterised by pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis is the most
        common form of arthritis in which one or many joins undergo
        degenerative changes. Treatment includes rest of the involved
        joints, heat, and antiinflammatory drugs. Intraarticular
        injections of corticosteroids may give relief. Surgical
        treatment is sometimes necessary and may reduce pain and greatly
        improve the function of the joint. However these treatments,
        apart from surgical treatment, only provide temporary relief and
        some may have severe side reactions. </p>
      <p>Influenza is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory
        tract caused by a myxovirus and transmitted by airborne droplet
        infection. It occurs in isolated cases, epidemics and pandemics
        Treatment is symptomatic and usually involves bed rest,
        antipyretics such as aspirin and drinking of fluids. New strains
        of the virus emerge at regular intervals so it is difficult to
        take preventative measures to avoid the infection There is a
        need for a method to prevent and to treat certain inflammatory
        diseases, degenerative diseases and viral diseases in mammals.
        There is a need for a method to prevent and to treat arthritis
        and influenza in mammals. </p>
      <p>Senescence in mammals is characterised by progressive
        oxidations of the structural and functional molecules that
        constitute body cells and tissues. Oxidations of the structural
        and functional molecules in body cells and tissues are increased
        in rate by acidic conditions. Oxidations of structural and
        functional molecules are increased in rate by the presence of
        excess proton concentrations. There is a need for a method to
        prevent and treat excess proton concentrations in body cells so
        that oxidations of structural and functional molecules are
        decreased in rate. There is a need for a method to decrease and
        treat senescence in mammals. </p>

        dioxide gas dissolved in water, carbonated soft drinks,
        carbonated mineral water, soda water or other carbon
        dioxide-containing-aqueous diluents. If carbon dioxide gas is
        used, the carbon dioxide may be either bubbled into aqueous
        solutions containing metal carbonate or metal carbonate
        hydroxide or metal oxide or mixture thereof or the carbon
        dioxide may be introduced in the form of a blanket over aqueous
        solutions containing metal carbonate or metal carbonate
        hydroxide or metal oxide or mixture thereof. Typically the

        C. to 10° C. and even most typically 5° C. </p>
      <p>Generally The pH adjusting agent is carbon dioxide gas,
        carbonic acid in water, hydrated carbon dioxide in water, carbon
        dioxide gas in water, carbonated soft drinks, carbonated mineral
        water, soda water or other carbon dioxide-containing-aqueous
        diluents or an alkali or any mixture thereof. Examples of
        alkalis are water soluble drinkable alkalis such as sodium
        hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or potassium
        hydroxide or any mixture thereof. </p>
      <p>Typically additives may be added during the process of the
        invention or to the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution. The additives may be 0 mg or 0.5 mg to
        1000 mg sodium bicarbonate per liter of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, typically 25 mg to
        900 mg per liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution, typically 50 mg to 800 mg or 50 mg to 500
        mg per liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution, more typically 100 mg to 700 mg per liter
        of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution, even more typically 200 mg to 600 mg per liter of
        aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution,
        most typically 300 mg to 500 mg per liter of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, even most typically
        500 mg per liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution. The additives may also be chlorides and
        appropriate salts of magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium and
        lithium, such as carbonates or hydroxides or sulfates, with or
        without the addition of sodium bicarbonate. For example,
        magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride or other soluble salts of
        magnesium. Further additives may include potassium bicarbonate,
        calcium bicarbonate or lithium bicarbonate Generally calcium
        bicarbonate is prepared by adding carbonic acid or carbonated
        water or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas to a
        mixture of calcium carbonate in water. Generally lithium
        bicarbonate is prepared by adding carbonic acid and/or
        carbonated water and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon
        dioxide gas and/or solid carbon dioxide to a mixture of lithium
        carbonate in water. </p>
      <p>The aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution may further include a stabilising agent. The
        stabilising agent may also be a pH adjusting agent, Typically
        the stabilising agent is a gaseous phase, for example carbon
        dioxide gas, which maintains and/or stabilises the solution at a
        pH of 7 to 9 and at a temperature of 0 to 55° C. more typically
        0 to 25° C. </p>
      <p>Generally once the solution is prepared, the solution may be
        stored under a blanket of carbon dioxide gas or a mixture of
        carbon dioxide gas and a nondeleterious inert gas, for example,
        argon, helium, air, oxygen and/or nitrogen wherein the amount of
        carbon dioxide present in the inert gas is sufficient to
        maintain the solution at a pH of 7 to 9 and at a temperature of
        0 to 25° C. and to prevent the metal bicarbonate from forming
        insoluble compounds which can precipitate out of solution.
        Typically the carbon dioxide gas above the solution prevents
        loss of carbon dioxide from the solution. The amount of carbon
        dioxide in the gaseous mixture provides partial pressure on the
        liquid which is substantially equal to the partial pressure
        which is produced from equilibrium of bicarbonate in the
        solution at the mixing temperature. </p>
      <p>Magnesium Bicarbonate Particularly </p>
      <p>Typically the production of magnesium bicarbonate utilises the
        dissolution of magnesium carbonate by carbonic acid or hydrated
        carbon dioxide solutions. Ideally, the dissolution is produced
        within a defined range of conditions--a defined range of pH
        values, a defined range of temperature values and a defined
        minimum time. For optimal biological and medical activities, and
        for therapeutic safety, the concentrations of the component ions
        are defined also. </p>
      <p>Typically to prepare the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution, crushed or powdered metal carbonate,
        or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal oxide, such as magnesium
        carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub>, or commercial magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,
or













        other commercial magnesium carbonate hydroxides, or hydrated
        magnesium oxides, or magnesium oxides heated with carbon
        dioxide, or the calcite series or dolomite series of minerals
        (Mg, Ca)CO<sub>3</sub>, or limestone or dolomite rocks is mixed
        with water. A cloudy suspension is obtained. Sufficient carbonic
        acid and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas
        and/or solid carbon dioxide is added to obtain a solution having
        a pH 7 to 9 or pH 7 to 8.6, more typically pH 7.5 to 8.8 or pH
        7.5 to 8.5 or pH 7.8 to 8.6, pH 7.8 to 8.5, pH 7.8 to 8.4, pH

        pH 8.4 to 8.6, pH 8.4 to 8.5, pH 8.5 to 8.6, even more typically
        pH 8 to 8.6 or pH 8.2 to 8.6, most typically pH 8.3. The
        solution is then typically placed in a closed or sealed
        container at 0 to 20° C. or 0 to 15° C. with occasional mixing
        until a clear solution develops. The amount of carbonic acid
        and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas bubbled
        through the solution and dissolved therein and/or solid carbon
        dioxide is sufficient to prevent precipitation of water
        insoluble metal compounds (such as magnesium or calcium
        carbonate). A clear solution is generally obtained in about 6
        hours to 7 days, typically 12 hours to 5 days, more typically 24
        hours to 5 days, most typically 24 hours to 3 days. Generally
        the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution is prepared and stored at a temperature ranging from 0
        to 55° C., 0 to 25° C., 0 to 20° C. 0.5 to 25° C., 0.5 to 20°
        C., 0.5 to 15° C., 0.5 to 10° C., 0.5 to 9° C., 0.5 to 8° C.,

        to 15° C., typically 0 to 15° C., more typically 0 to 10° C.,
        even more typically 3° C. to 10° C., most typically 5° C. to 10°
        C. and even most typically 5° C. Alternatively the crushed or
        powdered metal carbonate, or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal
        oxide or mixture thereof is added to an aqueous solution of the
        carbonic acid and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or to an
        aqueous solution through which carbon dioxide gas is bubbled
        and/or solid carbon dioxide has been added. The amount of
        carbonic acid and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon
        dioxide gas bubbled through the solution and dissolved therein
        and/or solid carbon dioxide is sufficient to prevent
        precipitation of water insoluble metal compounds (such as
        magnesium or calcium carbonate). </p>
      <p>Typically one liter of water is placed in a container and
        sufficient carbonic acid and/or carbonated water and/or hydrated
        carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas and/or solid carbon
        dioxide is added to produce a pH value of approximately pH 5.2.
        (In practice, approximately 40 to 45 mL of chilled (5.degree.
        C.) carbonated mineral water is used depending on the initial pH
        of the water). The container is sealed and the contents are
        mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate powder
        (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added, The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. </p>
      <p>The container is stored at a temperature of 0 to 10° C. and the
        contents mixed regularly. Sufficient time is allowed for a clear
        solution of magnesium bicarbonate to develop at a range of pH
        8.0 to pH 8.6, preferably pH 8.3. This takes approximately 24 to
        72 hours. Alternatively the carbonic acid and/or carbonated
        water and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas
        and/or solid carbon dioxide is added to the magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate powder in water. Alternatively one liter
        of water is placed in a container and sufficient carbonic acid
        and/or carbonated water and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or
        solid carbon dioxide is added to produce a pH value less than pH
        5 2. (In practice, approximately 30 mL to 40 mL of chilled water
        is used depending on the initial pH of the water). The container
        is sealed and the contents are mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,

        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. The container is stored at a temperature of
        0 to 10° C. and the contents mixed regularly. The pH of the
        water is then adjusted with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide
        or potassium hydroxide to a pH of 8 to 8.6, typically pH 8.3.
        Alternatively the carbonic acid or carbonated water and/or
        hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas and/or solid
        carbon dioxide is added to the magnesium carbonate hydroxide
        pentahydrate powder in water. </p>
      <p>The above processes may optionally be conducted under an
        atmosphere of carbon dioxide or a gas comprising carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p>Generally once the solution is prepared, it may be stored under
        a blanket of carbon dioxide gas to maintain the solution at a pH
        of 7 to 9 and at a temperature of 0 to 25° C. </p>
      <p>Usually one liter of the magnesium bicarbonate solution
        prepared above contains approximately 120 mg of magnesium per
        liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and approximately 600 mg of bicarbonate. 500 mg sodium
        bicarbonate (or potassium bicarbonate) is added to the magnesium
        bicarbonate solution and mixed. The mixture is stored in a
        sealed container in a refrigerator. The mixture contains
        approximately 120 mg magnesium per liter of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, 135 mg sodium per
        liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and 950 mg bicarbonate per liter of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution of the invention is administered or
        consumed orally. Typically the solution is an orally drinkable
        solution. Typically the solution is a therapeutic orally
        drinkable solution. Alternatively a gelling agent may added to
        the solution and the solution subjected to gelling conditions to
        gel the solution and the resultant gel may be consumed orally.
        For example, the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution may be prepared as a solution or an iced
        confectionary, such as an ice block or iced dessert, which is
        ingested orally. Alternatively the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be prepared in the form
        of a tablet, lozenge or lolly which is ingested orally. For
        example, the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution may be administered for metabolic acidosis
        or renal failure. Optionally the solution may be sterilised.
        Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is prepared as a solution which is ingested
        on a regular basis hourly, daily, monthly or yearly. The amount
        and frequency of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution administered/consumed in a day is generally
        sufficient so as to maintain a steady bicarbonate level in the
        bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. It is
        preferable to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate level in
        the bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. The
        amount of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution administered in a day ranges from 250 mL to 6 liters,
        typically 250 mL to 5.5 liters, 250 mL to 5 liters, 250 mL to
        4.5 liters, 250 mL to 4 liters, 250 mL to 3.5 liters, 250 mL to
        3 liters, 500 mL to 6 liters, 500 mL to 5.5 liters, 500 mL to 5
        liters, 500 mL to 4.5 liters, 500 mL to 4 liters, 500 mL to 3.5
        liters, 500 mL to 3 liters, more typically 1 liter to 6 liters,
        1 liter to 5.5 liters, 1 liter to 5 liters, 1 liter to 4,5
        liters, 1 liter to 4 liters, 1 liter to 3.5 liters, even more
        typically 1 liter to 3 liters, 1.5 liters to 6 liters, 1.5
        liters to 5.5 liters, 1.5 liters to 5 liters, 1.5 liters to 4.5
        liters, 1.5 liters to 4 liters, 1.5 liters to 3.5 liters, 1.8
        liters to 3.3 liters, 1.8 to 2.8 liters, 1.8 to 2.5 liters, 1.8
        to 2.3 liters, 1.8 to 2.0 liters, most typically 2 to 3 liters,
        typically 2.3 to 2.8 liters, more typically 2.3 to 2.6 liters,
        usually 2.1 to 3 liters. The aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution may be administered on a full or
        empty stomach, typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is administered on an empty stomach.
        Usually 1.5 to 3.5 liters, typically 1.8 to 3 liters, more
        typically 1.5 to 2.4 liters, even more typically 1.8 to 2.1
        liters and usually between 1.8 and 2.7 liters of aqueous neutral
        to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution is ingested,
        administered or consumed on an empty stomach by a mammal
        (typically a human) in equal or non equal volume amounts
        (100-1000 mL, 200-800 mL, 250-750 mL, 275-700 mL, 300-650 mL,
        350-600 mL, 400-550 mL, 450-500 mL, typically about 300-400 mL,
        more typically about 375 mL volume amounts a number of times
        (typically at set times) each day for the required number of
        times per day to drink the desired daily amount of the
        solution). For example if 1800 mL per day is to be consumed then
        a user may drink six 300 mL amounts of the solution every 2 to
        2.5 hours throughout the day. The oral consumption of the
        solution three or more times at roughly equally spaced apart
        intervals throughout the day is more desirable than consuming
        the solution in one or two lots throughout the day. The idea of
        taking the solution is to take it regularly throughout the day
        so that a simulated continuous oral intake or a close to
        continuous regular oral intake of the solution occurs. Thus
        depending on the condition and the subject one suitable
        administration/consumption regime could be nine by 200 mL
        amounts of the solution, each 200 mL amount being orally
        administered/consumed about every 1.5-1.75 hours to provide a
        total daily intake of 1800 mL. Alternatively, once again
        depending on the condition and the subject one suitable
        administration/consumption regime could be nine by 300 mL
        amounts of the solution, each 300 mL amount being orally
        administered/consumed about every 1.5-1.75 hours to provide a
        total daily intake of 2700 mL. Alternatively, once again
        depending on the condition and the subject one suitable
        administration/consumption regime could be nine by 350 mL
        amounts of the solution, each 350 mL amount being orally
        administered/consumed about every 1.5-1.75 hours to provide a
        total daily intake of 3150 mL. Typically the solution is
        administered/consumed 3 to 30, 3-25, 3-20, 3-15, 3-12, 3-10,
        3-9, 3-8, 3-7, 3-6, 3-5, 3-4, 4-30, 4-25, 4-20, 4-15, 4-12,
        4-10, 4-9, 4-8, 4-7, 4-6, 4-5, 5-30, 5-25, 5-20, 5-15, 5-12,
        5-11, 5-10, 5-9, 5-8, 5-7, 5-6, 6-30, 6-25, 6-20, 6-15, 6-12,
        6-11, 6-10, 6-9, 6-8, 6-7, 7-30, 7-25, 7-20, 7-15, 7-12, 7-11,
        7-10, 7-9, 7-8, 8-30, 8-25, 8-20, 8-15, 8-12, 8-11, 8-10, 8-9
        times per day at regular or irregular intervals or a mixture of
        both regular and irregular intervals, throughout each day.
        Typically the solution is administered/consumed every 0.3-10,
        0.3-8, 0.3-7, 0.3-6, 0.3-5, 0.3-4.5, 0.3-4, 0.3-3.5, 0.3-3,
        0.3-2.5, 0.3-2, 0.3-1.5, 0.3-1, 0.3-0.75, 0.3-0.5 hours/day when
        the subject is awake. More typically the solution is
        administered/consumed every 0.5-8, 0.5-7, 0.5-6, 0.5-5, 0.5-4.5,
        0.5-4, 0.5-3.5, 0.5-3, 0.5-2.5, 0.5-2, 0.5-1.5, 0.5-1, 0.5-0.8,
        0.5-0.75 hours/day when the subject is awake. Where possible the
        solution is consumed/administered on an empty (e.g. before
        eating). The solution may be administered according to these
        latter dosages over short (for example 1 to 60 days, 10 to 40
        days, 3 months to 6 months, 1 day to 6 months) or long (for
        example 6 months to 10 years or more, 9 months to 18 months, 1
        year to 3 years, 1 year to 5 years, 2 to 6 years) periods as
        required. Usually the amount of aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution administered to a mammal is
        5 to 100 mL per Kg, more usual 10 to 50 mL per Kg, most usual 14
        to 29 mL per Kg or 25 to 43 mL per Kg. </p>
      <p>The solution may include other additives such as sweeteners,
        preservatives, flavourings and other suitable additives.
        Examples of suitable sweetners include sucrose, lactose,
        glucose. aspartame or saccharine. Examples of suitable
        flavouring agents include peppermint oil, oil of wintergreen,
        cherry, orange or raspberry flavouring. Examples of suitable
        preservatives include sodium benzoate, vitamin E,
        alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben
        or sodium bisulphite. </p>
      <p>Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is orally administered/consumed on an empty
        stomach. Usually consumption in this manner avoids the mixing of
        bicarbonate anions with stomach acid which may result in the
        loss of bicarbonate Usually the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution is consumed in small amounts
        a number of times through a day typically at set times each day
        to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate concentration of
        body fluids. Usually the amount of aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution consumed at commencement is
        500 mL per day and is increased by increments over a period of
        one month to the maximum consumption. This start-up schedule
        generally avoids any gastrointestinal side effects due to the
        smooth muscle relaxation properties of magnesium. </p>
      <p>The aqueous neutral to very mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution of the invention may be administered intravenously
        (e.g. by discrete injection, semi continuous injection or drip
        feed or continuous injection or drip feed) or by other
        parenteral routes. Another embodiment of the invention is
        directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the solution
        of the first or eleventh embodiments together with one or more
        pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants and/or
        excipients. Typically the pharmaceutical composition is suitable
        for oral or parenteral administration. Another embodiment of the
        invention is directed to a veterinary composition comprising the
        solution of the first or eleventh embodiments together with one
        or more veterinarily acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants
        and/or excipients. Typically the veterinary composition is
        suitable for oral or parenteral administration. The amount and
        frequency of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution administered/consumed in a day is generally
        sufficient so as to maintain a steady bicarbonate level in the
        bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. It is
        preferable to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate level in
        the bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. For
        parenteral administration, the solution is generally sterile.
        Suitable mono-toxic parenterally acceptable diluents or solvents
        include waters, Ringer's solution, isotonic salt solution,
        1,3-butanediol, ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene
        glycols in mixtures with water. Aqueous solutions or suspensions
        may further comprise one or more buffering agents. Suitable
        buffering agents include sodium borate, sodium acetate, sodium
        citrate, or sodium tartrate, for example. Typically the solution
        is administered on a regular basis throughout a day to a patient
        requiring treatment. For example a patient may be parenterally
        administered the solution by way of a continuous drip feed or
        alternatively by way of a number of injections of the solution
        throughout a day (e.g. every 0.5-8 hours, more typically every
        1-4 hours). The treatment is generally continued as long as
        required to alleviate the patient's symptoms to a satisfactory
        level. For concentration of metal bicarbonate in the
        compositions, frequency of administration and amount
        administered see discussion under oral administration. </p>

      <p>BEST MODE AND OTHER MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Magnesium bicarbonate is a natural hydrated salt which exists
        only in an aqueous solution. It may be formed in spring water by
        an ion exchange process between the protons in carbonic acid
        (formed from the hydration of carbon dioxide located in the
        atmosphere, organic material, soils and rocks) and the magnesium
        in the constituent minerals of rocks (particularly the
        ferromagnesian minerals known as pyroxene and olivine that
        constitute basalt rocks). </p>
      <p>The ion exchange process can be represented by the following
        equations </p>
      <p><img src="1eq1.gif" width="305" height="136"></p>
      <p>The term magnesium bicarbonate is used universally to describe
        the mixture of magnesium cations and bicarbonate anions found in
        spring waters and mineral waters. Most spring waters and mineral
        waters have acidic pH values (about pH 6.0). If the pH value of
        the water rises (due to contact with hydroxides), the magnesium
        cations and bicarbonate anions "attract" each other (reversibly)
        to form the true salt. The chemical formula of magnesium
        bicarbonate may be written as Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
        or (more accurately) Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub>(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.
        This latter formula takes into account the hexahydrated
        magnesium cation Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>.<sup>2+</sup>. </p>
      <p>In essence, magnesium bicarbonate exists in aqueous solution
        probably as an hydrated salt of indeterminate hydration size due
        to the hydrogen bonds between linked water dipoles centred
        around the hydrated magnesium cation. </p>
      <p>The chemical processes occurring in magnesium bicarbonate
        solutions are complex and depend on the concentrations of
        magnesium cations and other ions. The following reactions are
        considered to occur: </p>
      <p><img src="1eq2.gif" width="343" height="196"></p>
      <p>There exists also a range of possible acid-base equilibria
        involving HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>,
        CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions and CO<sub>2</sub>
        and H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>. Usually the pH adjusting agent
        (and/or stabilising agent) maintains the acid-base equilibria. </p>
      <p>Typically to prepare the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution, crushed or powdered metal carbonate,
        or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal oxide, such as magnesium
        carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub>, or commercial magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2.</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O,
or













        other commercial magnesium carbonate hydroxides, or hydrated
        magnesium oxides, or magnesium oxides heated with carbon
        dioxide, or the calcite series or dolomite series of minerals
        (Mg, Ca)CO<sub>3</sub>, or limestone or dolomite rocks is mixed
        with water. A cloudy suspension is obtained. Sufficient carbonic
        acid or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas is added
        to obtain a solution having a pH 7 to 9 or pH 7 to 8.6, more
        typically pH 7.5 to 8.8 or pH 7.5 to 8.5 or pH 7.8 to 8.6, pH

        to 8,6, even more typically pH 8 to 8.5 or pH 8.2 to 8.6, most
        typically pH 8.3. The solution is then typically placed in a
        sealed container at 0 to 20° C. with occasional mixing until a
        clear solution develops. A clear solution is generally obtained
        in about 6 hours to 7 days, typically 12 hours to 5 days, more
        typically 24 hours to 5 days, most typically 24 hours to 3 days.
        Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is prepared and stored at a temperature
        ranging from 0 to 25° C., 0 to 20° C. 0.5 to 25° C., 0.5 to 20°

        to 15° C., typically 0 to 15° C., more typically 0 to 10° C.,
        even more typically 3° C. to 10° C., most typically 5° C. to 10°
        C. and even most typically 5° C.. Alternatively the crushed or
        powdered metal carbonate, or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal
        oxide or mixture thereof is added to an aqueous solution of the
        carbonic acid or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas.
      </p>
      <p>Typically one liter of water is placed in a container and
        sufficient carbonic acid or carbonated water or hydrated carbon
        dioxide or carbon dioxide gas is added to produce a pH value of
        approximately pH 5.2. (In practice, approximately 40 to 45 mL of
        chilled (5° C.) carbonated mineral water is used depending on
        the initial pH of the water). The container is sealed and the
        contents are mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate hydroxide
        pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2.</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. The container is stored at a temperature of
        0 to 10° C. and the contents mixed regularly. Sufficient time is
        allowed for a clear solution of magnesium bicarbonate to develop
        at a range of pH 8.0 to pH 8.5, typically pH 8.3. This takes
        approximately 24 to 72 hours. Alternatively the carbonic acid or
        carbonated water or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide
        gas is added to the magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate
        powder in water. </p>
      <p>Alternatively one liter of water is placed in a container and
        sufficient carbonic acid or carbonated water or hydrated carbon
        dioxide gas is added to produce a pH value less than pH 5.2. (In
        practice, approximately 30 mL to 40 mL of chilled water is used
        depending on the initial pH of the water). The container is
        sealed and the contents are mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2.</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. The container is stored at a temperature of
        0 to 10° C. and the contents mixed regularly. The pH of the
        water is then adjusted with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide
        or potassium hydroxide to a pH of 8 to 8.5, typically pH 8.3.
        Alternatively the carbonic acid or carbonated water or hydrated
        carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas is added to the magnesium
        carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate powder in water. </p>
      <p>Generally once the solution is prepared, the solution may be
        stored in a closed container under a blanket of carbon dioxide
        gas or a mixture of carbon dioxide gas and usually a
        nondeleterious inert gas, for example, argon, helium and/or
        nitrogen to maintain the solution at a pH of 7 to 9 and at a
        temperature of 0 to 25° C. and at 0.8 to 5 atm. The carbon
        dioxide gas blanket prevents loss of carbon dioxide from the
        solution. The amount of carbon dioxide in the gaseous mixture
        provides partial pressure on the liquid which is substantially
        equal to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from carbon
        dioxide from the solution which is produced from equilibrium of
        bicarbonate in the solution at the particular temperature. In
        this way the solution is stabilised. If the solution were left
        in an open container for any substantial length of time
        precipitation of metal carbonate from the solution would occur
        as a result of decomposition of the bicarbonate in the solution
        as carbon dioxide is liberated from the solution. By using a
        stabilising agent in and/or above the solution such
        decomposition is substantially minimised or prevented.
        Alternatively the solution may be stored in a closed or sealed
        container (generally airtight) which is substantially filled
        with the solution whereby there is substantially no gas in the
        container or little gas compared to the amount of liquid in the
        container. </p>
      <p>The relevant chemical reactions may be represented by the
        following equations: </p>
      <p><img src="1eq3.gif" width="364" height="281"></p>
      <p>Usually one liter of the magnesium bicarbonate solution
        prepared above contains approximately 120 mg of magnesium per
        liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and approximately 600 mg of bicarbonate. 500 mg sodium
        bicarbonate (or potassium bicarbonate) is added to the magnesium
        bicarbonate solution and mixed. The mixture is stored in a
        sealed container in a refrigerator. The mixture contains
        approximately 120 mg magnesium per liter of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, 135 mg sodium per
        liter of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and 950 mg bicarbonate per liter of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>In the body, normal intracellular pH value is pH 7.2. Under
        acidic conditions, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
        hydrolysis, intracellular pH value may decrease to pH 6.5. In
        practice, a pH value is chosen for bicarbonate solutions that
        exceeds normal blood plasma pH value (pH&gt;7.38). </p>
      <p>A low temperature, between 0 and 10° C., typically 5 to 10° C.,
        ensures that carbon dioxide stays dissolved in solution to
        maximise carbon dioxide hydration. Above 15 to 20° C., the
        solubility of carbon dioxide is low, the carbon dioxide leaves
        the solution, and particles and sediments may occur in the
        solution. Above 15 to 20° C., the solution may be cloudy in
        appearance. </p>
      <p>At high magnesium concentrations, a minimum time, at least 24
        to 72 hours at 5° C., is required for completion of the kinetic
        processes that produce a clear solution of magnesium
        bicarbonate. (The kinetic processes include the hydration of
        carbon dioxide, the dissolution of magnesium carbonate and the
        dissolution of magnesium hydroxide.) </p>
      <p>The concentration of magnesium cations (in association with
        bicarbonate anions) is generally in the range 25 mg to 250 mg
        per liter aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution (depending on the pH value of the metal bicarbonate
        solution). Usually the maximum magnesium concentration that can
        be maintained in solution as magnesium bicarbonate may be
        approximately 120 mg per liter aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution at pH 8.3. As the pH value
        decreases, the concentration of magnesium that can be maintained
        in solution increases. Because magnesium chloride is soluble,
        higher concentrations of magnesium can be maintained in solution
        if chlorides (such as sodium chloride) are added to the aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>The solubility product constant for magnesium carbonate is
        reported to be approximately 3.5.times.10.sup.-8. The solubility
        product constant for magnesium hydroxide is reported to be
        approximately 1.1 x 10<sup>-11</sup>. Calculated from these
        values, the maximum concentrations of magnesium cations that can
        exist in solution as carbonates or hydroxides are approximately
        20 mg per liter aqueous metal bicarbonate solution and 10 mg per
        liter aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution respectively. </p>
      <p>Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution of the invention is administered or
        consumed orally. Typically the solution is an orally drinkable
        solution. Typically the solution is a therapeutic orally
        drinkable solution. For example, the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be prepared as a
        solution or an iced confectionary, such as an ice block or iced
        dessert, which is ingested orally. Alternatively the aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be
        prepared in the form of a tablet, lozenge or lolly which is
        ingested orally. For example, the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be administered for
        metabolic acidosis or renal failure. Optionally the solution may
        be sterilised. Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is prepared as a solution which is
        ingested hourly, daily, monthly or yearly. The amount of aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution
        administered in a day ranges from 250 mL to 6 liters, typically
        250 mL to 5.5 liters, 250 mL to 5 liters, 250 mL to 4.5 liters,
        250 mL to 4 liters, 250 mL to 3.5 liters, 250 mL to 3 liters,
        500 mL to 6 liters, 500 mL to 5.5 liters, 500 mL to 5 liters,
        500 mL to 4.5 liters, 500 mL to 4 liters, 500 mL to 3.5 liters,
        500 mL to 3 liters, more typically 1 liter to 6 liters, 1 liter
        to 5.5 liters, 1 liter to 5 liters, 1 liter to 4.5 liters, 1
        liter to 4 liters, 1 liter to 3.5 liters, even more typically 1
        liter to 3 liters, 1.5 liters to 6 liters, 1.5 liters to 5.5
        liters, 1.5 liters to 5 liters, 1.5 liters to 4.5 liters, 1.5
        liters to 4 liters, 1.5 liters to 3.5 liters, most typically 2
        to 3 liters, usually 2.1 to 3 liters. The aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be administered
        on a full or empty stomach, typically the aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution is administered on an
        empty stomach. Usually 1.5 to 3 liters, more typically 1.5 to
        2.4 liters, even more typically 1.8 to 2.1 liters and usually
        between 1.8 and 2.7 liters of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is ingested on an empty stomach in
        approximately 300 mL volumes at set times each day. The solution
        may be administered according to these latter dosages over short
        (for example 1 to 10 days) or long (for example 6 months to 10
        years or more) periods as required. Usually the amount of
        aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution
        administered to a mammal is 5 to 100 mL per Kg, more usual 10 to
        50 mL per Kg, most usual 14 to 29 mL per Kg or 25 to 43 mL per
        Kg. </p>
      <p>Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is consumed on an empty stomach. Usually
        consumption in this manner avoids the mixing of bicarbonate
        anions with stomach acid which may result in the loss of
        bicarbonate. Usually the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is consumed in small amounts at set
        times each day to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate
        concentration of body fluids. Usually the amount of aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution consumed
        at commencement is 500 mL per day and is increased by increments
        over a period of one month to the maximum consumption. This
        start-up schedule generally avoids any gastrointestinal side
        effects due to the smooth muscle relaxation properties of
        magnesium. </p>
      <p>The advantages of the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution of the invention are that the magnesium
        cations function as bicarbonate transporters into body cells.
        Magnesium bicarbonate enters body cells and the bicarbonate
        anions function to displace from equilibrium the dissociation
        reaction of intracellular carbonic acid. Magnesium bicarbonate
        enters body cells and the bicarbonate anions function as an
        intracellular proton sink (or proton scavenger). These reactions
        can be represented by the one equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq4.gif" width="296" height="36"></p>
      <p>Magnesium bicarbonate enters body cells and the bicarbonate
        anions function to displace from equilibrium the hydration
        reaction of carbon dioxide which is catalysed by the enzyme
        carbonic anhydrase. This reaction can be represented by the
        equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq5.gif" width="277" height="42"></p>
      <p>Usually appropriate salts of magnesium, sodium, potassium,
        calcium and lithium should not exceed the concentrations of the
        component elements recommended by health authorities. The
        concentrations of component elements cannot exceed
        concentrations restricted by the solubility product constants of
        respective hydroxides and carbonates. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p><i>An Experiment to Decrease Intracellular Proton
          Concentrations and to Increase Intracellular Bicarbonate
          Concentrations in Mammalian Cells in vitro</i> </p>
      <p>Aqueous bicarbonate anions act as proton sinks in the presence
        of excess proton concentrations in solution. This reaction can
        be represented by the chemical equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq6.gif" width="270" height="34"></p>
      <p>In the presence of sufficient concentrations of bicarbonate
        anions, the reaction is essentially complete and proton
        concentrations decrease. The pH value of the solution increases.
        When plasma bicarbonate anions are present outside mammalian
        body cells in sufficient concentrations, they are translocated
        into the cytoplasm of the cells across the cell plasma
        membranes. Indeed, bicarbonate anions equilibrate rapidly across
        mammalian cell membranes. Bicarbonate translocation into cells
        takes place via several processes. These processes include a
        chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and a sodium dependent
        chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and potassium co-transport
        and magnesium co-transport. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to decrease intracellular proton
        concentrations and to increase intracellular bicarbonate
        concentrations in mammalian body cells in vitro. Throughout the
        experiment, extracellular pH determinations were made using a pH
        electrode and intracellular pH determinations were made using a
        trapped fluorescein derivative. An increase in intracellular
        proton concentrations (intracellular acidification) was achieved
        by applying 10 mmol ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)
        solution to a suspension of cells and then removing the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.












        An increase in intracellular bicarbonate concentrations was
        achieved by applying an aqueous metal bicarbonate solution to a
        suspension of cells. The aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg per liter, Na<sup>+</sup>
        135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 950 mg per
        liter at pH 8.3. This aqueous metal bicarbonate solution was
        equivalent to 15 mmol bicarbonate approximately. Blood was
        collected in sodium heparin from a range of mammals and the
        leucocytes removed. The leucocytes were washed and re-suspended
        in isotonic saline. Intracellular pH determinations were made by
        loading leucocytes for 15 minutes with (10 micromol in saline)
        2,7-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Cells were
        illuminated at 440 nm and 490 nm and fluorescence was measured
        at 530 nm. </p>
      <p>The experiment utilising sheep leucocytes is given stepwise

        Intracellular pH 6.6 </p>
      <p>Result: Cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        rapidly decrease intracellular proton concentrations. Cytoplasm
        shows rapid recovery from acidification relative to non-treated
        cells. </p>

      <p>Result: Cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        have increased intracellular bicarbonate concentrations which
        are manifested by an increase in pH value of cytoplasm. </p>
      <p>The experiment was repeated with leucocytes from mice, rats,
        guinea pigs, cattle, horses, dogs, cats and humans. In all
        cases, acidified cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution had decreased intracellular proton concentrations. In
        all cases, cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        had increased intracellular bicarbonate concentrations which
        were manifested by increased pH values of cytoplasm. The
        experiment was repeated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solutions
        that contained a range of concentrations of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>2+</sup>,

      <p><i>An experiment to Demonstrate Bicarbonate Anion Translocation
          from Aqueous Metal Bicarbonate Solution into the Mammalian
          Body against a Bicarbonate Anion Concentration Gradient</i> </p>
      <p>Mammalian plasma contains bicarbonate anions at a concentration
        about 25 mmol (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 1,500 mg per liter).
        When ingested, aqueous metal bicarbonate solution produces
        biochemical, physiological and medical effects at bicarbonate
        anion concentrations about 16 mmol (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
        950 mg per liter). Aqueous metal bicarbonate solution, at
        bicarbonate anion concentration about 16 mmol, contains two
        thirds the bicarbonate anion concentration of plasma, so
        bicarbonate anions must be translocated into the mammalian body
        against a bicarbonate anion concentration gradient. </p>
      <p>Mammalian plasma contains cations at concentrations around Mg<sup>2+</sup>
        24 mg per liter, Na<sup>+</sup> 3,300 mg per liter, K<sup>+</sup>
        175 mg per liter and Ca<sup>2+</sup> 100 mg per liter. Aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution commonly contains cations at
        concentrations around Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg per liter, Na<sup>+</sup>
        135 mg per liter, K<sup>+</sup> 100 mg per liter and Ca<sup>2+</sup>
        20 mg per liter. Aqueous metal bicarbonate solution commonly
        contains 5 times the magnesium cation concentration of plasma.
        Other cations are present commonly in aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution in concentrations lower than plasma. </p>
      <p>The concentrations of cations and anions in plasma can be

      <p>It is suggested that sodium cations and chloride anions leave
        plasma along their respective concentration gradients and
        magnesium and bicarbonate ions enter plasma along a magnesium
        cation concentration gradient. Magnesium functions as a
        bicarbonate transporter. In addition, it is suggested that
        bicarbonate anions enter plasma by chloride-bicarbonate exchange
        processes along a chloride anion concentration gradient
        (chloride `our`, bicarbonate `in`). </p>
      <p>In mammals, any large increases in plasma bicarbonate
        concentrations can be decreased normally by a number of
        biochemical and physiological homeostatic control processes.
        These processes occur in time frames that range from minutes to
        hours and longer. One of the main control processes that occurs
        as a result of increased plasma bicarbonate concentration is an
        alteration in bicarbonate chemistry in the kidneys. This is
        manifested by a decrease in proton concentration in urine and by
        a pH value of urine that is less acidic. In the presence of
        increased plasma bicarbonate, kidney tubule cells decrease their
        excretion of protons. Kidney control of bicarbonate
        concentration is not instantaneous and occurs within a time
        frame of several hours to several days. Unless a mammal has
        physiological or clinical acidosis, it is difficult to detect
        small increases in plasma bicarbonate concentration. Any
        increases in plasma bicarbonate concentration are taken up by
        body cells, Indeed, plasma bicarbonate equilibrates with
        intracellular bicarbonate rapidly. In a normal mammal, a
        measurable increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration occurs
        only during an artificially induced alkalosis and is detectable
        either when the consumption of bicarbonate anions (as NaHCO<sub>3</sub>)
        greatly exceeds the concentration of bicarbonate in normal
        plasma or when bicarbonate anions (as NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) are
        administered intravenously. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to determine if bicarbonate anions
        in aqueous metal bicarbonate solutions are translocated against
        a bicarbonate concentration gradient into the body. Bicarbonate
        translocation against a concentration gradient could occur
        either via energy (ATP) dependent processes or via anion
        (chloride-bicarbonate) exchange or via co-transport with cations
        along cation concentration gradients. There are also complex
        thermodynamic processes involving intracellular and
        extracellular concentrations of bicarbonate anions, hydroxide
        anions, protons and carbon dioxide that may assist in the
        overall translocation of bicarbonate anions, These processes
        often involve the production of bicarbonate anions by carbonic
        anhydrase enzymes. In the experiment, entry of bicarbonate
        anions into the body was assessed by determinations of proton
        concentration in urine; that is, the pH value of urine. </p>
      <p>Ten people had urine pH value assessed once per week for 3
        months. Urine pH values were assessed once per week for a
        further 3 months after commencement of consumption of aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution. The aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg per
        liter, Na<sup>+</sup> 135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
        950 mg per liter. The major component of the solution was
        magnesium bicarbonate Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per
        liter approximately. Results are given below: <br>

      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution decreases
        proton excretion by the kidneys. The pH value of urine
        increases. </p>
      <p>These results demonstrate that bicarbonate anions from aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution are translocated against a
        bicarbonate anion concentration gradient into the body. This may
        occur either via co-sport with cations along a cation
        concentration gradient or via chloride-bicarbonate exchange
        processes along a chloride anion concentration gradient
        (chloride `out`, bicarbonate `in`). In the case of aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution, the only cation concentration gradient
        possible is that involving magnesium cation concentrations. </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution leads to
        an increase in bicarbonate anion concentration in the body which
        is manifested by a decrease in proton concentration in urine; an
        increase in pH value of urine. </p>

      <p><i>An Experiment to Improve the Buffering Capacities of the
          Extracellular and Intracellular Bicarbonate Buffers and to
          Decrease Senescence and to Increase Longevity in a
          Representative Mammal</i> </p>
      <p>Mammalian body cells produce continuously concentrations of
        carbon dioxide. Upon hydration, carbon dioxide increases proton
        concentrations in the cytoplasm of body cells. The pH values of
        the cytoplasm of body cells are lowered. The production of
        protons in cytoplasm by the hydration of carbon dioxide can be
        represented by the following chemical equations: </p>
      <p><img src="1eq7.gif" width="260" height="55"></p>
      <p>The protons produced in the cytoplasm of body cells by the
        hydration of carbon dioxide, and other intracellular reactions,
        are buffered normally by intracellular bicarbonate buffers. The
        bicarbonate anions in intracellular buffers derive manly from
        the extracellular bicarbonate of blood plasma. The bicarbonate
        anions in blood plasma originate from erythrocytes as products
        of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase enzyme reactions. </p>
      <p>When plasma bicarbonate anions are present outside mammalian
        body cells in sufficient concentrations, they are translocated
        into the cytoplasm of the cells across the cell plasma
        membranes. Indeed, plasma bicarbonate equilibrates with
        cytoplasmic bicarbonate rapidly. Bicarbonate translocation into
        cells takes place via several processes. These processes include
        a chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and a sodium dependent
        chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and potassium co-transport
        and magnesium co-transport. There are also complex thermodynamic
        processes involving intracellular and extracellular
        concentrations of bicarbonate anions, hydroxide ions, protons
        and carbon dioxide that may assist in the overall translocation
        of bicarbonate anions. These processes often involve the
        production of bicarbonate anions by carbonic anhydrase enzymes.
      </p>
      <p>Concentrations of bicarbonate anions that are translocated into
        mammalian body cells improve the buffering capacity of the
        cytoplasm of the cells. Concentrations of bicarbonate anions and
        concentrations of carbon dioxide form a buffer system described
        by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: </p>
      <p>pH = pK + log ([HCO<sub>3</sub>sup.- ]/[H<sub>2</sub> CO<sub>3</sub>])














      </p>
      <p>(Where pK is the pK of hydrated carbon dioxide H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
        and has an approximate numerical value of 6.35). </p>
      <p>For a classical (closed system) buffer to be effective, the
        ratio of the conjugate base to the acid (in the above case [HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
        ]/[H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ]) must be between 0.1 and 10.
        This ratio applies also to buffers in biological (open) systems.
        In mammalian body cells, the continuous and open production of
        carbon dioxide means that continuous supplies of bicarbonate
        anions are required to maintain effective and optimal buffering
        capacities. Under conditions of excess proton concentrations,
        from carbon dioxide production and ATP hydrolysis and other
        metabolic processes, the supply of bicarbonate fails and the
        effective and optimal buffering capacities of mammalian body
        cells falter. </p>
      <p>The vitality of mammalian body cells is linked critically to
        the buffering capacities of the extracellular fluids and the
        cytoplasm of the cells. Processes of cellular degeneration occur
        when buffering capacities falter in the presence of excess
        proton concentrations. Cellular degenerations are manifested in
        the mammalian body by degenerative diseases and senescence.
        Examples of degenerative diseases in mammals that are linked
        casually to extracellular and intracellular proton
        concentrations include osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, the
        diseases associated with chronic inflammation, the diseases
        associated with lysosomal enzyme activities, the diseases
        associated with oxidations of cell nucleic acids, cell protein
        amino acids and cell membrane lipids, and the diseases
        associated with aberrations of mitochondrial respiration. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to improve the buffering capacities
        of the extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate buffers and
        to consequently decrease senescence and increase longevity in a
        representative mammal. One hundred and ten Merino ewe lambs were
        divided randomly at weaning into a control group and a treatment
        group. The groups were of equal size and were maintained under
        similar conditions except for the pH values and aqueous metal
        bicarbonate concentrations of drinking water supplies. Sheep
        were selected as the representative mammal because their life
        span and body weight are more representative of typical mammals
        tan laboratory rodents, their life span is not excessively long,
        their body size permits multiple blood and tissue sample
        collections, they are easy to handle and their husbandry is
        suited to experimental conditions. The control group was
        maintained, for the full life span of the sheep, in small
        experimental paddocks with slightly acidic (less than pH 6.5)
        drinking water supplies that contained bicarbonate
        concentrations less than 30 mg per liter. The treatment group
        was maintained, for the full life span of the sheep, in small
        experimental paddocks with slightly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 9.0)
        drinking water supplies that contained bicarbonate
        concentrations between 300 mg per liter and 800 mg per liter.
        The drinking water supplies for the treatment group were loaded
        with the appropriate concentrations of bicarbonate anions by the
        addition of crushed and powdered magnesite MgCO<sub>3</sub> to
        the water. The magnesite frequently contained calcite CaCO<sub>3</sub>
        and dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO<sub>3</sub>. The magnesite was dissolved
        in the drinking water either with the assistance of commercial
        supplies of carbon dioxide gas or carbonic acid or with local
        supplies of hydrated carbon dioxide. This dissolution process
        can be represented by the following chemical equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq8.gif" width="302" height="77"></p>
      <p>The treatment group of sheep consumed slightly alkaline (pH 7.8
        to 9.0) drinking water that contained bicarbonate concentrations
        between 300 mg per liter and 800 mg per liter. At this pH value,
        and this bicarbonate concentration, bicarbonate was mostly in
        the form of magnesium bicarbonate Mg (HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>:

      <p>In the lates stages of pregnancy, there is a tendency for
        pregnant mammals to become hypoglycaemic and hyperketonaemic.
        Hyperketonaemia subjects the pregnant mammal to an acid load
        (increase in proton concentrations) This acid load may result in
        clinical acidosis. Like all mammals, pregnant ewes tend to be
        hypoglycaemic and hypoketonaemic late in pregnancy. In ewes
        affected clinically with acidosis, bicarbonate concentrations
        range between 14 to 20 mmol per liter plasma. </p>
      <p>Over several years, plasma bicarbonate concentrations were
        determined for the control group and the treatment group one
        week prior to lambing. Determination of plasma bicarbonate
        concentrations prior to lambing is a direct measure of
        extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate buffering capacity.
        In ewes with effective extracellular and intracellular
        bicarbonate buffers, bicarbonate concentrations are maintained
        in a range between 24 to 27 mmol per liter plasma. Plasma

      <p>The treatment group had larger plasma bicarbonate
        concentrations than the control group. The consumption of

        bicarbonate solution, improves the buffering capacities of
        extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate buffers in mammals.

      <p>In mammalians demography, there are two measurements utilised
        commonly in the experimental study of degenerative diseases and
        senescence. The first measurement is called fifty percent
        survival. Fifty percent survival describes the chronological age
        at which half an original population has died. The second
        measurement is called maximum life span. Maximum life span
        describes the age of the longest lived survivors of a
        population. The fifty percent survival measurement is considered
        to reflect susceptibility to accidents and infectious and
        degenerative diseases in mammals. The maximum life span
        measurement is considered to reflect the innate processes of
        senescence in mammals. The fifty percent survival measurement
        and the maximum life span measurement for the control group and
        the treatment group are given below: <br>

        The treatment group had a larger fifty percent survival
        measurement and a larger maximum life span measurement than the
        control group. </p>
      <p>The death of each member of a population of mammals can be
        plotted graphicaly. The continuous function representing
        mortality in a population is known as a survival curve. Survival
        curves for the control group and treatment group are represented
        in FIG. 1. The survival curves show that more mature sheep were
        alive in the treatment group than the control group at any time.
        This occurred with the consumption of normal physiological
        volumes of water (as aqueous metal bicarbonate solution). </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution, extends
        the maximum life span of mammals by at least twenty percent and
        increases the number of mature mammals alive at any time. </p>
      <p>Senescence in mammals is characterised by progressive
        oxidations of the structural and function molecules that
        constitute body cells and tissues. These oxidations occur
        particularly in nucleic acids, protein amino acids and cell
        membrane lipids. </p>
      <p>Because protons often participate in biological redox
        reactions, oxidations of many structural and functional
        molecules in body cells and tissues are increased in rate by the
        presence of excess proton concentrations. Oxidations of
        structural and functional molecules are increased in rate by
        acidic conditions. </p>
      <p>In general, oxidations of molecules are linked to proton
        concentrations described by a formulation of the Gibbs energy
        equation </p>
      <p>E<sub>pH</sub> = E<sub>m</sub> + 2.3 RT/F
        log([oxidised]/[reduced]) </p>
      <p>where E<sub>pH</sub> is a measure of oxidising power at a
        particular pH value and E.sub.m is the mid-point potential. In
        practice, E<sub>pH</sub> is decreased by between -30 mV and -60
        mV for each decrease in proton concentration by a factor of 10.
        That is, oxidising power is decreased by between -30 mV and -60
        mV for each increase in pH value by 1 pH unit. </p>
      <p>Oxidations of nucleic acids and protein amino acids lead to
        nucleic acid and protein degradation respectively. These
        degradations lead to senescence in mammals. Nucleic acid
        degradation is manifested by either cell death or cell
        transformation to the cancerous state. Protein degradation is
        manifested by increased urea concentrations in the body which
        can be detected in the plasma. </p>
      <p>Determination of plasma urea concentrations in elderly mammals
        is a direct measure of amino acid oxidation, protein degradation
        and overall nitrogen (anabolic/catabolic) balance. Determination
        of plasma urea concentrations in elderly mammals is a direct
        measure of cellular degenerations and senescence. </p>
      <p>Over several years, plasma urea concentrations were determined

      <p><i>An Experiment to Distinguish Between the Consumption of
          Magnesium Bicarbonate and the Consumption of Magnesium Cations
          per se in Increasing Longevity in a Mammal</i> </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to assess if the consumption of
        magnesium bicarbonate increased longevity in a mammal compared
        to the consumption of magnesium cations per se. A short-lived
        mammalian species was chosen. Short-lived mammals possess high
        levels of proton leak across inner mitochondrial membranes, high
        levels of carbonic anhydrase enzyme activities (for acid
        production) and high levels of spontaneous cancer development
        and spontaneous death. Any increase in longevity in a
        short-lived species is indicative of an improvement in
        fundamental cell biochemistry. Two hundred outbred (Swiss)
        female mice were divided randomly at weaning into two groups of
        100 mice and were maintained under identical management and
        environmental conditions. </p>
      <p>One group of mice was supplied with drinking water that
        consisted of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution with a pH value
        between pH 8.1 and pH 8.5. The aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg per
        liter, Na<sup>+</sup> 135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
        950 mg per liter. The major component of the solution was
        magnesium bicarbonate Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per
        liter approximately. The second group of mice was supplied with
        drinking water that contained magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) 1
        gram per liter with a pH value between pH 6.5 and pH 7.0. This
        drinking water contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg
        per liter. Bicarbonate anions were absent. </p>
      <p>Both groups of mice were fed commercial laboratory food that
        contained 1 gram of magnesium per kilogram of food. Both groups
        of mice were fed on alternate days with no food available on the
        other days. Group-specific drinking water (as described above)
        was available at all times. Feeding on alternate days decreased
        the possible loss of bicarbonate anions by stomach acid and food

      <p>EXAMPLE 5 </p>
      <p><i>An Experiment to Decrease the Clinical Signs of
          Osteoarthritis</i> </p>
      <p>Osteoarthritis is a disease of degeneration. There is
        degradation and inflammation of the joints of the body.
        Osteoarthritis is defamed as a disease process involving a
        disturbance of the normal balance of degradation and repair in
        the articular cartilage and subchondral bone of joints. This
        disturbance of balance causes areas of morphological damage and
        results in clinical problems such as pain and disability.
        Osteoarthritis is manifested as a slowly progressive
        degeneration of the joints of the hands and large weight-bearing
        joints (hips and knees). It is common in post menopausal women.
        Osteoarthritis is characterised by pain, enlargement of joints
        and limitation of joint movements. The linings of osteoarthritic
        joints show a moderate to marked degree of inflammation. The
        principle pathological changes associated with osteoarthritis
        are destruction of joint cartilage and neoformations of bone at
        joint margins (osteophytes). In osteoarthritis, destruction of
        joint cartilage is caused by acid protease enzymes (and other
        enzymes) derived often from the lysosomes of cartilage cells
        (chondrocytes), inflammatory cells and other cells. </p>
      <p>Acid protease enzymes possess optimal activity in an acidic
        environment; that is, an environment with high proton
        concentrations Proton concentrations involved in the
        pathogenesis of osteoarthritis derive from the hydration of
        carbon dioxide catalysed by intracellular carbonic anhydrase
        enzymes. The production of protons by carbonic anhydrase enzymes
        can be represented by the equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq11.gif" width="239" height="41"></p>
      <p>Protons formed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes are concentrated
        by intracellular V-type proton pumps and stored in the endosomes
        and lysosomes of body cells. </p>
      <p>Functional endosomes and lysosomes maintain internal
        concentrations of protons which give them internal pH values
        between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0. Many degenerative diseases, including
        osteoarthritis, involve intracellular and extracellular release
        of lysosomal enzymes. In osteoarthritis, chemical fluxes through
        the reactions catalysed by lysosomal enzymes result in the
        breakdown of cartilage and bone. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to assess if the clinical signs of
        osteoarthritis could be decreased by the consumption of aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution. The clinical signs of osteoarthritis
        include pain, swelling, inflammation, skin discoloration, joint
        deformities and decrease in joint function. An increase in
        extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate anion concentrations
        would decrease the production of protons from reactions
        catalysed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes, decrease the pumping of
        protons by V-type proton pumps, decrease the activities of acid
        protease enzymes and decrease other activities of lysosomes. The
        clinical signs of osteoarthritis would be alleviated. A group of
        ten people were chosen who had been diagnosed with having
        osteoarthritis. Each person in the group had been suffering from
        (clinical) osteoarthritis for between 2 and 5 years. Five of the
        group were post menopausal women who had clinical signs of
        osteoarthritis in the joints of their hands. The osteoarthritic
        joints included the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints
        of the fingers and the carpometacarpal joint of the thumbs. In
        all 5 cases, loss of joint function was moderate to severe. </p>
      <p>In all 5 cases, the women suffered pain, swelling of the
        fingers and loss of joint movement. Mucous cysts were associated
        with distal joint osteoarthritis. Lateral deformities occurred
        in some proximal joints with severe loss of joint function.
        Women with affected thumbs had considerable loss of function and
        considerable pain. Many hands were "claw-like" in appearance
        (FIG. 2). The remainder of the group had osteoarthritis in the
        hips and knees. These people suffered pain and moderate loss of
        joint functions. </p>
      <p>The people consumed aqueous metal bicarbonate solution with a
        pH value between pH 8.1 and 8.5. The aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution contained approximately Mg<sup>2+ </sup>120 mg per
        liter, Na<sup>-</sup> 135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
        950 mg per liter. The major component of the solution was
        magnesium bicarbonate Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per
        liter approximately </p>
      <p>Consumption of the aqueous metal bicarbonate solution was
        commenced at half a liter per day and increased by increments
        over a period of one month to between 2 to 3 liters per day.
        Consumption occurred on an empty stomach to avoid the loss of
        bicarbonate by stomach acid (HCI). Consumption occurred in small
        amounts (300 ml) at set times each day to avoid rapid increases
        in bicarbonate concentrations of body fluids and to avoid over
        hydration. </p>
      <p>The results of the experiment were unequivocal. Within 3 to 6
        months, all participants in the experiment demonstrated
        substantial decreases in the clinical signs of osteoarthritis. </p>
      <p>In all cases, there were remissions in the clinical signs of
        osteoarthritis which were quantifiable by standard tests of
        movement, flexibility and strength. The participants showed
        considerable increases in joint functions and decreases in acute
        and chronic joint swellings. The "stabbing" pain of
        osteoarthritis was alleviated. Some participants had remissions
        of inflammation and arthritis to the stage where many chronic
        swellings were no longer observable and joint mobilities and
        functions were restored (FIG. 3). </p>
      <p>People in the experiment consumed aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution continuously for at least 2 years. During this period,
        there was evidence of progressive improvement in healing
        processes. Mucous cysts associated with distal joint
        osteoarthritis were no longer visible. </p>
      <p>Remissions in the clinical signs of osteoarthritis were
        maintained only with the continual consumption of aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution. Once the consumption of aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution was halted, clinical signs of pain and
        swelling began to reappear within 10 days. Clinical signs again
        went into remission upon continuation of consumption of aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution,
        principally magnesium bicarbonate solution, results in
        remissions in the clinical signs of osteoarthritis. </p>

      <p><i>An Experiment to Maintain and Improve Motor Activity in
          Mammals. An Experiment to Decrease Fatigue and Lethargy and
          Improve Motor Activity. An Experiment to Decrease the Fatigue
          and Lethargy of Chronic Disease and Improve Motor Activity</i>
      </p>
      <p>Mammals convert food energy into chemical energy that can be
        used by body cells to maintain essential cell processes and cell
        functions. The main chemical energy in mammalian body cells is
        the chemical ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP is synthesised
        mainly in the mitochondria of body cells. Mitochondrial ATP
        production is linked intimately to the respiration rates of
        mitochondria. The respiration rates of mitochondria are
        dependent on many factors including the proton concentrations
        (pH values) of the cytoplasm of body cells. If the intracellular
        bicarbonate buffer of mammalian body cells is not maintained.
        and is not functional, proton concentrations increase in the
        cytoplasm and the pH value of the cytoplasm decreases. When
        proton concentrations increase in the cytoplasm sufficiently (pH
        value decreases sufficiently) the respiration rates of
        mitochondria are diminished. When the respiration rates of
        mitochondria are diminished, the production of ATP is
        diminished. When the production of ATP is diminished, ATP
        concentrations in the cell decrease and the main chemical energy
        source for mammalian body cells becomes depleted. Under these
        conditions, body cells cannot maintain essential cell processes
        and cell functions. The body becomes fatigued and lethargic. </p>
      <p>In addition to the hydration of carbon dioxide per se, one of
        the sources of increased proton concentrations in the cytoplasm
        of body cells is the hydrolysis of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP
        can be represented by the chemical equation </p>
      <p>ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O &lt;====&gt; ADP + P<sub>i</sub> + H<sup>+</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Increased proton concentrations from the hydrolysis of ATP
        occur particularly in the cytoplasm of muscle cells during
        muscular (motor) activity. This is referred to often as an
        increase in `lactic acid` (the lactic acid is, in fact, lactate
        derived from glycolysis and the `acid` is the protons derived
        from ATP hydrolysis). </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to assess if motor activity could
        be maintained and improved in mammals by improving the buffering
        capacity of the extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate
        buffers. </p>
      <p>Two hundred inbred (Balb c) female mice were divided randomly
        at weaning into two groups of 100 mice and maintained under
        identical conditions for 3 years. Control groups of mice were
        given drinking water that was deionised and slightly acidic (pH
        5.0). Treatment groups of mice were given drinking water that
        consisted of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution with a pH value
        between pH 8.1 and 8.5. The aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg per liter, Na<sup>-</sup>
        135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 950 mg per
        liter. The major component of the solution was magnesium
        bicarbonate Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>. 720 mg per liter
        approximately. </p>
      <p>Motor activity in mice was assessed at regular intervals for a

      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution,
        principally magnesium bicarbonate solution, maintains and
        improves motor activity in mammals. </p>
      <p>Mitochondria are described as `efficient` if they maintain
        sufficient production of ATP for maintenance of essential cell
        processes and cell functions. Efficient mitochondria are the
        mitochondria of young mammals. </p>
      <p>In mammals, there are declines in the efficiencies of
        mitochondria which are correlated to chronological age. The
        capacities of cells to maintain their particular energy
        requirements are diminished progressively with chronological
        age. Cells that are unable to meet their particular energy
        requirements undergo senescence, become non-functional and
        decline progressively towards cell death. This is manifested by
        body senescence and ageing. </p>
      <p>Mitochondria are described as `inefficient` if they cannot
        maintain the necessary production of ATP for maintenance of
        essential cell processes and cell functions. Mitochondrial
        inefficiency arises from oxidative damage to mitochondrial
        nucleic acids, mitochondrial enzymes and mitochondrial membrane
        proteins and lipids, Inefficient mitochondria gradually and
        progressively dominate in body cells through middle age to old
        age. Middle aged and elderly mammals are fatigued and lethargic
        relative to the young. Normal body cells attempt to produce
        buffers that maintain a cytoplasmic pH value of about pH 7.2. In
        vitro, if mitochondria are placed for a period in a medium
        either with an improved buffer at pH 7.2 or with a pH value
        buffered slightly higher than pH 7.2, there occurs an increase
        in mitochondrial respiration rate and an increase in the
        production of ATP. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to assess if fatigue and lethargy
        could be decreased and motor activity improved by improving the
        buffering capacity of the cytoplasmic bicarbonate buffer in a
        group of middle aged and elderly people. </p>
      <p>Improving the buffering capacity of the cytoplasmic bicarbonate
        buffer would increase mitochondrial respiration rate and
        increase the production of ATP. Mitochondria would become more
        `efficient`. More chemical energy would be available for
        maintenance of essential cell processes and cell functions.
        Fatigue and lethargy would decrease and motor activity would
        improve. </p>
      <p>A group of nineteen people were chosen, with a mean age of 61
        years, who had a history of fatigue and lethargy. In the context
        of this experiment, fatigue and lethargy were determined as
        subjective feelings of general exhaustion which were manifested
        by mild to moderate lack of function. The people consumed
        aqueous metal bicarbonate solution with a pH value between pH
        8.1 and 8.5. The aqueous metal bicarbonate solution contained
        approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120 mg per liter, Na<sup>+</sup>
        135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 950 mg per
        liter. The major component of the solution was magnesium
        bicarbonate Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per liter
        approximately. </p>
      <p>Consumption of the aqueous metal bicarbonate solution was
        commenced at half a liter per day and increased by increments
        over a period of one month to between 2 to 3 liters per day.
        Consumption occurred on an empty stomach to avoid the loss of
        bicarbonate by stomach acid (HCl). Consumption occurred in small
        amounts (300 ml) at set times each day to avoid rapid increases
        in bicarbonate concentrations of body fluids and to avoid over
        hydration. </p>
      <p>The results of the experiment were unequivocal. Within 3
        months, all participants in the experiment demonstrated
        substantial decreases in fatigue and lethargy. All participants
        described a feeling of well-being (mild euphoria). All
        participants demonstrated an increased capacity for mild
        physical activity; an improvement in motor activity. Function
        was restored. </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution,
        principally magnesium bicarbonate solution, decreases fatigue
        and lethargy and improves motor activity in middle aged and
        elderly people. </p>
      <p>Chronic disease (including degenerative disease) is manifested
        often by chronic fatigue and lethargy and chronic pain. This is
        true particularly for chronic inflammatory diseases and
        autoimmune diseases. </p>
      <p>The fatigue, lethargy and pain of chronic disease are
        correlated often to the high proton concentrations involved in
        the pathogenesis of chronic disease. In addition to the
        hydration of carbon dioxide per se, proton concentrations
        involved in the pathogenesis of chronic disease derive from the
        hydration of carbon dioxide catalysed by intracellular carbonic
        anhydrase enzymes. The production of protons by carbonic
        anhydrase enzymes can be represented by the equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq12.gif" width="222" height="43"></p>
      <p>Protons formed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes are concentrated
        often by V-type proton pumps and stored in endosomes and
        lysosomes in the cell. The breakdown of endosomes and lysosomes
        creates concentrations of protons in the cell cytoplasm. This
        lowers the pH value of the cytoplasm and decreases the
        production of ATP in mitochondria. Cells become energy
        deficient. Cells are unable to maintain essential cell processes
        and cell functions. the body becomes fatigued and lethargic. </p>
      <p>Functional endosomes and lysosomes maintain internal
        concentrations of protons which give them internal pH values
        between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0. Many of the chronic and degenerative
        diseases of the body involve intracellular lysosomal activities
        and intracellular and extracellular release of lysosomal
        enzymes. Chemical fluxes through the reactions catalysed by
        lysosomal enzymes result in the breakdown of cells and tissues.
        Many lysosomal enzymes require low pH values for optimal
        activity. Some of these enzymes are known as acid protease
        enzymes. </p>
      <p>Lysosomes located in cells known as macrophages, and in some
        other cells, are involved in antigen processing and antigen
        presentation. Antigen processing and presentation leads to cell
        to cell interactions within the immune system which triggers
        release of a set of chemicals called cytokines. Cytokine
        concentrations in the body are correlated often to many of the
        clinical signs of inflammation and disease. These clinical signs
        include heat, swelling, pain, fatigue and lethargy. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to assess if fatigue and lethargy
        could be decreased and motor activity improved by improving the
        buffering capacity of the cytoplasmic bicarbonate buffer in a
        group of people diagnosed and suffering with chronic disease.
        Improving the buffering capacity of the cytoplasmic bicarbonic
        buffer would decrease the hydration of carbon dioxide per se,
        would decrease the production of protons from reactions
        catalysed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes, decrease the pumping of
        protons by V-type proton pumps, decrease the activities of acid
        protease enzymes, decrease the activities of lysosomes, decrease
        antigen processing and presentation, and increase the production
        of ATP. Fatigue and lethargy would decrease and motor activity
        would improve. Some of the clinical signs of chronic disease
        would be alleviated. </p>
      <p>A group of twenty three people were chosen who had been
        diagnosed with having chronic disease. Each person had been
        suffering from chronic disease for between 3 and 8 years. </p>
      <p>The diseases consisted of chronic viral diseases, chronic
        inflammatory diseases and autoimmune diseases and included
        rheumatoid arthritis and dermatitis. All people had a history of
        fatigue and lethargy. In the context of this experiment, fatigue
        and lethargy were determined as subjective feelings of general
        exhaustion which were manifested by moderate to severe lack of
        function. The people consumed aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        with a pH value between pH 8.1 and 8.5. The aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120
        mg per liter, Na<sup>-</sup> 135 mg per liter, K<sup>+</sup> 100
        mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> 1,100 mg per liter.
        The major component of the solution was magnesium bicarbonate
        Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per liter approximately.
        Potassium bicarbonate 250 mg per liter was a component of the
        aqueous metal bicarbonate solution to improve the co-transport
        of bicarbonate anions into body cells. Consumption of the
        aqueous metal bicarbonate solution was commenced at half a liter
        per day and increased by increments over a period of one month
        to between 2 to 3 liters per day. Consumption occurred on an
        empty stomach to avoid the loss of bicarbonate by stomach acid
        (HCl). Consumption occurred in small amounts (300 ml) at set
        times each day to avoid rapid increases in bicarbonate
        concentrations of body fluids and to avoid over hydration. The
        results of the experiment were delayed but unequivocal. Within 3
        to 9 months, all participants in the experiment demonstrated
        substantial decreases in fatigue and lethargy. All participants
        demonstrated an increased capacity for mild physical activity;
        an improvement in motor activity. Function was improved. Those
        participants with chronic rheumatoid disease (rheumatoid
        arthritis) demonstrated some decreases in inflammation and some
        decreases in pain. Those participants with chronic skin disease
        (dermatitis) demonstrated decreases in inflammation. Those
        participants with tissue calcification demonstrated decreases in
        calcium deposits. </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution,
        principally magnesium bicarbonate solution, decreases fatigue
        and lethargy and improves motor activity in people suffering
        with chronic disease. </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution,
        principally magnesium bicarbonate solution, decreases clinical
        signs of inflamation and pain and calcification in people

      <p><i>An Experiment to Prevent and to Treat the Clinical Signs of
          Diseases Caused by Viruses that Require Proton Concentrations
          for Infectivity</i> </p>
      <p>Many viruses become infective by utilising high intracellular
        proton concentrations in host cells. Proton concentrations
        involved in the infectivity of viruses, and the pathogenesis of
        viral diseases, derive from the hydration of carbon dioxide
        catalysed by intracellular carbonic anhydrase enzymes. The
        production of protons by carbonic anhydrase enzymes can be
        represented by the equation </p>
      <p><img src="1eq13.gif" width="241" height="45"></p>
      <p>Protons formed by carbonic anhydrase enzymes are concentrated
        by intracellular V-type proton pumps and stored in the endosomes
        and lysosomes of body cells. Functional endosomes and lysosomes
        maintain internal concentrations of protons which give them
        internal pH values between pH 3.0 and pH 6.0. </p>
      <p>Virus infectivity often requires the activities of acid
        protease enzymes. Acid protease enzymes are enzymes that
        function optimally at acidic pH levels. Acid protease enzymes
        are located in endosomes and lysosomes of body cells. </p>
      <p>Influenza viruses require acid protease enzyme activities for
        their replication and infectivity. The acid proteases of
        lysosomes and endosomes in body cells act to liberate the
        nucleic acid (RNA) of the influenza virus from the outer viral
        membrane. </p>
      <p>Many viruses contain their own acid-dependent enzymes which
        utilise proton concentrations in host cells. For example, the
        acid proteases of lentiviruses are required for virus protein
        assembly and viral infectivity. </p>
      <p>An experiment was instigated with the aim of preventing and
        treating the clinical signs of diseases caused by viruses that
        require proton concentrations for infectivity. Natural
        infections with influenza viruses and flu-like respiratory
        viruses were taken as the model infections. Influenza is an
        acute febrile infectious respiratory disease manifested by
        inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. It is complicated often by
        bacterial pneumonia. Clinical signs of influenza include
        initially fever, malaise, headache and muscle pain followed by
        coughing, sneezing and respiratory tract effusions. Flu-like
        respiratory viruses cause respiratory diseases manifested
        generally by clinical signs of less intensity than influenza. </p>
      <p>Twenty people were chosen and divided into two equal groups.
        The control group did not consume aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution. The treatment group consumed aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution with a pH value between 8.1 and 8.5. The aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution contained approximately Mg<sup>2+</sup> 120
        mg per liter, Na<sup>+</sup> 135 mg per liter and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>
        950 mg per liter. The major component of the solution was
        magnesium bicarbonate Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per
        liter approximately. Consumption of the aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution was commenced at half a liter per day and
        increased by increments over a period of one month to between 2
        to 3 liters per day. Consumption occurred on an empty stomach to
        avoid the loss of bicarbonate by stomach acid (HCl). Consumption
        occurred in small amounts (300 ml) at set times each day to
        avoid rapid increases in bicarbonate concentrations of body
        fluids and to avoid over hydration. </p>
      <p>Aqueous metal bicarbonate solution was consumed by people in
        the treatment group for 2 years. </p>
      <p>People in both groups worked either in child care centres or in
        homes for the elderly and were exposed to influenza and other
        respiratory infections over a 2 year period. Clinical signs of
        influenza and flu-like virus infections were observed and

      <p>Aqueous metal bicarbonate solution is administered typically in
        300 ml doses approximately 6 to 10 times per day at equal time
        intervals throughout the day. </p>
      <p>Typically, the solution is allowed to stand prior to
        consumption until the solution reaches 15° C. to 20° C. (cool
        room temperature). </p>
      <p>A suitable formulation for the aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution contains Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per
        liter at pH 8.3. The formulation usually contains also NaHCO<sub>3</sub>
        485 mg per liter. The aqueous metal bicarbonate solution may
        contain a range of cations and anions within a pH range pH 7.5
        to 8.8. The aqueous metal bicarbonate solution is administered
        in volumes ranging from 1 to 3 liters per day. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 9 </p>
      <p>Osteoarthritis is a slowly progressive degeneration of the
        joints of the hands and large weight-bearing joints (hips and
        knees). Osteoarthritis is common in post menopausal women.
        Osteoarthritis is characterised by pain, enlargement of joints
        and limitation of joint movements. The linings of osteoarthritic
        joints show a moderate to marked degree of inflammation. The
        principle pathological changes associated with osteoarthritis
        are destruction of joint cartilage and neoformations of bone at
        joint margins (osteophytes). In osteoarthritis, destruction of
        joint cartilage is caused by acid protease enzymes (and other
        enzymes) derived often from the lysosomes of cartilage cells
        (chondrocytes), inflammatory cells and other cells. </p>
      <p>For an experimental trial, a group of post menopausal women
        were chosen who had clinical signs of osteoarthritis in the
        joints of their hands. The osteoarthritic joints included the
        distal and proximal interphalangeal joints of the fingers and
        the carpometacarpal joint of the thumbs. In all cases, loss of
        joint function was moderate to severe. </p>
      <p>In all cases, the women suffered pain, swelling of the fingers
        and loss of joint movement. Mucous cysts were associated with
        distal joint osteoarthritis. Lateral deformities occurred in
        some proximal joints with severe loss of joint function. Women
        with affected thumbs had considerable loss of function and
        considerable pain. Many hands were "claw-like" in appearance.
        Women consumed magnesium bicarbonate solution, with added sodium
        bicarbonate. The women consumed between 2 to 3 liters of
        bicarbonate solution per day. In this solution, the magnesium
        concentration was approximately 120 mg per liter, sodium
        concentration was approximately 135 mg per liter and bicarbonate
        concentration was approximately 950 mg per liter. Consumption
        was commenced at half a liter per day and increased by
        increments over a period of one month to 2 to 3 liters per day.
        Consumption occurred on an empty stomach to avoid the loss of
        bicarbonate by stomach acid. Consumption occurred in small
        amounts (300 mL) at set times each day to avoid rapid increases
        in bicarbonate concentrations of body fluids. </p>
      <p>In all cases, there were remissions in the clinical signs of
        osteoarthritis which were quantifiable by standard tests of
        movement, flexibility and strength. The participants showed
        considerable increases in joint functions and decreases in acute
        and chronic joint swellings. The "stabbing" pain of
        osteoarthritis was alleviated. Some participants had remissions
        of inflammation and arthritis to the stage where many chronic
        swellings were no longer observable and joint nobilities and
        functions were restored. However, these improvements were
        maintained only with the continued consumption of bicarbonate
        anions. Once the consumption of bicarbonate anions ceased,
        clinical signs of inflammation began to reappear often within a
        week. </p>
      <p>The participants commented on an absence of lethargy and the
        presence of a feeling of well-being. Magnesium bicarbonate
        alleviated the pain and swelling associated with osteoarthritis.
      </p>
      <p>None of the participants demonstrated any clinical signs of
        influenza or other respiratory. viral infections over the two
        year period of the trial. This occurred despite several of the
        participants working in situations where exposure to viral
        infections was high (nursing homes and child care centres). </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 10 </p>
      <p>Influenza is an acute febrile infectious respiratory disease
        manifested by inflammation of the bronchial mucosa. Influenza is
        complicated often by bacterial pneumonia which may be fatal. </p>
      <p>For an experimental trial, a group of men and women were chosen
        who worked in situations where exposure to the influenza virus
        was likely to occur (nursing homes and child care centres). Each
        person in the experimental group consumed magnesium bicarbonate
        solution, with added sodi bicarbonate. Each person consumed
        between 2 to 3 liters of bicarbonate solution per day. In this
        solution, the magnesium concentration was approximately 120 mg
        per liter, sodium concentration was approximately 135 mg per
        liter and bicarbonate concentration was approximately 950 mg per
        liter. </p>
      <p>Consumption was commenced at half a liter per day and increased
        by increments over a period of one month to 2 to 3 liters per
        day. Consumption occurred on an empty stomach to avoid the loss
        of bicarbonate by stomach acid. Consumption occurred in small
        amounts (300 mL) at set times each day to avoid rapid increases
        in bicarbonate concentrations of body fluids. </p>
      <p>Over the two year period of the experimental trial, no person
        in the experimental group showed any clinical signs of
        influenza. </p>

      <p>EXAMPLE 12 </p>
      <p>Mitochondria are inefficient if they cannot maintain the
        necessary production of ATP for maintenance of essential cell
        processes and cell functions. This inefficiency is due often to
        functional damage to the mitochondrial inner membrane and other
        mitochondrial molecules. Inefficient mitochondria are not able
        to maintain normal carbon, electron and proton fluxes. </p>
      <p>However, in middle age, carbon and electron fluxes may be
        maintained by the synthesis of fatty acids in the cytoplasm of
        body cells. In body cells of the middle aged, fatty acids can be
        regarded as carbon and electron sinks necessary for the
        maintenance of essential fluxes; that is, for the maintenance of
        essential life processes. The synthesis of fatty acids utilises
        ATP. However, the fluxes for production of ATP in mitochondria
        are decreased in middle age. There is a consequent `energy`
        deficit. The middle aged are flat and lethargic relative to the
        young, though they can be regarded as fat by necessity; the
        necessity of staying alive. In addition to utilisation of cell
        ATP, the synthesis of fatty acids in body cells adds to the
        carbon dioxide load of the cells and adds to concentrations of
        intracellular protons. This occurs because the series of
        chemical reactions that synthesise fatty acids results in a net
        utilisation of bicarbonate anions and a net production of carbon
        dioxide and protons. For example, each molecule of the fatty
        acid palmitate that is synthesised by cells utilises seven
        molecules of ATP and seven bicarbonate anions and produces seven
        molecules of carbon dioxide and seven protons. Of course, fatty
        acids are oxidised continuously from fat stores in the body
        which produces even more carbon dioxide. When excess calories
        are consumed at any chronological age (and converted to fatty
        acids) the overall carbon dioxide load is considerable. Caloric
        restricted rodents avoid this extra carbon dioxide load and, as
        a consequence. they live longer lives with delays in the onset
        of degenerative diseases. </p>
      <p>A trial involving people consuming bicarbonate anions in water
        was conducted. These people were middle aged and overweight and
        complained of tiredness and lethargy. No control group was
        maintained for the duration of the trial (people in an initial
        control group were unable to consume the volumes of soft water
        required). People involved in the trial were given a series of
        lectures on the biochemistry of mitochondrial processes. They
        were requested to decrease their food (calorie) intake
        considerably and to avoid dietary fats. Excessive aerobic
        exercise was not recommended due to the consequent increase in
        hunger it produces, the large increase in carbon dioxide
        concentrations that occur with increased aerobic muscle activity
        and the damage excess activity does to inefficient mitochondria.
        Indeed, active muscle cells contain mitochondria with most
        nucleic acid damage relative to other body cells. </p>
      <p>The trial consisted of each person consuming between two to
        three liters per day of a mixture of magnesium bicarbonate and
        sodium bicarbonate in water. Bicarbonate concentration was
        established at a maximum of one gram per liter. (This
        concentration of bicarbonate is well within the concentrations
        in several water sources utilised for human consumption in
        Europe. In these waters however, the bicarbonate is in the form
        of calcium and sodium bicarbonate and pH values often are not
        very alkaline.) Consumption was commenced at half a liter per
        day and increased by increments over a period of one month to
        the maximum consumption. This start-up schedule avoided any
        gastrointestinal side effects due to the smooth muscle
        relaxation properties of magnesium. Capillary dilation in the
        face was apparent in several people (which was interpreted by
        those affected as rosy, healthy cheeks). The capillary dilation
        may have been due to magnesium or may have been due to a
        decrease in activity of renin which is an acid protease enzyme
        from the kidney that is central to the control of blood
        pressure. (Renin exerts its effects ultimately by constriction
        of small blood vessels.) </p>
      <p>Each participant in the trial was advised to consume the
        bicarbonate solution `on an empty stomach`. Consumption in this
        manner avoided the mixing of bicarbonate anions with stomach
        acid which would have resulted in the loss of bicarbonate.
        Advice was given also to consume the solution in small amounts
        at set times each day. Consumption in this manner avoided a
        rapid increase in the bicarbonate concentrations of body fluids.
      </p>
      <p>The results were unequivocal. Body weight was lost at about one
        half of a kilogram per week after the initial start-up period
        was completed. Other beneficial effects (more important than
        weight loss to the participants in the trial) included the
        absence of lethargy, the presence of a feeling of well-being
        (mild euphoria) and the increased capacity for mild physical
        activity. The participants all commented that their `energy
        levels` had improved and that their outlook on life had
        consequently become more positive. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 13 </p>
      <p>A heart muscle cell contains mitochondria that occupy one
        quarter of the cell volume. It is natural to expect the heart to
        be rich in mitochondria when one considers the workload of the
        heart and its subsequent requirement for `energy`. The
        consumption of magnesium bicarbonate may assist in maintaining
        efficient mitochondria in heart muscle cells. In the presence of
        bicarbonate anions, mitochondrial efficiency in heart muscle
        cells is maintained by processes which include decreases in
        proton leaks across inner mitochondrial membranes, establishment
        of proton circuits independent of proton leaks and maintenance
        of alkaline pH values in mitochondrial matrixes. In the presence
        of bicarbonate anions, mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial
        failure are decreased. Efficient mitochondria in heart muscle
        cells maintain ATP production so that the heart remains
        functional as a vital organ. </p>
      <p>There are further beneficial effects to the cardiovascular
        system resulting from the consumption of magnesium bicarbonate.
        First, decreased fatty acid synthesis in body cells results in
        lowered body weight with subsequent reduction in high blood
        pressure to a normal value. Indeed, these effects were observed
        in people participating in the trial reported in Example 5.
        Second, lysosomal enzyme damage to ischaemic heart muscle may be
        prevented or decreased. </p>
      <p>There is unequivocal evidence of correlation that heart
        disease, senescence, degenerative diseases and death are caused
        by inefficient mitochondria. Though inefficient mitochondria may
        not be the only cause of these conditions. There is sufficient
        evidence however that senescence and general degeneration in all
        species studied, from fungi to humans, are correlated to the
        damage to the complex molecules of the mitochondria. For
        example, the mitochondria of aged people carry nucleic acid and
        protein defects not observed in the mitochondria of young
        people. This is true particularly of the mitochondria in muscle,
        heart and brain cells. Accordingly, it has been proposed that
        several chronic diseases common in old age may be related to
        mitochondrial failure, including heart disease, late-onset
        diabetes and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. That is, the
        gradual loss of efficiency of cell mitochondria results in a
        diminution of the functional capacity of body cells with
        pathological consequences. </p>
      <p>A progressive decline in organ function is characteristic of
        old age. Some of the changes that occur as people grow older
        are: </p>
      <p>1. The ability to focus the eyes decreases and response time to
        stimuli becomes slower. <br>
        2. Cancers in epithelial tissues (skin, lung, colon, mammary
        gland) become more common. <br>
        3. Heart disease and widely disseminated atherosclerosis occur.
        <br>
        4 Osteoporosis and bone and joint pathology occur. <br>
        5 Thermoregulation becomes impaired. <br>
        6. There is a decline in the ability of body organs such as the
        reproductive organs, lungs, glandular tissues and kidneys to
        maintain their specialised life processes. <br>
        7. There is a reduced capacity for surviving haemorrhage. <br>
        8. There is an increase in autoimmune diseases and chronic
        inflammatory diseases, </p>
      <p>Relative to their life span of around three years, mice develop
        heart disease, kidney disease, arthritis and cancer at similar
        stages in life to humans. In other words, both senescence and
        the similar degenerative diseases of mice and humans are
        correlated to the chronological age of each species but carmot
        be linked causally to chronological age per se. It has been
        observed in many experiments that rodents fed caloric restricted
        diets suffer less from the above diseases than control animals.
        It has been observed also that careful necropsies on
        diet-restricted rodents often do not reveal any gross or
        microscopic pathology. </p>
      <p>Mitochondrial proton leak is a contributing cause of
        mitochondrial inefficiency and hence a source of senescence and
        degenerative diseases in short-lived rodents. Mitochondrial
        proton leak may be a source of senescence and degenerative
        diseases in humans. Because the proton leak in humans is only a
        fraction of the leak in rodents, humans develop senescence and
        degenerative diseases at a later chronological age than rodents.
      </p>
      <p>It may be possible to prevent inefficient processes in
        mitochondria in order to extend longevity and to delay
        degenerative diseases. Exogenous sources of appropriate
        bicarbonate anions can be absorbed by body cells to maintain
        intracellular alkaline pH values and that alkaline pH values
        maintain mitochondrial respiration rates and maintain effective
        proton concentration gradients across inner mitochondrial
        membranes. </p>
      <p>Intracellular alkaline pH values appear necessary for optimum
        activities of many enzymes in body cells. These enzymes include
        polymerases, phosphofructokinase and carbonic anhydrase. Enzymes
        permit life processes to be perpetuated. Therefore, maintenance
        of enzyme activities by maintenance of intracellular alkaline pH
        values may assist in the perpetuation of longevity. </p>
      <p>The long-term provision of appropriate bicarbonate anions to
        body cells maintains efficient mitochondrial function, maintains
        the DNA polymerase activity of mitochondria and therefore
        maintains the integrity of mitochondrial DNA. This latter effect
        results in accurate syntheses of the complex functional
        molecules that are involved in electron fluxes in mitochondria.
        Of course, bicarbonate anions will decrease the proton load per
        se in body cells with a subsequent decrease in proton damage to
        other cell molecules and a decrease in the tendency of oxidation
        reactions to occur. Decreased oxidations result in decreased DNA
        mutations and decreased amino acid oxidations. Degenerative
        diseases are delayed. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND ART </p>
      <p>Certain inflammatory diseases, degenerative diseases and viral
        diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality in mammals.
        Typically these diseases are represented by the diseases of
        arthritis and influenza. </p>
      <p>Arthritis is any inflammatory condition of the joints,
        characterised by pain and swelling. Osteoarthritis is the most
        common form of arthritis in which one or many joints undergo
        degenerative changes. Treatment includes rest of the involved
        joints, heat, and antiinflammatory drugs. Intraarticular
        injections of corticosteroids may give relief. Surgical
        treatment is sometimes necessary and may reduce pain and greatly
        improve the function of the joint. However these treatments,
        apart from surgical treatment, only provide temporary relief and
        some may have severe side reactions. </p>
      <p>Influenza is a highly contagious infection of the respiratory
        tract caused by a myxovirus and transmitted by airborne droplet
        infection. It occurs in isolated cases, epidemics and pandemics.
        Treatment is symptomatic and usually involves bed rest,
        antipyretics such as aspirin and drinking of fluids. New strains
        of the virus emerge at regular intervals so it is difficult to
        take preventative measures to avoid the infection. There is a
        need for a method to prevent and to treat certain inflammatory
        diseases, degenerative diseases and viral diseases in mammals.
        There is a need for a method to prevent and to treat arthritis
        and influenza in mammals. </p>
      <p>Senescence in mammals is characterised by progressive
        oxidations of the structural and functional molecules that
        constitute body cells and tissues. Oxidations of the structural
        and functional molecules in body cells and tissues are increased
        in rate by acidic conditions. Oxidations of structural and
        functional molecules are increased in rate by the presence of
        excess proton concentrations. There is a need for a method to
        prevent and treat excess proton concentrations in body cells so
        that oxidations of structural and functional molecules are
        decreased in rate. There is a need for a method to decrease and
        treat senescence in mammals. </p>

        to 55 mL, more typically 40 to 50 mL, most typically
        approximately 45 mL of chilled carbonated mineral water per
        litre of water is used. Usually the chilled carbonated mineral
        water is at a temperature of 0 to 25° C., 0 to 20° C. 0.5 to 25°

        to 10° C., even more typically 3° C. to 10° C., most typically
        5° C. to 10° C. and even most typically 5° C. Alternatively the
        metal carbonate or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal oxide or
        mixture thereof can be added after the carbon dioxide has been
        added. </p>
      <p>Generally the metal bicarbonate in aqueous solution may be
        derived from a metal carbonate or metal carbonate hydroxide or
        metal oxide or metal bicarbonate or metal hydroxide or other
        appropriate metal compound or any mixture thereof. Examples
        include magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium, lithium carbonate
        or carbonate hydroxide or oxide or bicarbonate or a mixture of
        any two or more thereof. For example magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate, the calcite series or dolomite series of
        minerals (Mg, Ca)CO<sub>3</sub> or limestone or dolomite rocks
        is used. Generally magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate or
        a mixture of magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate and
        sodium bicarbonate is used. </p>
      <p>Generally the pH of the aqueous metal bicarbonate solution for
        oral administration is neutral to mildly alkaline, typically in
        the range pH 7 to 9 or pH 7 to 8.6, more typically pH 7.5 to 8.8
        or pH 7.5 to 8.5 or pH 7.8 to 8.6, pH 7.8 to 8.5, pH 7.8 to 8.4,

        pH 8.0 to 8.1, pH 8.1 to 8.6, pH 8.1 to 8.5, pH 8.1 to 8.4, pH
        8.1 to 8.3, pH 8.1 to 8.2, pH 8.2 to 8.6, pH 8.2 to 8.5, pH 8.2
        to 8.4, pH 8.2 to 8.3, pH 8.3 to 8.6, pH 8.3 to 8.5, pH 8.3 to
        8.4, pH 8.4 to 8.6, pH 8.4 to 8.5, pH 8.5 to 8.6, even more
        typically pH 8 to 8.5 or pH 8.2 to 8.6, most typically pH 8.3.
        Generally the pH of the aqueous metal bicarbonate solution for
        parenteral administration is neutral to very mildly alkaline,
        typically in the range pH 7 to 7.6, or pH 7.0 to 7.5, or pH 7.1
        to 7.5, more typically pH 7.2 to 7.5 or pH 7.3 to 7.5 or pH 7.4
        to 7.5. Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is prepared and stored at a temperature
        ranging from 0 to 25° C., 0 to 20° C. 0.5 to 25° C., 0.5 to 20°
        C., 0.5 to 15° C., 0.5 to 10° C., 0.5 to 9° C., 0.5 to 8° C.,
        0.5 to 7° C., 1 to 20° C., 1 to 15° C., 1 to 10° C., 1.5 to 20°
        C., 1.5 to 15° C., 1.5 to 10° C., 2 to 20° C., 2 to 15° C., 2 to
        10° C., 3 to 20° C., 3 to 15° C., 4 to 20° C., 4 to 15° C., 4 to

        15° C., 8 to 10° C., 9 to 20° C., 9 to 15° C., 9 to 10° C., 10
        to 15° C., typically 0 to 15° C., more typically 0 to 10° C.,
        even more typically 3° C. to 10° C., most typically 5° C. to 10°
        C. and even most typically 5° C. </p>
      <p>Generally the pH adjusting agent is carbon dioxide gas,
        carbonic acid in water, hydrated carbon dioxide in water, carbon
        dioxide gas in water, carbonated soft drinks, carbonated mineral
        water, soda water or other carbon dioxide-containing-aqueous
        diluents or an alkali or any mixture thereof. Examples of
        alkalis are water soluble drinkable alkalis such as sodium
        hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or potassium
        hydroxide or any mixture thereof. </p>
      <p>Typically additives may be added during the process of the
        invention or to the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution. The additives may be 0 mg or 0.5 mg to
        1000 mg sodium bicarbonate per litre of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, typically 25 mg to
        900 mg per litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution, typically 50 mg to 800 mg or 50 mg to 500
        mg per litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution, more typically 100 mg to 700 mg per litre
        of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution, even more typically 200 mg to 600 mg per litre of
        aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution,
        most typically 300 mg to 500 mg per litre of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, even most typically
        500 mg per litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution. The additives may also be chlorides and
        other appropriate salts of magnesium, sodium, potassium, calcium
        and lithium, such as carbonates or hydroxides or sulfates, with
        or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate. For example,
        magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride or other soluble salts of
        magnesium. Further additives may include potassium bicarbonate,
        calcium bicarbonate or lithium bicarbonate. Generally calcium
        bicarbonate is prepared by adding carbonic acid or carbonated
        water or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas to a
        mixture of calcium carbonate in water. Generally lithium
        bicarbonate is prepared by adding carbonic acid and/or
        carbonated water and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon
        dioxide gas and/or solid carbon dioxide to a mixture of lithium
        carbonate in water. </p>
      <p>The aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution may further include a stabilising agent. The
        stabilising agent may also be a pH adjusting agent. Typically
        the stabilising agent is a gaseous phase, for example carbon
        dioxide gas, which maintains and/or stabilises the solution at a
        pH of 7 to 9 and at a temperature of 0 to 55° C. more typically
        0 to 25° C. </p>
      <p>Generally once the solution is prepared, the solution may be
        stored under a blanket of carbon dioxide gas or a mixture of
        carbon dioxide gas and a nondeleterious inert gas, for example,
        argon, helium, air, oxygen and/or nitrogen wherein the amount of
        carbon dioxide present in the inert gas is sufficient to
        maintain the solution at a pH of 7 to 9 and at a temperature of
        0 to 25° C. and to prevent the metal bicarbonate from forming
        insoluble compounds which can precipitate out of solution.
        Typically the carbon dioxide gas above the solution prevents
        loss of carbon dioxide from the solution. The amount of carbon
        dioxide in the gaseous mixture provides partial pressure on the
        liquid which is substantially equal to the partial pressure
        which is produced from equilibrium of bicarbonate in the
        solution at the mixing temperature. </p>
      <p>Magnesium Bicarbonate Particularly </p>
      <p>Typically the production of magnesium bicarbonate utilises the
        dissolution of magnesium carbonate by carbonic acid or hydrated
        carbon dioxide solutions. Ideally, the dissolution is produced
        within a defined range of conditions --- a defined range of pH
        values, a defined range of temperature values and a defined
        minimum time. For optimal biological and medical activities, and
        for therapeutic safety, the concentrations of the component ions
        are defined also. </p>
      <p>Typically to prepare the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution, crushed or powdered metal carbonate,
        or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal oxide, such as magnesium
        carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub>, or commercial magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,
or













        other commercial magnesium carbonate hydroxides, or hydrated
        magnesium oxides, or magnesium oxides heated with carbon
        dioxide, or the calcite series or dolomite series of minerals
        (Mg, Ca)CO<sub>3</sub>, or limestone or dolomite rocks is mixed
        with water. A cloudy suspension is obtained. Sufficient carbonic
        acid and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas
        and/or solid carbon dioxide is added to obtain a solution having
        a pH 7 to 9 or pH 7 to 8.6, more typically pH 7.5 to 8.8 or pH
        7.5 to 8.5 or pH 7.8 to 8.6, pH 7.8 to 8.5, pH 7.8 to 8.4, pH
        7.8 to 8.3, pH 7.8 to 8.2, pH 7.8 to 8.1, pH 7.8 to 8.0, pH 7.8
        to 7.9, pH 7.9 to 8.6, pH 7.9 to 8.5, pH 7.9 to 8.4, pH 7.9 to
        8.3, pH 7.9 to 8.2, pH 7.9 to 8.1, pH 7.9 to 8.0, pH 8.0 to 8.6,
        pH 8.0 to 8.5, pH 8.0 to 8.4, pH 8.0 to 8.3, pH 8.0 to 8.2, pH
        8.0 to 8.1, pH 8.1 to 8.6, pH 8.1 to 8.5, pH 8.1 to 8.4, pH 8.1
        to 8.3, pH 8.1 to 8.2, pH 8.2 to 8.6, pH 8.2 to 8.5, pH 8.2 to
        8.4, pH 8.2 to 8.3, pH 8.3 to 8.6, pH 8.3 to 8.5, pH 8.3 to 8.4,
        pH 8.4 to 8.6, pH 8.4 to 8.5, pH 8.5 to 8.6, even more typically
        pH 8 to 8.6 or pH 8.2 to 8.6, most typically pH 8.3. The
        solution is then typically placed in a closed or sealed
        container at 0 to 20° C. or 0 to 15° C. with occasional mixing
        until a clear solution develops. The amount of carbonic acid
        and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas bubbled
        through the solution and dissolved therein and/or solid carbon
        dioxide is sufficient to prevent precipitation of water
        insoluble metal compounds (such as magnesium or calcium
        carbonate). A clear solution is generally obtained in about 6
        hours to 7 days, typically 12 hours to 5 days, more typically 24
        hours to 5 days, most typically 24 hours to 3 days. Generally
        the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution is prepared and stored at a temperature ranging from 0
        to 55° C., 0 to 25° C., 0 to 20° C. 0.5 to 25° C., 0.5 to 20°
        C., 0.5 to 15° C., 0.5 to 10° C., 0.5 to 9° C., 0.5 to 8° C.,
        0.5 to 7° C., 1 to 20° C., 1 to 15° C., 1 to 10° C., 1.5 to 20°
        C., 1.5 to 15° C., 1.5 to 10° C., 2 to 20° C., 2 to 15° C., 2 to
        10° C., 3 to 20° C., 3 to 15° C., 4 to 20° C., 4 to 15° C., 4 to
        10° C., 5 to 10° C., 5 to 15° C., 6 to 20° C., 6 to 15° C., 6 to
        10° C., 7 to 20° C., 7 to 15° C., 7 to 10° C., 8 to 20° C., 8 to
        15° C., 8 to 10° C., 9 to 20° C., 9 to 15° C., 9 to 10° C., 10
        to 15° C., typically 0 to 15° C., more typically 0 to 10° C.,
        even more typically 3° C. to 10° C., most typically 5° C. to 10°
        C. and even most typically 5° C. Alternatively the crushed or
        powdered metal carbonate, or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal
        oxide or mixture thereof is added to an aqueous solution of the
        carbonic acid and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or to an
        aqueous solution through which carbon dioxide gas is bubbled
        and/or solid carbon dioxide has been added. The amount of
        carbonic acid and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon
        dioxide gas bubbled through the solution and dissolved therein
        and/or solid carbon dioxide is sufficient to prevent
        precipitation of water insoluble metal compounds (such as
        magnesium or calcium carbonate). </p>
      <p>Typically one litre of water is placed in a container and
        sufficient carbonic acid and/or carbonated water and/or hydrated
        carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas and/or solid carbon
        dioxide is added to produce a pH value of approximately pH 5.2.
        (In practice, approximately 40 to 45 mL of chilled (5° C.)
        carbonated mineral water is used depending on the initial pH of
        the water). The container is sealed and the contents are mixed.
        485 mg magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. </p>
      <p>The container is stored at a temperature of 0 to 10° C. and the
        contents mixed regularly. Sufficient time is allowed for a clear
        solution of magnesium bicarbonate to develop at a range of pH
        8.0 to pH 8.6, preferably pH 8.3. This takes approximately 24 to
        72 hours. Alternatively the carbonic acid and/or carbonated
        water and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas
        and/or solid carbon dioxide is added to the magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate powder in water. Alternatively one litre
        of water is placed in a container and sufficient carbonic acid
        and/or carbonated water and/or hydrated carbon dioxide and/or
        solid carbon dioxide is added to produce a pH value less than pH
        5.2. (In practice, approximately 30 mL to 40 mL of chilled water
        is used depending on the initial pH of the water). The container
        is sealed and the contents are mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>.Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. The container is stored at a temperature of
        0 to 10° C. and the contents mixed regularly. The pH of the
        water is then adjusted with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide
        or potassium hydroxide to a pH of 8 to 8.6, typically pH 8.3.
        Alternatively the carbonic acid or carbonated water and/or
        hydrated carbon dioxide and/or carbon dioxide gas and/or solid
        carbon dioxide is added to the magnesium carbonate hydroxide
        pentahydrate powder in water. </p>
      <p>The above processes may optionally be conducted under an
        atmosphere of carbon dioxide or a gas comprising carbon dioxide.
      </p>
      <p>Generally once the solution is prepared, it may be stored under
        a blanket of carbon dioxide gas to maintain the solution at a pH
        of 7 to 9 and at a temperature of 0 to 25° C. </p>
      <p>Usually one litre of the magnesium bicarbonate solution
        prepared above contains approximately 120 mg of magnesium per
        litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and approximately 600 mg of bicarbonate. 500 mg sodium
        bicarbonate (or potassium bicarbonate) is added to the magnesium
        bicarbonate solution and mixed. The mixture is stored in a
        sealed container in a refrigerator. The mixture contains
        approximately 120 mg magnesium per litre of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, 135 mg sodium per
        litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and 950 mg bicarbonate per litre of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution of the invention is administered or
        consumed orally. Typically the solution is an orally drinkable
        solution. Typically the solution is a therapeutic orally
        drinkable solution. Alternatively a gelling agent may added to
        the solution and the solution subjected to gelling conditions to
        gel the solution and the resultant gel may be consumed orally.
        For example, the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution may be prepared as a solution or an iced
        confectionary, such as an ice block or iced dessert, which is
        ingested orally. Alternatively the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be prepared in the form
        of a tablet, lozenge or lolly which is ingested orally. For
        example, the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution may be administered for metabolic acidosis
        or renal failure. Optionally the solution may be sterilised.
        Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is prepared as a solution which is ingested
        on a regular basis hourly, daily, monthly or yearly. The amount
        and frequency of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution administered/consumed in a day is generally
        sufficient so as to maintain a steady bicarbonate level in the
        bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. It is
        preferable to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate level in
        the bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. The
        amount of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution administered in a day ranges from 250 mL to 6 litres,
        typically 250 mL to 5.5 litres, 250 mL to 5 litres, 250 mL to
        4.5 litres, 250 mL to 4 litres, 250 mL to 3.5 litres, 250 mL to
        3 litres, 500 mL to 6 litres, 500 mL to 5.5 litres, 500 mL to 5
        litres, 500 mL to 4.5 litres, 500 mL to 4 litres, 500 mL to 3.5
        litres, 500 mL to 3 litres, more typically 1 litre to 6 litres,
        1 litre to 5.5 litres, 1 litre to 5 litres, 1 litre to 4.5
        litres, 1 litre to 4 litres, 1 litre to 3.5 litres, even more
        typically 1 litre to 3 litres, 1.5 litres to 6 litres, 1.5
        litres to 5.5 litres, 1.5 litres to 5 litres, 1.5 litres to 4.5
        litres, 1.5 litres to 4 litres, 1.5 litres to 3.5 litres, 1.8
        litres to 3.3 litres, 1.8 to 2.8 litres, 1.8 to 2.5 litres, 1.8
        to 2.3 litres, 1.8 to 2.0 litres, most typically 2 to 3 litres,
        typically 2.3 to 2.8 litres, more typically 2.3 to 2.6 litres,
        usually 2.1 to 3 litres. The aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution may be administered on a full or
        empty stomach, typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is administered on an empty stomach.
        Usually 1.5 to 3.5 litres, typically 1.8 to 3 litres, more
        typically 1.5 to 2.4 litres, even more typically 1.8 to 2.1
        litres and usually between 1.8 and 2.7 litres of aqueous neutral
        to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution is ingested,
        administered or consumed on an empty stomach by a mammal
        (typically a human) in equal or non equal volume amounts (100
        mL-1000 mL, 200-800 mL, 250-750 mL, 275-700 mL, 300-650 mL,
        350-600 mL, 400-550 mL, 450-500 mL, typically about 300-400 mL,
        more typically about 375 mL volume amounts a number of times
        (typically at set times) each day for the required number of
        times per day to drink the desired daily amount of the
        solution). For example if 1800 mL per day is to be consumed then
        a user may drink six 300 mL amounts of the solution every 2 to
        2.5 hours throughout the day. The oral consumption of the
        solution three or more times at roughly equally spaced apart
        intervals throughout the day is more desirable than consuming
        the solution in one or two lots throughout the day. The idea of
        taking the solution is to take it regularly throughout the day
        so that a simulated continuous oral intake or a close to
        continuous regular oral intake of the solution occurs. Thus
        depending on the condition and the subject one suitable
        administration/consumption regime could be nine by 200 mL
        amounts of the solution, each 200 mL amount being orally
        administered/consumed about every 1.5-1.75 hours to provide a
        total daily intake of 1800 mL. Alternatively, once again
        depending on the condition and the subject one suitable
        administration/consumption regime could be nine by 300 mL
        amounts of the solution, each 300 mL amount being orally
        administered/consumed about every 1.5-1.75 hours to provide a
        total daily intake of 2700 mL. Alternatively, once again
        depending on the condition and the subject one suitable
        administration/consumption regime could be nine by 350 mL
        amounts of the solution, each 350 mL amount being orally
        administered/consumed about every 1.5-1.75 hours to provide a
        total daily intake of 3150 mL. Typically the solution is
        administered/consumed 3 to 30, 3-25, 3-20, 3-15, 3-12, 3-10,
        3-9, 3-8, 3-7, 3-6, 3-5, 3-4, 4-30, 4-25, 4-20, 4-15, 4-12,
        4-10, 4-9, 4-8, 4-7, 4-6, 4-5, 5-30, 5-25, 5-20, 5-15, 5-12,
        5-11, 5-10, 5-9, 5-8, 5-7, 5-6, 6-30, 6-25, 6-20, 6-15, 25 6-12,
        6-11, 6-10, 6-9, 6-8, 6-7, 7-30, 7-25, 7-20, 7-15, 7-12, 7-11,
        7-10, 7-9, 7-8, 8-30, 8-25, 8-20, 8-15, 8-12, 8-11, 8-10, 8-9
        times per day at regular or irregular intervals or a mixture of
        both regular and irregular intervals, throughout each day.
        Typically the solution is administered/consumed every 0.3-10,
        0.3-8, 0.3-7, 0.3-6, 0.3-5, 0.3-4.5, 0.3-4, 0.3-3.5, 0.3-3,
        0.3-2.5, 0.3-2, 0.3-1.5, 0.3-1, 0.3-0.75, 0.3-0.5 hours/day when
        the subject is awake. More typically the solution is
        administered/consumed every 0.5-8, 0.5-7, 0.5-6, 0.5-5, 0.5-4.5,
        0.5-4, 0.5-3.5, 0.5-3, 0.5-2.5, 0.5-2, 0.5-1.5, 0.5-1, 0.5-0.8,
        0.5-0.75 hours/day when the subject is awake. Where possible the
        solution is consumed/administered on an empty (e.g. before
        eating). The solution may be administered according to these
        latter dosages over short (for: example 1 to 60 days, 10 to 40
        days, 3 months to 6 months, 1 day to 6 months) or long (for
        example 6 months to 10 years or more, 9 months to 18 months, 1
        year to 3 years, 1 year to 5 years, 2 to 6 years) periods as
        required. Usually the amount of aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution administered to a mammal is
        5 to 100 mL per Kg, more usual 10 to 50 mL per Kg, most usual 14
        to 29 mL per Kg or 25 to 43 mL per Kg. </p>
      <p>The solution may include other additives such as sweeteners,
        preservatives, flavourings and other suitable additives.
        Examples of suitable sweetners include sucrose, lactose,
        glucose, aspartame or saccharine. Examples of suitable
        flavouring agents include peppermint oil, oil of wintergreen,
        cherry, orange or raspberry flavouring. Examples of suitable
        preservatives include sodium benzoate, vitamin E,
        alpha-tocopherol, ascorbic acid, methyl paraben, propyl paraben
        or sodium bisulphite. </p>
      <p>Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is orally administered/consumed on an empty
        stomach. Usually consumption in this manner avoids the mixing of
        bicarbonate anions with stomach acid which may result in the
        loss of bicarbonate. Usually the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution is consumed in small amounts
        a number of times through a day typically at set times each day
        to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate concentration of
        body fluids. Usually the amount of aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution consumed at commencement is
        500 mL per day and is increased by increments over a period of
        one month to the maximum consumption. This start-up schedule
        generally avoids any gastrointestinal side effects due to the
        smooth muscle relaxation properties of magnesium. </p>
      <p>The aqueous neutral to very mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution of the invention may be administered intravenously
        (e.g. by discrete injection, semi continuous injection or drip
        feed or continuous injection or drip feed) or by other
        parenteral routes. Another embodiment of the invention is
        directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising the solution
        of the first or eleventh embodiments together with one or more
        pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants and/or
        excipients. Typically the pharmaceutical composition is suitable
        for oral or parenteral administration. Another embodiment of the
        invention is directed to a veterinary composition comprising the
        solution of the first or eleventh embodiments together with one
        or more veterinarily acceptable carriers, diluents, adjuvants
        and/or excipients. Typically the veterinary composition is
        suitable for oral or parenteral administration. The amount and
        frequency of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution administered/consumed in a day is generally
        sufficient so as to maintain a steady bicarbonate level in the
        bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. It is
        preferable to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate level in
        the bicarbonate concentration of a taker's body fluids. For
        parenteral administration, the solution is generally sterile.
        Suitable mono-toxic parenterally acceptable diluents or solvents
        include water, Ringer's solution, isotonic salt solution,
        1,3-butanediol, ethanol, propylene glycol or polyethylene
        glycols in mixtures with water. Aqueous solutions or suspensions
        may further comprise one or more buffering agents. Suitable
        buffering agents include sodium borate, sodium acetate, sodium
        citrate, or sodium tartrate, for example. Typically the solution
        is administered on a regular basis throughout a day to a patient
        requiring treatment. For example a patient may be parenterally
        administered the solution by way of a continuous drip feed or
        alternatively by way of a number of injections of the solution
        throughout a day (e.g. every 0.5-8 hours, more typically every
        1-4 hours). The treatment is generally continued as long as
        required to alleviate the patient's symptons to a satisfactory
        level. For concentration of metal bicarbonate in the
        compositions, frequency of administration and amount
        administered see discussion under oral administration. </p>

      <p>BEST MODE AND OTHER MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>Magnesium bicarbonate is a natural hydrated salt which exists
        only in an aqueous solution. It may be formed in spring water by
        an ion exchange process between the protons in carbonic acid
        (formed from the hydration of carbon dioxide located in the
        atmosphere, organic material, soils and rocks) and the magnesium
        in the constituent minerals of rocks (particularly the
        ferromagnesian minerals known as pyroxene and olivine that
        constitute basalt rocks). </p>
      <p>The ion exchange process can be represented by the following
        equations: </p>
      <p>##STR1## </p>
      <p>The term magnesium bicarbonate is used universally to describe
        the mixture of magnesium cations and bicarbonate anions found in
        spring waters and mineral waters. Most spring waters and mineral
        waters have acidic pH values (about pH 6.0). If the pH value of
        the water rises (due to contact with hydroxides), the magnesium
        cations and bicarbonate anions "attract" each other (reversibly)
        to form the true salt. The chemical formula of magnesium
        bicarbonate may be written as Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>,
        or (more accurately) Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>4</sub> (HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>.
        This latter formula takes into account the hexahydrated
        magnesium cation Mg(H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>6</sub>sup.2+. </p>
      <p>In essence, magnesium bicarbonate exists in aqueous solution
        probably as an hydrated salt of indeterminate hydration size due
        to the hydrogen bonds between linked water dipoles centred
        around the hydrated magnesium cation. </p>
      <p>The chemical processes occurring in magnesium bicarbonate
        solutions are complex and depend on the concentrations of
        magnesium cations and other ions. The following reactions are
        considered to occur: </p>
      <p>##STR2## </p>
      <p>There exists also a range of possible acid-base equilibria
        involving HCO<sub>3</sub>-, H<sub>3</sub>O.sup.+, CO<sub>3</sub>sup.2-












        and OH.sup.- ions and CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>.
        Usually the pH adjusting agent (and/or stabilising agent)
        maintains the acid-base equilibria. </p>
      <p>Typically to prepare the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution, crushed or powdered metal carbonate,
        or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal oxide, such as magnesium
        carbonate MgCO<sub>3</sub>, or commercial magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4.</sub>Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>.5H<sub>2</sub>O,
or













        other commercial magnesium carbonate hydroxides, or hydrated
        magnesium oxides, or magnesium oxides heated with carbon
        dioxide, or the calcite series or dolomite series of minerals
        (Mg, Ca)CO<sub>3</sub>, or limestone or dolomite rocks is mixed
        with water. A cloudy suspension is obtained. Sufficient carbonic
        acid or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas is added
        to obtain a solution having a pH 7 to 9 or pH 7 to 8.6, more
        typically pH 7.5 to 8.8 or pH 7.5 to 8.5 or pH 7.8 to 8.6, pH
        7.8 to 8.5, pH 7.8 to 8.4, pH 7.8 to 8.3, pH 7.8 to 8.2, pH 7.8
        to 8.1, pH 7.8 to 8.0, pH 7.8 to 7.9, pH 7.9 to 8.6, pH 7.9 to
        8.5, pH 7.9 to 8.4, pH 7.9 to 8.3, pH 7.9 to 8.2, pH 7.9 to 8.1,
        pH 7.9 to 8.0, pH 8.0 to 8.6, pH 8.0 to 8.5, pH 8.0 to 8.4, pH
        8.0 to 8.3, pH 8.0 to 8.2, pH 8.0 to 8.1, pH 8.1 to 8.6, pH 8.1
        to 8.5, pH 8.1 to 8.4, pH 8.1 to 8.3, pH 8.1 to 8.2, pH 8.2 to
        8.6, pH 8.2 to 8.5, pH 8.2 to 8.4, pH 8.2 to 8.3, pH 8.3 to 8.6,
        pH 8.3 to 8.5, pH 8.3 to 8.4, pH 8.4 to 8.6, pH 8.4 to 8.5, pH
        8.5 to 8.6, even more typically pH 8 to 8.5 or pH 8.2 to 8.6,
        most typically pH 8.3. The solution is then typically placed in
        a sealed container at 0 to 20° C. with occasional mixing until a
        clear solution develops. A clear solution is generally obtained
        in about 6 hours to 7 days, typically 12 hours to 5 days, more
        typically 24 hours to 5 days, most typically 24 hours to 3 days.
        Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is prepared and stored at a temperature
        ranging from 0 to 25° C., 0 to 20° C. 0.5 to 25° C., 0.5 to 20°
        C., 0.5 to 15° C., 0.5 to 10° C., 0.5 to 9° C., 0.5 to 8° C.,
        0.5 to 7° C., 1 to 20° C., 1 to 15° C., 1 to 10° C., 1.5 to 20°
        C., 1.5 to 15° C., 1.5 to 10° C., 2 to 20° C., 2 to 15° C., 2 to
        10° C., 3 to 20° C., 3 to 15° C., 4 to 20° C., 4 to 15° C., 4 to
        10° C., 5 to 10° C., 5 to 15° C., 6 to 20° C., 6 to 15° C., 6 to
        10° C., 7 to 20° C., 7 to 15° C., 7 to 10° C., 8 to 20° C., 8 to
        15° C., 8 to 10° C., 9 to 20° C., 9 to 15° C., 9 to 10° C., 10
        to 15° C., typically 0 to 15° C., more typically 0 to 10° C.,
        even more typically 3° C. to 10° C., most typically 5° C. to 10°
        C. and even most typically 5° C. Alternatively the crushed or
        powdered metal carbonate, or metal carbonate hydroxide or metal
        oxide or mixture thereof is added to an aqueous solution of the
        carbonic acid or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas.
      </p>
      <p>Typically one litre of water is placed in a container and
        sufficient carbonic acid or carbonated water or hydrated carbon
        dioxide or carbon dioxide gas is added to produce a pH value of
        approximately pH 5.2. (In practice, approximately 40 to 45 mL of
        chilled (5° C.) carbonated mineral water is used depending on
        the initial pH of the water). The container is sealed and the
        contents are mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate hydroxide
        pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. The container is stored at a temperature of
        0 to 10° C. and the contents mixed regularly. Sufficient time is
        allowed for a clear solution of magnesium bicarbonate to develop
        at a range of pH 8.0 to pH 8.5, typically pH 8.3. This takes
        approximately 24 to 72 hours. Alternatively the carbonic acid or
        carbonated water or hydrated carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide
        gas is added to the magnesium carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate
        powder in water. </p>
      <p>Alternatively one litre of water is placed in a container and
        sufficient carbonic acid or carbonated water or hydrated carbon
        dioxide gas is added to produce a pH value less than pH 5.2. (In
        practice, approximately 30 mL to 40 mL of chilled water is used
        depending on the initial pH of the water). The container is
        sealed and the contents are mixed. 485 mg magnesium carbonate
        hydroxide pentahydrate powder (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>Mg(OH)<sub>2</sub>5H<sub>2</sub>O,
molecular













        weight 485 is added. The container is again sealed and the
        contents are mixed. The container is stored at a temperature of
        0 to 10° C. and the contents mixed regularly. The pH of the
        water is then adjusted with an alkali such as sodium hydroxide
        or potassium hydroxide to a pH of 8 to 8.5, typically pH 8.3.
        Alternatively the carbonic acid or carbonated water or hydrated
        carbon dioxide or carbon dioxide gas is added to the magnesium
        carbonate hydroxide pentahydrate powder in water. </p>
      <p>Generally once the solution is prepared, the solution may be
        stored in a closed container under a blanket of carbon dioxide
        gas or a mixture of carbon dioxide gas and usually a
        nondeleterious inert gas, for example, argon, helium and/or
        nitrogen to maintain the solution at a pH of 7 to 9 and at a
        temperature of 0 to 25° C. and at 0.8 to 5 atm. The carbon
        dioxide gas blanket prevents loss of carbon dioxide from the
        solution. The amount of carbon dioxide in the gaseous mixture
        provides partial pressure on the liquid which is substantially
        equal to the partial pressure of carbon dioxide from carbon
        dioxide from the solution which is produced from equilibrium of
        bicarbonate in the solution at the particular temperature. In
        this way the solution is stabilised. If the solution were left
        in an open container for any substantial length of time
        precipitation of metal carbonate from the solution would occur
        as a result of decomposition of the bicarbonate in the solution
        as carbon dioxide is liberated from the solution. By using a
        stabilising agent in and/or above the solution such
        decomposition is substantially minimised or prevented.
        Alternatively the solution may be stored in a closed or sealed
        container (generally airtight) which is substantially filled
        with the solution whereby there is substantially no gas in the
        container or little gas compared to the amount of liquid in the
        container. </p>
      <p>The relevant chemical reactions may be represented by the
        following equations: </p>
      <p>##STR3## </p>
      <p>Usually one litre of the magnesium bicarbonate solution
        prepared above contains approximately 120 mg of magnesium per
        litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and approximately 600 mg of bicarbonate. 500 mg sodium
        bicarbonate (or potassium bicarbonate) is added to the magnesium
        bicarbonate solution and mixed. The mixture is stored in a
        sealed container in a refrigerator. The mixture contains
        approximately 120 mg magnesium per litre of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution, 135 mg sodium per
        litre of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution and 950 mg bicarbonate per litre of aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>In the body, normal intracellular pH value is pH 7.2. Under
        acidic conditions, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
        hydrolysis, intracellular pH value may decrease to pH 6.5. In
        practice, a pH value is chosen for bicarbonate solutions that
        exceeds normal blood plasma pH value (pH&gt;7.38). </p>
      <p>A low temperature, between 0 and 10° C., typically 5 to 10° C.,
        ensures that carbon dioxide stays dissolved in solution to
        maximise carbon dioxide hydration. Above 15 to 20° C., the
        solubility of carbon dioxide is low, the carbon dioxide leaves
        the solution, and particles and sediments may occur in the
        solution. Above 15 to 20° C., the solution may be cloudy in
        appearance. </p>
      <p>At high magnesium concentrations, a minimum time, at least 24
        to 72 hours at 5° C., is required for completion of the kinetic
        processes that produce a clear solution of magnesium
        bicarbonate. (The kinetic processes include the hydration of
        carbon dioxide, the dissolution of magnesium carbonate and the
        dissolution of magnesium hydroxide.) The concentration of
        magnesium cations (in association with bicarbonate anions) is
        generally in the range 25 mg to 250 mg per litre aqueous neutral
        to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution (depending on the
        pH value of the metal bicarbonate solution). Usually the maximum
        magnesium concentration that can be maintained in solution as
        magnesium bicarbonate may be approximately 120 mg per litre
        aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution at
        pH 8.3. As the pH value decreases, the concentration of
        magnesium that can be maintained in solution increases. Because
        magnesium chloride is soluble, higher concentrations of
        magnesium can be maintained in solution if chlorides (such as
        sodium chloride) are added to the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>The solubility product constant for magnesium carbonate is
        reported to be approximately 3.5.times.10.sup.-8. The solubility
        product constant for magnesium hydroxide is reported to be
        approximately 1.1.times.10.sup.-11. Calculated from these
        values, the maximum concentrations of magnesium cations that can
        exist in solution as carbonates or hydroxides are approximately
        20 mg per litre aqueous metal bicarbonate solution and 10 mg per
        litre aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate
        solution respectively. </p>
      <p>Generally the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution of the invention is administered or
        consumed orally. Typically the solution is an orally drinkable
        solution. Typically the solution is a therapeutic orally
        drinkable solution. For example, the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be prepared as a
        solution or an iced confectionary, such as an ice block or iced
        dessert, which is ingested orally. Alternatively the aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be
        prepared in the form of a tablet, lozenge or lolly which is
        ingested orally. For example, the aqueous neutral to mildly
        alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be administered for
        metabolic acidosis or renal failure. Optionally the solution may
        be sterilised. Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is prepared as a solution which is
        ingested hourly, daily, monthly or yearly. The amount of aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution
        administered in a day ranges from 250 mL to 6 litres, typically
        250 mL to 5.5 litres, 250 mL to 5 litres, 250 mL to 4.5 litres,
        250 mL to 4 litres, 250 mL to 3.5 litres, 250 mL to 3 litres,
        500 mL to 6 litres, 500 mL to 5.5 litres, 500 mL to 5 litres,
        500 mL to 4.5 litres, 500mL to 4 litres, 500 mL to 3.5 litres,
        500 mL to 3 litres, more typically 1 litre to 6 litres, 1 litre
        to 5.5 litres, 1 litre to 5 litres, 1 litre to 4.5 litres, 1
        litre to 4 litres, 1 litre to 3.5 litres, even more typically 1
        litre to 3 litres, 1.5 litres to 6 litres, 1.5 litres to 5.5
        litres, 1.5 litres to 5 litres, 1.5 litres to 4.5 litres, 1.5
        litres to 4 litres, 1.5 litres to 3.5 litres, most typically 2
        to 3 litres, usually 2.1 to 3 litres. The aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution may be administered
        on a full or empty stomach, typically the aqueous neutral to
        mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution is administered on an
        empty stomach. Usually 1.5 to 3 litres, more typically 1.5 to
        2.4 litres, even more typically 1.8 to 2.1 litres and usually
        between 1.8 and 2.7 litres of aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is ingested on an empty stomach in
        approximately 300 mL volumes at set times each day. The solution
        may be administered according to these latter dosages over short
        (for example 1 to 10 days) or long (for example 6 months to 10
        years or more) periods as required. Usually the amount of
        aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution
        administered to a mammal is 5 to 100 mL per Kg, more usual 10 to
        50mL per Kg, most usual 14 to 29 mL per Kg or 25 to 43 mL per
        Kg. </p>
      <p>Typically the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution is consumed on an empty stomach. Usually
        consumption in this manner avoids the mixing of bicarbonate
        anions with stomach acid which may result in the loss of
        bicarbonate. Usually the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline
        metal bicarbonate solution is consumed in small amounts at set
        times each day to avoid a rapid increase in the bicarbonate
        concentration of body fluids. Usually the amount of aqueous
        neutral to mildly alkaline metal bicarbonate solution consumed
        at commencement is 500 mL per day and is increased by increments
        over a period of one month to the maximum consumption. This
        start-up schedule generally avoids any gastrointestinal side
        effects due to the smooth muscle relaxation properties of
        magnesium. </p>
      <p>The advantages of the aqueous neutral to mildly alkaline metal
        bicarbonate solution of the invention are that the magnesium
        cations function as bicarbonate transporters into body cells.
        Magnesium bicarbonate enters body cells and the bicarbonate
        anions function to displace from equilibrium the dissociation
        reaction of intracellular carbonic acid. Magnesium bicarbonate
        enters body cells and the bicarbonate anions function as an
        intracellular proton sink (or proton scavenger). These reactions
        can be represented by the one equation </p>
      <p>##STR4## </p>
      <p>Magnesium bicarbonate enters body cells and the bicarbonate
        anions function to displace from equilibrium the hydration
        reaction of carbon dioxide which is catalysed by the enzyme
        carbonic anhydrase. This reaction can be represented by the
        equation </p>
      <p>##STR5## </p>
      <p>Usually appropriate salts of magnesium, sodium, potassium,
        calcium and lithium should not exceed the concentrations of the
        component elements recommended by health authorities. The
        concentrations of component elements cannot exceed
        concentrations restricted by the solubility product constants of
        respective hydroxides and carbonates. </p>
      <p>EXAMPLE 1 </p>
      <p>An Experiment to Decrease Intracellular Proton Concentrations
        and to Increase Intracellular Bicarbonate Concentrations in
        Mammalian Cells in Vitro </p>
      <p>Aqueous bicarbonate anions act as proton sinks in the presence
        of excess proton concentrations in solution. This reaction can
        be represented by the chemical equation </p>
      <p>##STR6## </p>
      <p>In the presence of sufficient concentrations of bicarbonate
        anions, the reaction is essentially complete and proton
        concentrations decrease. The pH value of the solution increases.
        When plasma bicarbonate anions are present outside mammalian
        body cells in sufficient concentrations, they are translocated
        into the cytoplasm of the cells across the cell plasma
        membranes. Indeed, bicarbonate anions equilibrate rapidly across
        mammalian cell membranes. Bicarbonate translocation into cells
        takes place via several processes. These processes include a
        chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and a sodium dependent
        chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and potassium co-transport
        and magnesium co-transport. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to decrease intracellular proton
        concentrations and to increase intracellular bicarbonate
        concentrations in mammalian body cells in vitro. Throughout the
        experiment, extracellular pH determinations were made using a pH
        electrode and intracellular pH determinations were made using a
        trapped fluorescein derivative. An increase in intracellular
        proton concentrations (intracellular acidification) was achieved
        by applying 10 mmol ammonium chloride (NH<sub>4</sub>Cl)
        solution to a suspension of cells and then removing the NH<sub>4</sub>Cl.












        An increase in intracellular bicarbonate concentrations was
        achieved by applying an aqueous metal bicarbonate solution to a
        suspension of cells. The aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        contained approximately Mg.sup.2+ 120 mg per litre, Na+ 135 mg
        per litre and HCO.sub.3.sup.- 950 mg per litre at pH 8.3. This
        aqueous metal bicarbonate solution was equivalent to 15 mmol
        bicarbonate approximately. Blood was collected in sodium heparin
        from a range of mammals and the leucocytes removed. The
        leucocytes were washed and re-suspended in isotonic saline.
        Intracellular pH determinations were made by loading leucocytes
        for 15 minutes with (10 micromol in saline)
        2,7-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). Cells were
        illuminated at 440 nm and 490 nm and fluorescence was measured
        at 530 nm. </p>
      <p>The experiment utilising sheep leucocytes is given stepwise
        below: </p>

        Result: Cells have increased intracellular proton
        concentrations. Cytoplasm is acidified. </p>
      <p>Step 2. Decrease in intracellular proton concentrations </p>
      <p>A. Acidified leucocytes (from Step 1.) divided into two groups;
        Control group and Treatment group. </p>
      <p>B. Treatment group of leucocytes exposed to aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>After 3 minutes: </p>
      <p>Extracellular pH 7.5 <br>
        Intracellular pH 7.0 </p>
      <p>C. Control group of leucocytes not exposed to aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution. </p>
      <p>After 5 minutes: </p>
      <p>Extracellular pH 7.2 <br>
        Intracellular pH 6.6 </p>
      <p>Result: Cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        rapidly decrease intracellular proton concentrations. Cytoplasm
        shows rapid recovery from acidification relative to non-treated
        cells. </p>
      <p>Step 3. Increase in intracellular bicarbonate concentrations </p>
      <p>A. Leucocytes suspended in normal saline after pretreatment
        with fluorescein. </p>

      <p>B. Aqueous metal bicarbonate solution applied to suspension of
        leucocytes for 20 minutes. </p>
      <p>Extracellular pH 7.9 <br>
        Intracellular pH 7.4 </p>
      <p>Result: Cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        have increased intracellular bicarbonate concentrations which
        are manifested by an increase in pH value of cytoplasm. </p>
      <p>The experiment was repeated with leucocytes from mice, rats,
        guinea pigs, cattle, horses, dogs, cats and humans. In all
        cases, acidified cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution had decreased intracellular proton concentrations. In
        all cases, cells treated with aqueous metal bicarbonate solution
        had increased intracellular bicarbonate concentrations which
        were manifested by increased pH values of cytoplasm. </p>
      <p>The experiment was repeated with aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solutions that contained a range of concentrations of Mg.sup.2+,
        Na.sup.+, HCO<sub>3</sub>sup.- and K.sup.+ and Ca.sup.2+ ions.

      <p>An Experiment to Demonstrate Bicarbonate Anion Translocation
        from Aqueous Metal Bicarbonate Solution into the Mammalian Body
        Against a Bicarbonate Anion Concentration Gradient </p>
      <p>Mammalian plasma contains bicarbonate anions at a concentration
        about 25 mmol (HCO<sub>3</sub>sup.- 1,500 mg per litre). When
        ingested, aqueous metal bicarbonate solution produces
        biochemical, physiological and medical effects at bicarbonate
        anion concentrations about 16 mmol (HCO<sub>3</sub>sup.- 950 mg
        per litre). Aqueous metal bicarbonate solution, at bicarbonate
        anion concentration about 16 mmol, contains two thirds the
        bicarbonate anion concentration of plasma, so bicarbonate anions
        must be translocated into the mammalian body against a
        bicarbonate anion concentration gradient. </p>
      <p>Mammalian plasma contains cations at concentrations around
        Mg.sup.2+ 24 mg per litre, Na.sup.+ 3,300 mg per litre, K.sup.+
        175 mg per litre and Ca.sup.2+ 100 mg per litre. Aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution commonly contains cations at concentrations
        around Mg.sup.2+ 120 mg per litre, Na.sup.+ 135 mg per litre,
        K.sup.+ 100 mg per litre and Ca.sup.2+ 20 mg per litre. Aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution commonly contains 5 times the
        magnesium cation concentration of plasma. Other cations are
        present commonly in aqueous metal bicarbonate solution in
        concentrations lower than plasma. </p>
      <p>The concentrations of cations and anions in plasma can be

        It is suggested that sodium cations and chloride anions leave
        plasma along their respective concentration gradients and
        magnesium and bicarbonate ions enter plasma along a magnesium
        cation concentration gradient. Magnesium functions as a
        bicarbonate transporter. In addition, it is suggested that
        bicarbonate anions enter plasma by chloride-bicarbonate exchange
        processes along a chloride anion concentration gradient
        (chloride `out`, bicarbonate `in`). </p>
      <p>In mammals, any large increases in plasma bicarbonate
        concentrations can be decreased normally by a number of
        biochemical and physiological homeostatic control processes.
        These processes occur in time frames that range from minutes to
        hours and longer. One of the main control processes that occurs
        as a result of increased plasma bicarbonate concentration is an
        alteration in bicarbonate chemistry in the kidneys. This is
        manifested by a decrease in proton concentration in urine and by
        a pH value of urine that is less acidic. In the presence of
        increased plasma bicarbonate, kidney tubule cells decrease their
        excretion of protons. Kidney control of bicarbonate
        concentration is not instantaneous and occurs within a time
        frame of several hours to several days. Unless a mammal has
        physiological or clinical acidosis, it is difficult to detect
        small increases in plasma bicarbonate concentration. Any
        increases in plasma bicarbonate concentration are taken up by
        body cells. Indeed, plasma bicarbonate equilibrates with
        intracellular bicarbonate rapidly. In a normal mammal, a
        measurable increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration occurs
        only during an artificially induced alkalosis and is detectable
        either when the consumption of bicarbonate anions (as NaHCO<sub>3</sub>)
        greatly exceeds the concentration of bicarbonate in normal
        plasma or when bicarbonate anions (as NaHCO<sub>3</sub>) are
        administered intravenously. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to determine if bicarbonate anions
        in aqueous metal bicarbonate solutions are translocated against
        a bicarbonate concentration gradient into the body. Bicarbonate
        translocation against a concentration gradient could occur
        either via energy (ATP) dependent processes or via anion
        (chloride-bicarbonate) exchange or via co-transport with cations
        along cation concentration gradients. There are also complex
        thermodynamic processes involving intracellular and
        extracellular concentrations of bicarbonate anions, hydroxide
        anions, protons and carbon dioxide that may assist in the
        overall translocation of bicarbonate anions. These processes
        often involve the production of bicarbonate anions by carbonic
        anhydrase enzymes. In the experiment, entry of bicarbonate
        anions into the body was assessed by determinations of proton
        concentration in urine; that is, the pH value of urine. </p>
      <p>Ten people had urine pH value assessed once per week for 3
        months. Urine pH values were assessed once per week for a
        further 3 months after commencement of consumption of aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution. The aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution contained approximately Mg.sup.2+ 120 mg per litre,
        Na.sup.+ 135 mg per litre and HCO<sub>3</sub> 950 mg per litre.
        The major component of the solution was magnesium bicarbonate
        Mg(HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> 720 mg per litre approximately.
        Results are given below: </p>
      <p>Mean pH value of urine </p>
      <p>(Early Morning Sample) </p>
      <p>Prior to consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution: pH
        5.9 </p>
      <p>After commencement of consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate
        solution: pH 6.7 </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution decreases
        proton excretion by the kidneys. The pH value of urine
        increases. </p>
      <p>These results demonstrate that bicarbonate anions from aqueous
        metal bicarbonate solution are translocated against a
        bicarbonate anion concentration gradient into the body. This may
        occur either via co-transport with cations along a cation
        concentration gradient or via chloride-bicarbonate exchange
        processes along a chloride anion concentration gradient
        (chloride `out`, bicarbonate `in`). In the case of aqueous metal
        bicarbonate solution, the only cation concentration gradient
        possible is that involving magnesium cation concentrations. </p>
      <p>The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution leads to
        an increase in bicarbonate anion concentration in the body which
        is manifested by a decrease in proton concentration in urine; an
        increase in pH value of urine. </p>

      <p>An Experiment to Improve the Buffering Capacities of the
        Extracellular and Intracellular Bicarbonate Buffers and to
        Decrease Senescence and to Increase Longevity in a
        Representative Mammal </p>
      <p>Mammalian body cells produce continuously concentrations of
        carbon dioxide. Upon hydration, carbon dioxide increases proton
        concentrations in the cytoplasm of body cells. The pH values of
        the cytoplasm of body cells are lowered. The production of
        protons in cytoplasm by the hydration of carbon dioxide can be
        represented by the following chemical equations: </p>
      <p>##STR7## </p>
      <p>The protons produced in the cytoplasm of body cells by the
        hydration of carbon dioxide, and other intracellular reactions,
        are buffered normally by intracellular bicarbonate buffers. The
        bicarbonate anions in intracellular buffers derive manly from
        the extracellular bicarbonate of blood plasma. The bicarbonate
        anions in blood plasma originate from erythrocytes as products
        of erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase enzyme reactions. </p>
      <p>When plasma bicarbonate anions are present outside mammalian
        body cells in sufficient concentrations, they are translocated
        into the cytoplasm of the cells across the cell plasma
        membranes. Indeed, plasma bicarbonate equilibrates with
        cytoplasmic bicarbonate rapidly. Bicarbonate translocation into
        cells takes place via several processes. These processes include
        a chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and a sodium dependent
        chloride-bicarbonate anion exchange and potassium co-transport
        and magnesium co-transport. There are also complex thermodynamic
        processes involving intracellular and extracellular
        concentrations of bicarbonate anions, hydroxide ions, protons
        and carbon dioxide that may assist in the overall translocation
        of bicarbonate anions. These processes often involve the
        production of bicarbonate anions by carbonic anhydrase enzymes.
      </p>
      <p>Concentrations of bicarbonate anions that are translocated into
        mammalian body cells improve the buffering capacity of the
        cytoplasm of the cells. Concentrations of bicarbonate anions and
        concentrations of carbon dioxide form a buffer system described
        by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation: </p>
      <p>pH = pK + log ([HCO<sub>3</sub>sup.-]/[H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
        ]) </p>
      <p>(Where pK is the pK of hydrated carbon dioxide H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>
        and has an approximate numerical value of 6.35) </p>
      <p>For a classical (closed system) buffer to be effective, the
        ratio of the conjugate base to the acid (in the above case [HCO<sub>3</sub>sup.-













        ]/[H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> ]) must be between 0.1 and 10.
        This ratio applies also to buffers in biological (open) systems.
        In mammalian body cells, the continuous and open production of
        carbon dioxide means that continuous supplies of bicarbonate
        anions are required to maintain effective and optimal buffering
        capacities. Under conditions of excess proton concentrations,
        from carbon dioxide production and ATP hydrolysis and other
        metabolic processes, the supply of bicarbonate fails and the
        effective and optimal buffering capacities of mammalian body
        cells falter. </p>
      <p>The vitality of mammalian body cells is linked critically to
        the buffering capacities of the extracellular fluids and the
        cytoplasm of the cells. Processes of cellular degeneration occur
        when buffering capacities falter in the presence of excess
        proton concentrations. Cellular degenerations are manifested in
        the mammalian body by degenerative diseases and senescence.
        Examples of degenerative diseases in mammals that are linked
        casually to extracellular and intracellular proton
        concentrations include osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, the
        diseases associated with chronic inflammation, the diseases
        associated with lysosomal enzyme activities, the diseases
        associated with oxidations of cell nucleic acids, cell protein
        amino acids and cell membrane lipids, and the diseases
        associated with aberrations of mitochondrial respiration. </p>
      <p>An experiment was conducted to improve the buffering capacities
        of the extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate buffers and
        to consequently decrease senescence and increase longevity in a
        representative mammal. One hundred and ten Merino ewe lambs were
        divided randomly at weaning into a control group and a treatment
        group. The groups were of equal size and were maintained under
        similar conditions except for the pH values and aqueous metal
        bicarbonate concentrations of drinking water supplies. Sheep
        were selected as the representative mammal because their life
        span and body weight are more representative of typical mammals
        than laboratory rodents, their life span is not excessively
        long, their body size permits multiple blood and tissue sample
        collections, they are easy to handle and their husbandry is
        suited to experimental conditions. The control group was
        maintained, for the full life span of the sheep, in small
        experimental paddocks with slightly acidic (less than pH 6.5)
        drinking water supplies that contained bicarbonate
        concentrations less than 30 mg per litre. The treatment group
        was maintained, for the full life span of the sheep, in small
        experimental paddocks with slightly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 9.0)
        drinking water supplies that contained bicarbonate
        concentrations between 300 mg per litre and 800 mg per litre.
        The drinking water supplies for the treatment group were loaded
        with the appropriate concentrations of bicarbonate anions by the
        addition of crushed and powdered magnesite MgCO<sub>3</sub> to
        the water. The magnesite frequently contained calcite CaCO<sub>3</sub>
        and dolomite (Ca,Mg)CO<sub>3</sub>. The magnesite was dissolved
        in the drinking water either with the assistance of commercial
        supplies of carbon dioxide gas or carbonic acid or with local
        supplies of hydrated carbon dioxide. This dissolution process
        can be represented by the following chemical equations: </p>
      <p>##STR8## </p>
      <p>The treatment group of sheep consumed slightly alkaline (pH 7.8
        to 9.0) drinking water that contained bicarbonate concentrations
        between 300 mg per litre and 800 mg per litre. At this pH value,
        and this bicarbonate concentration, bicarbonate was mostly in
        the form of magnesium bicarbonate Mg (HCO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2 </sub>:

      <p>##STR9## </p>
      <p>In addition, some sediments of carbonate (Ca,Mg)CO<sub>3</sub>
        were present in the drinking water during summer months: </p>
      <p>##STR10## </p>
      <p>The mean pH values and the mean magnesium, calcium and
        bicarbonate concentrations in the drinking water supplies are
        given below (the concentrations of cations and bicarbonate
        anions were not stoichiometric in the drinking water --
        particularly the drinking water of the control group -- because
        of the presence of some concentrations of sulphate, chloride and
        sodium ions): <br>

        In the late stages of pregnancy, there is a tendency for
        pregnant mammals to become hypoglycaemic and hyperketonaemic.
        Hyperketonaemia subjects the pregnant mammal to an acid load
        (increase in proton concentrations). This acid load may result
        in clinical acidosis. Like all mammals, pregnant ewes tend to be
        hypoglycaemic and hyperketonaemic late in pregnancy. In ewes
        affected clinically with acidosis, bicarbonate concentrations
        range between 14 to 20 mmol per litre plasma. </p>
      <p>Over several years, plasma bicarbonate concentrations were
        determined for the control group and the treatment group one
        week prior to lambing. Determination of plasma bicarbonate
        concentrations prior to lambing is a direct measure of
        extracellular and intracellular bicarbonate buffering capacity.
        In ewes with effective extracellular and intracellular
        bicarbonate buffers, bicarbonate concentrations are maintained
        in a range between 24 to 27 mmol per litre plasma. Plasma
        bicarbonate concentrations are given below: <br>

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The treatment group had larger plasma
        bicarbonate concentrations than the <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; control group. <br>
        The consumption of aqueous metal bicarbonate solution,
        principally magnesium bicarbonate solution, improves the
        buffering capacities of extracellular and intracellular
        bicarbonate buffers in mammals. </p>
      <p>In mammalian demography, there are two measurements utilised
        commonly in the experiment study of degenerative diseases and
        senescence. The first measurement is called fifty percent
        survival. Fifty percent survival describes the chronological age
        at which half an original population has died. The second
        measurement is called maximum life span. Maximum life span
        describes the age of the longest lived survivors of a
        population. The fifty percent survival measurement is considered
        to reflect susceptibility to accidents and infectious and
        degenerative diseases in mammals. The maximum life span
        measurement is considered to reflect the innate processes of
        senescence in mammals. The fifty percent survival measurement
        and the maximum life span measurement for the control group and
        the treatment group are given below: <br>
