            Papering the World to Make Crops Grow</b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      STRIPS of paper, three feet wide and less than one thirty-second
      of an inch in thickness, have increased the production of
      pineapples in the Hawaiian Islands by more than forty per cent.
      Laid in a field of sun-grown Sumatra tobacco, in Florida, the same
      kind of paper increased production more than fifty per cent.
      Papering fields of tomatoes in California raised their yield by
      some sixty per cent, while strawberries, their roots so protected,
      produced forty per cent more berries than the same varieties
      planted in a neighboring and un-papered field.<br>
      <br>
      For fifteen months or more, prior to 1923, experiments in the
      papering of pineapple fields in Hawaii were carried on with
      uniformly the same results. This year, more than 4,250 miles of
      paper were laid, at a cost of approximately $250,000, on the
      pineapple plantations of Hawaii. The result is an increase of from
      twenty-five to sixty per cent in the production of the pineapple
      plants, an average of at least forty per cent; the elimination of
      weeding, which costs on the average $45 per acre; the conservation
      of moisture; the prevention of baking of the soil, and the removal
      of the necessity for cultivation throughout the crop life of the
      pineapple, which is about five years.<br>
      <br>
      The device is the discovery of C. F. Eckart, the Burbank of the
      Hawaiian Islands. It consists of the laying of a mulch paper, made
      of asphalt-treated felt, not dissimilar to a thin roofing paper,
      in rows across the field. In this paper, six inches from each
      edge, and, therefore, twenty-four inches apart in the center,
      holes are punched with a trowel, and the pineapple cuttings,
      “ratoons,” are set in these holes. As the paper is laid, the earth
      is turned up over, the edges, to hold it flat and to prevent it
      from blowing away. The plants are set “staggering” in adjacent
      lines, so that while the rows along the paper are even, those
      across the field are not.<br>
      <br>
      The same method used in the planting -of the pineapples is adopted
      in the setting out of tobacco, tomato, cabbage or other plants.
      Experiments are now being conducted on the use of the paper with
      grapes, and with flowering plants, in short, with all crops which
      have a high value per acre. It also has been applied with success
      to sugar cane in the Hawaiian Islands. Not only does it increase
      the amount of production of each plant, but it increases the size
      of the fruits or vegetables or the number and size of the leaves.<br>
      <br>
      The paper virtually puts every plant root into a forcing hothouse.
      The roots are kept shaded, heat is retained as is also moisture,
      the combination necessary to the greatest root and plant growth,
      and weeds, being unable to pierce the paper covering, cannot grow.
      The use of the paper, by this combination of retained heat and
      moisture, has extended the area in which pineapples can be
      produced profitably to higher altitudes and colder temperatures in
      the Hawaiian Islands than ever before. In Florida, the increase in
      individual fields of sun-grown tobacco has reached as high as
      seventy-one per cent, but this is above the average. In the
      culture of tomatoes, the increase in yield ranged from twenty-one
      per cent to 168 per cent, under widely varying conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Surface evaporation from the area covered with the paper is so
      greatly reduced that it is virtually negligible, the moisture
      being conserved entirely for the use of the plant. This reduction
      of surface evaporation to a minimum eliminates the undesirable and
      often disastrous caking and cracking of the soil. Heat loss by
      evaporation of surface moisture also is prevented, producing and
      maintaining additional warmth in the soil. The paper receives the
      direct impact of the raindrops and so prevents the soil from
      packing. Some of the papers used are perforated with many small
      holes, so as to allow moisture from rain, dew, and fogs to seep
      slowly through, increasing the moisture so stored in the soil
      beneath the paper.<br>
      <br>
      The paper is applied by hand, with men carrying the rolls on steel
      rods, and other men following behind with hoes to cover the edges
      with a binder of earth; by machine layers, drawn by horses, with
      special devices for the turning in of the binder of earth ; and,
      on level fields, by double machines, laying two rows at a time,
      drawn by a tractor. These machines also lay their own earth
      binder.<br>

      <b>Conclusions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The purpose of this study was to determine if there are suitable
      alternatives to plastic mulch with respect to weed control and
      crop production in the Pacific Northwest. In this study we found
      that there were no differences in the quality or durability of the
      alternative mulch treatments or in the quality and yield of the
      vegetable crop. The oil had no effect on the longevity or
      qualities of the paper mulch. The paper mulches proved as high in
      quality as the plastic mulch and Garden Bio-Film. In adjacent
      observation plots, paper was laid in the field and then oils were
      applied. There was no difference in quality of the mulch whether
      oil was applied before or after laying the mulch in the field. In
      an additional adjacent observation plot, paper with no oil was
      laid in the field and overhead irrigation was applied throughout
      the summer. There was no difference in the quality of the mulch
      whether irrigation was applied through drip or overhead
      irrigation.<br>
      <br>
      In 2004 we intend to continue investigating alternatives to
      plastic mulch. We will test different weights of paper and again
      test Garden Bio-Film mulch. We will also evaluate the response of
      several types of vegetable crops (warmer temperature vs. cooler
      temperature) to the different mulches.<br>

      Paper is gaining over plastic in mulches used to grow commercial
      fruits and vegetables as well as the home-grown varieties,
      according to Agricultural Research Service (ARS) studies in
      Peoria, Ill. A main reason for this trend is that
      vegetable-oil-coated paper mulch may be a less costly alternative
      to plastic mulches, which are expensive to remove.<br>
      <br>
      Brown paper coated with vegetable oils like soybean and linseed
      oil can protect the crop from weeds and insects and is completely
      biodegradable, according to ARS chemist Randal L. Shogren at the
      National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research (NCAUR) in
      Peoria, Ill. That gives paper a big advantage over plastic mulches
      that cost about $240 an acre. Soy oil costs around 15 cents a
      pound, so growers and home gardeners can expect a reasonable cost
      for paper mulches made with vegetable oil.<br>
      <br>
      Shogren coated plain brown kraft paper--used to make grocery store
      bags--with several types of vegetable oils, including soybean,
      linseed and a chemically-modified soybean oil plus a catalyst. The
      vegetable-oil-coated paper withstood wind and rain long enough for
      the crop to grow, but then began degrading in the soil.<br>
      <br>
      In trials, Shogren found that kraft paper treated with a
      combination of epoxidized soybean oil and citric acid held up for
      13 weeks compared to untreated kraft paper, which was 50 percent
      degraded in 2-1/2 weeks. A U.S. patent on the technology has been
      approved. Field trials in Live Oak, Fla., in cooperation with the
      University of Florida (Gainesville) are in progress. Currently,
      field trials are being planned with an industry partner.<br>
      <br>
      Shogren presented information on the paper mulches at the 6th
      International Conference on Frontiers of Polymers and Advanced
      Materials in Recife, Brazil, March 5-9.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b> -- Biodegradable, agricultural mulches are
      prepared by coating paper with a cross-linked drying oil or a
      cross-linked, functionally modified drying oil. These mulches are
      inexpensive to produce, and are also water-resistant, mechanically
      stable and highly effective as weed barriers. The reactivities of
      various drying oils permit the development of a broad spectrum of
      coating systems and coating properties. In one embodiment of the
      invention, it is contemplated to complete cross-linking of coated
      paper in the field through either oxidative or photoinitiated
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Polyethylene films are used extensively in agriculture as
      greenhouse covers, forage covers and agricultural mulch. Worldwide
      yearly consumption for polyethylene mulch film alone is currently
      over 1 billion pounds (M. H. Jensen, presentation at 27th National
      Agricultural Plastics Congress, 1998). Plastic mulches and row
      covers help retain soil moisture, increase soil temperature,
      inhibit weed growth, reduce insect damage and thereby increase
      yields (D. F. Anderson, M. A. Garisto, J. C. Bourrut, M. W.
      Schonbeck, R. Jaye, A. Wurzberger and R. DeGregorio, J. Sustain.
      Agric. 7, 39-61, 1995; J. W. Courter, University of Illinois
      Cooperative Extension Service Circular No. 1009, Champaign, Ill.,
      1969; D. E. Hill, L. Hankin and G. R. Stephens, Connecticut Agric.
      Exp. Sta. Bull. No. 805, New Haven, Conn., 1982). Most mulches are
      used for vegetable and fruit production due to their relatively
      high value. Disposal or recycling of polyethylene films, however,
      has become a daunting problem. Agricultural mulch, in particular,
      is very difficult to recycle due to contamination with dirt and
      debris as well as loss in mechanical properties from UV catalyzed
      oxidation. Many landfills reject mulch film because of pesticide
      residues and thus it must be treated as hazardous waste (B.
      Hofstetter, New Farm 13, 56-57, 1991). A biodegradable mulch would
      have the dual advantages of avoiding costs of removal and disposal
      as well as contributing humus to the soil.<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a biodegradable, water resistant,
      agricultural mulch that is produced from paper and a cross-linked
      drying oil.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several different types of degradable mulch have been considered
      including polyethylene film containing prooxidants (W. J. Maddever
      and G. M. Chapman, Proceedings of the Soc. Plast. Eng. 47th Ann.
      Tech. Conf., 1352-1355, 1989), starch-polyvinyl (PVOH) alcohol
      films (F. H. Otey, A. M. Mark, C. L. Mehltretter and C. R.
      Russell, Ind. Eng. Chem. Prod. Res. Develop. 13, 90-92, 1974),
      biodegradable polyester films (J. M. Mayer and D. L. Kaplan,
      Trends in Polym. Sci. 2, 227-235, 1994) and coated paper or fiber
      mats (J. Vandenberg and J. Tiessen, Hortscience 7, 464-465. 1972
      and A. Bastiaansen, A. Hanzen, D. DeWit and H. Tournois, PCT Int.
      Pat. Appl. WO9609355, 1996). Although polyethylene films will
      disintegrate, resulting fragments may require decades to
      completely biodegrade, and toxicity of degradation products is
      largely unknown (A. C. Albertsson and S. Karlsson, J. Appl. Polym.
      Sci. 35, 1289-1302, 1988). Starch-PVOH films have rather poor
      resistance to water and thus would not be expected to maintain
      their integrity during rain. Progress is being made on laminating
      starch-PVOH films with different types of water-resistant,
      biodegradable polyesters (J. W. Lawton, in Cereals, Novel Uses and
      Processes, Plenum Press, New York, 1997, p. 43-47). Although
      biodegradable polyesters such as polylactic acid, polycaprolactone
      and polybutylene succinate have excellent mechanical properties
      (J. M. Mayer and D. L. Kaplan, Trends in Polym. Sci. 2, 227-235,
      1994), their cost ($2-8/lb.) is much higher than for polyethylene
      ($0.4/lb. resin, $1-2/lb. film) (D. F. Anderson, M. A. Garisto, J.
      C. Bourrut, M. W. Schonbeck, R. Jaye, A. Wurzberger and R.
      DeGregorio, J. Sustain. Agric. 7, 39-61, 1995 and Anonymous,
      Plastics Technol., May, 1998, p. 87). Uncoated paper, although
      inexpensive ($0.28/lb. for kraft paper) (Anonymous, North American
      Pulp and Paper Yearbook, Resource Information Systems,
      Charlottesville, Va., 1996, 95), degrades too rapidly to protect
      most crops adequately (D. F. Anderson, M. A. Garisto, J. C.
      Bourrut, M. W. Schonbeck, R. Jaye, A. Wurzberger and R.
      DeGregorio, J. Sustain. Agric. 7, 39-61, 1995).<br>
      <br>
      Various types of coatings for paper have been developed to slow
      degradation and improve wet strength. Rivise (C. W. Rivise, Paper
      Trade J. 89, 55-57, 1929), Hutchins (A. E. Hutchins, Minn. Agr.
      Expt. Sta. Bull. No. 298, 1933) and Flint (L. H. Flint, U.S. Dept.
      of Agric. Tech. Bull. No. 75, 1928), have reviewed some of the
      early work on the use of paper mulches. In 1870, the first U.S.
      patent pertaining to utilization of paper as a mulch described the
      use of tarred paper to exclude insects from roots (S. Brunson,
      U.S. Pat. No. 104,418, 1870). By the 1920's, chiefly through the
      work of Eckart in Hawaii on sugar cane and pineapple, the dramatic
      advantages of tar or asphalt coated paper for improving yields of
      fruits and vegetable became apparent. Paper impregnated with
      paraffin wax (V. Z. Tzelik, Russ. Pat. 28,223, 1930) and animal or
      vegetable oils ( W. A. Hall, Brit. Pat. 370,482, 1931) were also
      claimed for mulch use. With the advent of synthetic polymers in
      the 1940's and 1950's, polyethylene largely displaced paper in
      mulching applications, likely due to its low cost and excellent
      strength and flexibility.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, however, there has been a resurgence in research and
      practical interest in coated paper mulches, probably due to
      concerns about disposal of polyethylene as well as the desire of
      organic farmers to have a natural, totally degradable mulch. Most
      of the coatings considered have been synthetic polymers such as
      polyethylene (J. W. Courter, University of Illinois Cooperative
      Extension Service Circular No. 1009, Champaign, Ill., 1969 and J.
      Vandenberg and J. Tiessen, Hortscience 7, 464-465, 1972), or
      various polymer latexes (G. E. Shanley and M. J. Lubar, Brit UK

      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We have now discovered that paper treated with a coating
      comprising a cross-linked drying oil or cross-linked, functionally
      modified drying oil exhibits many of the desired properties of a
      biodegradable, water-resistant agricultural mulch needed for
      present day applications. The reactivities of the various drying
      oils permit the development of a broad spectrum of coating systems
      and coating properties. For example, partial or complete
      cross-linking of the drying oil-coated paper may occur in the
      field through either oxidative or photoinitiated processes.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with this discovery, it is an object of the
      invention to provide novel compositions of matter comprising a
      paper substrate coated, and/or impregnated, with a treatment
      comprising a polymerized drying oil.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the invention is to provide an inexpensive,
      biodegradable agricultural mulch that is water-resistant,
      mechanically stable and highly effective as a weed barrier.<br>
      <br>
      It is also an object of the invention to develop a system for
      tailoring the production scheme and functional properties of an
      agricultural mulch to a particular end use application.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages of the invention will be readily
      apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The basic substrate for use in this invention is paper. The term
      "paper" is in its broadest sense refers to any sheet or continuous
      web of intermeshed fibrous material. Typically, these sheets or
      webs are formed by depositing fibers of vegetable, mineral, animal
      or synthetic origin from a fluid suspension into a thin layer, and
      thereafter removing the fluid and drying the resulting sheet or
      web. For purposes of the invention, the fiber should be
      predominantly biodegradable, and is therefore preferably derived
      from a cellulosic raw material, such as wood pulp, kenaf, rag,
      straw, bagasse, recycled paper, etc. The paper may also be treated
      with additives and coatings conventionally used in the
      paper-making industry, provided that these treatments do not
      interfere with the cross-linked drying oil treatments of this
      invention. It is also contemplated that paper pulp can be treated
      with the coating materials described, below, and the treated pulp
      can then be pressed under conditions of heat and pressure into a
      mat. For purposes of economy and performance, a preferred paper
      for use herein is conventional kraft paper.<br>
      <br>
      The biodegradable paper coatings of the invention are defined in
      reference to Formula I: ##STR1## ##STR2##<br>
      <br>
      wherein the exact arrangement of CH2, R@1, R@2 and CH groups
      relative to one another depends on the type of fatty acid and on
      the rearrangement after radical activation or conjugation.<br>
      <br>
      The actual coating that is applied to the paper sheet is: (1) a
      polymer having the structure of Formula I; (2) a combination of
      (a) a drying oil that will polymerize to yield a polymer having
      the structure of Formula I in a polymerization reaction and (b) a
      catalyst to promote said polymerization reaction; or (3) a
      combination of (a) a functionally modified drying oil that will
      polymerize to yield a polymer having the structure of Formula I in
      a polymerization reaction and (b) a catalyst to promote said
      polymerization reaction.<br>
      <br>
      The drying oils contemplated herein include plant, animal,
      synthetic and semi-synthetic glycerides, particularly
      triglycerides, that can be transformed into hard, resinous
      materials (see Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, ed.
      H. F. Monk et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1966, pp. 216-234). The
      expression "drying oils" is generic to both drying oils, which dry
      (harden) at normal atmospheric conditions, and semidrying oils,
      which must be baked at elevated temperatures in order to harden.
      Unless otherwise indicated, "drying oil" will be used herein in
      its broadest sense to refer to both types of drying oil. The
      unsaturated fatty acids of a drying or semidrying oil comprise
      double bonds that are readily available for entering into
      oxidative or other reactions involved in the drying process.
      Common sources of drying oils include castor oil, fish oils,
      linseed oil, oiticica oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, sunflower
      oil, and tung oil. Of course the oils that contain the higher
      levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as soybean oil,
      linseed oil and safflower oil are the most reactive in terms of
      having available sites for cross-linking.<br>
      <br>
      The drying oils may be polymerized (i.e. cross-linked) through a
      variety of mechanisms, linkages, and cross-linkers. For instance,
      the cross-linking may be "intra", that is, between fatty acid
      ester chains on the same triglyceride; or it may be "inter", that
      is, between a fatty acid ester chain of one triglyceride and a
      fatty acid ester chain on another triglyceride. The cross-linking,
      whether intra or inter, may be directly from one methylene group
      to another, or may involve a linker, such as that resulting from
      reaction of an epoxidized oil with a curing agent, such as a
      polyol, a polybasic acid, an amine, a polyamine, a polythiol, or a
      polyphenol. Specific exemplary reagents for this purpose include:<br>
      polyols: ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, propylene glycol,
      and oligomers thereof; as well as hydroxylated oils such as castor
      oil<br>
      polybasic acids: succinic acid, adipic acid, butane
      tetracarboxylic acid, citric acid, succinic anhydride,
      octenylsuccinic anhydride, and phthalic anhydride;<br>
      amines: octylamine, and ethylamine;<br>
      polyamines: ethylene diamine and triethylene tetramine;<br>
      polyphenols: phenol-formaldehyde resin<br>
      <br>
      A preferred curing agent is citric acid, because of its rapid rate
      of reaction with epoxidized oil at relatively low temperatures.
      Another approach to cross-linking is to react the drying oil with
      maleic anhydride and then react the maleated oil with a polyol.
      Also contemplated herein are cross-linked alkyds having a
      structure in accordance with Formula I wherein z.gtoreq.1. Alkyds
      would typically be produced by reacting a polyol with a polybasic
      acid and free fatty acids.<br>
      <br>
      In one preferred embodiment of the invention, the drying oil is
      simply reacted with oxygen to form hydroperoxides which decompose
      to form various free radicals in the presence of a drying
      catalyst; particularly, metal ion catalysts, such as cobalt,
      manganese, copper, chromium, iron and calcium. The radicals then
      combine to form carbon-oxygen or carbon-carbon cross-links.<br>
      <br>
      In another preferred embodiment, the drying oil is first either
      partially or completely epoxidized. The resultant oxirane rings
      are then available for photoinitiated cross-linking. Optionally,
      the epoxidized oil and a catalyst can be coated on the paper, and
      the cross-linking would then take place when the paper is exposed
      to sunlight in the field. Alternatively, the epoxidized oil may be
      reacted with a curing agent to modify the drying oil by addition
      of a linker as described above. When acidic catalysts such as
      quaternary ammonium halides are used as catalysts in the latter
      reaction, the primary reaction product is a polyester containing a
      secondary hydroxyl group .beta. to the carboxyl carbon. Other
      catalysts for effecting polymerization across the oxirane ring are
      well established in the art.<br>
      <br>
      Partial polymerization is easily controlled by regulating the
      temperature of reaction. For example, the reaction can be stopped
      by rapidly lowering the temperature of the mixture, as in ice
      water, prior to applying the partially polymerized oil onto the
      paper. The reaction is then easily completed at a later time, such
      as by passing the treated paper through an oven, or the like.
      Partially reacted epoxidized oils are available for photoinitiated
      cross-linking through the remaining oxirane rings. For the
      partially epoxidized oils, oxidative cross-linking can be promoted
      between remaining sites of unsaturation and reactive functional
      groups introduced by the curing agent. As indicated above, both
      the photoinitiated cross-linking and the oxidative cross-linking
      of the coated paper can be completed in the field.<br>
      <br>
      The drying oil or modified drying oil is applied to the paper by
      any conventional means such as by spraying, wiping, or by passing
      the paper through a bath. The catalyst can be blended with the oil
      or applied to the paper as a separate stage. In order to interrupt
      or completely delay cross-linking until the coated paper is put
      into use, the sheet can be simply wound into a roll in order to
      exclude both oxygen and/or light needed to initiate the remaining
      cross-linking reaction. Of course it is understood that the
      viscosity of the drying oil applied to the paper can be controlled
      by partial cross-linking or by partial polymerization prior to
      applying the oil to the paper. As discussed further below, this
      approach may be desirable when control over impregnation into the
      paper is needed.<br>
      <br>
      The nature of the coating treatment on the paper is a function of
      a number of variables including the porosity of the paper, the
      initial viscosity of the treatment material, the mode and
      application rate of the treatment material, the contact period of
      the paper and treatment before the drying oil becomes completely
      cross-linked, the temperature during the contact period and the
      like. For example, the more porous the paper and the more fluid
      the treatment material, the more of the treatment material that
      will become absorbed by the paper. Likewise, the longer the period
      of contact between the paper and the drying oil before completing
      the cross-linking, the more the drying oil will tend to impregnate
      the paper. Conversely, by increasing the density of the paper or
      the viscosity of the treatment material, or by shortening the
      period of contact before completing the cross-linking, the amount
      of material absorbed by the paper can be reduced. It is envisioned
      that the extent of penetration of the treatment into the paper can
      be controlled over a broad continuum; but that typically some of
      the material will be absorbed, and some of the material will
      ultimately reside as a coating over the one or more of the
      surfaces of the paper. For purposes of this invention, the terms
      "treatment" and "coating" as used herein include material that may
      actually be absorbed into (i.e. penetrate or impregnate) the
      fibrous structure of the paper. Additionally, it is to be
      understood that the treatment may be applied to one or both
      surfaces (i.e. sides) of the paper sheet, and that the treatment
      may comprise non-cross-linked drying oil, or drying oil in various
      stages of cross-linking.<br>
      <br>
      The polymerization reactions contemplated for use herein and
      described above are all well known. Accordingly, determination of
      the appropriate conditions (e.g. time, temperature, and catalyst)
      for conducting a particular reaction would be well within the
      skill of the person in the art. Likewise, tailoring these
      conditions to achieve a particular result in the coating step
      would be within the skill of the ordinary artisan. For most
      applications, the coating weight would be in the range of about
      10-300% (7-200 g/m@2) of the paper for a given area. Usually, the
      level of coating will be in the range of 25-100% (15-65 g/m@2),
      with the preferred amount being in the range of 40-80% (25-55
      g/m@2).<br>
      <br>
      A variety of additives may be included in the coating treatment.
      For example, the optional addition of a darkening or opacifying
      agent such as carbon black, charcoal or dark organic dye to the
      polymerized oil or the paper are commonly used in plastic mulches
      to screen out the sun and thus make it more difficult for plants
      to grow underneath. Also, pigments of other colors may be added to
      help regulate the soil temperature or control the growth response
      of the cultivated plants. Of course, fertilizers, pesticides,
      fungicides, biocontrol agents, biodegradation enhancers and the
      like may optionally be added to the coating.<br>
      <br>
      The coated paper products of this invention have utility as
      agricultural mulches for all the same applications for sheeted
      mulches as known in the art. That is, they can be rolled out in
      orchards, gardens, fields, and potted plants for the purposes of
      retaining soil moisture, increasing soil temperature, inhibiting
      weed growth, and reducing insect damage. At the end of the growing
      season, or whenever the benefit of the mulch is no longer needed,
      the mulch is simply cultivated into the soil and allowed to
      biodegrade. It is apparent from the data in Example 5 that coating
      with vegetable oil resins extends the useful life of paper mulches
      to a length of time close to that required for many crops (about
      10 weeks).<br>
      <br>
      The treated paper of this invention is characterized by at least
      comparable, and in some cases, significantly improved, mechanical
      and functional properties as compared to untreated paper or to
      paper treated with the same amount (comparable add on) of
      nonpolymerized oil. For instance, as shown in the Examples below,
      treated kraft paper exhibits at least a two-fold increase in
      elongation to break vs. untreated paper. In a soil burial test,
      treated samples exhibit at least two-fold, and in some cases
      several-fold, increase in the half life over untreated paper. As a
      barrier to plants, tests described in the Examples show that the
      treated paper reduces penetration by plants up to 80% after 84
      days as compared to the untreated control.<br>
      <br>

      <b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Paper Coated with Polymerized Linseed Oil</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Linseed oil (LO, 120 g) and cobalt octoate solution (0.40 g) were
      magnetically stirred for 10 min. then the mixture was applied to
      pieces of kraft paper (50.8.times.91.4 cm) using a paint brush.
      The oil penetrated quickly into the paper due to its low
      viscosity. The coated paper was hung from a rope and allowed to
      "dry" overnight. Coating weight was approximately 45 g/m@2.<br>
      <br>
      Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)<br>
      <br>
      Samples of paper coated with polymerized linseed oil (LO coated
      paper) were prepared for FTIR analysis were pulverized in liquid
      nitrogen using a Wig-L-Bug Amalgamator, mixed with KBr and pressed
      into pellets. Spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Impact 410
      spectrometer. For LO coated paper, no absorbance corresponding to
      C--H stretching adjacent to carbon-carbon double bonds of LO (3010
      cm@-1, data not shown) was seen, indicating that most of the
      double bonds reacted.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Preparation of Epoxidized Soybean Oil-Based Polyesters</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Epoxidized soybean oil (ESO, 349 g, 1.5 mole epoxy), citric acid
      (CA, 99 g, 1.5 mole carboxyl) and tetrabutylammonium bromide
      (TBABr, 3.2 g) were first partially polymerized by heating in a 3
      l beaker equipped with an air stirrer and hot plate. After the
      temperature of the mixture reached 110 DEG C. (about 10 min.), the
      beaker was placed into a bucket of ice to stop the reaction.
      Pre-polymerization was conducted in order to better disperse the
      CA in the ESO. The partially polymerized ESO resin was then spread
      onto paper sheets using glass rods. The ESO resin penetrated only
      part way into the paper due to its high viscosity. Polymerization
      was completed by placing the coated paper onto steel sheets
      covered with teflon/aluminum foil (Bytac, Norton Performance
      Plastics, Akron, Ohio) and heating in an oven at 165 DEG C. for 3
      min. A similar experiment was conducted without the TBABr catalyst
      to evaluate possible effects of TBABr on biodegradation rates,
      described in Example 3, below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FTIR Analysis</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The ESO/CA coated paper was analyzed by FTIR as described above in
      Example 1 for LO coated paper. The absorbances corresponding to
      citric acid carboxyl carbonyl stretch (1701 cm@-1) and epoxide
      ring vibration (822 cm@-1) disappeared, indicating that
      essentially all ESO and CA reacted. Interestingly, the reaction
      seems to occur with or without the TBABr catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Testing for Biodegradation in Soil</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>Coated papers as well as uncoated paper were cut into
      5.08.times.10.16 cm pieces, weighed and sewn into nylon mesh bags
      having openings about 3 mm in size. Three replicates of each
      sample for each of 4 time points were then buried under 6 in. of
      soil in a field plot [National Center for Agricultural Utilization
      Research (NCAUR), Peoria, Ill.] starting on June 30. During summer
      weeks in which there was no rain, the plot was sprinkled with
      about 1.3 cm. of water. Samples were removed from the ground at
      14, 42, 84 and 140 days. After removal, samples were brushed
      lightly, gently rinsed with deionized water, equilibrated for 7
      days at 23 DEG C. and 50% relative humidity, weighed and tested
      for tensile properties (see below). Average outdoor temperatures
      were about 21 DEG C. over the first 3 months of the experiment and
      then declined gradually to 0 DEG C. over the next 2 months.
      Rainfall was very light the first six weeks (&lt;2 cm/week) and
      then increased.<br>
      <br>
      The results are shown in FIG. 1. The higher initial (at 0 time)
      weight/area values of the coated papers reflect the added weight
      of the coating. Rates of weight loss during soil burial as a
      percentage of initial weight, were most rapid in uncoated paper,
      followed by LO coated paper and finally ESO/CA coated paper. Rates
      of decrease in weight and strength were similar for ESO/CA and
      ESO/CA/TBABr coated papers, suggesting that TBABr does not
      significantly impede biodegradation. Close examination of the
      buried samples show that uncoated paper had torn or disintegrated
      into small pieces by 6 weeks while the coated papers remained
      whole. After 12 weeks, LO coated paper has also disintegrated
      while the ESO/CA coated paper has begun to tear. There were no
      significant changes in the measured thicknesses with time up to 6
      weeks so losses in weight were due to decreases in density and
      focal losses in area. Specimens were examined with a JEOL JSM
      6400V scanning electron microscope. The resulting SEM photographs
      (not shown) revealed that, by 6 weeks, fungal cells and hyphae
      have extensively colonized the surface and interior of uncoated
      paper. Fibrillar breakage and defibrillation are evident. Fungal
      growth was also widespread on the surface of LO coated paper at 6
      weeks but there was little penetration to the interior. The LO
      coating covers and fills the spaces between cellulose fibrils, so
      less surface area is available for microorganism growth. In
      contrast, the surface of ESO/CA coated paper showed only focal
      areas of microbial colonization after 6 weeks, suggesting that the
      ESO based resin may be more resistant to biodegradation than LO.
      It is somewhat surprising that LO coated paper appears to degrade
      faster than ESO/CA coated paper considering that the double bonds
      in LO are polymerized to single C--C or C--O bonds. The latter are
      normally thought to be more resistant to biodegradation than the
      ester linkages found in ESO/CA. However, the greater thickness of
      the ESO/CA coated paper or the greater ratio of resin to paper may
      also influence biodegradation rates.<br>
      <br>
      It is apparent from FTIR spectra of coated papers after exposure
      to soil for 12 weeks (data not shown) that for LO coated paper,
      absorbances from the LO component (2929 and 2856 cm@-1 from C--H
      stretching and 1741 cm@-1 from C=0 stretching) are greatly
      diminished relative to the cellulosic component (1163, 1059, 1034
      cm@-1 from C--O stretching). The ESO/CA coated paper likewise
      showed a smaller preferential loss of the oil component. These
      data suggest that the polymerized oil coatings protect the
      cellulosic fibers from premature microbial attack by acting as a
      sacrificial barrier.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Weed Growth Inhibition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Three pieces of each of the coated papers and control (uncoated
      paper) 50.8.times.91.4 cm in size were placed onto rototilled
      ground in the NCAUR field plot. The outer edges (about 10 cm) of
      the samples were buried in the dirt to keep the samples
      stationary. The number of weeds protruding through openings in the
      samples were recorded over time (FIG. 2).<br>
      <br>
      These data show that weed growth is most rapid for uncoated paper
      followed by LO coated paper then ESO/CA coated paper. This is
      consistent with the degradation data in Example 3. By 6 weeks, the
      uncoated paper had several tears or holes and weed growth through
      the paper began. Most of the uncoated paper on top of the soil
      disappeared (biodegraded and/or blown away) by 9 weeks. Loss of
      strength of uncoated paper during rain may also have contributed
      to its disintegration. In contrast, the coated papers remain
      mostly intact, albeit with some cracks and holes, up to 14 weeks.<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><b>Tensile Testing and Elongation to Break Evaluation</b><br>
      <br>
      Dog-bone type V tensile bars (4-5 for each sample) were cut and
      tested according to ASTM D638-91 using an Instron model 4201
      Universal Testing Machine. Crosshead speed was 20 mm/min and gage
      length was 25.4 mm. Both tensile strength and elongation to break
      were evaluated in the Instron.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 shows that the initial tensile strength of LO coated paper
      (82 MPa) is slightly higher than for uncoated paper (68 MPa).
      Since the LO penetrated into the paper (the overall thickness was
      85 .mu.m for both LO coated paper and uncoated paper), overall
      strength per unit area is higher for LO coated paper since the
      polymerized oil replaces air. Likewise, tensile strengths of the
      ESO/CA and ESO/CA/TBABr coated papers (45 MPa) are lower than the
      uncoated paper because much of the weaker resin did not penetrate
      the paper (thickness 180 .mu.m). Rates of decrease in tensile
      strength with time decreased in the order uncoated paper&gt;LO
      coated paper&gt;ESO/CA coated paper (FIG. 3).<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 4, elongations to break of coated and uncoated
      paper were 3.+-.1% at 0 time. Interestingly, elongation values for
      coated papers increased to 7.+-.1% after 2 weeks of soil exposure
      while those for uncoated paper remained unchanged. The reason for
      this is unknown, but could result from a decrease in fiber
      cohesion from rain or starch binder degradation, such that more of
      the load is transferred to the flexible resin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><br>
      <br>
      Kraft paper samples were coated with polymerized linseed oil as
      described in Example 1 and with epoxidized soybean oil-based
      polyesters as described in Example 2. Physical and functional
      properties of these coated samples were tested as described in
      Examples 3-5 as compared to kraft paper coated with uncross-linked
      soybean oil, linseed oil and paraffin wax. The uncross-linked
      soybean oil at the 39% add on level and the cross-linked soybean
      oil at the 25% add on level were applied to the paper with a paint
      sprayer. Tensile strength and elongation to break were determined
      by the previously-described procedures for both wet and dry
      samples. The results presented in Tables I A and I B show that the
      cross-linked coatings of the invention contribute significantly to
      the tensile strength and elongation to break of the wetted papers.
      The kinetic data for weight loss during soil burial are reported
      in Table II and in FIGS. 5-8. These data demonstrate a significant
      effect of the cross-linked coatings in the prolongation of the
      paper half life. Data regarding the effectiveness of the coated
      papers as plant barriers are shown in FIGS. 9 and 10.<br>
