      <p>In mathematics and physics, a scalar field associates a scalar
        value, which can be either mathematical in definition, or
        physical, to every point in space. Scalar fields are often used
        in physics, for instance to indicate the temperature
        distribution throughout space, or the air pressure. In
        mathematics, or more specifically, differential geometry, the
        set of functions defined on a manifold define the commutative
        ring of functions. </p>
      <p>Just as the concept of a scalar in mathematics is identical to
        the concept of a scalar in physics, so also the scalar field
        defined in differential geometry is identical to, in the
        abstract, to the (unquantized) scalar fields of physics. </p>
      <p><b>Definition</b> </p>
      <p>A scalar field is a function from Rn to R. That is, it is a
        function defined on the n-dimensional Euclidean space with real
        values. Often it is required to be continuous, or one or more
        times differentiable, that is, a function of class Ck. </p>
      <p>The scalar field can be visualized as a n-dimensional space
        with a real or complex number attached to each point in the
        space. </p>
      <p>The derivative of a scalar field results in a vector field
        called the gradient. </p>
      <p><b>Differential geometry</b> </p>
      <p>A scalar field on a Ck-manifold is a Ck function to the real
        numbers. Taking Rn as manifold gives back the special case of
        vector calculus. </p>
      <p>A scalar field is also a 0-form. The set of all scalar fields
        on a manifold forms a commutative ring, under the natural
        operations of multiplication and addition, point by point. </p>
      <p><b>Uses in physics</b> </p>
      <p>In physics, scalar fields can be used to ascribe forces (which
        are usually vector fields) to a more general scalar field, the
        gradient of which describes the force. </p>
      <p>* Potential fields, such as the Newtonian gravitational
        potential field for gravitation, or the electric potential in
        electrostatics, are scalar fields which describes the more
        familiar forces. </p>
      <p>* A temperature, humidity or pressure field, such as those used
        in meteorology. Note that when modeling weather on a global
        basis, the surface of the Earth is not flat, and thus the
        general language of curvature in differential geometry plays a
        role. Dopplerized weather radar generates a projection of a
        vector field onto a scalar field. </p>
      <p><b>Examples in quantum theory and relativity</b> </p>
      <p>* In quantum field theory, a scalar field is associated with
        spin 0 particles, such as mesons or bosons. The scalar field may
        be real or complex valued (depending on whether it will
        associate a real or complex number to every point of
        space-time). Complex scalar fields represent charged particles.
        These include the Higgs field of the Standard Model, as well as
        the pion field mediating the strong nuclear interaction. </p>
      <p>* In the Standard Model of elementary particles, a scalar field
        is used to give the leptons their mass, via a combination of the
        Yukawa interaction and the spontaneous symmetry breaking. This
        mechanism is known as the Higgs mechanism [1]. This supposes the
        existence of a (still hypothetical) spin 0 particle called Higgs
        boson. </p>
      <p>* In scalar theories of gravitation scalar fields are used to
        describe the gravitational field. </p>
      <p>* scalar-tensor theories represent the gravitational
        interaction through both a tensor and a scalar. Such attempts
        are for example the Jordan theory [2] as a generalization of the
        Kaluza-Klein theory and the Brans-Dicke theory [3]. </p>
      <p>* Scalar fields like the Higgs field can be found within
        scalar-tensor theories, using as scalar field the Higgs field of
        the Standard Model [4], [5]. This field interacts gravitatively
        and Yukawa-like (short-ranged) with the particles that get mass
        through it [6]. </p>
      <p>* Scalar fields are found within superstring theories as
        dilaton fields, breaking the conformal symmetry of the string,
        though balancing the quantum anomalies of this tensor [7]. </p>
      <p>* Scalar fields are supposed to cause the accelerated expansion
        of the universe (inflation [8]), helping to solve the horizon
        problem and giving an hypothetical reason for the non-vanishing
        cosmological constant of cosmology. Massless (i.e. long-ranged)
        scalar fields in this context are known are inflatons. Massive
        (i.e. short-ranged) scalar fields are proposed, too, using for
        example Higgs-like fields (e.g. [9]). </p>
      <p><b>Other kinds of fields</b> </p>
      <p>* Vector fields, which associate a vector to every point in
        space. Some examples of vector fields include the
        electromagnetic field and the Newtonian gravitational field. </p>
      <p>* Tensor fields, which associate a tensor to every point in
        space. For example, in general relativity gravitation is
        associated with a tensor field (in particular, with the Riemann
        curvature tensor). In Kaluza-Klein theory, spacetime is extended
        to five dimensions and its Riemann curvature tensor can be
        separated out into ordinary four-dimensional gravitation plus an
        extra set, which is equivalent to Maxwell's equations for the
        electromagnetic field, plus an extra scalar field known as the
        "dilaton". </p>

      <p>In theoretical physics, scalar field theory can refer to a
        classical or quantum theory of scalar fields. Such a field is
        distinguished by its invariance under a Lorentz transformation,
        hence the name "scalar", in contrast to a vector or tensor
        field. The quanta of the quantized scalar field are spin-zero
        particles, and as such are bosons. </p>
      <p>No fundamental scalar fields have been observed in nature,
        though the Higgs boson may yet prove the first example. However,
        scalar fields certainly do appear in the effective field theory
        descriptions of many physical phenomena. Because of the relative
        simplicity of the mathematics involved, scalar fields are often
        the first field introduced to a student of classical or quantum
        field theory. </p>
      <p>Although scalar fields are Lorentz scalars, they may transform
        nontrivially under other symmetries, such as flavour or isospin.
        For example, the pion is invariant under the restricted Lorentz
        group, but is an isospin triplet (meaning it transforms like a
        three component vector under the SU(2) isospin symmetry).
        Furthermore, it picks up a negative phase under parity
        inversion, so it transforms nontrivially under the full Lorentz
        group; such particles are called pseudoscalar rather than
        scalar. Most mesons are pseudoscalar particles. </p>
      <p>In this article, the repeated index notation indicates the
        Einstein summation convention for summation over repeated
        indices. The theories described are defined in flat,
        D-dimensional Minkowski space, with (D-1) spatial dimension and
        one time dimension and are, by construction, relativistically
        covariant. The Minkowski space metric, has a particularly simple
        form: it is diagonal, and here we use the + ? ? ? sign
        convention. </p>

        field theory of spinless particles, see "Scalar field theory" </p>
      <p>Scalar field theory (SFT) is a set of theories in a model which
        posits that there is a basic mechanism that produces the
        electric field and the magnetic field. Proponents of this theory
        claim that it advances the standard electromagnetic theory. </p>
      <p>Scalar waves in these theories (as opposed to a scalar field in
        mainstream physics) are hypothetical waves, which differ from
        the conventional electromagnetic transverse waves by having one
        oscillation level parallel to the direction of propagation; they
        thus have characteristics of longitudinal waves. Their existence
        however, as presupposed in numerous theories, has not been
        supported by experiment. Scalar waves are called also
        "electromagnetic longitudinal waves", "Maxwellian waves", or
        "Teslawellen" (tr., "Tesla waves"). Variants of the theory claim
        that Scalar electromagnetics (also known as scalar energy) is
        the background quantum mechanical fluctuations and associated
        zero-point energies (in contrast to "vector energies" which sum
        to zero).[citation needed] </p>
      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>Terminology</b> </p>
      <p>The basic understanding of scalar field theory begins with
        several definition of terms within the theory, which are also
        used in academic physics, but assigns them other meanings. A
        "scalar field" is a set of assigned observable magnitudes at
        every point in n-dimensional space (compare this with the
        standard definition; n is also 4 or greater). [1] An "electric
        field" is composed of the spinning charged mass, in motion
        through a finite change in electrostatic scalar potential
        (compare this with the current academic definition). A
        "potential" is pure energy and, is any ordering (static or
        dynamic) in the vacuum (eg., the position of the object relative
        to other objects). A "scalar potential" is the stationary
        ordering in the virtual particle flux of the vacuum (compare
        this with the current academic definition). A "vector potential"
        is any nonstationary ordering in the virtual particle flux of
        vacuum (compare this with the current academic definition).
        Scalar potentials and vector potentials are thus defined as:
        "contained" inside the energy domain.[citation needed] </p>
      <p><b>Magnetic fields interaction</b> </p>
      <p>SFT is based on "non-symmetrical regauging" potentials,
        demonstrated by the interaction of two magnetic fields. </p>
      <p>When the field lines oppose each other, the magnets are pulled
        together. When the fields are aligned in the same direction, the
        magnets push apart. When two magnets strongly oppose each other
        but are not permitted to move apart, the force between them is
        said to create a "scalar bubble" between the magnets. The
        greater the repulsive force, the larger this scalar bubble
        becomes. As the magnets move away and the pushing force
        decreases, the scalar bubble shrinks in size and strength. </p>
      <p>In a similar manner, two magnets that are strongly attracted
        create a "scalar void" between them that grows larger the closer
        the two magnets become. Two magnets powerfully attracted to one
        another create a very large scalar void, that decreases as the
        attracting magnets are moved apart. </p>
      <p>Despite the claims of its proponents, no repeatable experiments
        were able to show the existence of the scalar field. All
        observed effects were shown to comply to the standard physical
        laws of electrodynamics. The observations are in spectacular
        agreement not only with classical electromagnetics, but also
        with quantum electrodynamics, both of which are fields of
        physics. </p>
      <p><b>Field effects of scalar energy</b> </p>
      <p>SFT suggests that scalar energy can move through space much
        like an electromagnetic wave. However, the operating principles
        are different. The regular expansion and contraction of a scalar
        bubble/void is like rhythmicly splashing water on a pond. It
        sends out ripples through the general scalar field that can
        subtly affect the size and strength of distant scalar
        bubbles/voids. </p>
      <p>This means that a pair of magnets that are rhythmically
        opposing/attracting each other are sending out scalar ripples
        through space that will slightly perturb the scalar bubble/void
        between a second pair magnets nearby. The net effect is that the
        attraction and/or repulsion between the second pair of magnets
        exhibits a change in strength, even though the magnets and
        fields themselves are motionless. </p>
      <p>According to skeptics, the following description given for an
        application to a communication system reportedly failed to give
        reproduceable results. </p>
      <p><b>A basic scalar communications system</b> </p>
      <p>A scalar communications broadcast antenna does not make any
        sense according to normal electromagnetic theory. The goal of a
        scalar broadcast antenna is to create powerful
        repulsion/attraction between two magnetic fields, to create
        large scalar bubbles/voids. This is done by using a broadcast
        antenna with two opposing electromagnetic coils that effectively
        cancel out as much of each other's magnetic field as possible.
        An ideal scalar broadcast antenna will emit no electromagnetic
        field (or as little as possible), since all power is being
        focused into the repulsion/attraction between the two opposing
        magnetic fields. Normal electromagnetic theory suggests that
        since such a device emits no measurable electromagnetic field,
        it is useless and will only heat up. For a scalar broadcast
        antenna, any normal RF emission is wasted energy. </p>
      <p>A scalar reception antenna similarly excludes normal
        electromagnetic waves and only measures changes in magnetic
        field attraction and repulsion. This will typically be a
        two-coil powered antenna that sets up a static opposing or
        attracting magnetic field between the coils. The coils are
        counter-wound so that any normal RF signal will be picked up by
        both coils simultaneously and effectively cancel itself out,
        leaving only the scalar component. </p>
      <p><b>Scalar field detection by normal RF antennas</b> </p>
      <p>Even though a scalar wave train does not contain the regular EM
        components that are used by radio frequency communications, it
        can still be detected by a normal RF antenna, if that antenna is
        in the presence of some other static magnetic field. When the
        scalar wave train passes through, it will create a disturbance
        in the field surrounding that magnet and make the field lines
        move, which will impart a small electrical current in the
        standard RF antenna, as if the magnet itself were moved. </p>
      <p>Since all normal RF antennas are immersed in the magnetic field
        of the planet, they can serve as crude scalar detectors, though
        the reception will be extremely weak and washed out by any
        normal RF in the vicinity. Detection ability is greatly
        increased by enclosing the antenna and circuitry in a faraday
        cage, and by placing a very strong magnet near the antenna
        inside the cage. </p>
      <p><b>Scalar antennas and detectors</b> </p>
      <p>Various proponents have claimed to have developed instruments
        with characteristics and specifications for different designs.
        Scalar antenna and detector examples include: </p>

      <p><i>Absolutely Bizarre 'Creature' In Benjamin Fulford's Spine</i>
      </p>
      <p>On Friday, January 23rd, Benjamin Fulford shocked the audience
        of the Jeff Rense Program by emailing the claim, accompanied by
        a photograph, that surgeons had removed a bizarre life form,
        very much resembling a salamander, from his spine. Those who
        could view the strange creature were shocked and horrified.
        Immediately, everyone who saw the "thing" wondered what it
        was--and if it were real. </p>
      <p>Whether the creature was real or whether it was an ill-advised
        hoax, I wanted to find out if it was possible to place or to
        inject such a life form into an unsuspecting victim. One of the
        experts that I queried was a top-research scientist and
        inventor, who quickly responded that not only was it possible to
        inject the embryo of a parasite into a targeted victim without
        his or her knowledge, but that in the world of deep black
        operations, Russian scientists had already perfected such
        grotesque methodology. </p>
      <p>I asked the scientist to come on the Rense Program and discuss
        the science of bioenergetics being developed for Black Ops
        projects, but he informed me that he had been placed under "very
        strict warnings" not to make any appearances on any radio or
        television program. What he did do was to write a very
        informative email on the incredible world of bioenergetics and
        psychoenergetics which I reproduce below with his special
        permission. At the present time, he prefers to remain anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>Yes, Brad, the "embryo" for such a "new living parasite
        critter" could indeed be developed and inserted into a targeted
        victim, including at a great distance, but only by the highly
        "clandestine" world of the off-budget deep black operations --
        particularly those in Russia, which are still far ahead of
        anything in the West. </p>
      <p>The Russian science of "energetics" -- developed shortly after
        WW II by a tremendously massive Soviet effort of some of the
        best nonlinear scientists on earth -- did solve some of the
        perplexities of our modern physics, of psychology and biology,
        etc. And under Stalin's iron boot, the new and spectacular
        Russian scientific developments were immediately placed into
        extended weapons development. </p>
      <p>To this day, our own more-materialistic scientists still do not
        really comprehend Soviet energetics. (And they also still do not
        even know what a mind actually is, what a "dead" (separated)
        mind is, or what a "mind and body linked living system" really
        is). </p>
      <p>Soviet energetics had three branches: (1) the science of inert
        matter, called by the same name "energetics". (2) the science of
        living biological systems, where a mind is linked to a living
        body. This branch is called "bioenergetics". (3) the science of
        the mind and mental phenomena, which is called
        "psychoenergetics". </p>
      <p>Western science, being so materialistic, has not yet
        comprehended the most important thing about "mind": that is,
        that the mind and mental things exist in time, but not in
        3-space. </p>
      <p>If one turns to modern quantum field theory, then there are now
        FOUR photons available, not the two transverse photons so well
        known to classical electrodynamicists etc. In the following
        discussion, the travel direction of the photon in 3-space is
        assumed along the Z axis. The "regions of vibration" of the
        photon -- i.e., the type and direction of its oscillation -- may
        occur in four ways. These are (1, 2) the two "orthogonal"
        oscillation polarizations, one along the X-axis and the other
        along the Y-axis. Then there is (3) the longitudinal (i.e.,
        longitudinally-polarized) photon, which oscillates along the
        Z-direction of travel itself. And finally there is (4) the
        time-polarized or "scalar" photon, which oscillates along the
        time axis. These four photons are all in standard quantum field
        theory, even in the West. </p>
      <p>Now note that only the two transverse-polarized photons (1) and
        (2) are observable by our instruments. The longitudinal (3)
        photon is nonobservable, as is the time-polarized (4) photon. </p>
      <p>Here's the first "magic": </p>
      <p>A combination of a longitudinal photon (3) and a time-polarized
        photon (4) is OBSERVABLE AS A SPIKE OF VOLTAGE -- more
        precisely, a spike of electrostatic scalar potential. </p>
      <p>Now suppose you have a hidden (nonobservable) electromagnetic
        "system" you have built in the time-domain, so that it is built
        only of time-polarized photons. The system is not observable,
        nor is any part of it observable. </p>
      <p>But then suppose you also build a corresponding set of
        operations (a "system") in 3-space matter so that this new EM
        system consists only of longitudinal photons. And suppose you
        have made this "longitudinal" photon system's operations so that
        they exactly parallel the time-domain system's operations. In
        short, you now can superpose your longitudinally-polarized EM
        wave system and the time-polarized EM wave system. And your
        instruments will now observe the combination -- i.e., the actual
        ongoing linkage system's operation -- as a very strange but
        highly organized system of voltage spikes! </p>
      <p>The West has totally missed the fundamental characteristic of
        mind: Mind occupies time but not 3-space. Hence, mind is a
        totally "electromagnetic" system, but it is comprised of only
        non-observable time-polarized photon operations! </p>
      <p>Well, how could you possibly couple that mind to a biological
        (3-space) material body? </p>
      <p>You would have to have a parallel longitudinally-polarized set
        of electromagnetic operations ongoing in that 3-space body. </p>
      <p>And the direct coupling of those two "operational systems"
        would be the mechanism of the coupling of the mind to the body
        -- and it would and could be directly observed by our
        instruments as a correlated system of voltage spikes! </p>
      <p>And that is why the dendrite cells of the body all have so many
        endings and "continual and incredible voltage spikings"! In
        looking at the entire set of spiking, you are looking at the
        "coupling mechanism" (that couples the mind to the body) in
        action! That set of spikings is what links or couples
        (coherently) the living temporal mind to the living biological
        body! </p>
      <p>Now if you place great scientific effort on that area and in
        that fashion, for some decades, you will eventually be able to
        (1) directly produce an operating living mind in the laboratory,
        including a human mind and any version of it, and (2) link it to
        a properly designed biological body (to a proper set of
        longitudinal operations therein), and this will give you a
        living biological system created directly in the laboratory. </p>
      <p>In about 1990, the Russian hidden psychoenergetics science had
        progressed to the point that living minds were being designed
        and produced in the laboratory, including various "versions"
        (personalities) of a given mind. </p>
      <p>If one knows where to look, there is and has been quite a bit
        of external "testing" by the Soviets to stimulate the West and
        see if we recognize what is being done (in short, to see whether
        the West also has developed such science). Sadly, the
        provocative tests have clearly shown the Soviets that we do not
        have such capabilities or such scientific development. Indeed,
        we still do not even recognize that "testing" is even going on!
      </p>
      <p>One of the New Energy scientists -- Tom Bearden -- stumbled
        onto a portion of this Soviet energetic work. In his 2005 book,
        Oblivion: America at the Brink, Bearden gave an abbreviated
        presentation of the development of the energetics weaponry and
        some of the actual "evocative testing" examples. There are many
        more weapons and examples that he did not run across. </p>
      <p>Presently, the Russians can clandestinely duplicate the mind of
        a targeted individual, in the duplicate mind they can "alter"
        portions to produce "different behavior" if that alternate mind
        is inserted into the targeted individual in the West, and then
        they can do several things. (1) they can just leave it in that
        individual as an extra "multiple personality," so they have the
        'perfect spy" that hears everything the person's ears hear, sees
        everything his eyes see, and also receives all the thoughts that
        his true mind thinks. And they can put that on the TV screen in
        Moscow if they wish. With the portion for which he actually
        encountered evidence, Bearden gave examples of the military use
        of such capabilities in Oblivion. </p>
      <p>Sadly, the West still thinks that the human "mind" is just some
        electron wiggles in the brain, and that we are like a giant
        "nonliving" computer. </p>
      <p>There is also a way to directly engineer any physical
        observable system one wishes, in any part of it, living or
        nonliving. One can directly engineer and change inert matter or
        living matter, etc. I have learned that Bearden plans a future
        book (hopefully this year) dealing with this scientific
        methodology, which he calls "precursor engineering", but which
        the Soviets still have embedded in its term "energetics" with
        its associate science (and weapons). </p>
      <p>Once you understand something about this 3-fold secret weapons
        science of energetics that the Soviets have highly developed,
        then you can understand how -- with such developed technology --
        one could directly build both the physical body system (its
        correlated longitudinal EM photon system) and the "mind system"
        of such a "living critter" one creates in the laboratory, and
        how one could then use such capability (such weird and
        artificially-created critters) by sudden surprise on an
        unsuspecting enemy to overwhelm and crush him almost instantly.
      </p>
      <p>As you can see, we are referring to a gigantic leap forward in
        what the West calls "biological weapons" and in "biological
        warfare". </p>
      <p>Well, one should be looking for "very strange incidents"
        suggesting the development of such "critters" and parasites. And
        here is at least one "candidate" occurrence. </p>
      <p>This present "incredible tumor" discovery [ in Benjamin
        Fulford's spin] may be the discovery of one "provocative test"
        of these capabilities, just to see what our western science and
        biological warfare experts make of it. </p>
      <p>And if it is a "provocative test" to see what we know, of if we
        know anything of it at all, we have certainly once again assured
        them we have not the foggiest notion of the true reach of Soviet
        energetics science. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; The present invention relates to a
        method of predicting where the next major earth- quake will
        occur within a area based on knowledge of the stress tensor
        field in the area, including determining stress tensors that
        have caused a shear slip in the form of an earthquake. It is
        first assumed that said first shear slip is the only one that is
        not stable according the Mohr-Coulomb slip criterion applied to
        contenplated fault planes with all conceivable orientations and
        calculating according to the Mohr- Coulomb slip criterion the
        principal stress directions as a function of the friction
        coefficient f. After that, it is established according to the
        Mohr-Coulomb slip criterion a relationship between two of the
        principal stresses.; Moreover the normal stress sv in a known
        direction Sv is determined and, according to the elasticity
        theory, a relationship between the normal stress sv and the
        principal stresses is established. Then expressions of the three
        principal stresses as a function of a scalar parameter is
        established, and a function of the elastic deformation energy
        per unit of volume relative to an isotropic reference stress
        state with the pressure sv based on the expressions of the
        principal stresses is established. Finally, the remaining degree
        of freedom is eliminated by determining the value of said scalar
        parameter which minimises the function of the elastic
        deformation energy and the value of the scalar parameter in the
        expressions of the principal stresses is inserted. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> --&nbsp; A vectorial magnetometer (1), measures
        the components of a magnetic field in three directions (Oxyz)
        using a scalar magnetometer (2). The field is periodically

        which have a specific frequency for each direction and that
        power coils (Ex, Ey, Ez). Synchronous demodulation of the of the

        can carry out a double demodulation for phase and quadrature for
        each of the frequencies and processing means (70) that use the

        magnetometer (10,14,16,21,24,26,30,40,46,56). This magnetometer
        provides an output signal corresponding to the modulus of the
        applied magnetic field. There are also at least two conducting
        coils (Ex,Ey,Ez) disposed around the scalar magnetometer with
        mutually orthogonal axes. Each coil is supplied with a current
        at a given frequency. Processing circuits (Dx,Dy,Dz) receive the
        signal produced by the magnetometer and effect synchronous
        demodulation of the signal at the respective frequencies, to
        provide signals (Bx,By,Bz) corresponding to the components of
        the magnetic field which exists in this region. </p>

        <b>Abstract</b> -- PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To extract flow of each
        conduit from a conduit picture to generate a two-dimensional
        scalar field. SOLUTION: Conduits are extracted from the conduit
        picture one by one (S2), and representative points and values of
        flow are defined for each conduit, and respective values of flow
        are registered in positions corresponding to these
        representative points in a separately prepared two-dimensional
        area, and values of flow in other positions of the
        two-dimensional area are interpolated based on registered values
        of flow and their positions (S5), thus generating a
        two-dimensional scalar field. </p>

        properties of the electromagneticpotentials in the quantum
        domain. We shall show that, contrary to theconclusions of
        classical mechanics, there exists effects of potentials
        oncharged particles, even in the region where all the fields
        (and therefore theforces on the particles) vanish. We shall then
        discuss possible experiments totest these conclusions; and,
        finally, we shall suggest further possibledevelopments in the
        interpretation of the potentials. </p>

        <i>Abstract:</i> The expressions of the electric and magnetic
        fields, that can be derived from the Li'enard-Wiechert
        potentials, are in good agreement with experiments. Surprisingly
        the Li'enard-Wiechert potentials do not satisfy the Lorenz gauge
        condition, therefore they cannot be regarded as solutions of the
        Maxwell equations in the Lorenz gauge, but only as solutions of
        the inhomogeneous potential wave equations. Therefore, the
        inhomogeneous potential wave equations should be regarded as a
        separate set of differential equation that are unconnected with
        Maxwell's equations. In order to simplify this theory of
        classical electrodynamics we propose a generalization of
        Maxwell's equations, such that a gauge of the potentials is
        unnecessary in order to derive the Lorenz inhomogeneous
        potential wave equations. This generalization can be described
        as a conditional current regauge that does not violate the
        conservation of charge. This has several consequences: - the
        generalized Maxwell equations also contain scalar field terms. -
        the prediction of a longitudinal electro-scalar wave (LES wave)
        in vacuum. - a generalized Lorentz force expression that
        contains an extra scalar term. - generalized energy and momentum
        theorems, with an extra power flow term associated with LES
        waves. </p>
