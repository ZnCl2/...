      </center>
      <p>Superatoms are clusters of atoms that seem to exhibit some of
        the properties of elemental atoms. </p>
      <p>Sodium atoms, when cooled from vapor, naturally condense into
        clusters, more so into clusters of 2, 8, 20, 40, 58 or 82 atoms
        (the magic numbers), than into the other numbers. The first two
        of these can be recognized as the numbers of electrons needed to
        fill s and p orbitals, respectively. The superatom suggestion is
        that free electrons in the cluster occupy a new set of orbitals
        that are defined by the entire group of atoms, i.e. cluster,
        rather than each individual atom separately (non-spherical or
        doped clusters show deviations in the number of electrons that
        form a closed shell as the potential is defined by the shape of
        the positive nuclei.) Superatoms tend to behave chemically in a
        way that will allow them to have a closed shell of electrons, in
        this new counting scheme. Therefore, a superatom with one more
        electron than a full shell should give up that electron very
        easily, similar to an alkali metal, and a cluster with one
        electron short of full shell should have a large electron
        affinity, such as a halogen. </p>
      <p><b>Aluminium clusters</b> </p>
      <p>Certain aluminium clusters have superatom properties. These
        aluminium clusters are generated as anions (Aln- with n =
        1,2,3...) in helium gas and reacted with a gas containing
        iodine. When analyzed by mass spectrometry one main reaction
        product turns out to be Al13I-.[1] These clusters of 13
        aluminium atoms with an extra electron added do not appear to
        react with oxygen when it is introduced in the same gas stream.
        Assuming each atom liberates its 3 valence electrons, this means
        that there are 40 electrons present, which is one of the magic
        numbers noted above for sodium, and implies that these numbers
        are a reflection of the noble gases. Calculations show that the
        additional electron is located in the aluminium cluster at the
        location directly opposite from the iodine atom. The cluster
        must therefore have a higher electron affinity for the electron
        than iodine and therefore the aluminium cluster is called a
        superhalogen. The cluster component in Al13I- ion is similar to
        an iodine ion or better still a bromine atom. The related
        Al13I2- cluster is expected to behave chemically like the
        triiodide ion. </p>
      <p>Similarly it has been noted that Al14 clusters with 42
        electrons (2 more than the magic numbers) appear to exhibit the
        properties of an alkaline earth metal which typically adopt +2
        valence states. This is only known to occur when there are at
        least 3 iodine atoms attached to an Al14- cluster, Al14I3-. The
        anionic cluster has a total of 43 itinerant electrons, but the
        three Iodine atoms each remove one of the itinerant electrons to
        leave 40 electrons in the jellium shell.[2][3] </p>
      <p>It is particularly easy and reliable to study atomic clusters
        of inert gas atoms by computer simulation because interaction
        between two atoms can be approximated very well by the
        Lennard-Jones potential. Other methods are readily available and
        it has been established that the magic numbers are 13, 19, 23,
        26, 29, 32, 34, 43, 46, 49, 55, etc. [I. A. Harris et al. Phys.
        Rev. Lett. Vol. 53, 2390-94 (1984).] </p>

        Abstract </p>
      <p>The physical and chemical properties of cluster systems at the
        subnano and nanoscale are often found to differ from those of
        the bulk and display a unique dependence on size, geometry, and
        composition. Indeed, most interesting are systems which have
        properties that vary discontinuously with the number of atoms
        and composition, rather than scale linearly with size. This
        realm of cluster science where “one atom makes a difference” is
        undergoing an explosive growth in activity, and as a result of
        extensive collaborative activities through theory at VCU and
        experiment at PSU, our groups are recognized as pioneers in this
        area in which we have been active for many years. Herein we
        provide an overview of the field with primary focus on our joint
        undertakings which have spawned the superatom concept, giving
        rise to a 3-D periodic table of cluster elements and the
        prospect of using these as building blocks of new nanoscale
        materials with tailored properties. </p>

      <p>Two classes of gas-phase aluminum-iodine clusters have been
        identified whose stability and reactivity can be understood in
        terms of the spherical shell jellium model. Experimental
        reactivity studies show that the Al13I –x clusters exhibit
        pronounced stability for even numbers of I atoms. Theoretical
        investigations reveal that the enhanced stability is associated
        with complementary pairs of I atoms occupying the on-top sites
        on the opposing Al atoms of the Al13– core. We also report the
        existence of another series, Al14I –x, that exhibits stability
        for odd numbers of I atoms. This series can be described as
        consisting of an Al14I –3 core upon which the I atoms occupy
        on-top locations around the Al atoms. The potential synthetic
        utility of superatom chemistry built upon these motifs is
        addressed. </p>

        corresponding to M@Si16 (M = Sc, Ti, and V). Mass spectrometry
        and anion photoelectron spectroscopy show that the cluster
        features an electronically closed TiSi16 neutral core which
        undergoes a change in the number of valence electrons involving
        (i) substitution of neighboring metals with Sc and V, or (ii)
        addition of a halogen atom to the TiSi16 anion, and that VSi16F
        is predicted to form an ionically bound superatom complex. ... </p>

      <p>A research team has discovered clusters of aluminum atoms that
        have chemical properties similar to single atoms of metallic and
        nonmetallic elements when they react with iodine. The discovery
        opens the door to using ’superatom chemistry’ based on a new
        periodic table of cluster elements to create unique compounds
        with distinctive properties never seen before. The results of
        the research, headed jointly by Shiv N. Khanna, professor of
        physics at Virginia Commonwealth University and A. Welford
        Castleman Jr., the Evan Pugh Professor of Chemistry and Physics
        and the Eberly Family Distinguished Chair in Science at Penn
        State University, will be reported in the 14 January 2005 issue
        of the journal Science. </p>
      <p>"Depending on the number of aluminum atoms in the cluster, we
        have demonstrated ’superatoms’ exhibiting the properties of
        either halogens or alkaline earth metals," says Castleman. "This
        result suggests the intriguing potential of this chemistry in
        nanoscale synthesis." The discovery could have practical
        applications in the fields of medicine, food production and
        photography. </p>
      <p>The researchers examined the chemical properties, electronic
        structure, and geometry of aluminum clusters both theoretically
        and experimentally in chemical compounds with iodine atoms. They
        found that a cluster of 13 aluminum atoms behaves like a single
        iodine atom, while a cluster of 14 aluminum atoms behaves like
        an alkaline earth atom. "The discovery of these new iodine
        compounds, which include aluminum clusters, is critical because
        it reveals a new form of ’superatom’ chemistry," said Khanna.
        "In the future, we may apply this chemistry, building on our
        previous knowledge, to create new materials for energy
        applications and even medical devices." <br>
        To make their discovery, the research team replaced iodine atoms
        with the aluminum clusters in naturally occurring chains or
        networks of iodine atoms and molecules known as polyiodides.
        When the researchers substituted the iodine atom with the
        aluminum cluster, Al13, they observed that the entire chemistry
        of the compound changed--causing the other iodine molecules to
        break apart and bind individually to the cluster. The
        researchers then were able to bind 12 iodine atoms to a single
        Al13 cluster, forming a completely new class of polyiodides.
        "Our production of such a species is a stirring development that
        may lead to new compounds with a completely new class of
        chemistry and applications," says Castleman. "Along with the
        discovery that Al14 clusters appear to behave similarly to
        alkaline earth atoms when combined with iodine, these new
        results give further evidence that we are really on our way to
        the development of a periodic table of the ’cluster elements’."
      </p>
      <p>The researchers conducted experimental reactivity studies that
        indicate that certain aluminum-cluster superatoms are highly
        stable by nature. The team’s related theoretical investigations
        reveal that the enhanced stability of these superatoms is
        associated with a balance in their atomic and electronic states.
        While the clusters resemble atoms of other elements in their
        interactions, their chemistry is unique, creating stable
        compounds with bonds that are not identical to those of single
        atoms. </p>
      <p>Using stable clusters provides a possible route to an adaptive
        chemistry that introduces the aluminum-cluster species into
        nanoscale materials, tailoring them to create desirable
        properties. "The flexibility of an Al13 cluster to act as an
        iodine atom shows that superatoms can have synthetic utility,
        providing an unexplored ’third dimension’ to the traditional
        periodic table of elements," said Khanna. "Applications using
        Al13 clusters instead of iodine in polymers may lead to the
        development of improved conducting materials. Assembling Al13I
        units may provide aluminum materials that will not oxidize, and
        may help overcome a major problem in fuels that burn aluminum
        particles." </p>
      <p>The theoretical investigations for this project were conducted
        by Khanna with N.O. Jones, a graduate student in the physics
        department at Virginia Commonwealth University, and the
        experimental work was conducted by Castleman with Denis Bergeron
        and Patrick J. Roach, graduate students in the chemistry
        department at Penn State. </p>

        <p><i>The Transformative Power of the nano-clustered Superatom
            generates a new form of Chemistry with super-catalytic
            effects and implications for metal colloidals.</i></p>
      </center>
      <p>LET'S hear it for Dmitri Mendeleev. His periodic table has done
        a remarkable job of making sense of the elements, arranging them
        neatly into families whose members share similar properties. For
        more than a century it has been chemists' guiding light. But
        Mendeleev's classic layout is starting to prove inadequate at
        describing the unexpected ways in which chemical elements behave
        when divvied up into small chunks. And now some chemists think
        it may be time to build a whole new table, this time from
        something much stranger than atoms: superatoms. </p>
      <p>According to Mendeleev's roll call, an element's chemistry can
        be deduced from where it sits in the periodic table. Reactive
        metals like sodium and calcium occupy the two columns on the
        left. The inert "noble" gases make up the column on the far
        right, flanked by typical non-metals such as chlorine and
        sulphur. </p>
      <p>Now this neat picture is being disrupted by superatoms -
        clusters of atoms of a particular chemical element that can take
        on the properties of entirely different elements. The chemical
        behaviour can be altered, sometimes drastically, by the addition
        of just one extra atom. "We can take one element and have it
        mimic several different elements in the periodic table," says
        Welford Castleman, an inorganic chemist at Pennsylvania State
        University who has studied the chemistry of aluminium
        superatoms. </p>
      <p>It is a finding that is challenging our entire understanding of
        chemical reactivity. Adding superatoms to the periodic table
        would transform it from a flatland to a three-dimensional
        landscape in which each element is drawn out into a series of
        super-elements. Superatoms could have practical uses too: they
        could be combined into super-molecules to make new materials.
        And their unusual chemistry could be harnessed to make efficient
        fuels. </p>
      <p>According to conventional thinking, the chemical properties of
        an atom depend on the way the electrons orbiting its nucleus are
        arranged in a series of shells. This in turn is determined by
        the number of electrons it possesses - just one in the case of
        hydrogen, for example, but up to 92 for an atom of the heavy
        metal uranium. The structure of the periodic table is explained
        by the gradual filling of the shells. Atoms with completely
        filled shells - the noble gases, such as helium, argon and xenon
        - are particularly unreactive. The most reactive elements are
        often those with atoms that are just one electron short of a
        filled shell and so occupy the column next to the noble gases in
        the periodic table, or those with one electron too many, which
        make up the left-most column of the table. </p>
      <p>This simple picture was thrown into disarray in the early
        1980s, when evidence started appearing that clusters of atoms of
        one element could behave like another. Thomas Upton at the
        California Institute of Technology in Pasadena discovered that
        clusters of six aluminium atoms could catalyse the splitting of
        hydrogen molecules in much the same way as ruthenium, a metal
        used as a catalyst in the chemical industry. This quickly led to
        thoughts of extending the periodic table. "Some of us started
        giving talks with Mendeleev in the title," recalls Robert
        Whetten, a cluster chemist at the Georgia Institute of
        Technology in Atlanta. </p>
      <p>What was so special about these six-atom clusters? Research
        carried out around the same time by Walter Knight and his
        colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, on another
        type of cluster started to provide some clues. Knight's team was
        working with a cool gas of sodium atoms and noticed clusters of
        atoms condensing out of the gas, rather like water droplets in a
        steamy room. Close inspection led to an unexpected discovery:
        rather than being made up of random numbers of atoms, the
        clusters mostly contained 8, 20, 40, 58 or 92 atoms. But why
        these numbers over others? </p>
      <p><b>Atomic alter ego</b> </p>
      <p>Knight and his colleagues suspected it was down to the
        arrangement of electrons in the clusters. In a large lump of any
        metal, including sodium, some of each atom's electrons are free
        to move through the solid lattice. That's why metals conduct
        electricity. But Knight suspected that if these electrons are
        confined to a small number of atoms they might behave
        differently. To find out more, he borrowed a model used in
        nuclear physics and applied it to the cluster of atoms. Known as
        the "jellium" model, it treats the cluster of atoms as though
        they were a blob of jelly. Inside the blob, one electron from
        each sodium atom becomes free to roam through the blob. </p>
      <p>According to Knight's calculations, the electrons in the blob
        arrange themselves in shells, just as the electrons of a single
        atom do, making the cluster behave as a giant atom. And when his
        team calculated the number of electrons that would make complete
        shells in a jellium cluster, the answer turned out to be 8, 20,
        40 and so on. Since each sodium atom contributes one electron to
        the jelly, this explains why sodium clusters tended to be made
        of 8, 20 and 40 atoms. Clusters of this size can be thought of
        as the superatom counterparts of the noble gases, because their
        jellium electron shells are completely filled. </p>
      <p>Knight's jellium model explains why stable clusters form. But
        could it explain why clusters of one element mimic another as
        Upton had found? Fast-forward to the mid-1990s, when Castleman
        was investigating what happens when oxygen reacts with aluminium
        cluster-ions - clusters that had been given an extra electron.
        Castleman saw the oxygen stripping away aluminium atoms from the
        clusters one at a time, steadily shrinking them down to nothing
        as the reaction progressed. </p>
      <p><i>“ We can take one element and have it mimic several
          different elements in the periodic table ”</i> </p>
      <p>But when he did the experiment with clusters of various sizes,
        he noticed that the reaction would suddenly stop, leaving behind
        a depleted cluster. When he looked more closely, he found that
        the leftover clusters contained 13, 23 and 37 aluminium atoms.
        It seemed that there was something about these clusters that
        made them unwilling to react with oxygen. </p>
      <p>To understand what that was, Castleman and his colleagues
        turned to the jellium model and used it to calculate the
        arrangement of electrons in the Al13, Al23 and Al37 clusters.
        They found something similar to what Knight had seen in sodium
        clusters. Aluminium cluster-ions made of 13, 23 and 37 atoms -
        plus an extra electron - have just the right number of electrons
        to form closed electron shells. In effect, aluminium cluster
        ions with this number of atoms behave more like a noble gas than
        aluminium, at least as far as the reaction with oxygen is
        concerned. The numbers are different from the numbers in
        Knight's clusters because aluminium atoms contribute more
        electrons to the jelly than sodium does. </p>
      <p>Castleman then wondered what would happen if he removed the
        extra electron from the clusters. Elements with one electron
        fewer than the noble gases are the halogens - fluorine,
        chlorine, bromine and iodine - which are highly reactive. Sure
        enough, his team found that if they removed an electron, the
        neutral Al13 clusters underwent the same chemical reactions as
        the halogens. What's more, they found that Al13 cluster-ions,
        with their extra electron, behave much like the bromide ions
        that form when bromine atoms gain an electron. So it certainly
        looks as if aluminium, which is a typical metal, can be made to
        behave like a classic non-metal if it is in superatom form. </p>
      <p>How far does the similarity go? To test the chemistry of the
        aluminium superatom, Castleman's team investigated how it reacts
        with a halogen molecule such as iodine. Bromide ions are known
        to stick to iodine gas molecules to create BrI2- ions.
        Similarly, iodine ions latch onto iodine molecules to form
        tri-iodide ions, I3-, and further iodine molecules can then be
        added to create I5- and I7-. Castleman thought that if Al13
        cluster-ions really do mimic halide ions, then they should
        undergo the same reaction too. So his group tried it. Sure
        enough, they found that they could make Al13I2- and Al13I4-. </p>
      <p>It certainly looked promising. "We then started to work with
        other aluminium clusters," says Castleman, and that's when they
        discovered that they could get aluminium to mimic another
        element too. In reactions with iodine gas, they found that a
        cluster of 14 aluminium atoms behaves like an alkaline earth
        metal, the family in the second column of the periodic table
        that includes calcium and magnesium. </p>
      <p><b>Scouring for superatoms</b> </p>
      <p>These discoveries have prompted Castleman and his colleagues to
        scour the periodic table for more superatoms. So far, they have
        found hints that the chemical reactivity of clusters combining
        vanadium and oxygen atoms changes dramatically with the number
        of atoms in the cluster. </p>
      <p>But curiosity aside, what's the point? What can be gained from
        making a compound with a superatom mimicking an element like
        bromine, rather than with bromine itself? </p>
      <p>One answer is that superatoms could provide entirely new types
        of material, including "expanded" crystals. In a solid such as
        sodium chloride, the atoms are stacked together like oranges in
        a market display. In an expanded crystal, the atoms would be
        replaced by a stack of giant superatoms. </p>
      <p>Expanded crystals could have useful properties. In the early
        1990s, it was discovered that the superconducting properties of
        carbon-60 crystals doped with metal ions could be maintained at
        ever higher temperatures by squeezing larger and larger ions
        into the crystal lattice. Even so, the temperature at which the
        material ceased to act as a superconductor was still not very
        high - and was certainly a long way from the room-temperature
        superconductivity that researchers would love to achieve.
        Perhaps superatoms could hold the answer here and in related
        applications. Shiv Khanna, a physicist at Virginia Commonwealth
        University in Richmond who works with Castleman, hopes that
        replacing iodine in conducting polymers with aluminium
        superatoms could improve their conductivity. </p>
      <p>Not all researchers share his optimism. "There is scepticism,
        mostly expressed by physicists and theorists, that a crystalline
        material composed of large aluminium clusters could ever be
        achieved," Whetten admits. "But my opinion is that one of these
        projects will eventually succeed." Castleman is confident that
        chemists' ingenuity will win through. "Physicists lack
        appreciation for the immense variety of chemical approaches to
        synthesising new materials," he says. He looks forward to being
        able to use clusters to build materials with tailor-made
        properties. </p>
      <p>Another of the hopes for superatoms is that they could be used
        to disguise an element's normal chemistry. Aluminium could be a
        useful additive to solid fuels because it releases huge amounts
        of energy when it burns. But there is a problem: fine aluminium
        power is so reactive that the grains often oxidise before they
        even reach the ignition chamber, making them useless for
        boosting fuel. </p>
      <p>Castleman thinks the solution might lie with noble-gas-like
        Al13 cluster-ions, which do not react with oxygen. His plan is
        to combine them with some kind of combustible organic molecule
        and mix the resulting compound with the fuel. "It would be
        totally stable," he says, "until a flame kicks out the extra
        electron." At that moment, the cluster's disguise would fall
        away, returning it to its reactive neutral form. </p>
      <p>The idea "is just getting started", Castleman says, and he
        cautions that he doesn't know yet if it will work. But it is
        looking promising enough to have attracted the US air force,
        which is funding him to do further research. </p>
      <p>Applications like these are not the main point, however, at
        least as far as chemists are concerned. For them, superatoms
        could provide a means to change something they had previously
        accepted as given: the chemical properties of the elements. Now
        they are on the verge of being able to control and alter the way
        the elements react. It is a kind of alchemy, but it has no need
        of magic. All you have to do is count the right number of atoms.
      </p>
      <p><b>Size does matter</b> </p>
      <p>FOR nearly two centuries, researchers have known that when
        matter is divided into very small lumps it behaves in new and
        sometimes surprising ways. One of the most recent examples is
        seen in the change in the colour of light produced by some
        fluorescent materials if they are diced into nanoscale specks. </p>
      <p>When the semiconductor cadmium selenide is illuminated with
        white light, it normally fluoresces in the infrared part of the
        spectrum. But prepare it in the form of grains just a few tens
        of nanometres wide, and the wavelength of the light it emits
        becomes shorter, putting it into the red or yellow part of the
        visible range. </p>
      <p>The light is emitted when electrons in the semiconductor jump
        between quantised energy levels. Confining the electrons within
        nanoscale particles changes the energy levels, making the gap
        between them larger. As a result, the photons of fluorescent
        light have more energy, which in turn means that their
        wavelength is shorter. This effect allows the colour of the
        light emitted by the nanoparticles to be tuned simply by
        changing their size. The particles are already being used as
        glowing tags for labelling cells and could be turned into tiny
        light sources for optical communications. </p>

        <p><b>Belle Dumé</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Platinum atoms, which are not magnetic in the bulk, become
        magnetic when grouped together in small clusters, according to
        new experiments by physicists in Germany. The result, which
        confirms theoretical predictions, is not only of fundamental
        interest but could find applications in information storage and
        spintronics in the future. </p>

        <p><b>13-atom Pt cluster</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Clusters of atoms form a type of matter that is intermediate
        between single atoms and bulk matter. Metallic clusters are
        widely used as catalysts because they have a very high
        surface-to-volume ratio, which allows them to speed up chemical
        reactions. Researchers believe that magnetic clusters might also
        be used in information storage or in spintronic devices that
        exploit the spin of the electron as well as its charge. </p>
      <p>Scientists had already predicted that nanosized samples of
        platinum are highly paramagnetic (i.e. they are attracted to a
        magnet). The new experimental results, from Emil Roduner of the
        University of Stuttgart and colleagues, confirm these
        predictions and could help us to understand better how magnetism
        can develop in a normally non-magnetic element. </p>
      <p>Roduner and co-workers began their experiment by preparing the
        platinum clusters in the pores of a zeolite – a crystalline
        aluminosilicate that resembles a highly regular sponge with a
        network of pores measuring 1.3 nm in diameter. They then
        stabilized the clusters in these pores so that they did not grow
        any further. Next the team identified the clusters using a
        special X-ray technique called EXAFS, which is selective for
        specific elements (in this case platinum) and is particularly
        suitable for small species like these clusters. Finally the
        physicists measured the magnetization of the clusters as a
        function of temperature and magnetic field using an extremely
        sensitive magnetometer known as a superconducting quantum
        interference device. </p>
      <p>The Germany team found that each cluster, which consists of 13
        atoms, has a magnetic moment as high as 0.65 Bohr magnetons per
        atom. By comparison the figure for iron is 2.2 Bohr magnetons
        per atom. </p>
      <p>"The main significance of our work at this point is a
        fundamental understanding of magnetism," Roduner told
        nanotechweb.org. "However, since small, isolated, high magnetic
        moments - in this case corresponding to eight unpaired electrons
        per 13-atom cluster - are also of general interest to
        information storage or spintronics, these materials might be
        further developed to suit such advanced applications." </p>
      <p>Another intriguing feature of the platinum clusters is that
        they are best described as "superatoms", said Roduner. This
        means that each 13-atom cluster has properties that are very
        similar to those of individual atoms. "It is fascinating to
        imagine that new periodic tables of superatoms might be drawn
        and that this may lead to a new chemistry of superatoms,
        offering a fantastic perspective for the future of young
        chemists," he added. </p>

      <p>We recently demonstrated that, in gas phase clusters containing
        aluminum and iodine atoms, an Al13 cluster behaves like a
        halogen atom, whereas an Al14 cluster exhibits properties
        analogous to an alkaline earth atom. These observations,
        together with our findings that Al13? is inert like a rare gas
        atom, have reinforced the idea that chosen clusters can exhibit
        chemical behaviors reminiscent of atoms in the periodic table,
        offering the exciting prospect of a new dimension of the
        periodic table formed by cluster elements, called superatoms. As
        the behavior of clusters can be controlled by size and
        composition, the superatoms offer the potential to create unique
        compounds with tailored properties. In this article, we provide
        evidence of an additional class of superatoms, namely Al7?, that
        exhibit multiple valences, like some of the elements in the
        periodic table, and hence have the potential to form stable
        compounds when combined with other atoms. These findings support
        the contention that there should be no limitation in finding
        clusters, which mimic virtually all members of the periodic
        table. </p>

        <h1><font size="+1">Research Reveals Halogen Characteristics Of
            Cluster Of Metal Atoms</font></h1>
      </center>
      <p>A stable cluster of aluminum atoms, Al13, acts as a single
        entity in chemical reactions, demonstrating properties similar
        to those of a halogen, reports a research team led by A Welford
        Castleman Jr., the Evan Pugh Professor of Chemistry and Physics
        and the Eberly Family Distinguished Chair in Science at Penn
        State, in a paper to be published in the 2 April 2004 issue of
        the journal Science. Experimental results and theoretical
        calculations indicate that the cluster chemically resembles a
        "superhalogen" atom, retaining its properties during the
        reaction and in reaction products. Other team members include
        Denis E. Bergeron of the Penn State departments of chemistry and
        physics and Shiv N. Khanna of the Virginia Commonwealth
        University department of Physics. One implication of the
        research is the possibility of using such clusters as building
        blocks in nanoscale fabrication. The project focused on
        experimental evidence of the existence of a very stable cluster
        anion, Al13I-, prepared by the gas-phase reaction of aluminum
        clusters with HI gas. Mass spectrometric analysis indicated that
        the reaction produced relatively few products, the most abundant
        corresponding to Al13I-. Energy calculations to determine the
        bonding mechanism between the aluminum cluster and the iodine
        atom indicate that the extra electron is localized on the Al13
        cluster, meaning that the cluster maintains its integrity
        throughout the reaction. Because the cluster has a greater
        electron affinity in the compound, or attraction to the free
        electron, than does iodine, it can be considered a
        "superhalogen." </p>
      <p>"One of the themes of our research is using the clusters as
        building blocks for new nanoscale materials," says Castleman.
        "In many cases, people have worked from the top down; that is,
        subdividing matter to get it smaller and smaller. We're trying
        to work with atoms and molecules and put them together--working
        our way from the bottom up. If we can retain the properties of
        aggregates, as we put them together, perhaps we will be able to
        construct new nanoscale materials." The key to using the
        aggregates as building blocks is that they retain their
        individual properties during the reaction and do not coalesce
        into a large aggregate. </p>
      <p>One goal of the research is to test the Jellium model of stable
        clusters, which treats metal atoms in a small system as positive
        cores surrounded by the valence electrons. The model predicts
        certain closed-shell arrangements with high stability, called
        magic clusters. In the Jellium model, the cluster's atomic
        nuclei and inner electrons are seen as a single, spherical,
        positively charged core, surrounded by valence electrons in
        electronic shells similar to those of atoms. Essentially, the
        magic clusters can be viewed as superatoms, capable of forming
        compounds. </p>
      <p>"When we started looking at reactions, Al13 turned out to be a
        very interesting species for several reasons, " says Castleman.
        "It behaves very much like a halogen, somewhere between iodine
        and bromine the way it wants to bind an electron. If we could
        put an iodine atom in contact with Al13, the Al13 has a little
        higher electron affinity than iodine, which could allow the Al13
        to retain the electron, thereby bonding the Al13 and I
        together." </p>
      <p>Experimental observations indicated that the stability of the
        Al13I- ion is comparable to that of BrI-, a well-known and very
        stable molecular halogen ion. The ability of a cluster of
        aluminum atoms to behave like a halogen opens up the prospect
        that Al13 and other magic clusters can retain their properties
        as a building block for assembling new materials. </p>
      <p>"This superhalogen is not disrupted even in the presence of the
        very reactive iodine atom in close proximity, but still keeps
        its properties," says Castleman. "Now that we have shown that
        this is possible, we see potential ways to make other clusters,
        maybe involving other metals or alloys. It should be possible to
        construct something in the Jellium framework that would have the
        properties not only of a halogen, but of other types of atoms as
        well. For example, the Al13- ion itself resembles a rare gas
        atom because it is so unreactive. Ideally, we could have a whole
        series of clusters--a 'three dimensional' periodic table, not of
        elements but rather of clusters simulating the properties of the
        elements." The goal is to use these clusters as building blocks
        to tailor the design and formation of nanoscale materials with
        selected properties. </p>
