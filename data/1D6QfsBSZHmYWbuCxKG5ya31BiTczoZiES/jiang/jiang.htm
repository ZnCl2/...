              Infections: Cool Plasma Packs Heat Against Biofilms</font>
          </strong> </strong></p>

      <div align="center"><strong><strong><img src="jiang1.jpg"
              height="161" width="300"></strong></strong></div>
      <strong> </strong><br>
      Though it looks like a tiny purple blowtorch, a pencil-sized plume
      of plasma on the tip of a small probe remains at room temperature
      as it swiftly dismantles tough bacterial colonies deep inside a
      human tooth. But it's not another futuristic product of George
      Lucas' imagination. It's the exciting work of USC School of
      Dentistry and Viterbi School of Engineering researchers looking
      for new ways to safely fight tenacious biofilm infections in
      patients and it could revolutionize many facets of medicine.<br>
      <br>
      Two of the study's authors are Chunqi Jiang, a research assistant
      professor in the Ming Hsieh Department of Electrical
      Engineering-Electrophysics, and Parish Sedghizadeh, assistant
      professor of clinical dentistry and Director of the USC Center for
      Biofilms. <br>
      <br>
      Sedghizadeh explained that biofilms are complex colonies of
      bacteria suspended in a slimy matrix that grants them added
      protection from conventional antibiotics. Biofilms are responsible
      for many hard-to-fight infections in the mouth and elsewhere. But
      in the study, biofilms cultivated in the root canal of extracted
      human teeth were easily destroyed with the plasma dental probe, as
      evidenced by scanning electron microscope images of near-pristine
      tooth surfaces after plasma treatment. <br>
      <br>
      Plasma, the fourth state of matter, consists of electrons, ions,
      and neutral species and is the most common form found in space,
      stars, and lightning, Jiang said. But while many natural plasmas
      are hot, or thermal, the probe developed for the study is a
      non-thermal, room temperature plasma that's safe to touch. The
      researchers placed temperature sensors on the extracted teeth
      before treatment and found that the temperature of the tooth
      increased for just five degrees after 10 minutes of exposure to
      the plasma, Jiang said. <br>
      <br>
      The cooler nature of the experimental plasma comes from its pulsed
      power supply. Instead of employing a steady stream of energy to
      the probe, the pulsed power supply sends 100-nanosecond pulses of
      several kilovolts to the probe once every millisecond, with an
      average power less than 2 Watts, Jiang said. <br>
      <br>
      "Atomic oxygen [a single atom of oxygen, instead of the more
      common O2 molecule] appears to be the antibacterial agent,"
      according to plasma emission spectroscopy obtained during the
      experiments, she said. <br>
      <br>
      Sedghizadeh said the oxygen free radicals might be disrupting the
      cellular membranes of the biofilms in order to cause their demise
      and that the plasma plume's adjustable, fluid reach allowed the
      disinfection to occur even in the hardest-to-reach areas of the
      root canal. <br>
      <br>
      Given that preliminary research indicates that non-thermal plasma
      is safe for surrounding tissues, Sedghizadeh said he was
      optimistic about its future dental and medical uses. Much like the
      spread of laser technology from research and surgical applications
      to routine clinical and consumer uses, plasma could change
      everything; especially since nonthermal plasmas don't harbor the
      risks of tissue burns and eye damage that lasers do, he said. <br>
      <br>
      "Plasma is the future," Sedghizadeh said. "It's been used before
      for other sterilization purposes but not for clinical medical
      applications, and we hope to be the first to apply it in a
      clinical setting." <br>
      <br>
      "We believe we're the first team to apply plasma for biofilm
      disinfection in root canals," Jiang added. "This collaboration is
      very unique. We're attacking frontier problems, and we're happy to
      be broadening our fields." <br style="font-weight: bold;">

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <strong style="font-weight: bold;"> </strong><br>
      [0003] Despite continuing advances in the control of diseases of
      microbial origin, prevention of post-operative bacterial infection
      remains a serious challenge for practitioners in a number of
      medical fields, including but not limited to endodontology. <br>
      <br>
      [0004] For example, conventional methods of eliminating bacteria
      from the root canal system, such as mechanical cleaning,
      irrigation, application of hypochlorite and other anti-bacterial
      compounds, result in rates of post-procedure infection that exceed
      10%, even though eliminating bacteria from the root canal system
      is a major component of endodontic treatment. <br>
      <br>
      [0005] Laser systems have been shown to reduce bacteria after root
      canal surgery. However, the use of laser systems pose many
      challenges to practitioners, due to the significant cost of the
      delivery of care, the sizeable investment in capital, the cost of
      system operation and laser safety training, and laser-induced
      tissue trauma in patients that requiring days to recover. <br

      inlet of the outer chamber through the interior region of the
      electrode, so that a non-thermal plasma is ignited. The
      non-thermal plasma may exit from the gas flow outlet of the plasma

      </strong><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <strong style="font-weight: bold;"> </strong><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0010] The present disclosure describes methods and systems for
      using a non-thermal plasma for medical treatment purposes, which
      include but are not limited to root canal sterilization, dentin
      tubules sterilization, cleaning of dental and gum surfaces during
      oral surgery, and wound disinfection. The non-thermal plasma is
      generated from a plasma treatment probe that has a hollow
      electrode geometry. The non-thermal plasma can initiate and
      enhance bactericidal reactions without the need for elevated gas
      temperature. The plasma can be touched by bare hands without
      causing heating or painful sensation. <br>
      <br>
      [0011] In overview, a plasma probe system may include a plasma
      treatment probe, a high voltage pulse generator, and a gas flow
      system. The gas flow system may be configured to delivers
      pre-mixed gases, i.e. a gas mixture, in a controllable and
      detectable manner to the plasma treatment probe. The gas flow
      system may include instruments or devices for controlling and
      monitoring gas flow, such as a flow meter or a mass flow
      controller. The flow meter may have a flow rate of about 1000 SCCM
      up to about 20000 SCCM. <br>
      <br>
      [0012] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary plasma treatment probe 100,
      in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure. The
      plasma treatment probe 100 is a room-temperature atmospheric
      plasma device that can be driven by several kV, hundreds of
      nanosecond electric pulses. When a flow of a gas mixture is
      induced, as further described below, the plasma treatment probe
      may produce a room temperature, pencil-like plasma plume in
      ambient atmosphere. This plasma plume can be used for many medical
      applications, including but not limited to: root canal and dentin
      tubules sterilization after endodontic treatment; cleaning dental
      surfaces during dental and oral surgery procedures in general; and
      disinfecting wounds. <br>
      <br>
      [0013] The plasma treatment probe 100 employs a coaxial tubular
      design for the electrodes, and is driven by electric pulses of 100
      nanoseconds (or less), which may be generated by a high voltage
      pulse generator. This design provides a design free of
      electromagnetic noise, safe to operate, and efficient in electric
      energy delivery. <br>
      <br>
      [0014] The plasma treatment probe 100 shown in FIG. 1 has a
      hollow-electrode geometry. In overview, the plasma treatment probe
      100 includes: a hollow, tubular electrode 110; a coaxial
      insulating tube 120 that is configured to enclose the electrode
      therewithin; and an outer chamber 160 that is configured to
      enclose the insulating tube and the hollow electrode therewithin.
      The outer chamber 160 may have a gas inlet 162 configured to
      receive a gas mixture, e.g. from a gas flow system. <br>
      <br>
      [0015] In one embodiment, the central electrode 110 may be a high
      voltage metallic electrode. The electrode 110 may be formed of a
      variety of metallic materials, including without limitation brass
      or stainless steel. In one exemplary embodiment, the central
      electrode 110 may have an inner diameter of about 3 millimeters,
      an outer diameter of about 6.35 millimeters, and a length of about
      12.7 mm. Other embodiments may use central hollow electrodes
      having different dimensions. <br>
      <br>
      [0016] The hollow electrode 110 may configured to receive
      nanosecond electric pulses, while the gas mixture flows through
      the interior region of the electrode, so that a non-thermal plasma
      is ignited. <br>
      <br>
      [0017] The high voltage hollow electrode 110 may be enclosed
      within an isolating tube 120 that is coaxial with the hollow
      electrode. An outer chamber 160 may enclose the hollow electrode
      and the insulating tube in a gas tight configuration. A portion of
      the chamber 160 may be a grounded flange, shown with reference
      numeral 130 in FIG. 1. In one exemplary embodiment, the grounded
      flange 130 may have an inner diameter of about 12.7 millimeters,
      and an outer diameter of about 33.8 millimeters. In one
      embodiment, the grounded flange 130 may be a Conflat flange made
      of stainless steel. <br>
      <br>
      [0018] In one embodiment, the insulating tube 120 may have an
      inner diameter of about 6.35 millimeters to accommodate the
      central metal electrode 110, and a length of about 38 millimeters.
      One end of the insulating tube 120 may be an exit aperture that
      functions as a gas flow outlet 150 of the plasma probe 100. In one
      embodiment, the gas flow outlet 150 may have a length of about
      five millimeters, and an inner diameter of about three
      millimeters. The insulating tube 120 may be made of a variety of
      insulator materials, including without limitation ceramic. The
      insulating tube 120 may separate and isolate the inner high
      voltage electrode 110 from the outside air, and from the grounded
      flange 130. <br>
      <br>
      [0019] The plasma probe 100 may be made gas-tight, for example by
      copper gaskets or Torr-seal glue, to ensure that the gas mixture
      only exits through the exit aperture or gas flow outlet 150. <br>
      <br>
      [0020] The nanosecond electric pulses may be generated by a high
      voltage pulse generator. A custom-designed, inductive adder-based
      high voltage pulse generator may be used that is capable of
      generating up to 10 kV, about 50-100 nanosecond pulses at a rate
      from single shot to 3 kHz. <br>
      <br>
      [0021] These high voltage, nanosecond electric pulses may be
      delivered through standard coaxial SHV (safe high voltage)
      connections. High voltage insulated wires may be used to deliver
      the electric pulses from the SHV connection to the central hollow
      electrode 110. <br>
      <br>
      [0022] A pencil-like, non-thermal plasma plume, which may be about
      two to three centimeters long, may be formed at the exit aperture
      or gas outlet 150, pointing away from the high voltage electrode
      110, when intense nanosecond electric pulses are applied to the
      hollow metal electrode 110 while a gas mixture flows through the
      interior region of the hollow electrode 110. In one embodiment,
      the gas mixture may be a pre-mixed He/(1%)O.sub.2. The non-thermal
      plasma may exit from the nozzle at a flow rate of about 1.about.10
      std. L/min. <br>
      <br>
      [0023] When applying the plasma treatment probe 100 to root canal
      surfaces, the plasma plume (generated by the plasma probe) may
      substantially eliminate the bacteria within the root canal and the
      dentin tubules. <br>
      <br>
      [0024] A first version of plasma treatment probe 100 has been
      designed and tested with different organisms including
      Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Bacillus atrophaeus for their
      growth inhibition. In preliminary experiments, substantially 100%
      killing of test organisms on nutrient agar plates was observed. <br>
      <br>
      [0025] In dentistry, the plasma treatment probe 100 can be used
      for endodontic and periodontal treatment, including but not
      limited to root canal disinfection, tooth cleaning, cavity
      disinfection, and periodontal disease prevention. In addition, the
      plasma treatment probe 100 may be used for wound disinfection,
      implant disinfection, and disinfection for fungus-related topical
      diseases. The plasma treatment probe 100 may be particularly
      useful in treating areas that are difficult to reach, e.g. small
      cracks, holes, and on-site biomedical device sterilization. <br>
      <br>
      [0026] In operation, a method of root canal sterilization may
      include: receiving a gas mixture from a gas flow system, at a gas
      inlet of a plasma dental probe; generating a non-thermal plasma by
      applying nanosecond electric pulses to a hollow metallic electrode
      within the plasma dental probe, while the gas mixture is flowing
      through an interior region of the hollow electrode; and delivering
      the non-thermal plasma from a gas outlet of the plasma dental
      probe onto the root canal to sterilize the root canal. The
      nanosecond electric pulses may have a duration of about 50 to 100
      nanoseconds, and an intensity up to about 10 kV. <br>
      <br>
      [0027] The plasma probe system described above does not require
      any harmful gases or liquids. With noble gases (i.e. helium) as
      buffer, and mixed with low-percentage oxygen(&lt;1%), the
      bactericidal effect is only initiated with the plasma ignition.
      Compared to conventional methods, "cold" (or non-thermal) plasma
      treatment of the root canal system offers a painless, safe,
      effective, and simple procedure for root canal sterilization.
      Compared to near infrared laser irradiation for root canal
      sterilization, the "cold" plasma plume employs enhanced chemistry
      for bacteria elimination. The heat generated from the plasma is
      minimum, and does not cause any burning in tissues. Moreover, the
      plasma treatment probe 100 is simple, low cost, compact, and easy
      to operate and maintain. <br>
      <br>
      [0028] FIG. 2 is a schematic flowchart that illustrates a method
      200 of medically treating a patient using a plasma treatment
      probe, in accordance with one embodiment of the present
      disclosure. The method 200 may include an act 210 of receiving a
      gas mixture from a gas flow system, at a gas inlet of a plasma
      treatment probe. The method 200 may further include an act 210 of
      generating a non-thermal plasma by applying nanosecond electric
      pulses to a hollow metallic electrode within the plasma treatment
      probe, while the gas mixture is flowing through an interior region
      of the hollow electrode. The method 200 may further include an act
      220 of delivering the non-thermal plasma from a gas flow outlet of
      the plasma treatment probe onto a treatment region in the
      patient's body, to medically treat the treatment region. <br>
      <br>
      [0029] In sum, methods and systems have been described for
      generating and delivering a non-thermal plasma that can disinfect
      and sterilize root canal systems, wounds, and other treatment
      regions of a patient's body, in a painless, safe, effective, and
      inexpensive manner. <br>
      <br>
      [0030] Various changes and modifications may be made to the above
      described embodiments. The components, steps, features, objects,
      benefits and advantages that have been discussed are merely
      illustrative. None of them, nor the discussions relating to them,
      are intended to limit the scope of protection in any way. Numerous
      other embodiments are also contemplated, including embodiments
      that have fewer, additional, and/or different components, steps,
      features, objects, benefits and advantages. The components and
      steps may also be arranged and ordered differently. <br>
      <br>
      [0031] The phrase "means for" when used in a claim embraces the
      corresponding structures and materials that have been described
      and their equivalents. Similarly, the phrase "step for" when used
      in a claim embraces the corresponding acts that have been
      described and their equivalents. The absence of these phrases
      means that the claim is not limited to any of the corresponding
      structures, materials, or acts or to their equivalents. <br>
      <br>
      [0032] Nothing that has been stated or illustrated is intended to
      cause a dedication of any component, step, feature, object,
      benefit, advantage, or equivalent to the public, regardless of
      whether it is recited in the claims. <br>
      <strong style="font-weight: normal;"> </strong>
      <p><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">[0033] In short, the
            scope of protection is limited solely by the claims that now
            follow. That scope is intended to be as broad as is
            reasonably consistent with the language that is used in the
            claims and to encompass all structural and functional
            equivalents.</span><strong> </strong> </strong></p>
