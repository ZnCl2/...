            Association for Medico-Physical Research.</i> <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p>&gt;<b>This therapy started as an investigation of the toxins
            that cause convulsions after parathyroidectomy and in
            eclampsia. </b>The purpose was to devise a means of
          destroying poisons that contained the guanidine and imidazole
          groups. Since the poisons of these types developed while the
          oxidations were seriously impaired, we immediately set to work
          investigating methods of harmlessly oxidizing them within the
          body. <b>We chose to use the normal oxidation mechanism, but
            first had to master it.</b> </p>
        <p><b>It might be stated in outline that the important steps
            cover some cardinal contributions to physiology. They also
            reduce the clinical features and the essential pathologies
            of the broad field of disease to a single basic fault in
            tissue chemistry. They include the application of this
            system of direct oxidation of sugar and fat to the burning
            of pathogenic poisons whose structure we identified and
            whose origin we located in residual focal infection. These
            poisons we credited also with producing the various
            allergies, degenerative diseases, and cancer. They are
            identical with the products of the same germs active in
            acute infections.</b> </p>
        <p>It must be acknowledged at the start that the burning of
          sugar, and especially aerobic glycolysis, is still regarded as
          a mystery. Back in 1914, when we began this research,
          practically no pertinent facts were known and, besides, the
          science of photochemistry that deals with the catalysis of
          such processes was in its early infancy. However, we
          formulated a system of aerobic glycolysis that worked out
          perfectly on paper and, to our extreme satisfaction, it served
          as a guide to the chemistry of immunity.<b> As photochemistry
            developed and various laws controlling catalytic activities
            were I earned, the correctness of our working scheme has
            been amply verified. It checked up physiologically, too, and
            so it stands a good chance of being the correct
            interpretation.</b> </p>
        <p>In order to bring the oxidations involved within the field of
          photochemistry, we outlined the break­down of glucose and
          fructose as accomplished by dehydrations with the formation of
          double bonds between carbon atoms. This provided free
          valencies able to activate oxygen as well as activate ethylene
          and carbonyl groups to take up the activated oxygen. Several
          important highly unsaturated structures with powerful
          catalytic properties were thus produced. </p>
        <p>At first the simplest procedure of glycolysis imaginable was
          tested out. Thus glucose, by a single dehydration, makes a
          cyclic molecule, “ Inosite,” which, as pictured below, may
          undergo full dehydration into the hypothetical substance I
          call Hexylene. And this can either fully saturate with
          peroxide oxygen and break up directly into six molecules of
          carbon dioxide or it may take up either two or three molecules
          of peroxide oxygen and split into two molecules of Malonide or
          three molecules of Glyoxylide, as depicted below. </p>
        <p>Since the hypothetical Hexylene is not practical
          experimentally, we went back to the next most unsaturated
          structure that could be produced syn­thetically and that could
          also yield the Hexylene under proper conditions. <b>The
            substance we worked with is 1:4 Benzoquinone.</b> <b>Let us
            call it BQ for short. </b>This substance conforms to the
          rules of structure requisite to immunogenesis as I have
          formulated them. So it was put to work to see how much it
          could boost the oxidations of surviving tissues before and
          after they were poisoned by the pathogenic negative oxidation
          catalysts. It proved out very satisfactorily and without delay
          it was used to treat the sick in catalytic dilutions. <b>We
            used one or two cc. of a dilution of 1 X 10-(2) to 1 X
            10-(36)to find the most active solution. Thus BQ was our
            first synthetic antitoxin.</b> </p>
        <p><b>We next employed the two transition forms, Malonide and
            Glyoxylide </b>and its closely related Ketene, since these
          bodies are also intermediaries in the other two schemes of
          aerobic glycolysis, which we outlined. They were all found to
          act similarly in many respects both physiologically and
          thera­peutically. With these four compounds we studied the
          recovery processes in the serious acute and chronic infections
          and in the so-called incurable diseases like coronary
          thrombosis, Berger’s disease, multiple sclerosis, progressive
          muscular atrophy epilepsy, cancer, and certain forms of
          insanity. In these conditions and also in the gumma stage of
          syphilis, in tuberculosis, and leprosy, the recovery processes
          were found to be essentially similar, both in regard to their
          periodicities and in the order of correction of the symptoms
          and structural changes. </p>
        <p><b>The first observations were made in 1917 in cancer
            associated with sarcoma. Considering our great ignorance the
            patients did remarkably well. Thereafter, the most thorough
            investigations possible were made on every incurable that
            came for help at our Detroit Clinic.</b> </p>
        <p><b>The mechanism of allergy production had to be formulated
            also. It too, is still regarded a mystery, but we outlined a
            process of allergenesis along photochemical lines that meets
            all the facts, including the specificity and the failure of
            physiological control of the hyperactivity that constitute
            the disease. Most important of all, when the catalysts were
            employed clinically, they worked very efficiently and the
            recoveries followed the same program as the recoveries
            secured in all other diseases.</b> It seemed that we could
          best explain allergenesis as a matter of energy transfer
          accomplished by the fluorescence of the allergenic substance.
          The energy of the exothermic reactions going on in the cells
          was thus transferred into the chemical processes of such
          functional units as were able to accept such energy. The
          specificity of energy acceptance resides in the similarity of
          energy emission range and energy absorption range of the
          fluorescent substance and the functional unit. The energy
          accepted passes into and boosts its chemical processes and
          functional activity; and so the contractile, secretory,
          reproductive, or conductive units are forced to functionate
          beyond physiological control, producing the bronchial spasms
          and hyper-secretion of asthma, the cell multiplication of
          cancer, the spasms, inhi­bitions and fixed ideas of insanity.
        </p>
        <p>An examination of the chemical structures, which we
          identified as the intermediaries that catalyze aerobic
          glycolysis, yields several charac­teristics which may be
          stated as the rules of struc­ture that determine immunity.
          These are the following: <b><i>The molecule shall be as small
              as possible. There shall be no amino-nitrogen present in
              the molecule. A carbon atom shall be present which shares
              two ethylene linkages or forms a part of ethylene and a
              carbonyl group or it</i> <i>shall be attached to hydrogen
              or to a hydroxyl group that can be removed so as to form
              either of the above structures. </i></b>We checked up on
          a series of compounds that possessed these qualities and found
          that they served the tissue oxidations in vitro. When given in
          catalytic doses to patients suffering from acute infections,
          the response was rapid. <b>The chronic infections, allergies,
            and malignancy responded with a rapidity inversely
            proportionate to the length of time the condition had been
            established in the patient and his ancestry.</b> </p>
        <p>With recovery the general vitality and nutrition improved
          very impressively. In order to ascertain if or not, only such
          molecules as may play a part in aerobic glycolysis possessed
          these curative powers, <b>we prepared and tested propargylic
            aldehyde.</b> It possesses an acetylene group which
          undergoes change yielding a carbon atom possessing two sets of
          double bonds and thus it conforms with our rules of chemical
          structure that provide protection against disease poisons.
          This substance shows splendid curative powers in disease
          showing rapid tissue necrosis.<b> We concluded, therefore, as
            early as 1930, when this substance was tested out, that the
            oxidation catalyzing power resided in the free valencies of
            carbon and oxygen atoms when arranged according to these
            rules, yet the general structure of the molecule influences
            the efficacy in important respects.</b> </p>
        <p>After the therapy was thus reduced to something like an exact
          science, we instructed favorable European cancer institutions
          in our work. <b>In 1935 the Cancer Institute of Louvain
            University, under the direction of Professor Maisin, adopted
            it for scientific research and clinical use and they have
            made some splendid contributions in the mean­time many
            American physicians have done nobly in the service of the
            afflicted and in accumulating data of great value.</b> So
          today, not only in our hands, but also in the personal
          experience of many astute observers, the great field of
          incurable disease has been attacked successfully by a single
          therapeutic principle and thus the singleness of the basic
          cause of disease in general has become evident. </p>
        <p>We described the periodicity of the recovery process as early
          as 1920. It seems that this feature had escaped detection
          hitherto. Likewise the pre-growth toxic period, which we
          described about that time, had also escaped detection. It also
          manifests its symptoms with the same periodicity as the
          recovery process. <b>These observations aroused very little
            interest except in Dr. Douglas Webster, Radiologist of the
            Middlesex Hospital, London, who investigated the periodicity
            of the recurrence of cancer, and found that his periodicity
            ran very close to ours.</b> They most likely are identical,
          for the time lost in recognizing metastases after they become
          located would require a period of three weeks, or even nine
          weeks. Furthermore, we have shown that the recovery process is
          the reversal of the pathogenesis and so the same periodicity
          should be expected. This is an extremely important matter in a
          study of many thousands of case histories covering many years.
          <b>Webster found that cancer invariably returned after
            operation or irradiation, either at a periodicity of
            thirty-three weeks or half thirty-three weeks. So accurate
            is this phenomenon that he could predict the death of
            patients very closely. In the same way we have been
            predicting the recovery of patients quite closely under our
            treatment for the last twenty years.</b> Webster has also
          been able to predict the time of return of epidemics,
          influenza, etc., for they follow this periodicity. Thus the
          periodicity features of disease are cosmic phenomena
          ultimately. All photochemic phenomena are essentially
          periodic. They are electronic behaviors that follow definite
          laws and, although their periodicity comprises very short
          units, they accumulate in “overtones,” so to speak, that
          constitute the greater cosmic events. </p>
        <p><b>In a little over a quarter of a century, therefore, we
            have secured and systematized the data that give a
            fundamental and scientific conception of disease and its
            processes both with regard to their genesis and correction.
            At the same time we have demonstrated the correctness of
            this conception by the only worthwhile test—the true cure of
            the hitherto incurable.</b> </p>

        <p>The history of the professional aspect of the work is
          discussed in a separate volume. <b>It might he stated that
            Dr. Mitchell, one of the country’s foremost surgeons, when
            President of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical
            Association, understanding that the financial interests that
            control organized medicine would suffer severely when our
            treatment undergoes general adoption, wrote the following
            encouraging message as long ago as 1924:</b> </p>
        <p>“I shall be guided by Dr. L. in the use of the material. Have
          been watching his cases and am convinced that whatever the
          substance is, it is efficient. I had the pleasure of reading
          your article in the October number of “<i>Cancer”</i> and it
          is certainly the most intelligent and enlightening discussion
          of the subject I have ever read. For years I have been
          convinced of the utter uselessness of surgery in true cancer
          cases and have made myself disliked somewhat by my opposition
          to surgeons going about the country lecturing upon a subject
          of which they themselves knew nothing. I hope that a little
          more time will prove that your work is really an epoch making
          work and that you will ultimately secure the full credit and
          profit to which your service entitles you.” </p>
        <p>Dr. Mitchell’s hopes will come true, and hu­manity will have
          free access to this service only when the profession becomes
          sufficiently enlight­ened to properly appreciate the work.
          This time is very close at hand, for confirmation of the
          prin­ciples we have taught for years are coming from several
          sides. The most noted Tuberculosis experts are adopting our
          vegetarian diet. The cura­tive position of activated
          prothrombin, which we demonstrated conclusively in 1920, is
          being investigated now at Harvard University. The destruction
          of carcinogenic poisons by oxidation that we demonstrated so
          many years ago, is just now being observed at the Rockefeller
          Institute. Even a book entitled, <i>“The Treatment of Cancer
            and Its Allied Diseases,”</i> is now advertised by the
          American Society for the Control of Cancer. </p>
        <p>Thus the constitutional nature of cancer is becoming
          recognized even though the proponents of the theory of local
          treatment as the proper approach do not like to admit it. We
          published our book, <i>“Cancer and Its Allied Diseases,”</i>
          in 1929 and demonstrated the success of constitutional
          treatment for the most part in cases that failed to respond to
          the local treatments in vogue. This book was published to
          demonstrate the fundamental constitutional nature of the
          disease and the period of personal and hereditary toxic
          changes that precede the appearance of the cancer growth. We
          showed that this pre-growth toxic phase, which expresses
          itself as so many diseases entities, classifiable as allergies
          that can be cured by the same oxidation catalysts that cure
          cancer. We are happy to find that our efforts have not been in
          vain and that the common sense view of the matter promises to
          be adopted eventually.<br>
