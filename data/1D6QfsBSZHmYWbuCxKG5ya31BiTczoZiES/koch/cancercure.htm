        cases. (May, July, August and September, 1926.) </p>
      <p>Dr. Koch, as a result of 10 years of laboratory experiments at
        the University of Michigan and at the Detroit College of
        Medicine and of 7 years of clinical observation concludes that
        cancer is a systemic disease of parasitic origin, that the
        cancer tumor is an inadequate effort on the part of nature
        against the toxins of the invading organism and that cancer can
        be cured by chemotherapy. </p>

      <p>The following paper for which 2000 words are allowed is given
        in outline to cover the large amount of material concerned, and
        to answer several of the questions repeatedly asked regarding
        our treatment. </p>
      <p>Philosophy does not retain the notion that nature is
        self-destructive, for if it were self-destructive, it has had in
        the ages that have passed plenty of chance to cease to exist.
        Therefore, we cannot hold the view that cancer has accidentally
        or purposely come into existence to destroy the body that
        produces it, nor that it is the great blunder of nature, as the
        pathologist would claim. </p>
      <p>Neither has cancer any ordinary physiological function, for the
        normal body gets along physiologically without it. There can,
        therefore, be only one contingency to determine the occurrence
        of the cancer manifestation, namely, that it must be a new
        response to environment, a mechanism of adaptation in the
        progress of evolution, an immunity or protective effort. If this
        be so, we can look to the perfection of the effort in the ages
        to come as a new acquirement, undoubtedly of a new gland of
        internal secretion providing better adaptation to environment.
        Cancer is not a blunder, but one of the wonders in nature. </p>
      <p>Physiologic affairs are efficient to a high degree, thus the
        supply of any activity is regulated by the demand. The various
        cells of the organism not only serve their own needs but
        specialize in the service of the body as a whole, taking up and
        perfecting those activities that they are best adapted to. Thus
        we observe the activity of the parathyroid glands that protect
        the body as a whole against the guanidine bases that are
        distributed through the blood to every tissue of the body in
        sufficient amount to rapidly prove fatal. (1) Likewise there is
        proof that the cancer effort is directed to protect the body
        against a certain toxin distributed by the blood and that this
        protective function is attempted by tissues not too busily
        engaged in other physiological direction, as the resting mammary
        gland or the uterus, and especially by tissues where congestive
        changes bring a greater quantity of the toxin to the tissue. </p>
      <p>Practically every cancer patient presents evidence of poisoning
        over a period of years previous to the incidence of the growth.
        (2) This poisoning ceases in part or entirely during the growth
        period. So definite is this fact that it is often possible to
        tell the patient when the growth was first noticed after getting
        the data on the intoxication symptoms. In a way, then, the
        cancer effort demonstrates its protecting function, insomuch as
        it may, by removing the intoxication symptoms. </p>
      <p>But, with the incidence of the growth, a set of symptoms of
        cachexia arise, and these result from the presence of a
        substance formed by the cancer tissue acting upon the original
        toxin that called forth the cancer effort. Thus the cancer cells
        produce an even more harmful poison out of the toxin of which
        they try to dispose. And the fact that the cancer cells convert
        the growth producing toxin into something else throws light not
        only on their function but also points out what is the nature of
        the immunity process. If the cancer function was one of
        oxidation simply it could destroy the toxin and thus dispose of
        it. But such is not the case. It converts the toxin without
        oxidizing it into a substance of different isorropesis state. </p>
      <p>Thus the cancer effort is not simply intended for purposes of
        destroying and eliminating the growth producing toxin but it is
        so directed as to preserve this material, to use it for further
        elaboration, and the only reasonable purpose of which is that of
        antitoxin production. We have demonstrated chemically that
        toxins are the material from which antitoxins are made.
        Antitoxins are not new substances built up from the tissues to
        neutralize the toxin as the Ehrlich theory states. Antitoxins
        are converted toxins of such isorropesis state that they are
        destructive to their source, the causal infection. The cancer
        effort falls short of its mark. It does not succeed in producing
        the antitoxin, so the effort is not adequate, and it persists
        and tries until it has sapped enough vitality from the patient
        to kill him. The attempted function of cancer, then, is to
        convert the toxin of the disease into its antitoxin and to thus
        establish immunity: </p>
      <p>Our work is based upon the isolation and identification of the
        growth producing toxin, the successful synthesis of the
        antitoxin and the successful synthesis of the substance that can
        convert the toxin of the disease into its antitoxin right within
        the body. Thus accomplishing the work the cancer activity
        attempts to do. </p>
      <p><b>ADMINISTRATION OF THE TREATMENT</b> </p>
      <p>The substance we are using is a synthetic chemical,
        structurally a late intermediary phase of the antitoxin in its
        transition from the toxin state of structure. One c. c. of the
        substance is given subcutaneously, generally to the arm. Time is
        then allowed for cure to take place. If necessary, after an
        interval of several months, the dose is repeated. </p>
      <p><b>REACTIONS</b> </p>
      <p>The mode of action of the substance is in a way similar to
        several other chemical reactions, as for example,
        crystallization of a saturated solution under the influence of
        "seeding" by a crystal. In this case the crystal placed in the
        saturated solution induces through the electronic wave
        consequent to its state of isorropesis similar electronic waves
        in the molecules of the substance (in tune) in the solution, in
        response to which these molecules assume a similar structural
        state. So the "Converter" injected into the patient, by virtue
        of the electronic waves emitted, induces a change from the toxin
        state to that of the intermediary injected. </p>
      <p>This phase of the intermediary is, however, not stable and
        passes on into the antitoxin state automatically. Thus all toxin
        follows suit and becomes antitoxin. A complete conversion of
        toxin into antitoxin takes place and the results can be
        demonstrated in a high percentage of cures. The possibility also
        remains that the converter can, under certain influences, be
        reverted into the toxin, but the finished antitoxin can never be
        changed back to toxin. The treatment, therefore, should never be
        used after recent radium, X-ray, or other catalytic exposures.
        The treatment is most applicable in cases of real cancer, not in
        cases that have had radiation less than three months previously.
      </p>
      <p>As soon as the toxin is destroyed by the cancer the cells
        gradually revert back to normal, assume their original polarity,
        undergo calcification and digestion, the products being absorbed
        by angioblastic tissue. This tissue heals the deficiencies that
        might exist. </p>
      <p>The material absorbed in the removal of the cancer tissue again
        renourishes the body being reverted to the same elements as were
        taken from the blood in the progress of the growth of this
        tissue. Moreover, whatever stored toxins are liberated from the
        involuting cancer tissue are also converted to antitoxin. </p>
      <p>Reactions occur at different periods after treatment, and these
        are due to changes in the concentration of the toxins in the
        blood. Often a reaction with slight fever and aching and nausea
        develops for a few hours from the second to the fourth day;
        again from the fourth to the sixth week; about the middle of the
        ninth week; and during the twelfth week after the treatment is
        given. The first is due to the rapid decrease in the circulating
        toxins; the second during the absorption of the growth; and the
        last two accompany the withdrawal of the last traces of the
        poison. Some anaphylactic effects are had because of absorption
        of bacterial toxins, due to secondary infection. Very often a
        case clears up with little or no reaction. </p>
      <p><b>CASE REPORTS.</b> </p>
      <p>The following cases are given to illustrate: (1) Pregrowth
        symptoms, (2) Reactions occurring during recovery, (3)
        Permanency of the cure and (4) Healing of areas destroyed by the
        growth. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 1. </i></b>Cancer of the Uterus. </p>
      <p>Mrs. E .F., age 37. Heredity, negative. Pregrowth symptoms:
        dizziness and a sensation of falling long distances on closing
        eyes, for a period of nine years before the growth came. The
        dizziness let up almost entirely for one year and sit months
        previous to an exploratory operation which revealed a pelvic
        growth. July 1918, the normal weight was 172 pounds. The first
        attack of nausea was supposed to be one of appendicitis nausea,
        vomiting and pains that doubled her up. She lost 18 pounds in
        ten days from this attack. Several attacks followed at intervals
        with gradual loss of strength and weight. She complained of
        pains in the back, and there was a change in color to a yellow
        cachexia. By fall, the patient noticed that the umbilicus was
        displaced obliquely to the right and was less movable as the
        left side of the abdomen became raised and hard. She was seen by
        Drs. Wheeler, Brand, and Park Meyers of Toledo. No treatment
        helped. She later consulted Drs. George Jones and A. N. Smith,
        stomach specialists of Toledo, who found a large growth in the
        abdomen. They called in Dr. Louis Smead, a surgeon, and all
        decided that an exploratory operation would settle the
        diagnosis. The operation was performed in June, 1919, at Flower
        Hospital, Toledo, with the following report: "Found trouble to
        be cancer of the uterus and in such shape that an attempt to
        remove it would undoubtedly prove fatal; consequently there was
        nothing to do but close the wound and keep the patient as
        comfortable as possible." Prognosis: six months. At this time
        the body weight had dropped to 97 pounds. Patient kept failing
        rapidly, vomiting became continuous. pain constant, she became
        bedfast. </p>
      <p>This patient was brought to Detroit, November 17, 1919, as a
        test case for the Wayne County Medical Society. The weight was
        perhaps 80 pounds. Record of examination made by the Committee
        of the Wayne County Medical Society that was appointed to pass
        judgment on the treatment made at the Herman Kiefer Hosp. of
        Detroit, Nov. 26, 1919 is: "Palpable mass in lower abdomen
        extending from pelvis to two inches below umbilicus, about
        grapefruit size. Uterus fixed, pelvis infiltrated more on left
        side, and extending on both sides to crest of ilium, cervix
        smooth, uterus one mass with adjoining tissues:" Signed. Dr. J.
        H. Carstens, Chairman of the committee. </p>
      <p>On admission to the Herman Kiefer Hospital, the temperature 97,
        pulse 80, respiration 18. The urine was examined Nov. 18, and
        found to be acid in reaction, to show a trace of albumen and
        occasional epithelial and pus cells. Nov. 19, the reaction was
        alkaline, albumen positive. sugar negative, occasional hyalin
        casts and red blood cells. Dec. 1, the hemoglobin was 65
        percent, red blood count 3.010.000: white count: neutrofile 75
        percent, small mononuclears 24 percent. During November she
        received, two treatments of two c. c. each without any rise in
        temperature above 99° F. although the pulse rose to 104 and the
        respiration to 20 during the first reaction. However, the
        patient suffered severe focal pain. She remained in the hospital
        until Dec. 19, when the investigation was closed. Rapid
        improvement set in two weeks after the first treatment, the
        patient. could get up and walk about a little. The vomiting also
        had ceased and the pain subsided a gain in weight and in color
        was recognized. The gain in weight continued to 170, the mass
        entirely disappeared in the course of a year, normal health
        being, reestablished. </p>
      <p>Recently the Wayne County Medical Society committee, reporting
        in the Wayne County Society<i> Bulletin</i> on their examination
        of this patient admitted that the patient is "apparently in good
        health." Nevertheless that society and the American Medical
        Association make every attempt to discredit this treatment. The
        woman is still in perfect health, working every day. </p>
      <p>Discussion: The pregrowth symptoms in this case were of the
        most usual type: dizziness coming on when the eyes were not
        focused on some object. With the development of the growth the
        dizziness was overcome; but cachexia set in, and this is an
        effect of the toxin changed by the growth activity. All symptoms
        disappeared with the cure of the case and the return to normal
        health. Reactions were without fever, but gave rise to sharp
        temporary increase in focal pain and tenderness. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 2</i></b>. Cancer of the Stomach. </p>
      <p>Mrs. P., of Port Huron, Mich., age 61 in 1919, when accepted
        for treatment. Heredity negative. Pregrowth symptoms: gastric
        ulcer symptoms for years. These became constant for the four
        years preceding the diagnosis of cancer. The statement of Dr.
        Heavenrich, of Port Huron, who performed the exploratory
        laparotomy is as follows: </p>
      <p>"She was taken ill August 1, 1919, with what was diagnosed
        gallstone colic. Needed opiates for relief of pain. During the
        following six weeks had repeated attacks: pain, nausea,
        jaundice. Was seen by several doctors, all of whom agreed in
        diagnosis and need of operation. I first saw her in September in
        one of these attacks. I found her emaciated and anemic,
        suffering severely with gallstone colic, deep jaundice over
        entire body. Itchy skin, clay stools, and vomiting bile. Unable
        to retain any food. Temperature 98.4, pulse 118. Abdomen so
        tender as to make palpation impossible. I also advised
        operation, and was requested to do so at once. I had her removed
        to the hospital, where she was operated upon the following
        morning by Dr. Aldridge and myself. To our surprise we found the
        liver and gall bladder perfectly normal: no stones, no
        thickening of the duct walls, etc. But the lesser curvature of
        the stomach was one large sausage-shaped tumor, hard in
        consistency, with some nodules at various spots. So much of the
        organ was involved, and the patient was in such a weakened
        condition, that we were both of the opinion that
        gastroenterostomy or any modification of such operation would be
        of no avail. We closed the wound and about November first sent
        her to you. At this time (August 8, 1920) she appears to be in
        splendid health, does her own work, and eats everything, and
        certainly is grateful to you." </p>
      <p>On admission to the Woman's Hospital, Detroit, Nov. 1, 1919,
        the patient was fairly well exhausted. She had lost some 79
        pounds in weight. Her weight was 110 pounds. All ingests were
        vomited and had been for some weeks previously. Blood count
        showed 3,100,000 red cells, hemoglobin 60 percent. Stools were
        black and scanty, urine very scanty. Physical examination showed
        a large tumor mass filling the epigastrium and extending to
        below the umbilicus and involving the liver. Supraclavicular
        glands on left side were involved, also the base of the left
        lung. Left pelvis revealed a mass as big as a fist and smaller
        masses were found throughout the abdomen. </p>
      <p>Three treatments were given at two week intervals. Two weeks
        after the second treatment the pylorus opened up and food went
        through thereafter; with consequent gain in patient's health,
        increase in urine and stools. At this time fever also developed
        to 104 and lasted a few days, but strength returned very rapidly
        and patient was able to return home six weeks after her entrance
        to the hospital. She gained to 187 pounds which she holds today
        and is in perfect health, six years after treatment was
        instituted. </p>
      <p>In cases of gastric cancer developing on a gastric ulcer, and
        in cases that have had rodent ulcers for years, the nervous
        pregrowth symptoms are too mild to disturb the patient. The
        reactions in this case, as in a fair proportion of the cases,
        included fever as well as focal pain. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 3</i></b>. Insanity and Gastric Cancer. </p>
      <p>Miss L. T., age 38. Normal weight. 104 pounds. Pregrowth
        symptom, some form of insanity. </p>
      <p>In 1920 was confined in an insane asylum for insanity for nine
        months, after which all nervous disturbances disappeared with
        onset of gastric disturbance. In March of 1922 she vomited blood
        and had progressive indigestion with putrid eructations, loss of
        weight and strength and much pain in the back and abdomen,
        particularly in the gastric region. Tarry stools and daily
        vomiting of blood during March and April, when she consulted Dr.
        G. Field who sent her to Harper Hospital where five X-ray
        pictures were taken, and an exploratory operation performed by
        Drs. Angus McLean and Y. D. Barrett. A large gastric cancer was
        found and a specimen removed and sent to the hospital
        pathologist, Dr. P. F. Morse. Three days later the family was
        informed that the disease was cancer and nothing could be done.
        A few weeks later Dr. Pinckert again explored the abdomen and
        reported to the family that the intestines were covered with the
        growth, that she could live only a few days, and requested that
        she be left in the hospital to die so an autopsy could be
        performed: She was taken home and on August 16th, I was called
        to attend the patient. </p>
      <p>Patient extremely emaciated, the skin literally lay on the
        bones; unable to hold herself up or raise herself in bed; had no
        appreciation of surroundings; had taken no food for two weeks,
        but vomited foul material and blood. Abdomen contained one large
        mass, size of two heads, lumpy and completely filling abdomen.
        Family insisted upon my treating patient, in spite of advice
        that it could do no good. The patient was treated. Gradual
        improvement set in with complete recovery by September of the
        following year, when her weight reached 106 pounds. All
        tenderness and the tumor mass had disappeared and a fair
        nutrition was re-established. Patient is now at work daily and
        is well, except for attacks of indigestion that follow dietary
        indiscretions. </p>
      <p>Discussion: In this case the pregrowth symptoms were a toxemia
        of sufficient violence to upset the whole brain activity to the
        extent that insanity was diagnosed. For a period of over a year
        preceding the recognition of the gastric disease, but while it
        was in progress, the nervous intoxication had been overcome
        quite completely. With the cure of the condition both the
        pregrowth intoxication and the cancer manifestation were
        completely cured. The patient was so very sick that whatever
        reactions might have occurred under the treatment, were masked
        by the cancer symptoms, and only improvement was noticed. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 4</i></b>.&nbsp; Cancer of the Rectum. </p>
      <p>Mrs. S., age 48. Normal weight around 100 pounds. There was an
        entire absence of pregrowth symptoms. The patient was well until
        the spring of 1921, when she started to bleed from the rectum
        and a progressive constipation set in. Finally pain in the lower
        spine developed and by spring of 1823, bowel obstruction
        threatened. She entered the Henry Ford Hospital March 17,1923,
        and an operation removing the lower ten inches of the bowel and
        a cancer mass was removed. Diagnosis by microscope proved it to
        be cancer. The patient nearly died of shock, but after two
        months was able to be moved to her home. Her condition rapidly
        grew worse, bleeding odorous discharge, pain and bowel
        obstruction returned with violence. Soon cancer masses appeared
        around and later practically blocked the anus, and the feces
        came through the vagina. She grew weaker and pain in the upper
        abdomen associated with vomiting set in. </p>
      <p>I was called to see this patient August 7.1923. I found patient
        bedfast and thin. Examination of abdomen showed liver
        enlargement reaching one-third distance from ribs to umbilicus
        and a hard three-lobed mass filling the pelvis and reaching from
        pubes to one finger breadth from umbilicus. Examination of anal
        region showed the walls of the orifice to be completely, covered
        and closed by cancer tissue so that exploration within the
        rectum was not attempted. However, through the vagina, a fistula
        opening into the rectum large enough to admit three fingers
        could be explored. The recto-vaginal wall remnant non-elastic,
        thickened and nodular, the whole area was painful, bleeding and
        emitting a characteristic discharge. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given. A febrile reaction occurred the twelfth
        week. Recovery was complete in fourteen weeks, except that the
        recto-vaginal fistula was not completely healed until January,
        1924. At present she is strong can pass a stool as large as
        one's thumb, has no pain and stools all come through the rectum.
        All traces of cancer have disappeared, exploration of the
        recto-vaginal wall can find no abnormality and the patient is
        perfectly well, except for the loss of sphincter control which
        we refer to the results of the operation. She is in perfect
        health today. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case is cited as one of the few examples where
        pregrowth symptoms could not be elicited, but perhaps more
        thorough study of the case would reveal a disturbance that could
        be so classified. The healing of the recto-vaginal fistula
        occurred in this case, as in all others of similar type, and the
        replacement of the wall was not merely a matter of scarring, but
        a reconstruction on the same lines as normally existed. The
        febrile reaction occurring as late as the end of the twelfth
        week after treatment is a fairly usual occurrence and times the
        completion of the cure. </p>
      <p>Other features of the treatment, as outlined above, will be
        illustrated in a further study of case histories in a future
        paper. </p>
      <p>Physicians are invited to study the treatment, at the several
        clinics already established. </p>

      </center>
      <p>In a previous paper in this <i>Journal</i> (1) I outlined the
        fundamental pathology of cancer as an old intoxication,
        explained the function of the growth as a protective effort at
        immunity and demonstrated the cure of the disease by a process
        of conversion of the causative toxin into its anti-toxin. </p>
      <p>Case histories were submitted to illustrate the pregrowth
        intoxication symptoms, reactions occurring during recovery, the
        permanency of the cure and the healing of areas destroyed by the
        growth. These factors as well as the utilization of the cancer
        material undergoing absorption as food material for replenishing
        the body will be further illustrated in this paper by additional
        case histories. <br>
        &nbsp; </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 5</i></b>. Inoperable Cancer of Stomach. </p>
      <p>Mrs. J., of Union City, Michigan, referred by Dr. Hancock and
        Dr. Grice of Union City, Mich., October 30, 1919. The diagnosis
        was made by clinical history, by X-ray, and exploratory
        laparotomy. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>Malaria at ten, menses began at twelve, irregular; five
        children, one abortion at 17. In 1916 the left ovary and five
        tumors were removed from abdomen. In 1916 Dr. McGregor, of
        Battle Creek, did a panhysterectomy and removed a number of
        tumors which he said would recur. October 1st. 1919 Dr.
        McGregor, Dr. Hancock and Dr. Grice did an exploratory
        laparotomy at Battle Creek, Mich. They reported "recurrent
        extension of carcinoma throughout lower abdomen and involving
        stomach and liver; prognosis, three weeks perhaps to live." </p>
      <p>Vomiting of blood started in June, 1919 and persisted unto four
        days after admission into Herman Kiefer Hospital, October 30,
        1919 where she was brought nearly dead, as a test case for the
        Wayne County Medical Society, Wasserman test by University of
        Michigan Hospital reported negative; X-ray and fluoroscopic
        examination by Dr. Gerstine, of Battle Creek: report, inoperable
        carcinoma of stomach. Weight loss from 206 to 180 pounds. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: hysterical all her life, after incidence of
        the growth assuming uraemic type of symptoms; sudden attacks of
        weakness, smothering sensations, loss of consciousness and
        convulsions. </p>
      <p>Treatments were given November 4th and 7th, 1919. Hemorrhages
        stopped after several days and recovery rapidly followed,
        patient discharged from hospital November 26, 1919. She was
        observed by her physicians, Dr. Grice and Dr. Hancock, who
        reported her as completely recovered by June 1920. X-ray
        examination by Dr. Gertsine, who gave the first X-ray diagnosis
        as inoperable cancer of stomach, was again made and the stomach
        found perfectly normal. She is in excellent health today and
        cured of cancer. The Wayne County Medical Society is fully aware
        of the cure in this test case. </p>
      <p>This case illustrates that the comparatively mild pregrowth
        symptoms of hysteria due to the causative toxin can be altered
        by the growth activity on the toxin to become so severe as to
        cause unconsciousness and convulsions. The case also illustrates
        what an extensive case of cancer can be completely cured. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 6</i></b>.&nbsp; Cancer of Stomach and Liver. </p>
      <p>Mrs. Z, age 53, of Sebewaing, Michigan, referred by Dr.
        Friedlander, March 1919. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis by exploratory laparotomy and clinical history. </p>
      <p>Family history:&nbsp; Father died of dropsy at age 71, mother
        died of rapidly growing tumor of uterus at age 71, one sister
        died of cancer at age 65, one brother died of cancer of stomach
        at age 63, four children, one of whom died of convulsions in
        Infancy. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: Scarlet fever at 6 years of
        age; La Grippe and Bronchitis, at 25; Repair operation on uterus
        at 34. Hysterectomy for suspected malignancy, at 47. For 14
        years before admission had gastric ulcer, pains before and after
        eating, occasional vomiting of blood, one/half pint at onetime.
        These symptoms improved somewhat just previous to February 1918;
        when severe attacks of pain set in, doubling patient up. They
        recurred every two weeks, were accompanied by vomiting. There
        was rapid loss of strength and development of cachexia until
        March 1919, when food was no longer retained. Gastric analysis
        showed complete achlorhydria, stools were tarry and exploratory
        laparotomy revealed a large mass of cancer involving the whole
        stomach and liver and occupying the whole upper abdomen. This
        laparotomy was performed by Dr. Friedlander at Grace Hospital,
        Detroit, March 24, 1919. He gave a prognosis of not longer than
        three months to live. The weight of the patient was 130 pounds.
      </p>
      <p>Treatment was instituted and recovery followed gradually. Cure
        with return of normal gastric function and complete
        disappearance of growth was established within one year. It is
        now 6 1/2 years after treatment was started and the woman is in
        excellent health. Her weight is 187. </p>
      <p>This case, like Case 2 of the previous paper, illustrates that
        the pregrowth symptoms in cases where cancer develops on an old
        gastric ulcer are not prominent, that the return of motor and
        secretory function accompany the disappearance of the disease. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 7</i></b>. Primary Cancer of Liver. </p>
      <p>Mrs. V., age 47. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis by clinical history and exploratory laparotomy. </p>
      <p>From Plainwell, Michigan, referred by Dr. C. M. Stuck and Dr.
        McNair of Kalamazoo, Michigan, February 3rd, 1920. Family
        history negative. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient. </p>
      <p>Fairly good health all her life, except for over twelve year of
        dizziness on retiring, blind spells and teichopsia with
        fortification spectra. These symptoms let up almost completely
        by January 1919, but shortly afterwards pains developed in the
        abdomen and under the right shoulder blade. Vomiting set in.
        Emaciation and jaundice and the inability to turn in bed,
        because of the presence of a large sore lump below the ribs on
        the right side, brought her to the surgeon. Laparotomy was
        performed January, 1920, by Dr. McNair and Dr. C. M. Stuck, with
        findings as in following report: "This is to certify that Mrs.
        D. M. V. was operated upon January, 1920. We found the liver
        enlarged and nodulated and much swollen and, in our opinion, it
        was cancer. Closed the wound and at different times (after the
        Koch treatment) I have examined her and on March 12, 1921, could
        find no swelling, soreness or abnormal condition. This
        examination was done at Dr. McNair's office and he also found
        conditions as described on these examinations." Signed C. M.
        Stuck. M. D. </p>
      <p>On admission, the patient was found to have a large mass
        continuous with liver and extending down into the right pelvis
        and across the epigastrium, beyond the midline. She was nearly
        bedfast, weighed perhaps 80 pounds, was jaundiced, vomiting
        frequently, and was in severe pain. </p>
      <p>Treatment was instituted and recovery was gradual, perfect
        health being regained by the spring of the next year, an
        indicated in the above report of her surgeons. She is still in
        perfect health and free from pregrowth and cancer symptoms,
        present weight varies around 130 pounds. </p>
      <p>This case illustrates the more usual type of nervous pregrowth
        symptoms, as well as the growth period symptoms and that both
        disappear with the cure of the disease. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 8</i></b>. Cancer of Stomach. </p>
      <p>Mr. S. (age 54, of Detroit, referred by Dr. Morey. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis, by clinical history and physical examination. </p>
      <p>Family history negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>He had been in fine health all his life, with the exception of
        dizzy spells for a period of five years before his stomach
        started to trouble him. In the fall of 1921, attacks of pain in
        the stomach set in that made him stop work and he frequently had
        to be taken home on this account from the Ford Motor Plan where
        he worked. By April 1922, he became bedfast and was under
        morphine treatment by Dr. Caughey until I was called by Dr.
        Morey to treat him on July 25th, 1922. Patient at that time was
        practically moribund, had been vomiting blood and debris for
        several weeks, a mere skeleton with skin hanging over the bones.
        He had not been able to swallow water or even saliva for some
        three weeks, because of blocking of the, oesophagus by the
        extensive mass of cancer. Examination showed pupils to react
        paradoxically, the mass distended epigastrium and protected 1%,
        inches further out than the ribs and extended to below
        umbilicus. The patient was only partly conscious, too weak to
        turn in bed. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given under protest that it was too late.
        Recovery, however, was rapid. Ten days later, although the
        patient had taken no food, he was able to get out of his bed and
        crawl to the pantry and eat a bowl of beans. This gave rise to
        severe cramps. It was the first food he had taken in over a
        month. Thereafter recovery was steady and by November he was
        able to resume his work at the Ford Motor Plant, having gained
        in weight to 139 pounds from a possible 60 pounds when first
        treated. Examination at the Ford Hospital in October, 1922,
        found him perfectly normal. The large mass of cancer had
        completely disappeared and healed. He is in perfect health today
        with complete absence of pregrowth or cancer symptom. </p>
      <p>This case illustrates the usual pregrowth symptoms and is
        particularly valuable in demonstrating the great nutritional
        value of the cancer tissue as it undergoes digestion, returning
        to the blood stream those elements in useful form that it took
        from the blood stream to build up the growth. For without the
        ten days of nutrition gained from the involuting cancer tissue,
        the absorption of which returned patency to the oesophagus, this
        fellow could never have crawled to the pantry to obtain food, or
        have swallowed it. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 9</i></b>. Carcinoma of Larynx: </p>
      <p>Mr. C. F., age 54, weight 197 pounds, normal weight 206,
        admitted November 26, 1923. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis by clinical history, physical examination and
        microscopic specimen. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>Well all life until three years previously had a nervous
        breakdown. Pregrowth symptoms of years of dizziness that did not
        respond to the treatments given and persisted until hoarseness
        and pain in throat commenced in May 1923. On November 2, 1923,
        specimen was removed by Dr. Simpson at Harper Hospital, Detroit,
        and microscopic examination by the hospital pathologist proved
        it to be cancer. The specimen was reviewed at the University of
        Michigan and confirmed to be cancer. Gross diagnosis by Dr.
        Canfield at Ann Arbor was cancer, Recommendations were made by
        several surgeons that tracheotomy be performed, as the growth
        was obstructing breathing and dyspnoea was severe. Difficulty in
        swallowing had set in and speech was reduced to a faint whisper.
        Examination showed both vocal cords involved by carcinoma and
        large extensions involved the glands of both sides of neck,
        largest mass in left cervical glands, size of one's little
        finger. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given and recovery was rapid, speech returning
        and the dyspnoea subsided and ability to swallow returned. All
        masses were cleared up in twelve weeks and the body weight
        improved to 225 pounds in that time, and examinations by a
        number of surgeons, found the patient cured. He is in perfect
        health today, speech normal, has been lecturing for a living for
        the past year. </p>
      <p>This case again presents the usual pregrowth symptoms of
        dizziness subsiding with the advent of the growth, and the
        sufficient repair by the healing process to permit return of
        function. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 10</i></b>. Cancer of Breast, with Paget's Disease.
      </p>
      <p>Mrs. C. P., age 47, weight 110 pounds, normal weight 130. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis by clinical history and physical examination. </p>
      <p>Family history negative as to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>Patient stated she was well all her life, except for rheumatism
        several years previously. Had had the usual pregrowth dizziness
        for ten years before the growth came in the breast, at which
        time the dizziness disappeared. In March, 1919, pain started in
        the right breast and shoulder and shortly was severs in region
        of right shoulder blade. Sleep and work was thereby interfered
        with, very tired all the time, lost 70 pounds in weight by
        November, 1919, and because of shortness of breath and severe
        coughing, had difficulty in climbing stairs. </p>
      <p>She had been treating with Dr. James Davis, a surgeon and
        pathologist, who gave the diagnosis of Paget's disease and
        recommended a radical operation that might, he stated,
        permanently result in the loss of use of the right arm, but
        could not promise a cure. She refused operation and presented
        herself for treatment November 5, 1919. At this time my
        examination revealed that the right nipple had largely eroded
        away and the areola was largely involved by a typical Paget's
        disease. Behind the nipple was a hard mass attached to skin and
        parieties about the size of an egg, another mass at the inner
        end of the third Interspace and a mass slightly smaller than the
        first in the anterior axillary border and attached to skin and
        parieties about the size of an egg, another mass and involving
        the pectoralis major muscle, smaller masses deep in the axilla
        and supra clavicular space could be palpated. There was evidence
        of pulmonary involvement on the right side, as well as of the
        subscapular glands. Treatment was instituted and immediate
        improvement noted. She was observed during her recovery at
        intervals by Dr. Davis, until he stated on July 26. 1920, that
        she was cured. She has gained in weight to 188 pounds, all
        masses have disappeared, the nipple has healed and perfect
        health is restored. She works hard every day and remains cured.
        This case, with affidavits proving the diagnosis, was submitted
        among others to the local medical society. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This patient's recovery demonstrates the complete
        disappearance of all symptoms of the disease, the pregrowth
        intoxication, as well as the cachexia symptoms of the growth
        period. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 11</i></b>. Sarcoma of Brain. </p>
      <p>Mrs. T. R., age 85. </p>
      <p>Normal weight 209, weight on admission about 70: </p>
      <p>Diagnosis by clinical history, X-ray and physical findings. </p>
      <p>Family history negative as to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>She had a. fever in Russia many years before, but was well
        otherwise until the present illness began in the summer of 1921.
        There were no pregrowth symptoms. The trouble started as
        headache, interference with vision and a gradual loss of the use
        of the right arm. By November, 1921, she consulted a doctor and
        in December, 1921, she was taken to Harper Hospital at Detroit,
        where the cranial nerves were all studied and a piece of the
        skull as big as the palm of a man's hand was removed from the
        side. A diagnosis of brain tumor was made, and two deep X-ray
        treatments were given. Her condition became worse: When she left
        the hospital two weeks later, the relief of pressure obtained by
        the decompression, had given way to recurrence of the pain and
        paralysis. At this time the scalp was not raised at the
        decompression area, but after her return home, a gradual
        swelling of this area was observed. This increased until in
        July, 1922, when I was called to see the patient, a hard mass as
        big as a grape fruit projected from the decompression area, and
        a new mass as big as a fist had developed in the dorsal spine.
        The patient at this time was reduced to a skeleton, completely
        paralyzed, blind, able to speak, and there was persistent
        projectile vomiting of the most severe type; her headache was
        terrific. This was seven months after the X-ray treatments had
        been given, and the patient was about to die. She had lost so
        much weight, that her husband carried her about like a child. </p>
      <p>She was given treatment and rapidly recovered. All traces of
        growths completely disappeared in five months, all paralysis,
        vomiting and blindness disappeared and her weight was restored
        to 180 pounds. In another ten months her weight reached 220
        pounds, where it stands today. She is in perfect health, working
        hard every day. The bone removed from the skull has now been
        nearly completely replaced. </p>
      <p>This case well illustrates the tendency after this treatment to
        re-establish the normal health. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 12</i></b>. Sarcoma Involving the Spine and Whole
        Abdomen: </p>
      <p>Mrs. J. W., age 43, weight 85, referred by a cured patient,
        August 18, 1922. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis by clinical history, exploratory operation and
        specimen findings. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>Had been ailing for about seven years with dizziness and blind
        spells, which let up just prior to 1920, when disturbances
        referable to pressure within the abdomen developed. At this time
        her legs started to swell and severe attacks of pain that
        doubled her up, came at intervals. These attacks finally became
        rather frequent and were diagnosed as attacks of intestinal
        obstruction. At this time, she could feel the growth that
        distended her abdomen and was referred to the surgeon for
        operation. </p>
      <p>An exploratory operation was performed by Dr. Angus, McLean and
        Dr. Francis Dufeld at Harper Hospital on August 7, 1922. A
        specimen was removed for microscopic diagnosis and the wound
        closed without any attempt at removing the growth, which was
        found to extend throughout the abdomen. The surgeon thought she
        might live ten days and she was taken home to die. Her strength
        rapidly failed and in ten days she could not longer raise her
        hands to feed herself. At this time I was called to treat her.
        Examination showed a large mass distending the abdomen and
        extending from the ribs to deep in the pelvis. Its size was much
        larger than a man's head. Both legs were swollen enormously. The
        patient was in great pain and very weak. The family was advised
        that it was most likely too late to obtain any results from the
        treatment, but they wished to take a chance, so treatment was
        given. Recovery was gradual. She was back to her household
        duties within five months and is in perfect health today. All
        traces of the mass have disappeared, the swelling has long since
        left, and her natural vigor has returned. She is in perfect
        health and is cured. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This was a case of small round cell sarcoma, as
        proven by the microscope. Its extent was exceptionally great.
        The patient's physical condition was, decidedly unfavorable, and
        yet complete recovery, followed the treatment. All pregrowth and
        growth symptoms have disappeared. It is therefore evident that
        the material injected into the patient was able to remove the
        essential pathology, as in carcinoma. Both diseases are
        therefore fundamentally identical. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 13.</i></b> Sarcoma of Tibia. </p>
      <p>Dr. W. E. L., age 65, weight 129, referred by Dr. W. A. Dewy. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis: clinical, and by X-ray. </p>
      <p>Family history negative as to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: </p>
      <p>Well all his life. In the winter of 1920, after an injury to
        the left leg, a painful swelling developed, that by March, 1921,
        involved the whole upper half of the tibia. Radiographs showed
        the condition to be sarcoma of the bone, one surgical friend
        suggested curetting the bone and another amputation at the hip,
        but none of these procedures appealed to the patient, who is a
        doctor of wide experience. Examination in March, 1921, revealed
        considerable rough thickening of the upper half of the tibia,
        with changes in adjacent parts of the fibula of the left leg.
        These were verified by the X-ray. The whole leg was swollen and
        painful and walking only possible through help of support.
        Treatment was given and recovery gradually took place. After
        four months recovery was complete. He is perfectly well today,
        there were no pregrowth symptoms elicited in this case. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case is cited to illustrate one of the few
        sarcomas that developed without pregrowth symptoms, and
        corresponds to the very small portion of cases of carcinoma that
        give no history of pregrowth intoxication. However, a careful
        examination of the history of this case might reveal symptoms
        that could be so classified. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 14</i></b>. Small Cell Sarcoma. </p>
      <p>Mr. B. J., of Plainwell, Mich., age 52, weight 147 pounds. </p>
      <p>This involved the left groin, the left thigh and all the organs
        of the abdomen. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis: clinical and by microscope. </p>
      <p>Family history negative as to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past history and status of patient: Influenza in 1891, scarlet
        fever and diphtheria when young. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: dizziness came five years before the
        growth, during the fourth year was very bad, would fall over and
        lose control of himself, with blindness, on looking up, on
        turning off light on retiring, things would go around and go
        around; if he fixed eyes on an object, it would sway. There were
        no headaches. These symptoms started to let up four months
        before the growth was noticed. January 9; 1922; he noticed lump
        in left groin, size of a lima bean. It grew rapidly and in three
        weeks was as big as a goose egg. It was removed on or about
        February 4, 1922 by Dr. McNaire. The disease returned after the
        second X-ray treatment given at the Battle Creek Sanitarium
        (Kellogg's) by Dr. Case. The first X-ray treatment was given
        about March 5, 1922, and the second one about three weeks
        afterward. The recurrence was noted early in April, with pain
        and the spreading of the mass through the abdomen, also swelling
        in the leg. The opening left from the operation grew deeper and
        urine drained through the side. The third X-ray treatment was
        very heavy. This was given two weeks after the second, and
        another three weeks later. The growth grew more rapidly than
        ever, and in August on his first appearance here, the abdomen
        was found to be distended with a mass reaching above umbilicus
        on both sides, farther on left. There were liver masses, leg was
        swollen all the way down, the penis and the scrotum were
        enormously edematous, pains were present all the time, worse on
        motion and extended through both sides of the abdomen, to the
        small of back, down the left leg and thigh and up the left side
        and they were also in the right chest and liver and in the right
        arm and shoulder. Patient reported severe attacks of asthma. A
        corrupt odorous bloody discharge issued from the open
        sarcomatous area in left groin. Diagnosis made from tissue
        removed was Sarcoma. </p>
      <p>During treatment, dizziness recurred and the asthma was worse.
        The pains gradually disappeared with the disappearance of the
        growth and the healing of the open lesion. The swelling and
        oedema in various parts all left, the dizziness and the scotoma
        all disappeared within twelve months. </p>
      <p>On examination in fall of 1923 he was found to be apparently
        cured. Examination April, 1924, showed all disease removed. An
        examination in March, 1925, confirms the cure. </p>
      <p>Present condition of leg-It swells below the area of the X-ray
        application, especially after walking around all day (attributed
        to lymphatic injury, caused by the X-ray). He gained in weight
        from 147 to 185 pounds. </p>
      <p>Discussion: In this case as in the preceding case of sarcoma of
        the brain, the X-ray treatment made the disease grow more
        rapidly and spread it even after the surgical removal. It did
        not even prevent recurrence, but more exactly hastened the
        spread of the disease. Thus the essential pathology does not
        seem to lend itself, to X-ray therapy. </p>
      <p>The characteristic pregrowth symptoms likewise are those so
        frequently met with in carcinoma and the immunity effort of the
        growth is to some extent effective, as in carcinoma, since here
        as in carcinoma, these symptoms were nearly abolished when the
        growth came. </p>
      <p>As the large mass of sarcoma was absorbed, it unloaded its
        stored pregrowth toxin in sufficient concentration to cause
        again the pregrowth symptoms while this toxin was undergoing
        change into antitoxin. </p>
      <p><b>GENERAL DISCUSSION OF CASES</b> </p>
      <p>The persistence of the intoxication of the pregrowth period, as
        expressed in dizziness, momentary loss of sensory perceptions,
        is present alike in sarcoma and in carcinoma, and when the
        growth comes, this intoxication is much lessened or abolished.
        The exceptions are the few cases where rodent ulcer or gastric
        ulcer are present to represent the pre-cancer symptoms, that the
        nervous type of symptoms are not prominent, and where in some
        few cases even after the growth comes, the pregrowth symptoms
        are not ameliorated, but may even get worse. </p>
      <p>The true pathology of cancer is the same, whether carcinoma or
        sarcoma be the lesionary expression of the disease. Likewise the
        attempted function of both is identical. </p>
      <p>Both types of cases cure up equally well on the same treatment,
        and the identity of the fundamental pathology is thus
        established in both. </p>
      <p>The effort at protection of the body against the causative
        toxin, therefore, does not depend upon the histological
        structure of the tissue as a selective feature, but depends upon
        some other influence, as for instance, the exposure of the
        tissue that undergoes the change, to a higher threshold value of
        excitation by the toxin. And this would occur where irritation
        and prolonged congestion of the tissue allowed a greater amount
        of toxin to flow through the tissue in unit time over a
        sufficient period to bring about change. The only favoring
        selective feature about the tissue must rest with its functional
        inertia; and tissues occupied with steady physiological work and
        under the restraints of physiological control, would be less
        likely to alter their direction of activity than tissues at
        rest, like the uterus or mammary gland. </p>
      <p>That the cancer tissue is very satisfactory food material is
        shown in "Case 8" where the absorption of the growth gave
        sufficient nutrition to so replenish the exhausted patient as to
        permit him to crawl some twenty feet to the pantry, when ten
        days previously he could not turn over in bed, for in this
        period he took no food. Correlarily, the obstruction of the
        oesophagus which was complete for over a month previous to the
        treatment, had given way during these ten days of absorption of
        the growth so that he could swallow the beans after crawling to
        the pantry. Thus the material from which the growth is built up,
        is again returned to the blood stream as physiological
        nutritional units. Therefore the process of involution of the
        cancer tissue depends upon the reversibility of the reaction of
        cell synthesis, and is a purely physiological affair, proving,
        that the treatment administered has no direct destructive action
        upon the growth, but as our premises state, the treatment
        removes the requisite for cancer growth, and is therefore
        fundamental. </p>
      <p>More features will be submitted in another paper. Physicians
        are cordially invited to study the treatment of adoption. </p>

        <p><b>PART III</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In the preceding papers published in this <i>Journal</i> (May
        and July 1926) cancer was demonstrated to be a protective
        response against an old intoxication by a definite substance.
        Case histories were detailed to illustrate the effects of this
        poison in producing pregrowth symptoms which affected the
        'central nervous system. The toxin was proven to be the same in
        both carcinoma and sarcoma and the process of recovery under our
        treatment was illustrated through case histories. </p>
      <p>The present paper deals with the causative intoxication, as
        expressed by certain syndromes that are generally classified as
        idiopathic diseases. Thus the symptoms of the pregrowth
        intoxication may be simple goitre or toxic goitre, a gastric
        ulcer, a migraine or arteriosclerosis. </p>
      <p><b>CANCER OF UTERUS</b> </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 15. </i></b>Cancer of Uterus, Mrs. M., age 48.
        Family history negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all her life until her children came,
        thereafter poor health. There was some dizziness. An ovary and
        the appendix were removed by Dr. Max Ballin of Detroit, in 1918.
        The left breast was removed by the same operator in 1919. The
        dizziness increased, neuritis set in, and the thyroid gland
        enlarged some; nervousness; tremors, exophthalmus, and loss of
        weight were mild, but noticeable. In 1920 she began to suffer
        pain in the lower back. There was a bloody discharge from the
        uterus. In February 1922, she had a severe uterine hemorrhage.
        Thereafter the thyroid enlargement and thyrotoxic symptoms
        greatly increased. She consulted Dr. S. C: Runnells and Dr.
        Rubin Peterson of the surgical staff of the University of
        Michigan in May 1922. Both made a diagnosis of cancer of the
        uterus, far advanced. Dr. Peterson told her, she reports, that
        unless she were immediately operated upon, she would not live
        ten days. She refused operation and came to me for treatment the
        following day. </p>
      <p>I was impressed at a glance that the case was one of extreme
        thyrotoxicosis. The patient was bordering on collapse: after
        resting several hours, pulse irregular, 460, respirations 38 per
        minute. Exophthalmus marked, Stellwag's and Greefe's signs
        positive, sweat, tremor and high pulse pressure. Loss of weight
        16 pounds last month, weight less than 104 pounds. Left lobe of
        thyroid moderately enlarged, several bean to peach stone size
        tumors in left supraclavicular space, close to the thyroid.
        Axillary glands on left side slightly enlarged, several small
        tumors below clavicle on left side over operation area, about
        sear of breast amputation. Cardiac dullness increased and apex
        beat shifted toward post-axillary border. Heart action
        tumultuous, functional murmurs, liver enlarged. </p>
      <p>Uterus, fixed, enlarged to size of grapefruit, reaching halfway
        to umbilicus. Cervix, nodular, 2 inches wide; hard, purplish;
        ulcerated, a typical carcinoma appearance, a bloody foul
        discharge. Complained of pain in legs, back and abdomen; painful
        micturition and difficulty at stool. Treatment Instituted, and
        recovery completed in four months, with disappearance of all
        thyrotoxic symptoms, gain of weight to 142 pounds, disappearance
        of all thyroid enlargements and masses thereabout, and return of
        uterus to normal. At present she reports better health than she
        has enjoyed for many years; holds a gain of 88 pounds. </p>
      <p>Discussion: In this case the thyroid effort let up when the
        toxin causing the cancer was removed by the cancer treatment,
        and the toxin must therefore, have been causal to the thyroid
        condition, as well as of the cancer. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 16. </i></b>Simple Goitre and Cancer of Bowel and
        Uterus. </p>
      <p>Mrs. S., age 85, normal weight 152 pounds, referred by Rev. R.
      </p>
      <p>Family History, Father had sarcoma of right knee. </p>
      <p>Past History: Tonsillitis periodically for years. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms and status of patient: An enlarged thyroid
        gland for past 6 years, that increased in size with onset of
        rectal trouble, some dizziness throughout this period, with
        short blind spells, which let up during the last year. She had
        suffered with piles for years, was operated for them nine years
        ago and again three years ago. Later treated by Dr. Mowry for a
        time, but as the trouble got much worse, he referred her to a
        surgeon, Dr. Thompson, who made a diagnosis of cancer and
        refused to accept the case. This was in November 1922. Applied
        to me for treatment Dec. 15, 1922. She had suffered severely for
        several months, pain in back and down the legs, bleeding from
        rectum and vagina, great difficulty of bowel movement, and
        finally the passage of all fecal matter through the vagina, plus
        a discharge of blood and pus. Weight on admission 125 pounds,
        anemic and weak: </p>
      <p>I examined her on Dec. 15, 1922: it was impossible to explore
        through the anus, as this was blocked by a mass of cancer.
        Vaginal examination revealed a hard nodular posterior wall, with
        a hard nodular fistula opening into the rectal cavity, large
        enough to admit two fingers. The cancer mass extended to and
        involved the uterus which likewise was nodular, greatly
        enlarged, hard and immovable. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given; recovery complete in five months, bowel
        movements passing through the rectum without pain. Within 9
        months the recto-vaginal fistula was completely healed all signs
        and symptoms of cancer, and the thyroid enlargement having,
        completely disappeared. Her weight returned to normal and
        perfect health remains reestablished. She was examined by a
        number of doctors who could not understand the healing of the
        recto-vaginal wall without scar formation, and with perfect
        return to normal structure. She remains cured. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case is cited to show a very common thyroid
        enlargement preceding, and persisting with the development of
        cancer, which disappeared after the cancer treatment was given.
        The thyroid enlargement can be aptly referred to an effort on
        the part of the gland to work against the cancer producing
        toxin, as this enlargement disappears with the removal of the
        cancer poison. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 17</i></b>. Goitre and Cancer of Uterus. </p>
      <p>Mrs. M., referred by Dr. Geo. Hale, February 1922. </p>
      <p>Family History negative. </p>
      <p>Past History: Patient reports she was well all her life until
        enlargement of neck came on several years previously. She had
        had some dizziness in the past, but this was not noticed
        recently. One year ago she had severe uterine bleeding. A
        curettement for diagnostic purposes that proved the condition to
        be cancer and an operation with attempt at removal were
        performed by Dr. Wellington Yates. This procedure only
        aggravated the condition. During the last six weeks there was
        bleeding and discharge from the uterus; she daily vomited blood
        and could retain no food. Examination Feb. 6, 1922, revealed
        patient to be very emaciated. There was an enlargement of the
        thyroid region, which doubled the size of the neck, the right
        eye bulged and turned outward, the right arm was in constant
        tremor, large areas of consolidation were in the chest. The
        abdomen was one lumpy mass of cancer continuous with the uterine
        mass, that bled and discharged a putrid fluid. The patient was
        still vomiting blood daily, often a pint at a time, she reports.
        She complained of terrific headaches, that had persisted for a
        number of years. </p>
      <p>Treatment was instituted, recovery by June, 1922, with return
        to normal weight, the eye returned to its normal position, and
        the arm to proper nerve control, thyroid enlargement
        disappeared, also the masses in abdomen and pelvis, with healing
        of the vaginal vault. She was treated again in October, 1922,
        and has been normal in all respects and at work as a nurse ever
        since. </p>
      <p>This also illustrates the relation of goitre to cancer and
        demonstrates how severe a case can be cured. </p>

      <p>Mrs. B., age 85. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all her life except for last few years she
        had had a very marked bladder disturbance with passage of bloody
        urine, pregrowth symptoms of dizziness and a tendency to drop
        with blind spells. The thyroid gland had been moderately
        enlarged for last thirty years. A cancer of tongue started as a
        sore spot on the right side in January, 1922. This was examined
        by Dr. MacCormick and Dr. Murphy of Toledo, Ohio. A specimen
        removed at St. Vincent's Hospital, Toledo, proved to be cancer
        tissue. Radium was applied twice, with slight improvement, then
        rapid aggravation, so that by May 1922; her family physician,
        Dr. Willett, of Elmore, Ohio, sent her to The University
        Hospital at Ann Arbor, Mich., that something might be done
        quickly. Here she was examined by Dr. B. Canfield, she reports,
        who found her condition hopeless and refused to do anything but
        give her morphine. </p>
      <p>She came to me for treatment on the next day. My examination,
        May 23,1922, found the patient emaciated, arteries sclerotic, an
        arcus senilis, the whole mouth full of cancer so that it could
        not be closed, a foul bloody discharge, the whole tongue one
        mass of cancer, impossible to talk, or eat, pain terrific,
        metastases to glands on both sides of neck, the thyroid enlarged
        to twice normal size. There was a mass in the pelvis; presumable
        a bladder tumor, bloody urine, and painful micturition. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given, recovery was rapid, all cancer tissue and
        discharge had disappeared with complete healing by July 7, 1922.
        In November 1922, her recovery was demonstrated to the doctors
        at the University, who had refused to take her case, having
        believed she was a hopeless case. They found her all healed and
        cured, they admitted. She remains cured and is in perfect
        health, round and fat, with elastic arteries and the arcus
        senilis has disappeared. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case illustrates that a goitre of thirty years
        standing and senile manifestations disappear after this
        treatment for cancer, which indicates that the cancer causing
        toxin was present in her system for a long period before the
        growth came and was responsible for the senility changes, and
        the goitre, for these, as well as the cancer, all disappeared
        with the cure of the cancer. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 19</i></b>. Goitre senility and cancer. </p>
      <p>Mrs. R., age 57. </p>
      <p>Family History: Father died of erysipelas, age 39, mother died
        of a stroke, age 72, no history of cancer in family. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all her life until May, 1923, when present
        illness set in with pain across abdomen. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms of dizziness and transient blind spells for
        about eight years before growth came. Some dimness of vision for
        the last few years getting worse. The doctors claimed she had
        high blood pressure. Moderate goitre. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: After some months of pain in abdomen and
        back she was examined by Dr. Phillips, her family doctor, who
        made a diagnosis of cancer of the uterus. Went to the Mayo
        clinic in June 1923, where a diagnosis of cancer of the uterus
        was made and radium and X-ray treatments given. The husband was
        told by the Mayo surgeons that they could not cure her.
        Condition grew worse during the next six months. She applied for
        treatment here on November 6th, 1923. </p>
      <p>Examination revealed a large mass of cancer filling the abdomen
        men below the umbilicus and extending above the umbilicus one
        and one-half inches on the left side. The vaginal vault was
        widely distended by the mass. No cervix could be differentiated
        from the rest of the mass. Discharge, bloody and muco-purulent,
        moderate arcus senilis, arteries hardened and somewhat nodular,
        lenses opaque. She complained of marked bladder disturbance and
        pain. She had lost in weight to 115 pounds. There were areas of
        pigment over sides of neck, cheeks, forehead and several over
        abdomen. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given and recovery took place rapidly, gained in
        weight 3/4 pound per week until 168 pounds was attained The
        whole cancer mass had disappeared in six months and perfect
        health was reestablished. All senile changes had likewise
        disappeared, as well as the goitre and areas of pigmentation.
        She is in perfect health today. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case is cited to illustrate that with the cure
        of disease, the removal of the causative agent, all toxic and
        senile changes are disposed of. This case confirms further the
        relation of goitre and senility causing toxin to the genesis of
        cancer. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 20</i></b>. Goitre and Cancer of Prostrate. </p>
      <p>Mr. R., age 75. </p>
      <p>Family history negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms; had blind spells for 15 to 20 years became
        dizzy on looking up or going up. Blind spells and difficult
        vision off and on for distances that should ordinarily be easy.
        This all let up during the last two years. Enlargement of
        thyroid moderate, but noticeable for many years. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Started losing weight three years ago from
        166 to 138 at present, with development of nearly complete bowel
        obstruction, never passed blood from bowel; greatest loss of
        weight in last few months, cachexia and suffering very severe
        pain. Examination showed the liver enlarged to halfway to
        umbilicus, mass extending up from pelvis to two-thirds way to
        umbilicus. Rectal exploration revealed small rough, patch size
        of dollar on posterior wall, and an enormously enlarged prostate
        mass extending beyond reach of examining anger, continuous with
        the mass extending into abdomen, which also obstructs the
        sigmoid. </p>
      <p>Treatment given, recovery complete with complete return to
        normal health in 8 months. All masses and also the goitre
        enlargement have disappeared and prostate returned to normal
        size and structure. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 21. </i></b>Goitre and Cancer of Rectum. </p>
      <p>Mrs. J., age 38. </p>
      <p>Family History: Father had cancer of lip. Past History: Well
        all life until present complaint. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms and status of patient: Goitre for some five
        years, only moderate enlargement. Dizziness with blind spells
        for 12 years, let up some months ago. Rectal trouble started as
        bleeding from bowel, continuous for a week at a time in spells,
        caused some anemia. Two years ago developed Gain in the back and
        right hip. This grew rapidly worse, so that it drove the patient
        out of bed and seriously interfered with sleep. Eight months ago
        the pain shooting up the spine became intolerable. A bloody
        purulent foul rectal discharge then developed, and for the five
        weeks before admission, bleeding was profuse, a cupful a day,
        patient reports, bowel movements practically obstructed with
        terrific pain at stool, bladder, very irritable, with sensation
        of heavy pressure and frequent urination, patient rapidly
        failing. </p>
      <p>Examination November 28,1922. Marked cachexia, Hemoglobin 16
        percent, lips bloodless, slight exophthalmus, marked tremor,
        fair increase in thyroid, mass in right supraclavicular space
        size of walnut bound down hard nodular, pulse 148, respiration
        30, heart dilated, functional murmur, liver enlarged and nodular
        extending two inches below costal border. Large growth filling
        abdomen below umbilicus, with egg and orange size masses
        extending above umbilicus. Rectal examination revealed foul
        bloody discharge, a large carcinomatous ring occupying nearly
        the whole rectal wall, with central nodular depression and
        continuous with carcinomatous mass occupying the belly. </p>
      <p>Treatment given and recovery complete, with disappearance, of
        all masses, thyroid enlargement, healing and reestablishing of
        normal rectal contour and structure, return to perfect health,
        H. 90 per cent, perfectly strong and well, February, 19211. She
        is still in perfect health and cured. </p>
      <p>Discussion: In this case also the thyroid enlargement existed
        for years before the growth came, but the pregrowth intoxication
        symptoms did not let up because of the thyroid effort. The whole
        condition cured up only after the cancer causing toxin was
        removed by the treatment. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 22.</i></b> Goitre and Cancer of the Bladder. </p>
      <p>Mr. R., age 65, referred by Dr. St. John. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well until urine shut off in July 1921. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms and status of patient: Thyroid enlargement
        for years, no history of toxin symptoms, operated at University
        of Michigan Hospital, August 16, and 19, 1921, by Dr. Beebe,
        superpubic drainage established and diagnosis of cancer of
        bladder confirmed. Relief obtained through the superpubic
        drainage, but cancer kept growing, until obstruction of bowel
        threatened in fall of 1923. Came to me for treatment December
        21, 1923, complaining of swelling and pain across abdomen and
        painful passage of bloody urine through the superpubic opening,
        loss of weight 15 pounds. Examination revealed rectum occluded
        by a large mass continuous with the mass filling lower abdomen
        to level of umbilicus. Treatment was given and recovery, with
        complete disappearance of goitre and all cancer masses and
        restoration of perfect health by summer of 1924, the urine being
        passed through penis without difficulty. He is in perfect health
        today. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case also demonstrates the relation of the
        goitre to the pregrowth intoxication and in this m se the
        thyroid effort might possibly be credited with suppression of
        the symptoms usually present, before the growth appears. </p>
      <p><b>GENERAL DISCUSSION OF CASES</b> </p>
      <p>The fact that a single chemical substance that converts the
        toxin, causative to cancer, into its antitoxin, thus removing
        the cause of cancer and producing immunity to cancer, also
        causes to disappear certain symptom complexes that have preceded
        the development of cancer, clearly indicates the identity of the
        cause of cancer, with that of the other conditions. Thus toxic
        goitre, some instances of simple goitre, and sclerotic changes
        affecting blood vessels, the cornea and lens and the prostate
        have the same etiology as cancer. </p>
      <p>The thyroid response is a self-protective one. I do not infer
        that the toxin at the bottom of cancer is the only one to which
        we may have a goitre response. We have simply demonstrated here
        that the toxin causing cancer will bring about a response on the
        part, of the thyroid gland, which does not materially protect
        the body against the toxin and does not prevent cancer from
        developing. The thyroid response may be excessive and all the
        symptoms of toxic goitre be present. The thyroid response may
        show exhaustion in that its function is hampered, and the
        symptoms of myxedema arise, as in the case of Mrs. B., (Case
        27). Removal of the toxin reestablishes normality, and the gland
        returns to its original physiological activity. Therefore, the
        toxin causing cancer acts injuriously upon the thyroid so long
        as it is present and the thyroid response is directed toward its
        own protection. </p>
      <p><b>GASTRIC ULCER AND CANCER</b> </p>
      <p>The next four cases will show that gastric ulcer, duodenal
        ulcer, and rodent ulcer are likewise responses to the toxin that
        causes cancer, occurring in tissues not able to withstand the
        destructive effect of the toxin, nor yet able to give a
        reproductive response as occurs in cancer. Such ulcers may
        become the site of a future malignancy, or the growth may
        develop in some other part of the body, as in the case of Mr. M.
        (Case 23). In these cases there are other symptoms of the
        presence of the toxin that causes cancer. The ulcer then is but
        one sign of the presence of this toxin. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 23.</i></b> Gastric Ulcer and Cancer of. Colon. </p>
      <p>Mr. M., age 54, referred by Dr. Geo. Hale. </p>
      <p>Family History, Negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well except for gastric ulcer of ten years'
        standing. Pregrowth symptoms, gastric ulcer ten years, let up
        one year ago. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Diagnosis of gastric ulcer at Henry Ford
        Hospital 8 years ago by X-ray and clinical history, no relief
        therefrom until one year ago he noticed a change in symptoms.
        There was progressive difficulty in moving the bowels for the
        last six months, bloody and tarry stools, two tender classes
        developed, one in the right lower abdomen and the other just
        below the ribs on the same side. He could feel disturbances
        there as gas and material seemed to work through the intestine,
        pain was very severe. Examination by Dr. Hale and X-ray
        examination by Dr. Meinke, July 1924, resulted in a diagnosis of
        cancer of the ascending colon, widespread and causing nearly
        complete obstruction. The loss of weight was 17 pounds in last
        two months, the pain was terrific at night arid for last 8
        months he was rapidly getting weak. </p>
      <p>Treatment given September 5, 1924. Recovery was complete with
        normal bowel movements and a disappearance of the growth in four
        months. The patient reports that the stomach functions better
        than for the last ten years. He no longer has any symptoms of
        ulcer. </p>
      <p>Thus we see that the condition of gastric ulcer may, serve as a
        pregrowth symptom to cancer of a different organ. Both
        conditions are cured permanently by removing their common cause
      </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 24</i>.</b> Gastric Ulcer, Senile Changes and
        Cancer. </p>
      <p>Mr. D., age 62, normal weight 150. </p>
      <p>Family History negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Typhoid when 16 years old. Pregrowth symptoms;
        occasional blind spells, staggers and dizzy spells for 18 years.
        These symptoms all let up during the last year. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Stomach has bothered him for the last 20
        years, periodical attacks of pain, required black pepper and
        whiskey to stop attacks and carried a supply for that purpose;
        frequent hyperacidity, weak spells followed by periods of tarry
        stools. By February 1924, the attacks had become so severe that
        he had to be carried home from work and with each attack he
        vomited bright blood. The last attack was on August. 16, 1924,
        when the patient became bedfast, could no longer take food, and
        vomited blood and corrupt matter. Examination on August 25,
        1924, found the patient bedfast, unable to walk 20 feet, dim
        vision, arcus senilis, arterio-sclerosis, cachectic, emaciated,
        in terrific pain, pulse weak 150, had been vomiting blood. </p>
      <p>A mass in abdomen filled the epigastrium to the umbilicus, the
        supraclavicular gland on left side, size of large walnut, was
        hard, nodular and tender. Diagnosis; extensive gastric carcinoma
        developed on old gastric ulcer. Treatment was given and
        recovery, with complete disappearance, of all growths, a return
        of normal strength and gastric function and able to be at work
        by December 1924. The arcus senilis and arteriosclerosis have
        practically disappeared. He remains well and has had no attacks
        of trouble referable to the old gastric ulcer. The stomach
        functions normally. Thus, he is cured. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case demonstrates a very far advanced cancer
        of the stomach developing on an old gastric ulcer, and the
        presence of senile changes, all of which cleared up when the
        basic cause of the disease was removed. </p>

      <p>Mr. F., age 38. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Measles and chickenpox in childhood, pneumonia at
        20 and again 4 years ago. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms and status of patient: Stomach trouble
        started as indigestion when 16 years of age always taking soda.
        Operated on in 1913 by Dr. Wm. Campbell, of Pittsburgh, for
        appendicitis, the appendix was found normal; operated on in 1914
        by the same surgeon for gastric ulcer, who resected two small
        and one large ulcer and made a gastroenterostomy; no relief. He
        kept taking soda continually, the stools black, had pain and
        gas, was unable to straighten up for years, the pain extended
        through the epigastrium to the back. He was careful about diet
        to date of admission, was very nervous all the time. In the year
        1920, his weigh dropped from the normal of 166 to 136. On
        January 8, 1920, he had two severe gastric hemorrhages that left
        him nearly bloodless and cold. Tarry stools were passed for
        several succeeding days. An examination on January 12, 1920,
        revealed a mass the size of a fist in the epigastrium. Treatment
        given and recovery was complete in 4 months with disappearance
        of all stomach trouble and the mass in abdomen. He now weighs
        197 pounds and is in the best health he ever experience; stomach
        functions perfectly on any diet </p>
      <p>Discussion: Thus gastric ulcer is really a pregrowth cancer
        symptom and replaces the usual nervous symptoms of dizziness,
        etc. This case is valuable in illustrating how chronic a
        condition can be completely overcome by specific treatment. </p>

      <p>Past History: Scarlet fever at 13 years of age and diphtheria
        at 36 years of age. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms and status of patient: Trouble started ten
        years previously, with indigestion and vague abdominal pains,
        prolonged blind spells and dizziness for seven years of this
        period. Uterus and fibroid tumors were removed and two years
        later an ovary and the appendix were removed at the Battle Creek
        Sanitarium. The stomach trouble kept getting worse, so was
        treated for gastric ulcer. March 1922, the gall bladder was
        removed at Battle Creek Sanitarium, the surgeon found a growth
        obstructing the pylorus. The patient reports that a
        gastro-enterostomy was performed. No relief was obtained but the
        patient grew rapidly worse, terrific pain in abdomen and back,
        continual vomiting of undigested food and blood. </p>
      <p>Admitted November 13, 1922. Examination revealed a large growth
        filling epigastrium to the umbilicus and extending below
        umbilicus on right side. Treatment administered and recovery
        rapidly followed, all the mass having disappeared by January
        1923. Perfect gastric function was not established, however,
        until several months later. She is in good health today, able to
        do six washings a week with ease. Has perfect stomach function.
      </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case also illustrates that, the gastric ulcer
        represents the pregrowth symptoms but not necessarily to the
        exclusion of the usual nervous symptoms. </p>
      <p><b>MIGRAINE AND CANCER</b> </p>
      <p>Migraine, like neuritis, is a direct result of activity of the
        cancer causing toxin. Headache may be the chief pregrowth
        symptom. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 27.</i></b> Headache, Goitre and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Mrs. B., age 49, weight 169, referred by Dr. Schultz, September
        12, 1924. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all life except for the pregrowth symptoms.
        Pregrowth symptoms: severe headaches for the last twenty year,
        every week put her to bed a day or two, but practically no
        headache since growth reaching the size of a walnut by June
        1924, came in left breast. The thyroid was enlarged twice its
        size, for last few years, the skin was thickened, with pigment
        patches over the sides of the neck and cheeks myxoedema. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Examination September 12, 1924 nearly whole
        left breast one mass of cancer 9 cm in diameter, fixed to skin
        and parieties, had reached that size from that of a walnut in
        four months, carcinoma simplex type, nipple somewhat retracted.
        The axillary glands on the right side were slightly enlarged on
        left side there were several glands the size of a peanut. She
        had been losing "pep" for the last year; gained weight by 15
        pounds in the last year, but lost 4 pounds in the last month.
        She was treated with complete recovery and disappearance of
        growth, taking place in 6 months. Likewise all pregrowth
        symptoms have left. She reports that she feels better than for
        twenty years. </p>
      <p>Discussion: In this case the pregrowth toxic symptoms were a
        migraine that persisted until the growth came, and there were
        myxoedema changes referable to thyroid suppression. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 28</i></b>. Headache and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Miss G., age 52, referred by Dr. Chandler of Flint, Michigan. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Had the usual childhood diseases, otherwise well.
      </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Severe bi-monthly headaches over a period
        of years before the growth came. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: In November 1917, she had a severe
        hemorrhage from the uterus, thereafter her health failed and she
        lost in weight from 135 to about 70 pounds by December 1919. In
        May 1919, her trouble became very serious and examination by Dr.
        G. F. Johnston of Traverse City revealed an extensive cancer of
        the uterus. Hemorrhages became regular and the drainage from the
        uterus became profuse, and she grew thin and weak. She was
        brought to me by Dr. Chandler of Flint, Mich. In December 1919.
        At that time examination found her nearly bloodless, cyanotic,
        with rapid thready pulse; dyspnoea, and with not sufficient
        strength to raise her head from the pillow. The whole region
        below the umbilicus was one lumpy mass of cancer continuous with
        the uterus. Vagina nearly full of the uterus growth, which was
        necrotic and still, bleeding. Treatment was given and a gradual
        recovery took place over a period of 18 months before cure was
        established; with body weight returned to normal and the patient
        returned to work: Headaches let up in the first six months. She
        is in perfect health. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case illustrates the pregrowth symptoms taking
        the form of periodic bi-monthly headaches against which the
        cancer effort had no successful protective influences, and which
        was overcome by the removal of the toxin that caused the cancer
        to come, even before all traces of the cancer growth had
        disappeared. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 29</i>.</b> General Sclerosis and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Mr. A., age 72. </p>
      <p>Family History negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all his life. Pregrowth symptoms of
        dizziness and spells of poor vision (which he attributed to
        exposure to the sun), for the past years. A condition of general
        arteriosclerosis, with prostatic enlargement, and arcus senilis,
        plus moderate opacity of the lenses coming on for the last few
        years. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: The growth started as a pimple on the back
        of the left hand about November 1, 1921. It rapidly grew worse,
        acting like a boil. By March 29, 1922, it had reached the size
        of a silver dollar, and also spread to the outside of the hand
        and on to the two outer fingers. At this time he entered the
        University of Michigan Hospital for examination and diagnosis.
        They removed a specimen, took a radiograph of the bones of the
        hand to determine if they were severely involved, and sent him
        home with the statement that they would send a report to Dr. B.
        G. McGarry, his family doctor, who would make suggestions
        regarding treatment. This was done, and the University reports
        were turned over to the patient, with Dr. McGarry's
        recommendation that an amputation be performed. </p>
      <p>On April 10, 1922, patient was admitted and our examination
        revealed a typical carcinoma as described above, with central
        depression and raised edges. Axillary glands were slightly
        enlarged: Senility changes were present as mentioned above.
        Treatment was given, and recovery was complete, with perfect
        healing reestablishing the sweat glands and hair, without any
        noticeable deficiency remaining, in sixteen weeks. Moreover the
        arteriosclerosis, arcus senilis, and lens opacities and enlarged
        prostate, have likewise disappeared. He has gained from 170 to
        193 pounds and claims to feel twenty years younger. The
        attention of the Medical School at the University of Michigan
        was called to this case, but they showed no enthusiasm over the
        matter. The patient was also demonstrated to the cancer
        committee of the Wayne County Medical Society in November 1923,
        among other cases cured by the treatment. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case illustrates, like cases 18, 19 and 30,
        that the toxin bringing on the senility changes was identical
        with that causative to the growth, for both the cancer and the
        senility changes were removed by the same treatment. The
        reconstruction of the skin as an organ, with recovery of sweat
        glands and hair is a noteworthy accomplishment and demonstrates
        that this treatment is fundamentally a constructive one, and
        different from the destructive methods in vogue at present. </p>
      <p>The sclerosis is perhaps a protective response against the
        toxin in the sense of a barrier to the passage of the toxin
        through the tissues, but more likely may be viewed as a direct
        action of the toxin on a certain chemical grouping in the
        tissues. This point will be discussed in another paper. </p>

      <p>Mrs. G., age 67. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. Father died of apoplexy at
        70 years of age. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all life, except for disease of childhood
        and sciatic rheumatism since 60 years of age. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms and status of patient: Subject to frequent
        headaches; goitre for over 10 years, stomach trouble for last 16
        years, took soda right along, pain relieved by eating until the
        summer of 1922, when pain became continuous and was aggravated
        by eating, vomited frequently, had to take opiate for pain,
        became cachectic, and confined to bed. On both September 2, and
        12, 1922, had severe hemorrhages from the stomach. Dr. Potter
        examined patient and decided she was too far gone to be taken to
        a hospital for attempt at relief, believing that she would die
        on the way, so the family reports: </p>
      <p>My examination was made on September 18, 1922, 1 found the
        patient to be a very cachectic emaciated old woman, skin dry,
        wrinkled and bloodless, fingers cyanotic, hemoglobin less than
        10 per cent, respirations 38, pulse barely perceptible, bowels
        had moved only tarry matter during the past week, still vomiting
        blood with the little food that was taken. Abdomen tender, mass
        occupying whole abdomen above umbilicus, fixed to liver. To the
        left and extending blow umbilicus, an orange size mass somewhat
        movable, marked arteriosclerosis, arcus senilis, lenses somewhat
        opaque well developed goitre. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given, recovery complete, with return of
        function, disappearance of all masses including the goitre,
        disappearance of arcus senilis and opacities in lenses and
        return of elasticity of blood vessels. She is still perfectly
        well, and well nourished and active, feels better than for many
        years she reports. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case demonstrates the disappearance of four
        pregrowth conditions: headache, goitre, gastric ulcer, senility,
        as well as the cancer, the cure of each attending the removal of
        one toxin at the base of the trouble. </p>
      <p>Certain other pregrowth syndromes will be discussed in a
        following paper. </p>

      <p>The previous papers published in this <i>Journal</i> (May,
        July, and August, 1925) demonstrated that the toxin causative to
        cancer produced certain definite changes in the body, often for
        years before the growth came, and that the growth came as a
        protective response, which however was not adequate. The growth
        symptoms described were a certain type of dizziness, migraine,
        gastric ulcer, toxic goitre, simple goitre, and sclerotic
        senility changes. It was also demonstrated by case histories
        that the removal of the cancer causing toxin resulted not only
        in the cure of the cancer, but also in the removal of the
        pregrowth symptoms and changes. </p>
      <p>The present paper briefly discusses certain other pregrowth
        syndromes, identifying their etiology with that of cancer,
        demonstrating the cure of these conditions by the removal of the
        cancer causing toxin. These pregrowth symptoms are, rodent
        ulcer; uterine ulcer (hypertrophic endometritis)
        pseudo-hypertrophic muscular paralysis, neuritis, and
        pigmentation. </p>
      <p>The following case histories illustrate: </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 31</i>:</b>&nbsp; Pigmentation and Cancer. Mr. M.,
        age 44, referred by Dr. E. Richey. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Fairly well all his life, had childhood diseases.
      </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Pigmentation in patches and areas free from
        pigment distributed over the body, coming on in last few years.
      </p>
      <p>Status of patient: For several years prior to 1921, bleed at
        stool and experienced a mass of tissue protruding that could be
        pushed back into the rectum. Specimen was removed by Dr. R.
        Andries, and examined by Dr. A. Warthin, pathologist at the
        University of Michigan. Another specimen was also removed and
        examined by Dr. James Davis, pathologist for several hospitals
        and the Detroit College of Medicine. </p>
      <p>A diagnosis of rapidly growing adeno-carcinoma was made by both
        pathologists. Operation, April 1921, at Providence Hospital,
        Detroit, by Dr. Andries, cautery and radium also applied. In
        March, 1922, another cautery and radium needles again used.
        X-ray treatments once a week for a period. Continued to grow
        worse, so much so, that he could not sit down. Dr. Andries had
        the patient examined by Dr. Angus. McLean, who said the
        condition was hopeless, but to continue with the radium. May
        1922, radium again applied for twenty-four hours and three more
        X-ray treatments given, but patient grew worse rapidly, and the
        physicians advised the family that he was getting worse and
        hopeless. The bladder started to give trouble after the last
        radium treatment and continually grew worse, bleeding from
        rectum became severe in August and September 1922, and a
        rectovesicular fistula developed, so that stools came through
        the penis. Greater and greater pain, loss of weight and
        strength, obstruction of the bowel progressed. In October, 1922,
        the patient called his old family doctor who found the rectum
        completely involved, and the disease had spread to the liver
        and' throughout the abdomen generally. Dr. W. Evans, the
        radiologist at Harper Hospital, was consulted. He also looked
        upon the condition as hopeless. </p>
      <p>Thus the disease had progressed from a small lump that caused
        but little inconvenience outside of the bleeding to a
        generalized carcinomatosis with recto-vesicular fistula and
        marked cachexia, and this in spite of all the surgery, cautery,
        X-ray and radium that could be given. </p>
      <p>Admitted for examination, and treatment on November 5, 1922. I
        found the rectum full of the growth. It was impossible to
        introduce the finger beyond internal sphincter. The abdomen was
        involved throughout, the liver mass reaching to umbilicus.
        Weight 114 pounds, some oedema of tissues. Irregular patches of
        pigment were distributed over the body, and there were
        unpigmented areas not subject to darkening from sunburn. Feces
        passing through penis and the urine with stool through rectum. </p>
      <p>The report of the patients condition is stated as follows by
        his surgeon, Dr. E. Richey: "The malignancy at this time had
        spread to the abdomen, involving practically all the liver,
        large and small bowel, more extensively on the right side,
        perforation between bladder and rectum, marked cachexia, loss of
        weight, anorexia and a continuous passage from the bowels of
        mucopurulent material." </p>
      <p>Treatment was given and recovery was complete by September
        1923, with gain in weight to 142 pounds, a complete
        disappearance of all cancer masses and a return to the best
        health he ever enjoyed. His first year back to work was
        sufficiently energetic to win for him the prize for being the
        most successful real estate salesman in his association. The
        pigment patches have not completely disappeared as yet, although
        they greatly diminished. </p>
      <p>Discussion of case: This case demonstrates the healing of a
        recto-vesicular fistula caused partly by radium and partly by
        cancer, and the recovery from a generalized carcinomatosis, in
        spite of previous mistreatment: The most interesting feature is
        the slow absorption of the pigment going on for over a year
        without having as yet become absolutely complete after all
        traces of cancer have disappeared. Thus we may conclude that the
        pigment deposits are secondary to changes resulting from the
        cancer producing toxin. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 32</i></b>. Neuritis, Pigmentation and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Family History: Mother died of cancer of stomach, age 72. </p>
      <p>Past History, Typhoid fever at 10 years of age. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Severe headaches two or three times per
        month for twelve years before growth came in right breast, and
        becoming much worse after growth came, also a severe sciatic
        neuritis worse for six months before taking our treatment. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Weight 145 pounds, pigment patches over
        cheek bones, temples and sides of neck, several areas on the
        arms. A mass in the right breast size of an egg, attached to
        skin and parieties; palpable axillary glands (largest the size
        of a hickorynut) and small supraclavicular glands. She
        complained of severe pain in shoulder, down right arm, and in
        breast. Had a slight dry cough. Diagnosis: moderately advanced
        carcinoma of breast, with widespread metastases. Treatment was
        given in February 1921, sciatic neuritis and headaches soon
        ceased, and all traces of cancer have since disappeared. She
        gained in weight to 165 pounds and remains in perfect health.
        Patient remained at work, teaching school throughout recovery.
        The pigmentation has also disappeared, but it did not do so
        until after all cancer tissue was absorbed, and disposed of. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case exemplifies a fairly common pregrowth
        symptom-neuritis-which is severe and generally attacks the
        sciatic nerve. It is a toxic effect like the pregrowth headache,
        and lets up very soon after treatment. Thus the rapidity of the
        conversion of toxin to anti-toxin is illustrated. I am citing
        three cases of similar neuritis in patients in whom no cancer
        could be detected, but where rapid recovery was had from the
        treatment. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 33</i></b>. Neuritis. </p>
      <p>Dr. M., age 62, suffered with gradually increasing neuritis in
        both legs for two months, finally had to take to his bed and.
        resort to morphine, the condition rapidly becoming worse.
        Examination could reveal only an enlarged prostate. Area of
        anesthesia over outer side of right leg and over toes, small
        area over left ankle. Paralysis of leg muscles. Skin dry like
        flour. Loss of function of genitalia. </p>
      <p>Treatment given November 1922, recovery from neuritis and back
        to his practice in four days. It has never recurred. The skin
        became normal within twelve weeks, but the anesthesia, and the
        paralysis were not overcome until after a year had passed.
        Prostate normal. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 34</i>.</b>&nbsp; Neuritis. </p>
      <p>Mr. E., age 36. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all his life, except for transient blind
        spells and difficulty in relaxing sphincter iris for the three
        years past. Pains in left hip and down sciatic nerve for 6
        months. </p>
      <p>Status of patient well nourished apparently healthy man. No
        pathology could be demonstrated by physical examination or by
        X-ray study. Complained of severe sciatic pains that did not let
        up nor respond to former treatments, aggravated after five p.m.,
        unable to stand on left foot. Examination could locate no pelvic
        growth. Sphincter Ani very spastic. </p>
      <p>Treatment given May 12, 1925, recovery complete in 14 days,
        able to balance on left foot without pain or difficulty. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 35</i></b>: Neuritis. </p>
      <p>Mr. F., age 88. </p>
      <p>Family History, doubtful as to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all life except for last two years a
        gradually increasing neuritis of the right sciatic nerve and
        lumbar region. For the past several months not able to work more
        than a few, hours a day, unable to climb under automobile: All
        sorts of treatments were applied and failed. </p>
      <p>Examination June 12, 1922, revealed no gross pathology and
        X-ray studies also failed to show any abnormality. Treatment was
        given and relief was complete in four weeks. He has had no
        recurrence. </p>
      <p>The toxin causing the neuritis in this case must have been
        identical with that causative to cancer, or it would not have
        been removed by the cancer treatment. The pregrowth diagnosis
        and relief of the cancer disease is therefore possible. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 36</i></b>. Hypertrophic Pseudomuscular Paralysis. </p>
      <p>Mr. W. J., age 22. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: well all his life except for falling spells,
        which starting at 9 years of age, would go down in a heap, was
        insured in the back from playing football but recovered rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>"Pregrowth symptoms" of fainting had existed for years until
        five years ago, had dizzy and blind spells from ages of ten to
        fifteen. Falling spells since 9 years of age. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: At the age of twelve muscles started to
        hypertrophy very noticeable, the condition increasing and
        persisting over a period of eight years. Two years ago the
        muscles started to reduce. </p>
      <p>On examination August 6, 1924, the muscles were found generally
        atrophic, especially the muscles of the thighs, the knees were
        easily thrown out of joint. There was marked foot drop, knee
        jerk absent. Peculiar wobbling gait, knees flexed backward.
        Falls came from sudden loss of muscle control. Fell every little
        while, many times a day in spite of support of cane. Patient
        also feels himself fall while lying awake in bed, has a sense of
        a general let go of all the muscles progressively getting worse.
        No treatments (everything was tried) has really helped. </p>
      <p>Treatment given and recovery nearly complete in eleven months,
        ability to walk nearly good as anyone, nearly complete
        restoration of the muscles, which are still developing, falls
        only occasionally but can control the falls now. There is
        complete absence of the "pregrowth symptoms" of dizziness and
        blind spells. The knee jerks are diminished but there is no foot
        drop. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This case was treated ii months ago and, has
        recovered sufficiently during that time to show that the course
        of recovery resembles that in cancer. The first symptoms to come
        were last to disappear after treatment and the patient is now in
        the best of condition symptomatically resembling the onset of
        the disease. This case could not be mistaken for cancer. Yet it
        ran a similar course with pregrowth symptoms of falling spells,
        fainting, dizziness, and blind spells, before the neuromuscular
        pathology set in. The falling spells which like those observed
        as pregrowth symptoms to cancer, are a sudden cessation of
        muscle control, and possibly a cerebellar disturbance due to the
        presence of the toxin. The nerve paralysis and resulting muscle
        atrophy are the results of the chronic effects of the toxin. The
        regeneration of nerve and muscle function followed the
        detoxication by such time as is necessary for regenerating these
        structures. </p>
      <p>The fact that the toxin at the base of the trouble is converted
        into anti-toxin by the cancer treatment identifies it with the
        cancer producing toxin, and the whole syndrome can then be
        classified with the cancer pregrowth symptoms. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 37</i>.</b> Rodent Ulcer. </p>
      <p>Mr. M., age 46. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all his life until present illness. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms were not elicited. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Growth started on right side of nose 4 years
        ago. Had it frozen with carbon dioxide snow without help. </p>
      <p>Examination January 18, 1924, revealed a typical rodent ulcer
        about the size of a dime, involving the wing and sulcus on the
        right side of the nose. Otherwise the patient was well.
        Treatment was given and recovery, with complete healing in five
        weeks. He is still in perfect health. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 38</i>.</b> Rodent Ulcer and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Mr. E., age 77. </p>
      <p>Family History: One sister died of cancer of breast. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all his life. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Very slight dizziness for years, only on
        stooping. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Sore came on lip 8 years ago, operated at
        Victoria Hospital, London, Ontario, diagnosis given was cancer.
        Sore returned six years later, had it cauterized but it only got
        worse. Had it treated with pastes, but it still grew worse.
        Admitted here for treatment in November 1923. </p>
      <p>Examination revealed a well developed rodent ulcer, destroying
        lower left half of lip and some of the cheek and a typical
        squamous cell carcinoma of the angle of the mouth involving the
        upper lip. Treatment was given. The rodent ulcer healed in less
        than 2 weeks, but the carcinomatous area was not completely
        cured until 5 weeks later. He is still in perfect health. </p>
      <p>Discussion: Other cases might be cited where the rodent ulcer
        was cured by a paste, years before the cancer developed in an
        internal organ. These cases all demonstrate, particularly since
        the rodent ulcer disappears rapidly like gastric ulcer,
        pregrowth neuritis, and other pregrowth symptoms after this
        treatment, that they are all manifestations of the action of the
        cancer causing toxin. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 39</i>.</b> Hypertrophic Endometritis and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Miss E., age 29. </p>
      <p>Family History: Father had cancer of stomach, cured by Koch's
        treatment. Sister had cancer of uterus developing on an ulcer of
        the uterus similar to this patient's and was cured by Koch's
        treatment. </p>
      <p>Past History: Pneumonia at age of four, and the childhood
        diseases. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Uterine ulcer for 14 years. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Started to menstruate at 13, was regular for
        two years, then started to hemorrhage following the regular
        period, each successive period becoming longer, until she was
        bleeding continuously, with only short intermissions. Bleeding
        was rather violent at times, worst period from ages of 16 to 18.
        When 19 years old, she was operated on by Dr. R. Peterson at Ann
        Arbor, well for a few months when she again started bleeding
        that persisted steadily for a year (1916). Operated on by Dr.
        Lucy Haskins in December 1916, well a few months then settled
        down to steady flow for rest of 1917. Operated January 1918, and
        September 1918, better for a while and had natural periods
        during the entire year of 1919. In August 1920, she started to
        flow irregularly and in spring of 1921 had a bad hemorrhage; Dr.
        Curds recommended radium, but she did not take it. Stopped
        flowing for four months. During college year of 1921-1922, she
        flowed steadily. Dr. Hoover of Cleveland, said he could do
        nothing, sent her to Dr. Weir at Lakeside Hospital who curetted
        and took specimens. Well for two month's, the flowing began
        again, took osteopathy for a while, got much better except for
        the constant flowing. Went to Dr. Hiram Ross, of Daneville,
        Illinois, who found a large growth and used radium January 1923.
        One month later she had the worst hemorrhage ever, and
        thereafter grew progressively worse. </p>
      <p>Examination July 8, 1923, found uterus fixed, enlarged to the
        size of an orange, with a larger mass extending into the broad
        ligament on the left side, and up into the abdomen. Cervix hard
        nodular and ulcerated three times normal size and emitting a
        bloody drainage. Treatment was given, and bleeding stopped for
        five months. A small flow started again in December 1923, which
        gradually diminished until normal menstruations occurred.
        Examination March 6, 1925, found her normal. All masses have
        disappeared and the uterus returned to normal. </p>
      <p>Miss E., sister of Case 39, age 23. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Started to menstruate at 13 years of age.
        Not long after, she started to bleed six weeks at a time,
        continuously for about one year. Operated with removal of cervix
        and a papilloma and was curetted, she reports. Well for ten
        years. Bleeding started again in September 1923, and continued
        to date, lost weight from 136 to 112 pounds in last three
        months. Went to Henry Ford Hospital November 8, 1923, where they
        advised the use of radium, and let the patient understand, she
        reports, that the condition was cancer. My examination November
        13, 1923, revealed a typical carcinoma of the cervix, squamous
        cell type, 1 3/4 inches wide, cauliflower mass, broad ligaments
        involved, uterus fixed and extending into the abdomen halfway to
        the umbilicus, typical bloody odorous discharge. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given and recovery, with return to normal of all
        tissues concerned, was completed in sixteen weeks. She remains
        well to date, .and menstruates normally. </p>
      <p>Discussion: The father of these patients was cured by this
        treatment of cancer of the stomach and the two daughters became
        victims of the same infection, early in life, both expressing
        their reaction to the toxin in the same way. </p>
      <p>The first case used radium and a persistent irritant thus was
        introduced to complicate the pathology. The second case was a
        clean cut one. Both started out as ulcers of the endometrium and
        both ended .up as cancer. Both were cured by this cancer
        treatment. These cases run parallel to gastric ulcer in that the
        ulcer antedates the cancer and, as is often the case, becomes
        the site for the development of the cancer. Thus rodent ulcer,
        gastric ulcer and endometritis, especially if its cause cannot
        be explained, should be recognized as a sign of the presence of
        the cancer causing toxin and the forerunner of cancer. </p>

      <p>The microscopic recognition of cancer and its differentiation
        from other protective responses of the same order, is not always
        possible, indeed very often not possible. The clinical course of
        the disease with the wide range, of data yielded, has always
        been the best guide to correct diagnosis. Yet the medical
        profession has let itself be led through misinformation, plain
        ignorance, and lack of interest, to submit to the claims of the
        microscopist, the new Sherlock, who alone with his little lenses
        would decide as to whether or not a disease is cancer. It may be
        that the pathologist with his peculiar training does not know
        his limitations. The important fact is that through the
        pathological attitude rampant today toward disease we have lost
        track of the most essential clinical features bearing on
        malignancy. Moreover we have not learned to make a sure
        diagnosis of cancer with the microscope. Thus a syphilitic
        lesion is diagnosed sarcoma and a carcinoma too often called an
        adenoma. Many surgeons of experience will support this
        statement. </p>
      <p>A more important insufficiency in the pathology service is due,
        to lack of study of the microscopic findings in the light of the
        clinical course of the disease. As a result definite malignant
        conditions are not classified at all, or only incorrectly. To
        illustrate I shall give two cases that were cured by this
        treatment. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 41</i></b>. Sarcoma of finger. </p>
      <p>Miss H., age 19. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Measles, whooping cough in childhood, diphtheria
        at 16, operated upon by Dr. Hicks of Bradford, Ontario, for
        falling of the uterus at 18 years of age. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Dizziness started 6 years before the growth
        came and became worse after growth came. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: First finger of right hand became rapidly
        and painfully swollen one night in the fall of 1920, condition
        grew worse as finger swelled to twice its size, becoming red and
        hard. On the outerside of the second phalanx of this finger, a
        hard white "kernel," with central puncture gave the impression
        that the finger had been pierced by a sliver. Pus formed at this
        place, the finger was opened by Dr. Nash of St. George, Ontario,
        but only a little pus was obtained. The condition grew worse,
        with no relief from the pain. Finger opened again, but drained
        only a watery fluid. The bone was then scraped 14 different
        times, and a specimen removed and sent to the University of
        Toronto pathologist. </p>
      <p>The whole finger was then removed about January 20, 1921. One
        month after the stump healed, the next finger started the same
        affair. It was lanced, the bone scraped, got worse rapidly, and
        was amputated. The finger was sent to the University of Toronto
        pathologist and the following diagnosis returned: Sarcoma,
        Tuberculosis or Syphilis. </p>
      <p>One month later the third finger did the same thing. It was
        cut, scraped, and the surgeon, Dr. Reed, wanted to remove the
        hand first and later the arm, patient reports. Operation refused
        and patient came to Detroit to be treated. </p>
      <p>Our examination was made August 10, 1921. The patient was a
        very nervous, highly toxic girl. The amputation stumps on right
        hand were swollen hard and red and blue, the whole hand and
        forearm were much swollen and the large axillary glands
        palpable. The ribs on same side lumpy, very tender, and painful.
        The third finger was swollen, barrel shaped, hard and deep red,
        about four times the natural size. A white spot, with central
        puncture, through which a watery fluid escaped, was noted in the
        position as described on the first finger, the little finger
        appeared normal. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given and recovery ensued during the next few
        months. A few weeks after treatment, the little finger broke out
        in the same way, but the trouble was very mild and transient,
        not lasting over a week and causing no inconvenience. Both
        fingers rapidly became well and the swelling left the hand and
        arm. Likewise the axillary metastases disappeared, the ribs
        healed and disappearance of the nervousness and pregrowth
        symptoms of dizziness was completed before the fingers were
        healed. She gained weight and the best of health; has since
        married and has a healthy baby. She is in perfect health still.
        She returned to the surgeon to show herself, that he might enjoy
        her good fortune, but reports that she was not well received. </p>
      <p>Discussion: This peculiar case might be explained in the
        following way. Embryonic rests remained in similar positions in
        the four fingers of the right hand. The infecting agent
        producing its poison was in her system for some six years, and
        causing the pregrowth symptoms of dizziness and nervousness. The
        embryonic rests not being under inertia of physiological
        activity, were the easiest tissues to respond to the poisoning
        in the protective direction. As fast as one growth was removed,
        another came from a remaining rest, and finally, when the
        treatment was given and the growth underwent absorption
        unloading its stored toxin, the last rest was over stimulated
        and responded like the others. In the meantime the toxin was
        undergoing conversion to antitoxin and the resultant withdrawal
        of all toxin resulted in cure and the establishment of immunity.
      </p>
      <p>It makes little difference what the microscopic report happened
        to be, the clinical course of the disease was that of
        malignancy, and the little cells that made up the tumors had a
        function they could not adequately perform, the function of
        protection, attempted anti-toxin production. The disease was
        cured by doing the work for the growths. </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 42</i>.</b> Malignancy of Testes. </p>
      <p>Mr. F., age 28. </p>
      <p>Family History, doubtful to cancer or tuberculosis: </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all his life until present illness. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Right-sided headaches very severe and
        persistent for three years. Right arm shoulder neuritis tree
        years. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Left testicle always twice as large as the
        right one. Two weeks before removal it grew painful and bigger
        and fluid collected in the sack. Operated, with removal of left
        testis August 10, 1921, by Dr. J. D. Mathews of Detroit.
        Specimen report: "marked evidence of tuberculosis." Two and
        one-half years later the right testis started to swell, behaving
        as the left one had. Operation was again suggested, but the
        patient refused, to come to us for treatment. </p>
      <p>Examination February 12, 1924, revealed the sack fairly
        distended with fluid, and containing an irregular mass the size
        of a lemon, with hard nodular epididimas, teste grown fast to
        scrotum and discharging bloody pus. Inguinal glands enlarged and
        a mass in the abdomen, size of an apple (mesentaric gland
        metastasis), also a hickory nut sized mass in right epitrochlear
        glands, and a mass in the left ribs close to the spine, size of
        a walnut, attached to skin and invading surrounding tissues. </p>
      <p>Right nostril bleeding for the last few weeks, discharging pus
        at times. No cough. Morning headaches, afternoon fatigue.
        Although the microscopic diagnosis was tuberculosis, the
        clinical course was that of malignancy, so the treatment was
        given. Recovery was completed in 5 months, return to normal of
        teste and scrotum, disappearance of all growths; and patient
        back to work, in perfect health, and free from pregrowth
        Symptoms. </p>
      <p>Discussion: The course of recovery was that which takes place
        in malignancy, after our treatment; and the diagnosis of
        malignancy is thereby confirmed. It is evident from the
        pathological report in question, which was made by a recognized
        pathologist, that the tissue gave the impression of tuberculosis
        and as the bacillus is so rarely met in such tissues, it was not
        included as a diagnostic feature. Therefore, judging from the
        cytology of the testicle removed, the pathological diagnosis
        could not be made, and the report was only a guess. The tissue
        showed only one pathognomonic feature and that is typical
        cellular hyperplasia. The clinical course of the disease proved,
        that this cellular hyperplasia was an inadequate one, and
        therefore malignancy was at the bottom of the whole trouble, for
        after all, malignancy, whether carcinoma or sarcoma, is a new
        protective response of cells against the definite toxin in the
        blood. The response is not adequate and therefore persists by
        increased growth and metastasis, in the attempt to become
        adequate. The removal of the toxin, with consequent atrophy and
        absorption of the neoplastic tissue, is proof complete as to the
        diagnosis of malignancy. Therefore, though the pathologist
        cannot make the diagnosis, the clinician can do so. Now he can
        also cure the disease and substantiate the diagnosis of
        malignancy. Therefore, though the follows a definite program,
        and its features explain the true nature of malignancy. </p>
      <p><b>THE COURSE OF RECOVERY</b> </p>
      <p>The recovery from an infectious disease is a matter of immunity
        and in cancer it also involves processes of removal of the
        growth tissue and the healing of destroyed areas in such a way,
        that function can be resumed. </p>
      <p>Most of the principles concerned are exemplified in the case
        histories presented in this series of papers, but the reaction
        features have not been detailed in the various cases, in order
        to save space. These features are fairly constant, and one case
        history will suffice to illustrate. (Patient just reported for
        examination and reaction features were clear in his mind.) </p>
      <p><b><i>Case 43</i>.</b> Gastric Ulcer and Cancer. </p>
      <p>Mr. H., age 51, referred by Dr. Norman Wilson, of Jackson,
        Michigan, and Dr. Stitts, of Stockbridge, Michigan. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Mumps three years ago, and Flu in 1224. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms: Dizzy spells for last 14 years; on
        retiring, would feel as if taking somersaults. Also transient
        blind spells, feeling as if whole musculature was giving way,
        had to sit down so as to avoid falling. These spells did not let
        up until the sixth week after the treatment was given. Gastric
        ulcer (adequately diagnosed) twenty years ago, from which he was
        practically well until 7 years ago. Three years ago develop a
        general anasarca. This subsided for the most part, but remained
        easily noticeable until the sixth week after treatment, when it
        disappeared. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Had been vomiting regularly, and had slimy
        dysentery since fall of 1924, had frequent diarrhea for years
        past. Burning pain across the upper abdomen; constant since fall
        of 1924. Lost from 178 to 155 since January 1926, vomiting of
        decomposed blood and had tarry stools since January 1925. Cough,
        difficulty in swallowing, a sense of pressure in the throat,
        rapidly getting worse in last month. Unable to retain even water
        in stomach, last several days pressure in chest suggesting heart
        impairment to patient. Wasserman negative, Michigan State Board
        of Health. The examination made April 23, 1925. Color of skin
        and eyes yellow plus a cyanotic flush, general slight oedema,
        worse in ankles. Left supraclavicular mass size of large walnut,
        increased mediastinal dullness, and heart apex beat shifted to
        left. A mass in abdomen reaching from ribs to two inches below
        umbilicus on right side, tender and hard, anterior shelf of
        sigmoid involved by mass, size of small egg. X-ray report from
        Dr. R. M. Cooley of Jackson, Michigan, to Dr. Wilson: "Chest
        negative, lesser curvature of stomach presents a smooth
        appearance, but there is ragged shallow filling defect on the
        greater curvature, that extends from the prepyloric region
        upward to the cardiac region. This filling defect is constant in
        all films. The cap is not seen on any of the films. Slight ilial
        residue at five, hours, and normal colon." Visceral reflexes to
        muscles of back, causing spasm of erector spinae muscles from
        5th to 10th dorsal vertebra, reported by Dr. Wilson and easily
        found by me. </p>
      <p>Treatment was given April 23, 1925, and recovery followed the
        course given below. </p>
      <p>Temperature: For nearly twelve weeks after treatment, he ached
        all over, more or less. Chills and fever set in on the fourth
        day, lasting a few hours, returning the ninth and twenty-third
        days, also had a fair fever during the ninth and at the end of
        the eleventh week. Hoarseness, cough, and difficulty in
        swallowing disappeared by end of fourth week, color much better,
        cyanosis and oedema completely absent. Mucous and diarrhea
        stopped by the end of the sixth week, and masses were barely
        palpable. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms completely disappeared by end of seventh
        week. Some bleeding from rectum, with chills and fever of ninth
        week reaction, after which hyperaesthesia over abdomen left, and
        stools large and formed were passed the fret time in several
        years, regular natural bowel movements ever since. All masses
        completely disappeared, and visceral reflexes produce no longer
        spasm of spinal muscles. End of eleventh week, all aching and
        reaction symptoms have disappeared and patient feels better than
        for the last twenty years, he claims. Examination by Dr. Wilson
        and Dr. Stitt, can find no trace of the disease. Neither can I.
        Gain in weight was at the rate of one and one quarter pounds per
        week throughout. Present weight 170 pounds, and still on the
        gain, strength nearly returned. No X-ray pictures will be taken
        for some six months, because of the anti-healing influence they
        possess, and we want the patient all healed before he is
        submitted to any injury. For even though he may be all healed at
        present, his tissues are still tender. </p>
      <p>The prognosis in this case as given by his doctors when
        referring him was, that he might live only five weeks. To all
        intents, this patient is now cured, and convalescence nearly
        complete. He should be in better health each year, as occurred
        in other cases cited. </p>
      <p>Discussion:<b> </b>Immunity is established at the end of the
        seventh week, and the process of removal of the growth
        progresses most thereafter, although sometimes it starts
        earlier. Generally the twelfth week winds up the reaction
        period. </p>
      <p>The process of removal of the growth tissue is a matter of cell
        autolysis, plus the ingrowth of angioblastic tissue by which the
        digested material can be carried away. The growth thereby
        becomes replaced by blood vessels, and these retract as soon as
        their work is done. They provide for the restoration of
        destroyed tissues. </p>
      <p>The fevers that occur are due to the burning up of products of
        mal-metabolism, and materials absorbed from the growth that
        cannot be used for rebuilding the tissues of the body. They
        include also various samples of the stored (absorbed) converted
        cancer causing toxin, and products of activity of various
        bacteria that might be present in the growth. The fevers
        represent immunity accomplishments. </p>
      <p><b>RETURN OF FUNCTION</b> </p>
      <p>The recovery process has completed itself only when full return
        of function .has been established and I am citing as an example
        this case of cancer of the uterus, that after recovery became
        pregnant and at the end of the normal term, delivered a normal
        baby and remains in the best of health. </p>
      <p><i><b>Case 44</b>.</i> Normal Pregnancy Follows Cure. </p>
      <p>Mrs. T., age 31. </p>
      <p>Family History, negative to cancer. </p>
      <p>Past History: Well all her life, except for appendectomy op
        June 16, 1921, performed by Dr. Royce. </p>
      <p>Pregrowth symptoms of dizziness that were slightly bettor since
        the growth came. Headaches regularly for years. </p>
      <p>Status of patient: Irregular bleeding from uterus for over a
        year, pains in back and down legs, characteristic discharge.
        Specimen was removed by Dr. L. N. Tupper of Redford, Michigan,
        August 1,1923, and sent to the Owen Clinic Laboratory, which is
        the reliable and recognized diagnostic laboratory of Detroit.
        The specimen was found to be squamous cell carcinoma, and the
        surgeon recommended operation. From the time of removal of the
        specimen to time of treatment, August 7, 1923, the bleeding was
        constant and profuse. </p>
      <p>Examination August 7, 1923, found uterus enlarged by the growth
        and extending into the abdomen, one-third the distance to
        umbilicus. Cervix enlarged to size of an apple by a nodular
        mass, extending into broad ligaments. </p>
      <p>Diagnosis of cancer confirmed by these findings and history of
        pregrowth symptoms. Treatment given with complete recovery in
        five months with gain of fifteen pounds in weight, uterus
        returned to normal structure, and complete disappearance of
        pregrowth symptoms. </p>
      <p>Became pregnant in the late summer of 1924 and gave birth to a
        normal baby at end of normal term. No difficulty attended
        delivery. Uterus remains normal and patient in excellent health.
      </p>
      <p>Discussion:<b> </b>Such a return of function as has been
        exemplified in our cases proves that the growth of cancer cells
        into adjacent tissues is an interstitial infiltration and that
        the true destruction of the normal tissues is not as great as
        would so often seem. But even where deficiencies are observed,
        there is a great tendency to repair the affected part, with
        restoration of the physiological elements in normal proportions,
        so that function can be resumed. Thus the removal of the cause
        of cancer, the toxin and the organism that produces it out of
        the tissues of the host, gives nature free sway to restore her
        normal self. Moreover, one thing has been gained through being
        cured of cancer, namely that the process of conversion of toxin
        to anti-toxin, once established in the body, is a perpetual
        acquirement, the true immunity state. </p>
      <p>"Dr. Koch's interest in the study of medicine was to find a
        remedy, other than surgery to which his father afflicted with
        cancer of the stomach submitted without avail for the cure of a
        cancer. He has been a teacher both at the University of Michigan
        and in the Detroit Medical College. His point of approach of the
        study of the problem was one following his study of the
        parathyroid glands and their protective functions. After years
        of study, which at times required days without sleep to watch
        his chemical experiments he produced synthetically a protective
        substance, an antitoxin, for the cure of cancer. This was over
        seven years ago. The Editor has personally seen and examined
        many of the patients whose case histories have appeared in the <i>Journal</i>,
        and she found them all in good health, free from any sign of
        cancer, happy and working every day. Some of these were cured
        six and seven years ago. This "antitoxin" seems to be very
        effective in untreated cases, even advanced, and in cases which
        have had surgical interference only. Its efficiency is law in
        the treatment of cases that have been subjected to irradiation
        of X-ray or radium. Only about one in five of the latter
        recovers, as against four in five of the former." Editorial by,
