      <p>My invention relates to the production of unsaturated bodies
        such as ketenes and ketene derivatives from materials such as
        ethyl alcohol, its anhydride, ethyl ether, ethylene, acetylene,
        acetaldehyde, etc. </p>
      <p>I have established that the products resulting from the
        practice of my invention are beneficial for medicinal purposes,
        and are harmless in the treatment of humans when used by
        physicians who have been instructed properly. </p>
      <p>One method for the practice of my invention is as follows: </p>
      <p>Assuming that the starting material is acetaldehyde, this
        material is added very slowly, as by being carried in as a gas
        by admixture with the gas acetylene, to strong sulfuric acid,
        preferably 95% or stronger, or phosphoric acid, 85% or stronger
        the acid being well cooled. The proportion of added acetaldehyde
        is preferably less than 20% by volume of the amount of acid
        employed. </p>
      <p>This mixture, which I shall designate as product A, is allowed
        to age until sulfurous acid is formed, and then submitted to
        distillation with a sweep gas such as nitrogen to remove the
        products. </p>
      <p>The distillate is condensed by cooling, neutralized with chalk,
        then extracted with chloroform. The extract is washed with
        water. </p>
      <p>Both the chloroform extract and the water washings are
        evaporated to dryness, and the residues, after dilution with
        water used for intravenous, or intramuscular injection. </p>
      <p>As an alternative, the product A is submitted to neutralization
        with chalk, then extracted with chloroform and this extract
        washed with water. Both the chloroform extract and the water
        washing are evaporated and after proper dilution with water,
        used for intravenous or intramuscular injection. </p>
      <p>The products resulting from the practice of my process are
        various polymers of ketenes. The product which is soluble in
        chloroform carries a structure of conjugated carbonyl groups and
        no carboxyls. The product which is soluble in water carries a
        conjugated system of ethylene and carbonyl groups. </p>

      <p>My invention is directed to a method or process for producing a
        group of unsaturated compounds possessing free valences with
        catalytic activity, and more specifically is directed to the
        production of such substances photochemically. </p>
      <p>In the practice of my invention an aqueous solution of
        formaldehyde ad an aqueous solution of slaked lime (calcium
        hydroxide) are mixed, about equal parts by volume of fairly
        concentrated solutions of formaldehyde and of lime are employed.
      </p>
      <p>The concentrations of these two materials are not critical, but
        I prefer to employ fairly saturated or moderately concentrated
        solutions. </p>
      <p>After the mixture has been thoroughly or well shaken, it is
        placed in a flask transparent to or containing a port
        transparent to ultraviolet light. The source of the ultraviolet
        light may be the sun or an artificial source. </p>
      <p>The mixture is exposed to the ultraviolet light until test
        portions when evaporated produce a syrup that crystallizes and
        contains only a trace or small percent of formaldehyde. The time
        required for this step of the process depends upon the intensity
        of the uv light. I have found it varies from one to 3 days. </p>
      <p>The resultant changed mixture is then evaporated in vacuo in a
        stream of air until a syrup remain, which is filtered through a
        sterile glass filter plate. </p>
      <p>Portions of the material are then diluted with sterile water to
        one to a thousand or higher and sealed in sterile ampoules. </p>

      <p>This invention relates to the production of unsaturated bodies
        from sugars of the hexose class, namely, glucose, fructose and
        similar substances, and such of their decompositio&nbsp;
        products as lend themselves to the present process, such as
        acetaldehyde, paraldehyde, malonic acid, lactic acid, glyceric
        acid, glyceric aldehyde, pyruvic acid, pyruvic aldehyde, ethyl
        alcohol, ethyl ether, glycolic acid, glycolic acid, and glyoxal.
      </p>
      <p>According to the present invention, oxidation of these
        substances is caused to proceed as a peroxidation of unsaturated
        groups which are produced by the removal of water. </p>
      <p>In carrying on the process according to the present invention,
        the first step in the oxidation of fructose consists in the
        removal of hydroxyl from the carbon atom which is in beta
        position to the carbonyl group and the removal of the hydrogen
        attached to the carbon in alpha position to the carbonyl group,
        or vice versa, as a molecule of water. The unsaturated group
        that is produced is able to add oxygen (activated oxygen) and
        undergo cleavage at this point with the formation of two
        carbonyl groups. Thus fructose is split into two, three-carbon
        chains which may undergo change to lactic acid and related
        substance, which, in turn, are ale to undergo loss of water with
        the production of unsaturated bodies of ketene structure. </p>
      <p>In the same way glucose, by losing hydroxyl and hydrogen in the
        beta and alpha positions, respectively, to the carbonyl group
        undergoes a desaturation which can add activated oxygen ad
        cleave to form two keto groups, one on a two-carbon chain and
        the other on a four-carbon chain. By repeating the same process
        on the four carbon chain, three two-carbon chain groupings are
        produced which by further desaturation yield ketenes. The
        positioning of the initial desaturations is accomplished through
        the catalysis of a halogen, preferably iodine as such or in
        combination, such as calcium iodide, or an organic form of
        iodine in which the carrier is a benzene ring or in which an
        alipathic chain with or without nitrogen as carrier, such, for
        example, as an iodide compound of creatine. </p>
      <p>Active dehydration is produced by a strong mineral acid such as
        a mixture of fuming and strong sulfuric acid or a comparably
        strong phosphoric acid. </p>
      <p>In carrying on the present process, dry glucose or dry fructose
        are mixed with an excess of strong acid containing the selected
        halogen catalyst.&nbsp; The amount required is preferably less
        than one-hundredth of one percent of the amount of sugar used.
        As to the phosphoric acid, I prefer to employ a mixture of
        phosphoric anhydride and 85% phosphoric acid in such proportions
        of each that the mixture contains the minimum amount of water
        and is still able to flow. The catalyst is added to the acid and
        to this is added the dry pulverized sugar. The mixture is
        covered with a stopper and allowed to stand at about body
        temperature until the sugar is apparently fully dissolved. The
        mixture is then warmed gradually to about around 100 C over a
        flame with which it does not have direct contact, the mixture
        being well shaken to distribute the heat and prevent overheating
        of an part until it reaches a deep burgundy color in which a
        column, a centimeter in thickness, is almost opaque. The quicker
        the heating the sooner it reaches the color mentioned. I have
        found, however, that it is better to conduct the process slowly,
        taking 2 or 3 hours for its accomplishment. </p>
      <p>It would appear that the dehydrated sugar has, through its free
        valences, activated oxygen present and become a peroxide and
        cleavage has taken place. Some of the desaturated substance
        under the influence of peroxide has polymerized. As the
        desaturation and peroxidation and cleavage have resulted in
        shorter chains of 2 and 3 carbon atoms each and further
        desaturation is accomplished, the desaturated bodies for
        peroxides which catalyze further polymerization of the
        unsaturated bodies formed. The polymers thus produced may be
        cleaved into their component parts by high dilution with water
        or preferably by destructive distillation. I place the brown
        mixture in a flask that is connected with a condenser and pass a
        stream of gas, such as carbon dioxide, through the apparatus
        while the mixture is being heated, and below the temperature at
        which decomposition is so fast as to produce inconvenient
        foaming, so that the products can be carried over before
        undergoing too much decomposition. </p>
      <p>In the condensed product is found a mixture of substances
        containing modified products of the unsaturated substances
        obtained by the destructive distillation of the polymers
        obtained by the destructive distillation of the polymers and
        also in equilibrium with them the unsaturated substances desired
        in sufficient concentration for further dilution and use for
        treatment of diseases. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, my process is directed to the production of
        unsaturated bodies from hexose and hexose decomposition
        products. It is to be understood, also, that fuming and
        concentrated sulfuric acid may be substituted for the strong
        acid referred to. </p>
      <p>The product obtained by any of the aforesaid processes is
        diluted with water as above specified and may be sealed in
        ampoules for hypodermic injection, for the treatment of cancer
        and various infections. </p>
      <p>Hexose phosphate is converted to glyceric aldehyde and the
        aldehyde of glyceric acid, which yield lactene and malonide,
        thus: </p>

      <p>This invention is directed to the production of oxidizing and
        reducing agents to serve as catalysts of physiological processes
        to combat disease, and one of the objects of the invention is
        the production of unsaturated compounds of carbon capable of
        taking up peroxide oxygen and ozone and serving as oxidation
        catalysts to assist the body to overcome disease, particularly
        to support the reticulo-endothelial system and convert allergy
        into immunity. </p>
      <p>Allergic responses, whether vasomotor or viscero-motor
        reactions, allergic necrosis or the survival over such necrosis
        expressed as neoplasts, all depend upon interference with the
        oxidation processes normally conducted by the
        reticulo-endothelial system. These responses are caused by the
        action of a large toxic molecule containing unsaturated bonds
        between carbon atoms, such as are carried by the quinonoid group
        or the benzene ring, particularly fluorescent structures of
        large molecular weight which favors deep absorption into the
        tissue proteid, and a sluggishness that opposes oxidation. Such
        bodies absorb photochemic rays of normal oxidation and again
        re-emit them at a slower periodicity which instead of
        propagating the oxidation process really intercepts it and
        combats it. Such substances as benzopyrene, dibenzanthrene and
        the unsaturated proteins of different species or of disease
        bacteria behave in this manner. The tar products actually
        destroy the reticulo-endothelial system and cause cancer. </p>
      <p>The cure of the abnormalities thus produced can only be
        accomplished by the removal of the offending toxic agent; and I
        purpose to effect this removal by instituting such vigorous
        oxidation that the unsaturated groups of the toxins take up
        peroxide and are combusted. To do this two types of substances
        may be employed: (1) The very unstable short chain unsaturated
        carbon compound capable of vigorously taking up peroxide oxygen,
        whereby a migration of valences or electrons from oxygen to
        carbon is produced. (2) The peroxide or ozonide of the
        unsaturated substance. </p>
      <p>After the two atoms of peroxide oxygen have been taken up and
        the valence uniting them splits, an additional migration of
        electrons from oxygen to carbon and hydrogen takes place. It is
        these electronic vibrations that constitute the fundamental
        recovery process in that they initiate electromagnetic waves
        which are absorbed by resonant bodies, that is, bodies of the
        same type of structure, and institute oxidation reactions in
        these bodies. In this way the unsaturated carbon groupings are
        made to take up oxygen and to form carbon dioxide and water and
        are destroyed. The disease process, therefore, is eliminated at
        its very foundation. </p>
      <p>It will be understood that the more peroxide oxygen that can be
        taken up as compared to carbon and hydrogen content, the more
        efficient the substance, and a body able to take up enough
        oxygen to completely combust the other elements is most
        efficient. </p>
      <p>The substances mentioned are very unstable and must necessarily
        be to vigorously auto-oxidize, and their preparation involves
        great care and cleanliness, lest the least trace of impurity
        initiate a decomposition. In order to satisfy the requirements
        and still produce efficient agents, the sulfonates of these
        substances may be employed as well as the original unsaturated
        bodies, and since these sulfonates are produced in the same
        process in the methods to be described, it is necessary to
        separate them from the crude product and the crude product may
        be used as such, the unsaturated bodies being more stable in the
        presence of the sulfonates and sulfonates, being more stable,
        secure a more prolonged action. It will be appreciated that
        while the unsaturated bodies start a vigorous initial action,
        the sulfonates continue the process and secure greater effect. </p>
      <p>(A) Among the substances capable of being used for conversion
        into unsaturated bodies in the practice of my invention are
        organic substances such as ethyl alcohol, ethyl ether, glycolic
        acid, glyoxalic acid, glyoxal, acetaldehyde, acetic acid,
        glycerol, glyceric acid, methyl glyoxal, lactic, formic or
        oxalic acid and the various monosaccharides such as fructose or
        glucose. These substances are each mixed separately or in ether
        solution with from three to six times the weight of a mixture of
        two parts fuming and one part concentrated sulfuric acid or an
        equivalently strong phosphoric acid. The mixture is then heated
        until sulfur dioxide is evolved. A stream of ethylene gas is
        then passed through the mixture to carry over the products of a
        distillate. This distillate contains both the unsaturated
        hydrocarbons and the hydrogen ethyl esters of the substances
        involved, all of which are of service in the treatment of
        disease. Consequently they need not be separated, but are
        diluted in water in proportion of less than one part to a
        thousand of water, and sealed in ampoules to be used as
        hypodermic injections. </p>
      <p>(B) As an alternative the product of distillation may be
        extracted with ether, and the ether extract dried over anhydrous
        sodium sulfate and then mixed with an excess of dry hydrogen
        peroxide and evaporated in a vacuum desicator until it reaches
        crystallization or a syrup-like consistence. Enough hydrogen
        peroxide should be taken up to make the product explosive on
        concussion or upon being heated. </p>
      <p>(C) The liquid left over after ether extraction may be
        evaporated over caustic potash in a vacuum desicator until the
        sulfur dioxide excess is removed and then precipitated with a
        solution of barium chloride and the precipitate filtered off.
        The precipitate is extracted with warm water and crystallized in
        a vacuum desicator over sulfuric acid. The excess of barium is
        removed from the filtrate with sodium sulfate, the filtrate then
        evaporated over sulfuric acid in a vacuum desicator to
        crystallization, or diluted with water in the proportions of one
        part t a thousamd or more of water for hypodermic use, after
        being passed through a germ-proof filter of Yena glass. The
        crystals obtained from the barium precipitate above mentioned
        are likewise dissolved in water, filtered and sealed in apoules
        for hypodermic use. The barium sulfonates of the substances are
        thus obtained. As an alternative calcium chloride can be used in
        place of the barium to produce calcium sulfonates. </p>
      <p>(D) The filtrate first above mentioned&nbsp; in procedure (C),
        after evaporation to dryness, is mixed with an ether solution of
        an excess of dry hydrogen peroxide and evaporated in a vacuum
        desicator over sulfuric acid to a syrup or crystals and the
        product dissolved in water in proportions of one part to more
        than one thousand parts of water. The peroxides are thus
        obtained. </p>
      <p>(E) Organic substances such as propargylic acid, propargylic
        aldehyde, acetylene, acetylene dicarboxylic acid, diacetylene
        discarboxylic acid, oxalic acid, formic acid, vinyl alcohol,
        vinyl ether, acrolein, formaldehyde, in dry ether solution are
        exposed to a dry ether solution of hydrogen peroxide in slight
        excess and evaporated in a vacuum desicator over sulfuric acid,
        and the concentrate, srup or crystals are dissolved in water in
        the proportios of one part substance to more than one thousand
        parts water, filtered through Yena glass microbe filter and
        sealed in ampoules. </p>
      <p>(F) The substances of procedures (A) and (E) may be passed over
        a heated platinum surface, heated less than red hot, and the
        gases condensed, and dried in a vacuum desicator over sulfuric
        acid to form peroxides. These peroxides are dissolved in water
        in proportion of one part to more tan one thousand parts of
        water and passed through a Yena glass microbe filter&nbsp; by
        pressure and sealed in ampoules. </p>
      <p>(G) The substances of procedures (A) and (E) may be dissolved
        separately in water and exposed to ultraviolet light. In the
        water solution of the substance, a trace --- one part to 100,000
        or less --- of the sulfate of a metal used as a sensitizing
        catalyst is dissolved to resonate the particular wavelength of
        the light desired. Thus a mercury salt is used to resonate a
        wavelength of 2500 uu, lead for 3573 uu, bismuth for 3067 uu,
        antimony for 2597 uu, arsenic for 2780 uu. The exposure to the
        ultraviolet light is continued until the formation of peroxides
        has reached its limit. The product is then diluted in water in
        proportion of one part substance to more than 1000 parts water,
        and sealed in sterile ampoules. </p>
      <p>The reactions involved in the action of the fuming sulfuric
        acid mixture upon the various substances can be exemplified by
        the action on ethyl ether and acetaldehyde, thus: </p>
      <p>Ethyl ether plus sulfuric acid produces </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="381496a.jpg" height="703" width="553"></p>
      </center>
      The sulfuric acid of the strength used is both a hydrolyzing and
      powerful oxidizing substance. The action on the ether linkage
      results in a splitting of the ether into two alcohol, two aldehyde
      and two carboxyl groups. Thus the disulfuric acid derivative of

          <b><font size="+1">Process for the Production of Triquinoyl
              and its Polymers</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>The invention relates to a process for the production of
        triquinoyl and its polymers having therapeutic properties. </p>
      <p>According to the invention there is provided a process for the
        production of a solution containing triquinoyl or a mixture
        thereof with its polymers, which process comprises chlorinating
        an aqueous solution of inositol or a mixture therof with its
        polymers, which process comprises chlorinating an aqueous
        solution of inositol in the presence of light of 40 C to 60 C,
        treating the product with barium chloride to obtain barium
        rhodizonate, treating said rhodizonate with sulfuric acid to
        obtain rhodizonic acid, and treating the acid so obtained with
        manganese dioxide. </p>
      <p>The amount of manganese dioxide is controlled in accordance
        with the product which it is desired to obtain. </p>
      <p>The amount can be controlled so as to regulate the reaction and
        in this way it is possible to obtain a substantially complete
        oxidation of the rhodizonic acid to triquinoyl without further
        change to the compound. The amount can, however, be further
        adjusted in order that such change does occur whereby
        proportions of the polymers are obtained. </p>
      <p>Therefore, according to a feature of the invention, the amount
        of manganese dioxide may be controlled so as to obtain
        triquinoyl as the product. </p>
      <p>Alternatively the amount of manganese dioxide with which the
        rhodizonic acid is treated is so adjusted as to obtain
        conversion of the triquinoyl to its polymers. </p>
      <p>According to a preferred feature residual impurities are
        filtered off from the product. </p>
      <p>The solution of inositol may be a 1% solution. </p>
      <p>According to a further preferred feature, chlorination is
        continued until the temperature of the solution falls to ambient
        temperature. When this temperature is reached, the reaction
        solution is preferably maintained in darkness until the
        formation of a dark-colored precipitate and the evolution of a
        gas have finished. </p>
      <p>The solution containing triquinoyl and its polymers preferably
        has added thereto additional material which is (i)nickel
        sulphate, cobalt sulfate, manganese sulfate, or molybdenum
        sulfate and (ii)ferric sulfate, cupric sulfate, or zinc sulfate,
        the zinc being in its higher oxidation state. </p>
      <p>It has been found that the compound produced by the process of
        the invention has therapeutically valuable properties and can be
        used everywhere where oxidation and/or reduction agents are
        utilizable to cure illnesses. Furthermore the compound is useful
        for blocking electron transfer. </p>
      <p>The following Examples illustrate the invention: </p>
      <p><b>Example I</b> </p>
      <p>Chlorine gas is passed into a 1% aqueous solution of inositol
        which is simultaneously exposed to the light of a daylight lamp
        or to bright sunlight at a temperature of from 40 C to 60 C.
        This is maintained until the temperature has returned to room
        temperature. The reaction solution is kept in the dark until the
        formation of gas is finished and a black precipitate has formed.
      </p>
      <p>The solution is filtered and the filtrate neutralized with
        sodium bicarbonate and treated with barium chloride, whereby
        barium rhodizonate and a small amount of polymerized barium salt
        compounds precipitate as a reddish precipitate which precipitate
        is separated by filtration. </p>
      <p>The precipitate of barium rhodizonate is treated with dilute
        sulfuric acid whereby the barium compound is converted to barium
        sulfate which can be filtered off leaving a filtrate which is a
        very weak acid solution, which is then treated with manganese
        dioxide. </p>
      <p>The amount of manganese dioxide added determines the
        composition of the product. The amount may be controlled so that
        the rhodizonic acid is oxidized to triquinoyl, but may be
        varied, if desired, to obtain proportions of the polymers of
        triquinoyl. Any impurities, such as manganese dioxide or
        sulfates, present in the product can be removed, for example by
        filtration to give a solution which is designated solution I
        herein. </p>
      <p>The solution filtered off from the reddish precipitate as
        mentioned hereinbefore, is treated with sulfuric acid to
        precipitate barium sulfate. The latter is removed by filtration.
        The resulting clear solution, designated as solution II herein,
        contains a small amount of triquinoyl and its polymers and, in
        addition, high polymers of rhodizonic acid. </p>
      <p><b>Example II</b> </p>
      <p>The solution obtained in accordance with Example I containing
        triquinoyl and its polymers. i.e., solution I, is added to
        solution II. The solution obtained is designated herein as
        solution III. Both solutions show themselves to be good reducing
        agents directly in the cold with Fehling’s and Benedict’s
        solutions. A quantitative test of solution III showed, with
        reference to its power as a reducing agent on Fehling’s
        solution, that the solution III contained approximately 1% of
        reducing substances. </p>
      <p><b>Example III</b> </p>
      <p>1 ml of solution III is diluted with sterile distilled water to
        10 ml. Each cubic centimeter of solution then contains about 1
        mg of reducing substances. If 1 ml of the solution III is
        diluted with 1 liter of sterile distilled water then the
        concentration of reducing substances is 1 microgram per ml. This
        solution is designated as solution IV. </p>
      <p><b>Example IV</b> </p>
      <p>Since the molecular weights of triquinoyl and its polymers are
        rather high it is advantageous if the amount of oxidizing and/or
        reducing substances is increased by substances having a lower
        molecular weight such as glyoxal or methyl glyoxal. For this
        purpose 1 liter of solution III is treated with 1 mg of glyoxal,
        1 mg of methyl glyoxal, and 1 mg of p-benzoquinone. This
        solution is designated as solution V. </p>
      <p><b>Example V</b> </p>
      <p>It has been shown that the cations of some metals in their
        higher oxidation state assist the oxidation and/or reduction
        powers of carbonyl compounds in tissue exchanges where an
        electron transport is required from the substrata to the
        carbonyl compound and from the carbonyl compound to an electron
        receiver on the way to acid. For this reason 1 liter of the
        solution V is t reated with 1 microgram of nickel sulfate or
        molybdenum sulfate and 1 mg of an iron sulfate, copper sulfate,
        or zinc sulfate where the last-mentioned metals are in their
        higher oxidation states. </p>
      <p><b>Example VI</b> </p>
      <p>Solution V is adjusted to pH&nbsp; by adding sulfuric acid and
        drawn through a sintered bacteria filter of Pyrex glass and put
        into ampoules in aseptic conditions and used as an oxidizing
        and/or reduction means in illnesses in which there is a blocking
        of the electron transfer. </p>

          <b><font size="+1">Process for the Production of Unsaturated
              Compounds from a Hexose</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>My invention relates to the production of unsaturated bodies
        from sugars, namely, glucose, fructose, and similar substances,
        and such of their decomposition products as lend themselves to
        the process. </p>
      <p>It is my theory that oxidation of the materials above mentioned
        can be made to proceed as a peroxidation of unsaturated groups
        which are produced by the removal of water. Thus in the process
        of this invention the first step consists in the removal of
        hydroxyl from the carbonyl group and the removal of the hydrogen
        attached to the carbon in alpha position to the carbonyl group,
        as a molecule of water. The unsaturated group that is produced
        is able to add oxygen (activated oxygen) and undergo cleavage at
        this point with the formation of two carbonyl groups. Thus
        fructose is split into two, three-carbon chains which may
        undergo change to lactic acid and related substances, which in
        turn are able also to undergo loss of water with the production
        of unsaturated bodies. </p>
      <p>In the same way glucose, by losing hydroxyl and hydrogen in the
        beta and alpha positions, respectively , to the carbonyl group
        accomplish a desaturation which can add activated oxygen and
        cleave to form two keto groups, one on a two-carbon chain and
        the other on a four-carbon chain. By repeating the same process
        on the four carbon chain, three two-carbon chain groupings are
        produced which by further desaturation yield highly polymerizing
        bodies. The positioning of the initial desaturations is
        accomplished through the catalysts of a halogen, preferably
        iodine as such or in combination, such as calcium iodide, or an
        organic form of iodine in which the carrier is a benzene ring or
        in which an alipathic chain with or without nitrogen serve as
        carrier, such, for example, as an iodine compound of creatine. </p>
      <p>Active dehydration is produced by a strong mineral acid such as
        a mixture of fuming and strong sulfuric acid or a comparably
        strong phosphoric acid. </p>
      <p>In the process dry glucose or dry fructose is mixed with an
        excess of strong mineral acid containing the selected halogen
        catalyst. The proportion of hexose to acid may be varied, but by
        way of example I suggest mixing the hexose with from 3 to 6
        times its weight of a mixture of 2 parts fuming and on part
        concentrated sulfuric acid or an equivalently strong phosphoric
        acid. In case that free iodine is chosen as the halogen catalyst
        the amount required is preferably less than one-hundredth of one
        percent of the amount of hexose used. As to the phosphoric acid,
        I prefer to employ a mixture of phosphoric anhydride and 85%
        phosphoric acid in such proportions of each that the mixture
        contains the minimum amount of water and is still able to flow.
        The catalyst is added to the acid and to this is added the dry
        pulverized sugar. The mixture is covered and allowed to stand at
        about body temperature until the sugar is apparently fully
        dissolved. The mixture is then warmed gradually to around 100 C,
        and the mixture well shaken to distribute the heat and to
        prevent overheating of any part, until it reaches a deep
        burgundy color in which a column, a centimeter in thickness, is
        almost opaque. The quicker the heating the sooner it reaches the
        color mentioned. I have found, however, it is better to conduct
        the process slowly, taking two or three hours for its
        accomplishment. </p>
      <p>According to my interpretation, the dehydrated sugar has,
        through it free valencies, activated oxygen present and become a
        peroxide and cleavage has taken place. Some of the desaturated
        substance under the influence of peroxide has polymerized. As
        the desaturation and peroxidation and cleavage have resulted in
        each and further desaturation is accomplished, the desaturated
        bodies form peroxides which catalyze further polymerization of
        the unsaturated bodies formed. The polymers thus produced may be
        cleaved into their component parts by high dilution with water
        or preferably by distillation. I place the mixture in a flask
        that is connected with a condenser and pass a stream of gas,
        such as carbon dioxide, through the apparatus while the mixture
        is being heated, but below the temperature at which
        decomposition is so fast as to produce inconvenient foaming, so
        that the products can be carried over before undergoing to much
        deleterious decomposition. </p>
      <p>In the condensed product is found a mixture of substances
        containing modified products of the unsaturated substances
        obtained by the distillation of the polymers and also in
        equilibrium with them the unsaturated substances desired in
        sufficient concentration for further dilution and use for
        treatment of disease. </p>
      <p>As mentioned above, my process is directed to the production of
        unsaturated bodies from hexose and hexose decomposition
        products, such as their oxidation products and sulfuric and
        phosphoric acid derivatives. It is to be understood, also, that
        fuming and concentrated sulfuric acid may be substituted for the
        strong acid hereinabove referred to. </p>
