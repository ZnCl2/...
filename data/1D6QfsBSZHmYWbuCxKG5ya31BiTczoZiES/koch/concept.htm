          <blockquote>Today the dominant and orthodox concept of
            treatment of disease is and always has been destruction of
            the patho­genic factor, the germ, the cancer cell, etc.
            Today it is known as the cytolytic (cell destroying
            principle). Only homeopathy has carried a different or
            constructive idea.
            <p><b><i>The Koch Concept exhibits some of the features of
                  homeopathy, and is constructive and corrective. Thus,
                  in the performance of this Therapy, germs and virus
                  are not killed but are changed to their normal
                  non-pathogenic status. Cancer cells are relieved of
                  their injurious factor and are given the chance to
                  reconstruct to normalcy; the paralyzed nerve cells are
                  cleared of the virus that has blocked their func­tion
                  so the cell is free to perform its function again. Dr.
                  Koch has used this circumstance to prove that the
                  virus that had integrated with the nerve cell is
                  actually removed, because as long as the virus
                  occupies the vital positions within the cell, the cell
                  function is paralyzed, and when function returns the
                  virus must be absent.</i></b> </p>
            <p>There is also a principle in therapeutics, which combines
              the destructive idea with the constructive. For example,
              vaccines are killed germs or viruses, or very much injured
              germs or viruses and not in themselves able to produce a
              frank disease, although they have sufficient toxicity to
              excite a contrary protective action on the part of the
              body. When injected, the body produces an anti-toxic
              substance that is protective. However, the protective
              power of the vaccines is very limited, and after viral
              infection has taken place, the response in a protective
              way cannot be elicited. </p>
            <p>This is seen in the vaccines that are used against viral
              diseases in cattle. * It is seen in the Salk and Sabin
              polio vaccines, showing only protective action before
              infection has taken place, and sometimes even causing the
              disease they are supposed to prevent, but no curative
              action whatsoever is possible. Drug houses have paid
              heavily in suits brought against them for injury caused by
              the Salk and Sabin polio vaccines. </p>
            <p><i>(* The<b> </b>Survival Factor in Neoplastic and Viral
                Diseases.)</i> </p>
            <p><b>It is well known too that once a virus penetrates a
                cell, that cell is doomed, since no known orthodox
                system of treatment can separate the virus from the
                vital part of the host cell by any amount of anti-toxic
                serum, vaccine, or other measure of that kind. </b>This
              is because the atomic bonding between the host cell and
              the virus are so firm that once the integration is made it
              cannot be broken by any orthodox means. This firm
              integration between the virus and the cell takes place
              within one and a half minutes after the virus has
              penetrated. </p>
            <p><b>With the Koch System the situation is different. He
                has worked out a Postulate as to the nature of the
                functional mechanism of the cell, particularly the
                chemical structure of the energy-producing and
                energy-accepting mechanism to which he concluded that
                the pathogens attach themselves to produce not only
                paralytic disease, but also all other disturbances of
                function. He has demonstrated that all classes of
                disease fall into the same pattern and hence, are under
                the province of action of his system of correction.</b>
              This includes cancer, rabies, and other fatal viral
              infections, and focal infections whose toxins are the
              pathogenic agents in such metabolic disorders as toxic
              goiter and diabetes. <b>This wide range of disease,
                according to his clinical demonstrations, depends upon
                interference with the energy production and energy
                reception of the functional units of the cell.</b> </p>
            <p><b>In order to work out the state of combinations of a
                pathogen of any kind with the host cell, Dr. Koch had to
                identify the atomic groups of the pathogen that made the
                combina­tions. He decided that the pattern of
                combination is the same for all diseases he has
                investigated, and that <i>one atomic arrangement and
                  electronic disposition in the pathogen </i>gives it
                the power to make the combinations, and. that two atomic
                groups associated together are essential to the energy
                producing mechanism and the energy accepting mechanism
                of the host cell. </b>These he describes in detail in
              his reports, explaining the atomic groups and the
              electronic dispositions, the steric advantages, and the
              determining, bond strengths and the atomic distances that
              take part. </p>
            <p><b>Dr. Koch identified the circumstances that disposed to
                the integration of the pathogen with the functional
                units. He found that anoxia was the disposing factor. </b>In





              this finding the great Dr. Otto Warburg supports him but
              the rest of Koch’s Theory is quite different from that of
              Warburg. The latter’s proposal limits further progress in
              his clarification beyond the fact of anoxia, whereas Dr.
              Koch by demonstrat­ing how anoxia works in detail goes far
              beyond Warburg who claimed that cancer was irreversible. <b>Dr.




                Koch showed not only that the carcinogenic process is
                reversible, but also the process by which the reversal
                can be accomplished.</b> </p>
            <p>Let us take a look at one disease entity that <b><i>Dr.
                  Koch has explained — cancer.</i></b> <b>His
                exposition identifies three factors in the production of
                cancer; <i>a disposing factor</i> responsible for the
                anoxia, <i>an initiating carcinogen</i>, and <i>a
                  supportive or propagative carcinogen.</i></b> </p>
            <p>The disposing factor is a fungus found in all specimens
              of cancer. Dr. Glover identified it in 1923. This author
              found it in 1942. Dr. Irene Diller, a leading
              bacteriologist at the University of Pennsylvania,
              identified it in 1948. So it is well identified and, as
              Dr. Koch claims, its product, an amine quite similar to
              the amines of the antibiotic class used so widely in
              medicine that causes the gelation of the blood in the area
              that develops cancer as well as in the general
              circulation, and this brings about the anoxia required for
              the further evolution of the pathogenic process. </p>
            <p><b><i>The initiating carcinogen is described by Dr. Koch
                  as quite often a bacterial, nitrogenous product,
                  amines and mercaptans, sulfydryl compounds that are
                  easily dehydrated to form a free radical that adds to
                  one of the atomic groups of the energy producing and
                  energy accepting mechanisms. </i>The group to which
                the sulfur free radical adds in the host cell is an
                ethylenic linkage, which is essentially two carbon atoms
                joined by double bonds and possessing a rich quota of
                mobile electrons.</b> </p>
            <p><b>This double bond is conjugated with a <i>Carbonyl
                  group</i> that does the dehydrating of fuels, viruses
                or carcinogens that enter its field to start their
                combustion that supplies the energy for function. </b>By






              this act, when adequate molecular oxygen is at hand, it
              protects against disease. <b>But when oxygen is lacking,
                the free radical formed by the dehydrogenation cannot</b>
              <b>combine oxygen and form a peroxide free radical to
                continue the combustion process.This <i>free radical
                  can do only one thing</i>, and that is <i>add to the
                  closest double bond</i> at hand, and this double bond
                is the very one that is conjugated with and <i>activates






                  the Carbonyl group</i> which removed its hydrogen atom
                to form the free radical. Thereby the foreign substance,
                or fuel product, is integrated with the host cell’s
                functional mechanism and paralyzes its energy
                production, and <i>normal function is blocked</i>.</b>
              However, <b>the <i>function can be forced beyond</i>
                physiological control <i>by receiving vicarious energy</i>
                as the result of the following events, and thereby <i>the






                  various allergies and cancer can come about.</i></b> </p>
            <p><b>The <i>addition of the free radical to the double
                  bond </i>as stated above, has an <i>initiating
                  significance, </i>for the other terminal of this bond
                <i>becomes a free radical </i>which adds to one
                terminal of the most exposed double bond of the
                pro­pagating allergen or carcinogen if one happens to be
                pres­ent. This <i>produces a free radical at the other
                  pole</i>, which adds to another molecule of the same
                substance in the same way to start <i>a polymerization
                  process</i> that produces the energy, which <i>passes
                  right into the energy receiving mech­anism</i> of some
                functional unit <i>to force its activity</i>. </b>Thus
              the function of secretion as in hay fever, the
              contractions of bronchial muscles as in asthma, the
              continuous generation of impulses as in the fixed ideas,
              or compulsions of insanity. Or when the mitotic mechanism
              is affected, the uncontrolled cell divisions of neoplasia
              are produced. <i><b>This is the concept of Dr. Koch
                  offering a Least Common Denomi­nator in, pathogenesis
                  as based on the properties of the double bond, its
                  alpha-placed methylene groups and the free radical.</b>
                <b>He uses these same properties to accomplish an
                  orderly reversal of the pathogenesis.</b></i> </p>
            <p><b>The substances that are able to serve as initiating
                carcino­gens are several products: the <i>products of
                  tobacco smoke</i> and <i>exhaust gases</i> from
                combustion engines, <i>illuminating gas</i>, etc., as
                well as many <i>industrial products and dyes</i>. Among
                <i>propagating carcinogens</i>, according to Dr. Koch,
                ar<i>e viruses, products of germ metabolism elaborated
                  in anoxic foci that is in dense scars that healed some
                  serious infection</i>, as in the tonsils, the
                appendix, etc. Here the germ product does not receive
                enough oxygen to cause its de­structive combustion, and
                the <i>free radicals liberated add to the double bond
                  to constitute a polymerizationprocess.</i> Such <i>products





                  can enter the bloodstream</i> and penetrate tissue
                cells <i>and combine with the energy producing
                  mechanism or energy accepting mechanism</i>, as
                described in Dr. Koch’s books, and continue
                polymerizations that yield <i>the energy which forces
                  the cell divisions of cancer.</i></b> There is much
              more to it than this. However, enough is said to show that
              a definite process of carcinogenesis is exposed, and in
              this process the means for its reversal, the correction or
              if you wish, the cure of the disease is provided. <b><i>Nature,






                  herself, provides for the cure right in the
                  pathogenesis.Viruses are initiating carcinogens that
                  require the cooperation of the polymerizing bacterial
                  products to complete the act of cancer production.</i></b></p>
