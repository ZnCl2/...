      <p>"...After failing in its attempt to gain sole control over his
        research, Organized Medicine launched a fifty-year, unlimited
        assault aimed at discrediting Dr. Koch’s reputation, medical
        practice and research, along with those of any physician who
        dared to validate his Theories or use his Reagents. Organized
        Medicine developed an extensive propaganda campaign,
        disseminated false information on Reagent chemistry and publicly
        dismissed the Koch Theories, which emphasized the relationship
        between environmental toxins, dietary deficiencies and a
        depleted oxidation mechanism, as primary initiators of the
        disease process. </p>
      <p>"Because Dr. Koch endured such extensive persecution in regard
        to his science, he determined that the medical/pharmacological
        industry would forever remain unwilling to independently
        monitor, document or validate any of his ongoing laboratory
        research or medical case histories; therefore since his death,
        December 9, 1967, there have been no authentic Koch Reagents
        reproduced.<b> It was because of the scurrilous intentions held
          by the medical/pharmacological industry that Dr. Koch
          intentionally withheld specific knowledge required in the
          production of viable Koch Reagents. </b>(Therefore, any
        claims to the contrary should be viewed as suspect.)" </p>

      <h1> <font size="-0">PATHOGENESIS</font></h1>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Primary,
          general, and residual focal infections take place and persist
          only where there is deficiency in the tissue oxidation
          catalysis.</font>
        <p><font size="-0">Germ poisons absorbed from infection foci may
            circulate in the blood and adsorb into tissues and produce
            their specific effects only when the oxidation catalysis of
            blood and tissues is deficient.</font></p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Germ poisons are
          negative oxidation catalysts. They secure "anaerobic"
          environment necessary to the life of germ chemistry and
          unfavorable to the progress of tissue oxidation chemistry, by
          (a) totally quenching it and producing tissue necrosis, by (b)
          absorbing the energy of cell oxidations and under specific
          conditions transferring it to the chemical process of some
          functional unit in the cell, thus forcing uncontrolled,
          continuous allergic activity of that functional unit. (The
          specific condition that determines this energy transfer and
          acceptance action is the similarity in emission range of
          fluorescence of the toxin to the energy absorption range of
          the functional unit;) by (c) quenching the oxidation of
          ethylene or quinone groups of fluorescent substances in foods
          or tars or certain germ poisons so they remain to disturb
          function, producing allergic action of the reproductive
          elements, or of the contractile, secreting, or conductile
          elements of the cell, thus producing cancer, asthma, hay
          fever, contractures, or fixed ideas, etc., respectively.</font>
        <p><font size="-0">The atomic groups concerned in all germ
            poisonings and allergenic action are the unsaturated
            valencies between carbon atoms, between carbon and oxygen,
            and between carbon and nitrogen, which confer photochemic
            properties. They are destructible by vigorous oxidation
            brought about through appropriate oxidation catalysis.</font>
        </p>
        <p><font size="-0">The severity of any allergic change follows
            certain definite conditions. Thus the degree of malignancy
            is proportionate to, (1) the degree of oxidation deficiency
            present (2) the amount of toxin circulating, (3) the
            closeness of the source of toxin to the malignant cells, as
            when the neoplasm takes origin in the infection focus
            itself, (4) the degree of injury to the circulation within
            the focus of infection and within the neoplasm, as when
            caused by scar or the effects of traumatism,&nbsp; and
            finally (5) the degree of malignant expression in the
            forefathers, especially where each successive generation
            tends to develop cancer earlier and earlier in life. (Thus
            the pre?growth toxic period tends to become shorter and
            shorter with each successive generation until the growth
            develops and kills before the reproductive age arrives.)</font></p>

        <b><font size="-0">THERAPY</font></b></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; <br>
        <font size="-0">The destruction of toxic action through
          oxidation is the natural protective process. The catalysts
          concerned are those that mediate oxidation of sugars and fats
          for energy production for normal functional purposes. These
          bodies are Glyoxylide, O=C=C=O. Malonide, O=C=C=C=O. Ketene,
          H2C=C=O. Lactene, H2C=C=C=O. and 1:4, Benzoquinone. They
          activate oxygen and they also activate ethylene and quinone
          groups of toxic molecules to take up oxygen, thus destroying
          the free valency that produces their toxic photochemic action.
          This is the ultimate in all immunity chemistry and even where
          obscure chemotherapeutic s have been found helpful this
          principle will he found operative fundamentally.</font>
        <p><font size="-0">For instance, the sulpho compounds in common
            use are very toxic to the tissues, each must first be
            oxidized to para amino quinone, which is next oxidized to 1
            :4, benzoquinone and then to two molecules of the suboxide
            of carbon, "Malonide" or three molecules of Glyoxylide
            before it serves as a protective oxidation catalyst.</font></p>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">When the tissue
          oxidations are too feeble to accomplish this oxidation, harm
          instead of benefit is received. There can be no question as to
          the preference of the harmless directly active agents, over
          the original toxic sulphonamide molecules.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Glyoxylide is
          basic to every disease known to man in our experience and is
          not contraindicated in meningitis or any other condition but
          can be used with the expectation of doing good and not
          injuring the patient in any way whatever.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><b><font size="-0">RECOVERY
            PROCESS</font></b></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">When the
          pathogenic toxin is removed by this type of oxidation, its
          intermediaries have catalytic curative action also and so the
          "cause is turned into the cure," as I have insisted since
          1918. The germs depending upon it must die and all secondary
          toxins are burned; tissues still living resume normal
          function; injured cells are removed and replaced by normal
          tissue elements, and not by scar. Hence, normal function is
          restored. Scars that had been protecting focal infections are
          now obsolete and are absorbed and replaced by normal tissue
          elements more or less thoroughly. Focal infection as well as
          acute germ invasion is routed out and the allergies and
          degenerative diseases depending upon the old focal poisoning
          give way to normalcy, even with tissue reconstruction and
          return of function.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">This return to
          normalcy is a cyclic procedure, the periodicity of which is
          grossly similar to the periodicity of the genesis of the
          disease. The periods are made up of positive and negative
          phases, the shortest unit of which is three hours. This period
          is multiplied into twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six hour
          cycles, etc., these are further multiplied into three and a
          half, seven, ten and a half. and fourteen-day cycles, these
          into three-week, six-week, nine-week, and twelve-week cycles,
          and these into six-month, nine-month, twelve-month, and
          greater cycles. Especially important are the twelfth,
          twenty-fourth, thirty-sixth, sixtieth and seventy-second week
          periods.</font></div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Recovery is
          generally secured on one or two doses, but if the dose is to
          be repeated this is done during a negative phase only and at
          one of the divisional periods, such as the third, sixth,
          ninth, twelfth, twenty-fourth, thirty-sixth, fifty-first,
          sixtieth, or seventy-second week. It is never repeated while
          recovery is in progress.</font> </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> ---&nbsp; A solution containing triquinoyl or a
        mixture thereof with its polymers is prepared by chlorinating an
        aqueous solution of inositol in the presence of light at 40 to
        60 C., treating the product with barium chloride to obtain
        barium rhodizontate, treating the rhodizonate with sulphuric
        acid to obtain rhodizonic acid and treating the acid so obtained
        with manganese dioxide. The amount of manganese dioxide is
        controlled in accordance with the product which it is desired to
        obtain. The amount can be controlled so as to obtain a
        substantially complete oxidation of the rhodizonic acid to
        triquinoyl without further change to the compound or the amount
        can be increased so that proportions of the polymers are
        obtained. &nbsp; </p>
