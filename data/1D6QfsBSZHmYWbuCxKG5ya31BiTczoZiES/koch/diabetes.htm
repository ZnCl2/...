      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The period of
          observation includes scattered cases treated since 1922 and
          recent systematic studies. The cases treated cover about every
          type known, including a few of diabetes insipidus.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The treatment
          material consists of catalytic dilutions of the carriers of
          aerobic oxidation which we have described in the past
          elsewhere. (1) These substances are 1:4 B Benzoquinone and its
          transition products Glyoxylide, (O=C=C=O), and Malonide,
          (O=C=C=C=O), and also Ketene. Their chemical structures
          conform to the rules we have laid down as requisite to the
          production of immunity against disease; namely, they possess
          the smallest molecular weight possible; they possess carbonyl
          groups that share ethylene linkages or carbonyl groups that
          are conjugated with ethylene linkages in molecules that can
          yield carbonyl groups sharing ethylene linkages. (2)</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Substances of this
          type can be extracted from the heart and brain. Such extracts
          demonstrate the same curative results as the synthetic
          products and, like them, correct a definite blood coagulation
          deficiency. Because of this physiological property, I named
          them "Tissue Thrombin" and showed that they are able to cure
          cancer, in a paper published in the <i>New York Medical
            Record</i> in October, 1920. The synthetic products can be
          used with good control while the tissue extracts are very
          unreliable and have only academic interests. Vitamin K offers
          very weak protective properties in addition to its influence
          on blood coagulation and in its little way confirms what we
          have been teaching for years with, reference to carbonyl and
          ethylene groups in the catalysis of the oxidations. There is
          beginning to be a general appreciation of the significance of
          these findings. This is important, since it is our mission to
          demonstrate that the common basis of disease of all kinds;
          including diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus, is a
          specific defect in the oxidation catalysis.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The clinical data
          indicate that the cause of diabetes is the prolonged poisoning
          of the tissues by bacterial products liberated in scars that
          have scanty circulation. These products are intended to serve
          the nutrition of the germs that produce them and are
          originally of fairly small molecular weight, diffusible, and
          fully oxidizable by the oxidation mechanism of healthy
          tissues. However, when secreted under the anaerobic conditions
          prevailing in scars they are not burned, but instead some of
          their free valencies yield to polymerizations by which the
          molecular weight increases progressively while the photochemic
          properties vary also with the different stages in the
          polymerizations. The different photochemic values have
          different pathogenic powers, and so as the polymerizations
          progress, the patient passes through a series of different
          pathogenic influences that produce different symptomatologies
          and physical changes.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Diabetes is one of
          these effects, with a predilection to express itself in
          certain persons and races. Neuritis, various degenerative
          diseases, psoriasis and other changes may be exhibited, but
          the final change in all, if the patient lives long enough to
          develop it, is cancer. Here too the hereditary factor plays a
          part, for we have observed that successive generations tend to
          develop malignant growths earlier and earlier in life and the
          longer the disease has expressed itself in the ancestry the
          shorter is the pre?growth, toxic period that exhibits diabetes
          or the other changes. (3)</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The oxidation
          catalysts we use therapeutically are de-polymerizing agents
          and, while the toxin is being depolymerized to its simple
          burnable structure, it passes through, the various phases that
          were active during the pathogenesis, and so fleeting
          recurrence of these changes come, and disappear in the
          reversed order while recovery is going on. Thus, when the
          patient is treated in the cancer stage of the poisoning and
          retraces the symptomatology of the pathogenesis, the last
          toxic expression to come is the first to go and the first to
          come is the last to go. Therefore, an acute inflammation in
          some old cicatrix that imprisoned the causative infection is
          the last change to take place. After the germ's nutritional
          agents have been oxidized the germ dies and the scar which
          imprisoned it becomes obsolete and is absorbed. Thus, with the
          destruction of the etiological factor, the disease is
          completely cured. When some form of diabetes is one of the
          pre?growth symptoms it is overcome before the scar is cleaned
          out and, since this happens soon after the cancer growth is
          absorbed, we conclude that the molecular weight of the toxin
          at this stage is quite great. Cases of diabetes cured by this
          treatment, before they can develop cancer, may pass through
          other expressions of the intoxication producible by greater or
          lesser molecular weights, thus the neuritis will get well
          before the diabetes and the obliterative endarteritis will
          start to heal before the blood sugar is normal. But a
          psoriasis or other change may show up transiently after the
          blood sugar has become normal. Therefore, diabetes must be
          studied as a phase of a systemic intoxication and cure cannot
          be fully established until the focus of infection has been
          wiped out. Thus the recovery is not measured alone by the
          return of the blood sugar to normal.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Polymerizations of
          pathogenic toxins, therefore, appear to us to account for the
          different stages of chronic diseases, such as the several
          stages of syphilis, the different phases of malaria and of the
          "Fourth Disease," etc. It accounts also for the creation of
          pathogenic viruses. Certain polymerization phases
          have?specific pathogenic action, while others have no action
          at all. The rapidity of the recovery from virus caused disease
          after one dose of our Benzoquinone, solution or one of the
          transition forms, Glyoxylide or Malonide, can only be
          accounted for by this assumption, for recovery from early
          acute infantile paralysis has taken place in twenty?four,
          hours and measles recovers regularly in twelve hours. The
          dreaded tropical pemphigus begins to improve in twenty?four
          hours and recovers in a few weeks, with ultimate full
          restoration of the skin. The virus action is probably
          destroyed in the first three or four days, so far as the
          "Wild?fire" itself is concerned.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Obliterative
          endarteritis, which is a specific effect of the poison that
          causes diabetes, we regard as the lesion that specifically
          indicates a depression of the oxidation catalysis of the
          tissues, general or local. Therefore, this lesion is a
          definite indication that the oxidation catalysts we have
          contributed to medicine should be employed to remove the basic
          cause of many diseases, including Buerger's disease, leprosy,
          tuberculosis, syphilis, cancer, and so many more. There can
          belittle doubt that the endothelial hyperplasia is a
          compensatory attempt to increase the surface for filtration of
          oxygen from blood to, the tissues, even though it defeats its
          own purpose. The demand for activated oxygen on the part of
          the tissues is also expressed by poor sugar oxidation as
          observed in diabetes mellitus, cancer, the thyroid diseases,
          and others. By removing the basic pathology, that is, by
          restoring the oxidation catalysis to normal or better, all
          expressions of the intoxication are removed, and the
          metabolism, the blood pressure, and the tissue functions are
          again able to run along as they should. The focus of infection
          is wiped out and the disease is cured in its totality.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">After an
          intramuscular injection of our Benzoquinone solution or one of
          the other catalysts mentioned is given in diabetes, recovery
          begins very quickly and its progress can be measured by the
          decrease in the blood sugar. The amount of sugar eaten will
          affect this reading, but not the recovery mechanism. We feed
          the patient an ordinary amount of sugar and starches and as he
          recovers he is more and more able to use them. Where the sugar
          intake is controlled, however, it is usual to observe a drop
          of twenty mgms. percent every week until normal is reached.
          But we have seen both slower and more rapid restoration to
          normal. Sometimes a severe case is encountered in which the
          blood sugar is over four hundred mgms. percent and the vital
          organs have undergone fatty degeneration to a fatal extent. In
          such cases the blood sugar may come to normal and the gangrene
          heal, but the patient may, die from heart failure after
          excessive exertion, either very early or very late after
          recovery from the diabetes.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">In one series of
          cases, where the patients could be watched closely, the four
          per cent of failures belonged to this group only, but in each
          instance the blood sugar came to normal before death. Acidosis
          is not a serious factor either, because with the restoration
          of the oxidation of sugar, the fatty acids are also burned.
          The recovery is not simply the reduction of the blood sugar to
          normal. It involves the correction of the whole pathology and
          the removal of its cause. Therefore, the use of insulin is not
          essential. Indeed, it is better as a rule to do without it
          from the commencement of treatment so as to avoid a
          hypoglycemia in cases making rapid recoveries. The few cases
          of diabetes insipidus treated so far have also recovered.</font>
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The treatment
          procedure is to stop all medication and cleanse the bowels for
          a few days. Then one dose of one of the oxidation catalysts is
          injected intramuscularly. Except for the use of plenty of
          animal fats, the dietary regime is vegetarian entirely. No
          animal proteins whatever are permitted. Thus the production of
          nitrogenous negative oxidation catalysts in the intestine is
          retarded: Colon lavage is helpful. The diet should be
          reasonable and include plenty of vitamins and tissue salts.
          Foods containing quinones and terpenes that serve as negative
          oxidation catalysts must also be eliminated from the diet.
          Therefore, coffee, tea, mangoes, and citrus fruits are not,
          used, and exposure to pint solvents, perfumes and automobile
          or furnace gases is avoided. Food should not be cooked in
          aluminum. Adequate colon lavage should be employed to assure
          proper elimination. Alcohol, tobacco, and spices are
          forbidden. One dose of the remedy is usually sufficient where
          cure is possible.</font> </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">After the remedy
          is injected one should watch for periodic reactions which play
          their part in the recovery process. These have already been
          described. (4) They generally come at three and a half day or
          three?week intervals until recovery is complete: If an
          interfering factor prevents recovery it should be identified
          and removed and the dose repeated.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font size="-0">Diabetic Mechanism</font></b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; <br>
        <font size="-0">To orthodox medicine the mechanism of diabetes
          still remains a puzzle. It is observed, however, that after a
          person dies of diabetes, his pancreas can be removed and from
          it a normal amount of insulin is extractable. (Of, course,
          syphilitic and malignant destruction of the pancreas belong to
          different categories.) The difficulties must lie with the
          function of secreting or transferring the hormone into the
          blood stream. This is a function which like muscle contraction
          requires the expenditure of energy. We may say that two
          possibilities can exist in the production of diabetes, the
          inability to produce the energy within the secreting
          fibrillae, and the inhibition of the secretory function
          through allergic action of the "sugar center" in the brain or
          an allergic action of the pituitary gland. Both the anergic
          and allergic suppression of Islet function exist on the same
          chemical basis and have one means of correction. A few
          explanatory words are in order.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">We have given a
          thorough description of the allergy mechanism in various
          writings and lectures in the past. (8) Briefly we may say that
          in this condition the cell functional elements are made to
          work "under forced draft" beyond physiological control. They
          have adsorbed into their colloidal surfaces, a fluorescent
          toxin which transfers the exothermic energy which is
          constantly evolved in living cells, into the functional
          element affected. The specificity is determined by the
          similarity in the spectral absorption range of the functional
          unit and the emission range of the fluorescent substance. So
          the energy transferred passes right into the chemical
          processes of the functional unit and forces its activity to
          proceed without the usual control. Thus are produced the
          hyper-secretion of hay fever, the contraction of the bronchial
          musculature in asthma, the conduction of a constant series of
          impulses through the neurones associated in some thought
          complex resulting in the fixed ideas and delusions of in.
          sanity and. the phenomena of hysteria. Thus also mitotic units
          are forced into uncontrolled hyperactivity in the cell
          multiplications of malignancy.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">When energy is
          prevented from being evolved in a cell functional unit, the
          work of the affected unit cannot be performed. The mechanism
          of blocking the functional process is very much of the same
          nature as that of forcing allergic behavior. Both depend upon
          the free valencies of the offending substance (toxin). In one
          instance energy is transferred from the cell substance to a
          functional unit where it does not belong and forces function;
          in the other, the energy evolved within the cell is absorbed
          by the fluorescent substance and emitted at a range that does
          not correspond to the energy absorption range of the colloids
          of the functional unit, and hence it is dissipated without
          being used. Thus the functional unit is inactivated. It
          appears that the polymerization is less advanced in the
          allergenic than in the anergenic phase. Since the free
          valencies of the offending molecule in both instances are
          subject to oxidations and the molecule itself is a polymer of
          a much simpler oxidizable structure, both effects can be
          corrected and really completely cured by completely
          de-polymerizing and oxidizing the fluorescent materials that
          cause the interferences.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">As was stated
          earlier the origins of these toxins are imprisoned germs
          living under anaerobic conditions in scar tissue, occluded
          tonsilar crypts, intestinal diverticula, etc. The toxin is the
          germ's nutritional agent and its destruction is fatal to the
          germ.</font></div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Whether or not the
          toxin has polymerized to the very advanced stage where it acts
          directly upon the secretory filaments of the Islet cells
          inhibitively, or has polymerized only to the lesser degree
          where it can act allergically upon the nerve centers that
          inhibit Islet function, or upon the pituitary to accomplish
          the same result, is, therefore, of no consequence
          therapeutically. The same treatment measure is successful, for
          it removes the pathogenic agent completely and thereby causes
          the death of the germ that produces and depends, upon the
          poison. Since the scar prison is no longer needed after the
          death of the germ, it too is disposed of and recovery is
          completed. Recovery is complete too for another reason. The
          lack of oxidation capacity that permitted acute infection to
          become chronic and produce its poisons in any tissue is
          corrected by the new vigorous oxidations instituted by, the
          treatment and since they are of the normal type that conduct
          aerobic glycolysis, it is the normal protective procedure that
          is re?established. Thus we have overcome a serious disease by
          a physiological procedure. The same system is used in securing
          true recoveries in all of the other incurable diseases and
          lent infections so far encountered for the chemistry of their
          pathogenesis is the same.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font size="-0">Relation to Other Therapies</font></b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; <br>
        <font size="-0">The curative agents, 1:4 Benzoquinone, and its
          transition products, Glyoxylide and Malonide, are the
          unrecognized active principles of the favorite sulfonamide
          chemotherapies of the present day. But the active principles
          themselves are far superior because the sulfo drugs must be
          changed to 1:4 Benzoquinone first at the expense of the tissue
          vitality before they can do service. In complicated and
          serious sickness the vitality may be too depleted to conduct
          the oxidations required to accomplish this change and then the
          toxic effects of the drug added to the infection toxins have a
          good chance to prove fatal. This situation is eliminated and
          direct curative action only is had by the use of 1:4
          Benzoquinone or Glyoxylide or Malonide. (6) It is thus evident
          that in diabetes and malignancy, sulfa drugs offer certain
          dangers.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">Vitamins B, C,
          and K and some other useful agents depend primarily upon the
          carbonyl group for their specific action. In each instance the
          rest of the molecular structure determines the specific
          position at which the carbonyl activity fits into the body
          chemistry and what its intensity should be. The free valency
          of the carbonyl group exerts a photochemic action that
          influences the formation of oxidizable ethylene groups and
          activates oxygen and other carbonyl groups. (10) Therefore
          these vitamins, and some others are special oxidation agents
          that play a part in the recovery from diabetes and cancer.
          Their forced feeding gives a good boost to the oxidations,
          enough even to produce temporary approximate recoveries in a
          few instances.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">However, for
          true curative efficiency their structures would have to be
          changed to conform to the laws of chemical structure we have
          announced.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The very
          infrequent good results from irradiation we attribute to the
          accidental dehydration of tissue inosite to "Hexylene" (9) and
          its further oxidation to Glyoxylide and Malonide with 1:4
          Benzoquinone as a possible intermediary. The carcinogenic
          action of irradiation is far better known than its curative
          action in cancer which critical investigation shows to be
          nearly nonexistent. We, therefore, suspect that irradiation
          produces a reduction of the normal catalysts of sugar
          oxidation, Hexylene, Glyoxylide, and Malonide, to 1:4
          Benzoquinone, for in fairly concentrated solution 1:4
          Benzoquinone has proved to be carcinogenic. We have attributed
          all carcinogenic action to the quinone group. (7)</font></div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The ultimate of
          all curative therapies are Glyoxylide, Malonide, Hexylene, and
          their relative 1:4 Benzoquinone because of their critical
          physiological positions. Benzoquinone is indicated in the
          acute infections and lighter allergies, while Glyoxylide
          serves best in the more chronic infections, the deeper
          allergies like cancer, and the degenerative diseases.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font size="-0">Case Histories</font></b> </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp; <br>
        <font size="-0">One interesting observation is that of a
          physician of about fifty years of age whose mother we cured of
          an enormous cancer of the breast in 1920. She was about eighty
          years of age. The son, about fifty years old, came in 1926
          with profound diabetes of two years' standing. His diet was
          carefully managed and, insulin was used regularly. Still in
          the last ix months he developed a general multiple neuritis
          that affected both legs and hips most severely so that he was
          nearly bedfast and needed crutches to move about. The
          Glyoxylide solution we were using at that time was given
          intramuscularly. The neuritis and general nutrition improved
          very quickly. It was much better in a week and in seven weeks
          it had disappeared entirely. Still the blood sugar had only
          dropped from 190 to 160 in that time and he still took some
          insulin. Recovery was not completed until after the twelfth
          week. Here we see the changes disappear in reverse order to
          their coming, and it appears that the stage of polymerization
          of the toxin causing the neuritis was farther along than that
          which affected the pancreas islets.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">A case of
          diabetes with considerable obliterative endarteritis throws
          some light on the subject. This patient, age 50, was first
          seen by us in July 1928. For about a year the obliterative
          endarteritis in both legs and feet increased in severity so
          that walking became difficult. One of our best hospitals found
          the blood sugar to be 380; gave insulin, morphine to control
          the pain, and advised him to prepare for amputation of both
          legs at the knees. He took our treatment instead and made a
          full recovery. In twelve weeks the legs were normal and at the
          sixth month the blood sugar was again estimated at the same
          hospital and found to be 90 mgms. percent. No insulin was used
          after the injection of Glyoxylide and he ate all he wished. He
          was a fatty type and suffered from dyspnoea on slight
          exertion. The, heart muscle sounds were weak and its action
          flabby. A fatty degeneration of the myocardium was suspected
          therefore. Six years later after prolonged exertion he died
          from acute cardiac dilatation. Evidently better care and a
          longer time were required to permit the heart muscle to be
          repaired with good healthy muscle tissue.</font></div>
      <div class="MsoBodyText"><font size="-0">A simple case of diabetes
          which illustrates the vast majority one encounters is
          illustrated by the woman of 73 who was discovered by her
          grandson, a diabetes expert, to be carrying a blood sugar of
          220 mgms. percent. He did not give insulin, but our 1:4
          Benzoquinone solution instead. After one injection the blood
          sugar steadily decreased by about twenty mgms. percent per
          week until normal was reached. Thus it took her about six
          weeks to recover. Her diet was not arranged to restrict
          carbohydrates rigorously. She simply ate carefully as a woman
          her age should, but all animal proteins were forbidden.</font></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">We have
          encountered diabetes complicated with rapidly advancing
          tuberculosis. Such cases do as well as though no tuberculosis
          were present and the tuberculosis undergoes recovery just as
          rapidly as though no diabetes were present, whereas, before
          treatment the two conditions definitely aggravated each other
          or rather were both aggravated by the basic crippling of the
          oxidation mechanism</font></div>
      <p style="text-align: justify;"><font size="-0">The time relations
          may be obscured sometimes as in a case of diabetes where
          cancer is present, if for instance the size of the growth is
          very large. Such a case is that of a woman of 57 whom we
          treated in 1927. The diabetes was mild, the blood sugar rarely
          exceeding 200 mgms. percent. This condition was known for a
          year before a growth was found in the left breast. The growth
          developed rapidly producing large metastases in the axilla,
          and was found inoperable at the first examination. At her
          first visit to me the volume of the growth was about a liter
          and a half, the axillary growths included. Two injections of
          Glyoxylide were given, but recovery was very slow, which is
          contrary to the rule, for the greater the growth rate, the
          greater the autolysis rate. Recovery from the growth was not
          completed until seventy?two weeks had passed. However, the
          diabetes started to improve after the thirty?sixth week and
          the blood sugar became normal before the sixtieth week. Thus
          the time required for the organization, autolysis, and
          absorption of the growth exceeded the time required to get rid
          of the pathogenic toxin by something like nine months.</font>

          profession is invited to make observations with the four
          remedies we have been using most effectively, especially
          Benzoquinone and Glyoxylide. We prepare each dose as carefully
          as possible for every patient that is chosen for treatment and
          at the most reasonable cost possible. Case discussion is
          welcomed, and advice is offered whenever desired; and all
