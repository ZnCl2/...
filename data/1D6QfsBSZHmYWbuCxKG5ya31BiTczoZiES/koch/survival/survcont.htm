<p><b><font size=+1>DEDICATION</font></b></center>

<p>This book is dedicated to the memories of two leaders in American Science
and Industry, Dr. Willard H. Dow, and Dr. William J. Hale. Their humanitarian
genius was great enough to build the vast Dow Chemical Company to its present
pro portions and service, and also take interest in other humanitarian
efforts, such as our own, which they investigated fully, evaluated carefully,
and then supported effectively in our court battle.

<p><b><font size=+1>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</font></b></center>

<p>Gratitude is due Professor Joseph Maisin, of Louvain University, for
his many experiments in small animals with and without the writer from
which conclusions of fact could be drawn.
<p>Likewise gratitude is due Dr. Willard Dow, Dr. William Hale, Dr. Drake,
Dr. Rubens and other Dow scientists for every help in every need, especially
for their winning defense against United States Government attacks instigated
by competitive drug interests.
<p>The world’s leading surgical journal, the <i>London Lancet</i>, gave
an editorial review of the present status of surgery in the treatment of
cancer. It gave the same conclusions as did Sir James Paget a century ago,
when he stated in his text on cancer that this is not a surgical disease,
that the condition was profoundly constitutional, and that operated cases
did not live as long on an average as those that were left untouched. From
1910 to 1950, the American Cancer Control Society created an energetic
propaganda that 85% of breast cancer could be cured surgically or by irradiation,
and that early diagnosis was a prime advantage. Now after the statistics
are analyzed the <i>Lancet</i> quotes the world’s leading surgeons on the
results of early operation with the same discouraging conclusions as Sir
James Paget stated a hundred years ago. In the meantime life insurance
statistics and others established the fact that operated cases, the early
cases, lived less by two and a half months than the inoperable, far advanced
cases that were not operated. Add to this two and a half months the year
or so it took the early case to become inoperable and advanced, one sees
that surgery done with all its courage, sacrifice and dexterity is not
the attack that is required to win against this disease. The <i>Lancet</i>
states, “The intensive campaigns to awaken the public to keep on the watch
for tumors and report for the earliest possible diagnosis and treatment
has met with good response, but the anticipated drop in the mortality rate
did not follow.” “Despite a long and intensive educational program for
the early detection and treatment of cancer, the death rate from cancer
of the breast <i>shows no downward trend.” </i>In fact, “The comparative
mortality index, which allows for changes in the age structure of the population,
shows for men a rise of 6% in cancer mortality between 1938 and 1950.”
“The size of the primary tumor is no guide to curability; two-thirds of
patients reporting with tumors of the breast which were smaller than a
hazel-nut already showed metastases,” and with regard to lung cancer, “If
recent experience is typical, however, by the time definite abnormality
appears in the radiograph, most cases of pulmonary cancer have progressed
too far for successful resection.” “Survival rates after simple excision,
radical mastectomy, and irradiation, are depressingly uniform.” “Our basic
approach may be wrong; the attempt to treat cancer as a local disease rather
than a general disease, may be as irrational as treating syphilis by excising
the primary chancre.” “In most if not all lethal breast cancer, remote
spread takes place by the blood stream before interference is practicable.”
“The survival rates after different periods of delay before seeking medical
advice often shows a curious paradox. Thus Swynnerton and Truelove reviewing
395 cases of gastric carcinoma, showed that the greater the delay and the
longer the history of symptoms the greater was the survival rate.” Here
we find in the <i>Lancet
</i>of April 3, 1954, p. 714, with other statement
so similar import, the conclusions of the world’s most advanced surgeons.
A year later Dr. George Crile of the famous Crile Clinic in Cleveland gave
thorough information to the profession and the public on this subject and
was in exact agreement. Now comes the report of the 12th annual scientific
meeting of the Detroit Institute of Cancer Research. The consensus was
the same, Dr. Harden B. Jones, professor of medical physics at the University
of California, gave the ultimatum, “The odds for or against the recovery
from cancer are set long before the patient sees a physician.” and “There
is no evidence that treatment by surgery or radiation, the <i>only recognized
methods
of therapy </i>affect the course of the really malignant forms of cancer.”
and “Early treatment is a nice theory, but there is no evidence that it
benefits the patient.” “Some drastic cancer therapies not only do not help
but are harmful.” “The tumor easily could have a billion cells before it
is large enough to be recognized as cancer. Some of these cells are already
in the blood stream.”
<p>Unfortunately radiation does not answer the needs of the patient, but
adds to the basic pathology. The convention of the American Roentgen Ray
Society of September 1954, added to the report of the Roentgenologist of
the University of Pennsylvania in 1925 when he stated that irradiation
before and after surgery opened the vascular and lymph spaces and helped
the spread of the disease instead of retarding it. His report was so unpopular
that it was suppressed. But today the statistics are so disheartening that
even the radiation therapists are bold in reporting that where deep therapy
is poured into a neoplasm of one type, a more malignant form or a bone
sarcoma is created underneath only too often. When one recalls that viruses
are thousands of times more resistant to irradiation than tissue or cancer
cells, the situation is logical.
<p>Fifty years ago nothing was known about cancer except the diagnosis,
which was about all there was to become expert in. The gross and microscopic
pathology was so well learned that the resort to the biopsy was regarded
as a sign of poor training (Ewing) (Warthin). Our professor of pathology
insisted that we make 100% correct diagnoses and give the microscopic description
from the gross findings alone. Every surgeon on the University staff did
it regularly.
<p>Today, however, high specialization makes the biopsy an essential for
many. For many years ahead of my day, all that was known beyond diagnosis
was that cancer was caused by “irritation.” But no one knew exactly what
“irritation” meant, or how it operated to cause cancer. Further, there
was no information to serve as a starter to investigate the problem. But
still the walks through the hospital wards fervently cried for the solution.
The surgeon was doing his untiring best and the radiologist hoped and hoped
that his approach might some day prove fruitful. And yet no facts stepped
forth to show how to even make a start nothing from within the cancer properties
themselves.
<p><i>So the writer decided it might be helpful to get the basic facts
on any of the deepest injuries to the body chemistry that could be produced,
observe their effects on every tissue quality possible, and then figure
out how any of these changes might take part in the pathogenesis of cancer.
</i>The
effects of complete parathyroidectomy were chosen for this purpose, largely
because the great experts of that day on this very subject seemed to have
overlooked the main factors in parathyroid insufficiency, and because a
subject as important as that should be at least reasonably explored.
<p><i>As the writer’s investigations progressed in accumulating more data
it began to appear that he made the correct start. The findings were carefully
evaluated, the conclusions drawn, and from these a Postulate was formulated
and tested out in the broad field of disease. It was hoped that if the
venture would be propitious, a century of ignorance would be hurdled, and
a basis for investigating the cancer problem itself would be reached. </i>A
landing in barren territory simply called for a fresh start and another
trial. However, the first attempt proved fortunate. <i>Our Postulate had
been drawn up with every effort at precision, and the conclusions were
fruitful.</i> Under the circumstances this was even more important than
if our interpretations were correct or “true,” For the aim was to reach
a position of utility.
<p><i>The utility has two leading aspects. One lies in the proof that the
four primary cell functions — contraction, secretion, conduction, and cell
division —are provided with energy that is produced and received by each
functional unit in accord with one and the same pattern, and when interrupted
so as to produce disease, the fault is the same in pattern and subject
to the same type of correction by one and the same atomic structure.The
other phase of utility is the explanation of both viral and neoplastic
parasitisms, the atomic bondings and electronic displacements that constitute
the integration of the pathogen with the host cell, which not only accomplish
the pathogenesis, but actually provide for and invite the oxidative cleavage
that leaves the host cell in normal functional status, perfectly reconstructed,
and the virus no longer to be found.</i> The text demonstrates this as
well as the fate of the neoplastic cell and the process by which it is
disposed of. These matters are based on firm chemical laws, as the text
will show.
<p><i>So whether the cell contractile fibrillae as in asthma, or the secreting
fibrillae as in hay fever, or the conductile fibrillae as in a compulsory
neurosis, or some other phase of insanity, or the mitotic fibrillar system
as in neoplasia, happens to be attacked, the basic pathology is the same
and its correction is necessarily the same, too.</i> This is the subject
we will demonstrate in this text. We have no thought that our presentation
is the best that could be made. However, since we have opened the door
and uncovered the mysteries it enclosed, it is our chore to make the disclosure.
This door stands open for endless investigation and for collaboration as
well.<i> It should be inviting for our proofs of the cure of the many forms
of cancer offered in this text stand firm, </i>firstly in their diagnoses
made by America’s leading surgeons, with the patients housed in our proudest
institutions where every facility for a firm diagnosis was at hand. Then,
too, the clinical diagnoses were confirmed by our foremost pathologists.
Secondly, the cures were demonstrated to be permanent with reconstruction
of tissue so good function was restored, and accomplished by a definite
process without leaving even a microscopic trace of cancer cells.
<p><i>It will be seen that whether the correction happens to be in far
advanced cancer of the vital organs, widely metastasized, and the patient
in extremis, or the correction happens to be in the terminal phase of rabies,
hog cholera, or some other 100% fatal viral disease, the reversal of the
pathogenesis follows the same definite order. This physiological aspect
of the correction, we will attempt to show, depends upon well proven laws
in chemistry that are basic to tissue cell energy production and energy
use, and primarily basic to all vital processes. Thus a Least Common Denominator
in pathogenesis and its correction has been reached. It serves as a key
to the interpretation of disease production and also to its correction
in the whole field we have investigated so far.</i>
