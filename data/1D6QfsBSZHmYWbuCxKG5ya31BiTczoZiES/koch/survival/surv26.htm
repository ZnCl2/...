<p><b><font size=+2>DISEASES OF THE ARTICULATIONS</font></b></center>

<p>For accuracy’s sake a few words of review on Arthritis should be welcome.
Several types of Arthritis have been classified. <i>Anderson’s Pathology</i>,
page 1255, 3rd edition, and Karsner, 7th edition, page 809, give the main
characteristics in a simple practical way that disposes of any uncertainty.
<p>Rheumatoid Arthritis goes by the following synonyms: Atrophic and Proliferative
Arthritis in adults. In children, it is known as Still’s Disease. If dominant
in the spine, the sacroiliac and hip areas, it is called Strumpell-Marie
Spondilitis. It is a systemic disease of unknown etiology and is characterized
by <i>chronic </i>and <i>progressive inflammatory </i>involvement of the
articulations and by atrophy and rarefaction of the bones and muscles.
Eighty percent of cases are between 20 and 50 years of age. It may show
an insidious or violent onset, pain, swelling, stiffness, redness, early
in the disease with a warmth and thickening of the soft tissues about the
joints. This swelling goes with muscle atrophy, causing spindle shaped
digits. A striking feature is exacerbation and remission irregularly for
months or years. There is early inflammatory cell infiltration, but no
suppuration. As it progresses, granulation tissue at the perichondrial
margins grow in and cover the articular surface. Concomitantly, cartilage
is invaded and replaced by well-vascularized connective tissue showing
moderate inflammation on both sides causing fibrous adhesion (fibrous ankylosis).
Articular cartilage is destroyed causing permanently stiffened joints.
There is a twisting and bone atrophy from disuse, muscle and skin atrophy,
and nodules, somewhat resembling the gumma, are common changes. Others
than Anderson, state that fibrous ankylosis may ossify to make the ankylosis
permanent. This is regarded as certainly irreversible. There is a general
systemic degeneration present that shows a toxic or infectious basis. The
tissue degenerations do not improve but get worse with each inflammatory
aggravation.
<p>Osteoarthritis, also called Degenerative Arthritis, or Hypertrophic
Arthritis and Chronic Senescent Arthritis, come mostly after the third
or fourth decade. The primary pathology is in the cartilage. The large
weight bearing joints are affected first, Heberden’s nodes appear on the
finger joints.
<p>The gross and microscopic changes in all stages indicate <i>regressive
cartilage changes, that progress continuously, but at various rates, throughout
the life of the individual </i>(Anderson, page 1263). The cartilages undergo:
reduction, fragmentation, splitting in the vertical plane, become softened
and mossy in appearance, break loose and disappear in smaller or larger
areas leaving denuded bone that may become polished and grooved. Marginal
perichondrial cartilage forms and breaks down causing “lipping.” It is
associated with stress and nutritional handicaps. This description from
Anderson will help understand the pathogenesis and the corrective process
or reversal that takes place during the recovery reactions. This disease,
by the way, as Anderson emphasizes, has <i>NO REMISSIONS, but is continuously
progressive </i>at varying rates of speed <i>throughout life, </i>but there
are no remissions as in Rheumatoid Arthritis.
<p>It is well known that in this disease acute aggravation of pain and
acute difficulty in using a joint is due to a piece of cartilage breaking
loose and locking the joint causing pain, etc. This goes with the advance
of the disease, as progress of the structural degeneration. This is not
an inflammatory affair. Should an exacerbation subside it means that other
pieces of cartilage have broken loose and take positions that relieve the
impediment, or that the pieces are pulverized. This is also a part of the
progressive degenerative change in the joint structure as the disease progresses.
This is not an inflammatory disease, but a progressive degenerative disease
leading to thickening of the joints and their ankylosis. There is no remission
in the advance of the structural degenerative changes, and the progress
of its effects — ankylosis. No treatment in scientific medicine is known
that will halt the continuing advance of its structural degenerative changes,
much less reverse them.
<p>From the Federal Court Records and Federal Trade Commission Testimony,
a case of Osteoarthritis will serve as a factually uncontradictable demonstration
of the reversal of this disease when the FCG is put back in commission.
We will also give one cure of Rheumatoid Arthritis of the most advanced
type --- one showing bony ankylosis where remission never takes place.
The reactions in such cases might be compared with those in acute Rheumatic
fever, an example of which will be submitted.
<p><b>OSTEOARTHRITIS</b>
<br>CASE No. 66
<br>Dr. Mantor
<p>Mrs. M. M. was 52 years of age when her trouble started in 1938. She
went to the Mayo Clinic, where nothing was done but make the diagnosis.
They gave her no medicine or treatment. She was steadily becoming worse.
In June 1943, she went to Dr. Mantor for treatment. The trouble was pain,
enlargement and stiffening of the joints, mostly of the right knee. She
testified, “The joints kept getting worse and worse until I was not able
to walk without a chair or something.” She had to discontinue work and
hire help to run her rooming house, from which she had her support. There
were no remissions, but steady “worsening” in all respects. Her arms were
somewhat affected, but mostly her legs and feet — five years of continuous
increasing misery. The pretreatment period was one of steady progress of
the disease, and steady loss in her health.
<p><i>Treatment and Post-Treatment Progress --- </i>After Dr. Mantor’s
examination of Mrs. M. M., he gave her two micromicrograms of the Synthetic
Survival Reagent (SSR) on June 15, 1943. There was no change visible until
the ninth week. The joints were enlarged, hard, and nodular, with increase
in the bony structure. This all remained stationary after the Treatment
until the ninth week, so he repeated the dose on August the 14th, nine
weeks from the first dose. Her reactions were severe. She testified to
the swelling of her feet beyond the usual enlargement, soreness of her
flesh, and “every bone in my body ached; chills, right knee swollen, stiff,
pains like lumbago, pains in right leg and muscles, pain under right shoulder
blade, and dizziness.” This lasted pretty well from August to December,
when she began to get better. She continued to improve and on April 8,
1944, she took a job working at the local country club. The improvement
was steady after December, and included the decrease in the bony enlargements
of the joints, especially the right knee. Thus, the structural pathology
was normalized, and with it, function returned to what may be considered
normal. When she gave her testimony three years later she walked up the
high court house steps as easily as any normal person, could stoop and
pick up things from the floor like a normal person. The restoration of
normal structure of the right knee was demonstrated so any one could see
it.
<p>She kept a record of her symptoms and reactions, which, on study, are
typical of the recovery course followed after this Treatment, thus proving
the mechanism by which the recovery was accomplished. She has remained
well, the last report having been received in&nbsp; 1949.
<p><b>RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS TERMINAL STAGE</b>
<br><b>Pretreatment Control Period</b>
<br>CASE No. 67
<br>Prof. R. S. L.
<p>Major O. M. N. was age 49 years, physician in the Brazilian Army. His
condition started three years previously with pain and stiffness of the
neck and right shoulder. This progressed until it had involved all the
joints of the body and each progressed to complete ankylosis including
the jaws and there was a narrowing of the optic foramena, causing restriction
in vision.
<p>When seen in October 1941, the muscles were markedly atrophied. He had
been bedfast for a year without the ability to move his arms, legs or head
more than a half inch. The joints were atrophied and deformed and the articulations
fixed by bony unions demonstrated by the X-Ray and by simple palpation.
He had to be fed through a tube, as he could not move his jaws. Coronary
Sclerosis was identified by his experts as part of the pathology. At this
stage remissions never take place spontaneously. The damage is done. He
also suffered with constant migraine.

<br>Diagnosis --- Marie-Strumpell Syndrome, with universal atrophic, Ankylosed
Poly-Arthritis.
<p>Treatment --- He had received the classical efforts without any improvement.
His natural resistance was diminishing and he was developing a dangerous
anemia. The fever was constant and the pain severe. On October 1941, he
received two micrograms of Parabenzoquinone in two cc. of water.
<p>Post-Treatment Progress --- In thirty days there was improvement. The
temperature became normal, the headache disappeared, the appetite improved
and he felt stronger. In six months, he could sit up in bed by his own
efforts. In nine months, he was able to stand up a few minutes and walk
a little. At the end of twelve months he left the hospital. His diuresis
returned to normal. His articulations returned to about 90% of normal.
He could get about freely and felt fairly well. He returned to active army
duty and remained well until 1947 when he contracted pneumonia, in the
wilds of the highlands of Parana during a campaign with severe exposure,
and died as a result. In this case the reversal was complete, even of the
Osseous Ankylosis, and it was permanent.
<p>Several other extreme cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis have been encountered
and the recovery course and results were the same, thus establishing a
pattern.
<p>Discussion --- In all of the cases of Arthritis treated so far, whether
Rheumatoid or Hypertrophic Arthrosis, the recovery reactions are characteristic
for the type of disease. In the Rheumatoid form the reactions are cyclic
and repeat the former symptoms he exhibited from the very inception of
the trouble. The last reaction is generally a sudden red inflammation of
the joints with considerable pain as if he were attacked with acute rheumatic
fever. This happens even though the onset in such cases is insidious. One
has the impression that if the patient had a frank, full attack of acute
Rheumatic Fever, the condition would have ended there and not dragged along
as a chronic progression of degenerative changes. In Osteoarthrosis (Hypertrophic),
with some large joints mostly affected, the reaction after once starting
stays right with the pathology, and the joint is ankylosed until the whole
pathology is corrected. Then it is ready to function normally. In one case
the right hip was enlarged and hard like a medium-sized pumpkin. He was
bedfast for some time before Treatment --- many months --- but after Treatment
the reaction took hold and in six months the hip was normal. He rapidly
gained his strength back so that by the ninth month he could climb a mountain
with ease, and was back to steady work. Thus, the pattern of recovery is
characteristic for each type. The etiology is different as demonstrated
by the different recovery course in each of the two types.
<p>Nevertheless, in both types the pathogen, whether of bacterial origin
or some un-oxidized metabolic product or virus, had the means of integrating
with the fibrogenic tissues of the joint and changing its properties so
the specific pathology for each condition was carried out. All that was
necessary to restore the normal was to burn away the integrated pathogen.
The excessive fibrous tissue in the form of cartilage or bone or highly
vascular fibrosis was then in the way and obsolete and subject to digestive
autolysis, and removal, and the deficient tissues reconstructed to normal.
Nothing was left to hinder such correction for the pathogen was removed.
It is the same story as with neoplasia. The results are the same when the
pathogen is oxidatively removed.
<p>In the acute toxic stage of Rheumatic Fever, the Arthritis is entirely
inflammatory, but can lead to structural changes<b>. </b>Quick restoration
of the normal follows the oxidative removal of the pathogen whatever it
is. The following case from the court records illustrates:
<p><b>ACUTE RHEUMATIC FEVER</b>
<br>CASE No. 68
<br>Dr. Wendell Hendricks
<p>E. N., female, age 11 years, showed a pretreatment observation period
of five days. During this period her knees became fixed, flexed and contracted
so she could not move them for they were greatly swollen and acutely painful.
Other joints were hot, swollen, painful and flexed. Her finger joints,
elbows and hip joints could be straightened out, but would “pop” right
back to the flexed position. This was painful as was her effort to move
them. The heart showed a murmur. The pulse rate was 120, temperature 102&deg;F.
There was a severely inflamed throat with swollen tonsils and adenoiditis.
<p>Recovery Course --- On July 3, 1942, she was given two micrograms of
Parabenzoquinone dissolved in water by injection. On July 4th the throat
and knees were better, the temperature 100&deg;, and the pulse 108. On
July 6th all joints were better, temperature 99.2&deg;, pulse 100, and
the throat clear. On July 9th all joints were normal with normal function,
no pain or swelling, temperature 98.6&deg;, pulse 78. The throat was normal
and the adenoiditis and the heart murmur had disappeared. On August 20,
there had been no recurrence of any of the symptoms. Here again the FCG’s
had to be rescued by using a superior dehydrogenator Carbonyl group with
correct steric advantage. Two micrograms of Benzoquinone were sufficient.
The serial systems of Carbonyl groups have shown better action, however.
