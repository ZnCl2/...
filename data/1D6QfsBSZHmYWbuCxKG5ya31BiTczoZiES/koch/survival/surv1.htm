      <p><i>The initial work that spearheaded the Survival Factor
          Investigations was a research into the cause of the
          convulsions and deaths that always followed complete
          parathyroidectomy.</i> The findings were published in “<i>The
          Journal of Biological Chemistry</i>”—12; 313, 1912, Koch, and
        15; 43-63, 1913, Koch. This work was confirmed by Prof. Patton
        and his staff at the University of Glasgow, and published in the
        “<i>Quarterly Journal of Physiology</i>” in 1917 using two of
        the four numbers. For the care and excellency with which the
        confirmation was made, Patton was awarded the Triennial Prize in
        Medicine by Harvard University. This confirmation is of great
        importance because of the broad field of applicability of the
        facts brought forth and also the depth of their interpretations
        of disease processes. </p>
      <p><b>The cardinal facts were just three:</b> </p>
      <p><b>(1)&nbsp; </b>Guanidine, methyl guanidine, and some other
        toxic bases were produced in the tissues and eliminated in the
        urines in fatal amounts that increased until the dog died in
        convulsions; </p>
      <p><b>(2)&nbsp; </b>Calcium, lactate, and phosphate were
        eliminated in excess; </p>
      <p><b>(3) </b>The post-mortem findings showed ante-mortem
        coagulation of the blood in the large veins, and hemorrhagic
        degenerations of the liver and kidneys. </p>
      <p>From these findings, several important conclusions were made,
        based upon: </p>
      <p><b>(1)&nbsp;</b> The chemistry of guanidine and its derivatives
        showing the activation of its amine group by its conjugation
        with an imide group, and also the tendency to deactivate this
        amine group by such substitutions as acetic acid as in creatine
        and amino-valeric acid in arginine; </p>
      <p><b>(2) </b>The fact that guanidine and methyl guanidine are
        highly toxic while creatine and arginine are not; </p>
      <p><b>(3) </b>The large elimination of lactic acid even while the
        lungs were well ventilated showing that fuel was not burned via
        an oxidation process, but was fermented hydrolytically to
        produce lactic acid and thus the oxidation mechanism was blocked
        at its very inception; </p>
      <p><b>(4)</b> The block to oxygen transport in the blood and inter
        and intracellular fluids by the ante-mortem coagulation or
        gellation of tissue colloids that depended on the lack of energy
        production via oxidation to keep the colloidal particles charged
        on their surfaces and hence, a failure in their dispersion: the
        resultant failure in oxygen transport further blocked the
        oxidation mechanism in a vicious circle; </p>
      <p><b>(5) </b>The fact that the oxidations were blocked by an
        amine group of guanidine, that dehydrogenation is the first step
        in oxidation, that the Carbonyl group is a good dehydrogenator,
        and that it can be inactivated by condensing firmly with an
        amine group as in guanidine, but functions normally by
        condensing with a weakly activated amine group as in creatine to
        form an azomethine double bond. </p>
      <p>The conclusions are the following: </p>
      <p><b>(1) </b>After Parathyroidectomy, the activated amine group
        of guanidine and methyl guanidine condensed with the Carbonyl
        group of the cell’s energy producing mechanism for function
        (FCG) to form a firm azomethine double bond, and thus prevented
        it from initiating oxidations in fuels or toxins that came into
        the field; </p>
      <p><b>(2) </b>The failure to oxidize made it impossible to charge
        the tissue colloids and so they precipitated as a gel and did
        not flow through the capillaries and tissue spaces or even
        through the large vessels to carry oxygen to the intracellular
        mechanisms, so an anoxia or hypoxia was secondary to the
        inability to start oxidation chains; </p>
      <p><b>(3) </b>That the oxidations of highest quality are chain
        reactions started by dehydrogenations, free radical production,
        addition of molecular oxygen to the free radicals to form
        peroxide free radicals that carried the oxidation chain or
        caused molecular cleavage into parts with terminal Carbonyl
        groups that promoted further oxidation; </p>
      <p><b>(4) </b>That the Pasteur Effect was a function of this
        tissue cell functional Carbonyl group (FCG) and was suspended or
        destroyed by its condensation with tight binding amines as
        guanidine, but its function was supported by condensing with the
        weakly binding amine group of creatine after the hydrogen atom
        that the FCG removed from the fuel was passed on to an
        appropriate electron acceptor; </p>
      <p><b>(5) </b>That the Creatine-FCG azomethine bond is held until
        the energy developed as the oxidations progress caused
        phosphoric acid to enter this azomethine bond, combine the
        creatine and liberate it as a high energy carrying phosphate,
        and that the burning of fuel is regulated by the factors
        concerned, — the FCG, creatine phosphoric acid and stored
        energy; </p>
      <p><b>(6) </b>That toxic amines of various metabolic, bacterial,
        viral or of fungal agents (present day antibiotics may be
        included) are able to make the same crippling condensations with
        the FCG that no metabolic measure is able to break, and thus
        disturb the physiology in various ways; </p>
      <p><b>(7) </b>That to dislodge such toxins it is necessary to
        oxidize them away as no adequate hydrolytic provisions are
        available; </p>
      <p><b>(8) </b>That the double bond of the azomethine condensation
        activates the hydrogen atom of the carbon placed alpha and
        thereby provides for its easy dehydrogenation, and thus starts
        an oxidation progression via free radical, peroxide free radical
        and cleavage that burns away the amine group of the toxin or
        other pathogens and restores the host cell functional Carbonyl
        group; </p>
      <p><b>(9) </b>That the FCG is activated to be the preferred
        dehydrogenator through conjugation with the double bond of an
        ethylene linkage, that contributes electrons to it; additions to
        this linkage must destroy its activating powers. </p>
      <p>We shall see how these conclusions fit into the pathogenesis of
        cancer and viral infections, and determine the controlling
        therapeutic measures. It will be seen also that they explain the
        long unsolved Pasteur Effect, which we hold to be a splendid
        demonstration of the presence and action of the Functional
        Carbonyl Group, the FCG, as we designate it for short, and a
        solid proof of the correctness of our Working Hypothesis and
        Postulate. </p>
