<p><b><font size=+2>TUBERCULOSIS</font></b></center>

<p>Several bacterial infections will be given a little attention to show
that the bacterial toxin integrates with the host cell according to the
same pattern as the virus or carcinogen. <i>This is our conclusion since
the same Reagent causes the destruction of the toxin with liberation of
the host cell.</i> In tuberculosis, staphylococcus, streptococcus and corynebacterium
infections, the walling off process is often extensive. Here the fibroblastic
tissue evidently integrates with or co-polymerizes with the toxin since
after the high efficiency Carbonyl groups are admitted to the field, the
toxic fraction is burned off and the fibrous tissue has no more function,
as there is nothing to protect against. The fibrosis disappears. It will
be seen that the shaggy walls of the tubercular cavities first become smooth,
and the cavity enlarges as the wall and debris are removed, then nothing
more is to be seen of it as it becomes replaced with efficient breathing
lung tissue. In the dairy cattle, the extensive fibrosis of the udders
is seen to disappear completely in over 80% of the cows after only one
Treatment, as part of the recovery process. Besides, the hemolysins of
the Staph Aureus likewise disappear and none of the bacteria are toxic
any longer. So wherever the toxins are, freely circulating, integrated
with the tissue cell, or as part of the germ, they appear to invite dehydrogenation
by the activated Carbonyl group, and in the presence of molecular oxygen
they are burned away. The fibrosis is then replaced by functioning tissue
as milk production increases to normal or better, and respiratory efficiency
is restored.
<p>As bacteria mutate against the best of antibiotics, all infections including
tuberculosis become surgical diseases again. The old fashioned drainage
is required and lobectomies or pulmonectomies in such cases as are favorable.
It will be observed, too, that cases of lung infection that are not good
surgical material as the bilateral cavitations and those with heavy walls
that involve the mediastinum may respond favorably under the therapy described
here, and thus give the surgeon the aid he needs until the case becomes
a good surgical risk. Many factors enter into the management of such cases
and the expert will have to make the decision as to procedure. It is observed
in cases with large cavities, that while the patient’s health is improving,
the heavy toxic symptoms as fever, sweating, flush and weakness are disappearing,
and the germs are thrown out in great numbers until the healing is complete.
These bacilli are often seen to be phagocytized, and undergoing fragmentation
and dissolution in the phagocytes, instead of the phagocyte being destroyed.
We conclude that after the toxic fraction is burned off of the germ substance,
it is readily digested, like tissue debris.
<p>Prolonged bed rest is not needed in the care of these patients, even
though far advanced. In fact, as soon as the fever disappeared, which is
rather early, they are expected to move about as they please and rest enough
so as not to get tired. Long before the cavities have disappeared they
do light work, and it helps them physically and mentally.

<p>Mr. S. M. came to our Clinic on October 20, 1938, for Treatment by Dr.
G. Warnshuis. His case history revealed that his father had died of intestinal
obstruction. His previous illnesses were pleurisy in the left chest, which
was followed by pneumonia in 1935. In September 1938, he began feeling
badly, had cough raised sputum and had night sweats. We had his sputum
examined by the Public Health Laboratory. It was reported positive for
tuberculosis. Our own sputum examination was confirmatory. His weight was
153&frac12; pounds, normal weight being 182 pounds.
<p>Radiograph I was taken at the Herman Kiefer Hospital on September 16,
1938. Radiograph II was taken at the time he came to our Clinic. A definite
increase in the extension of the large cavity and tuberculosis infiltration
is seen in this short time. His condition also retrograded constitutionally
and with regard to the cough, night sweats, fever, etc.
<p>He received 2 micro-micrograms of the Synthetic Survival Reagent. At
that time he spent several weeks at our rest home, but was not put on the
strict bed rest so rigidly enforced for patients in his condition. He was
then sent home and kept on a vegetarian diet. He was allowed to be up and
about, but told not to exert himself so that he got tired whatsoever. He
kept a record of his temperature and other symptoms. He did his own cooking,
shopping and drove his car from his country home, about 40 miles away,
to our clinic every two weeks for a checkup. His improvement was slow at
first, but steady. In a year he could do a little work. Radiograph III
was taken on July 8, 1939. It shows healing of the large cavity during
the recovery process.
<p>On July 19, 1939, Mr. S. M. was examined by Dr. Douglas. He states in
his letter of July 21, 1939, that “there has been some clinical improvement
since last September,” but that it was his opinion, “that this man is totally
and permanently disabled because of pulmonary tuberculosis.” Thus we see
that in spite of Mr. S. M.’s condition when he came to us, he did make
some definite improvement during this nine-month period. Dr. Douglas still
considered Mr. S. M. “totally and permanently disabled,” and by this he
meant, “… that the chances of recovery to the degree that this patient
might be able to work are so poor that it is proper to say that he is totally
and permanently disabled.”
<p>July 21, 1939
<br>Dr. Peter Ivkovich
<br>14128 East Jefferson
<br>Detroit, Michigan
<p>Dear Dr. Ivkovich:
<p>In re: Stanley M----:
<p>Stanley M---- was examined here on July 19th and I have procured the
films from Dr. West for comparison.
<p>This man has a far advanced pulmonary tuberculosis and while there has
been some clinical improvement since last September, still there is evidence
of quite extensive disease of both lungs and sputum tests run last month
in the laboratory here showed the sputum to be strongly positive for tubercle
bacilli. With a disease of this extent existing for this length of time
it would be in my opinion that this man is totally and permanently disabled
because of pulmonary tuberculosis.
<p>Very truly yours, Bruce H. Douglas, M.D.
<br>Tuberculosis Controller.
<p>Mr. S. M. continued under our care. In February 1940, we had an X-Ray
taken at St. Francis Hospital. At that time there was no evidence of a
tuberculous process in either lung. The report of the Roentgenologist is
reproduced here.
<p>SAINT FRANCIS HOSPITAL
<br>HAMTRAMCK, MICHIGAN
<br>X-RAY ROOM PERMANENT RECORD
<p>Patient’s name: Stanley M---- Age: 45 Date 2-2-40
<br>X-Ray ordered by: Dr. Wm. Koch X-Ray No.: 17339
<br>Region: Chest
<br>Address: 269 River Road.
<p>A flat roentgenogram was made of the chest.
<p>Diaphragm: The leaves are smoothly rounded and normal in position. The
costophrenic and cardiophrenic angles are clear.
<br>Heart: Is normal in size, shape and position.
<br>Right lung: There is some increase in the lung markings toward the
base. The lung field is otherwise clear.
<br>Left lung: Here also there is some mottling at the base. The upper
portion of the lung field is clear.
<p>Conclusions: The findings are those of a low-grade respiratory infection.
There is no evidence of a tuberculous process in either lung at this time.
The patient should be re-examined in from two to four weeks.
<p>S. FORD, M.D.
<br>Roentgenologist.
<p>A summary of his progress, as seen in the radiographs, is given by Dr.
Hague, a noted expert.
<p>DR. OMER GRENVILLE HAGUE
<p>“The radiograph of September 16, 1938, is that of a male chest with
the bony cage and ribs and collarbones and heart cavity in the middle and
diaphragm down there. There are some infiltration shadows in parenchyma,
or the active portion of the lung in these areas, in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth and seventh interspaces anteriorly and a large cavitation shadow
in the mid-lung zone. I am measuring the left lung. That cavity measures
2&frac12; inches by 3&frac14; inches, a little better than 3&frac14; inches.
The outside measurement of the capsule of the cavity. By a little better
than 3&frac14; inches I mean about 1/8 of an inch more. The reason I am
not saying that with certitude is that the upper border of that cavity
is very, very thin and very, very faint, but we can see that line that
it follows and I would say it would be 3&frac14; inches at least. That
is being very conservative. There is a small fluid level at the bottom
of that cavity. There are, also, some heavy hilar shadows, and some thickening
of the peri-bronchial trunks; that is, the lymphatics that follow the bronchi
and smaller bronchioles. Those shadows indicate repeated infections that
have resulted in inflammation and the inflammation has gone on to scarring.
<p>The film dated July 8th, 1939, appears to be a film of the same chest;
the ribs strip with the previous film. The lung tissues on both sides show
soft infiltrated shadows throughout the lower two-thirds of both lungs.
There is an interlobar line, indicating a thickening of the pleura between
the middle and lower lobes, on the right side. There is a shadow in this
area. It is smaller than the cavity on the left side previously referred
to. It is in the same inter-space level, so that I conclude it is related
to the previous cavity. It measures 1&frac12; inches by 1 inch. The wall
of this cavity is less distinct. That is why it is a little harder to see.
The shadows in the lung are of a soft consistency, which would suggest
an activity of disease in the lung structure itself.
<p>In the film dated September 16, 1938, the linear markings are fairly
well fibrosed, hard. In the film dated July 8th, 1939, we see them softened
and in an active state of inflammatory change. In the film dated June 18,
1940, this inflammatory reaction has disappeared and the outline of the
cavity is very, very faint, practically disappeared. It would be very hard
to measure it accurately. It would be about 1 inch by an inch and a quarter.
The general appearance of this chest is much better than in the films taken
September 16th, 1938, and July 8th, 1939.
<p>Cavities almost of any size are a poor prognosis type of tuberculosis
cases. The tendency usually is for individuals that have cavitation, that
they get more cavitations rather than less. Cavities usually tend to get
large and unless they are treated successfully by a pneumothorax, or some
other compression therapy, and are held down for a long time, they usually
get worse and the patient’s outlook is serious.
<p>The cavity in the film dated September 16th, 1938, I think is about
as large a one as I have ever seen and I would say that patient’s condition
would not be a good risk at all.
<p>The two succeeding pictures dated July 8th, 1939, and July 18th, 1940,
show that there has been an extensive constitutional change taking place;
that is, the soft tissue of the lung has undergone a remarkable exudative
change; that is, there is a softening of the structure all through and
in an instance like this that patient would have more cough and more sputum
and it might be in the healing phase following this type of chest. For
instance, the tubercle from this cavity may have been coughed up and spread
out throughout the whole lung and that might be a cause for the infection
from here to become broad spread in that chest almost like a tuberculous
pneumonic condition and then in this view, this pneumonic process has disappeared
and the shadows in the lung are back to what you would expect of an individual
of this age and following conditions of a tuberculous recovery.

<p>The prognosis on the first film dated September 16th, 1938, would indicate
a very serious situation.
<p>The prognosis on the third film dated June 18th, 1940, without knowing
anything about the other two, would be very good.”
<p>In the Spring of 1942, Mr. S. M. went to work for Fisher Body, a division
of General Motors Corporation. He did hard manual labor, worked long hours
and overtime as well. During his employment he was given examinations and
X-Rays were taken. They established his good health and he was permitted
to continue to work. His sputum has been negative since his recovery. He
has continued working and testified in the Federal Court Trial in 1946.

<p><b>EXTENSIVE MILIARY TUBERCULOSIS</b>
<br><b>With Tubercular Meningitis and Tubercular Nephritis and Splenitis</b>
<br>CASE No. 48
<p>The rapid advance of the disease in Miss N. A., age 14, when treated
by the writer in July 1922, was reversed from the terminal stage by one
injection. She had been in the Detroit Tuberculosis Sanitarium from the
end of January until April. The radiographic findings of January 30, 1922,
were:
<p>“Both diaphragm leaves are clear. The trachea shows no compression or
deviation. The heart shadow is normally placed. Increased deposit at the
hilum on both sides. Some accentuation of the linear markings throughout
the right lung field. No definite evidence of a parenchymal lesion in the
right lung field. There is extensive parenchymal infiltration throughout
the left lung field, with greatest changes in the upper half. Several small
annular shadows at the apex and at the level of the first and second ribs
anteriorly. We believe these represent small cavity formations. Diagnosis:
Advanced parenchymal tuberculosis confined to the left lung field.”
<p>It will be noted that the lesions are located subclavicularly as in
the most rapidly disseminating type. Six months later I examined her. She
was emaciated, bedfast, comatose, with frequent projectile vomiting for
three weeks, cyanotic, with rapid shallow respiration, very rapid, thready,
practically uncountable pulse, with the head drawn back in continuous opisthotonus.
The fever was 105.5&deg;F. The heart was drawn over into the right side
of the chest; the left chest was empty of viscera so far as could be determined,
but contained fluid that splashed on shaking her. This lung had spontaneously
ruptured.
<p>The right lung showed huge cavitations and consolidations, and the splenic
area presented a hard, fixed tumefaction as large as her head. It could
not be determined then if this was kidney, spleen or both involved in the
tuberculosis process. She was also near death with a tubercular meningitis.
Two micro-micrograms of the Synthetic Survival Reagent were given intramuscularly.
The recovery process was slow at first, but this was to be expected considering
the condition she was in at the time I examined her. It was some months
before she got out of bed. A year later the heart was still on the right
side of the chest, but the left chest was not empty anymore, it was full
of apparently a fluid and fibrotic tissue. At the time she was walking
about, her heart rate was still exceedingly rapid and weak, though it had
dropped from around 150 to 130 per minute. Her temperature was normal.
After that she gradually got better and the heart went gradually over into
the left chest where it belonged. The heart rate slowed down.
<p>An X-Ray taken July 24, 1944, shows that the left chest, which was so
badly involved, is not exactly normal yet in all these twenty-two years
because there is less lung tissue there. That is because part of the chest
is replaced by the structures of the mediastinum. The lung tissue shows
markings in chests that one would interpret as healed tuberculosis. These
marks are very, very small, about a millimeter or two in diameter, dense,
fibrous, showing calcification. It shows that the healing process
has been very complete, and the scar tissue present from the large lesions
healed and are very, very minute.
<p>In this case we have a recovery with reconstruction in both lungs. The
other pathological conditions cleared up during the recovery process. Her
weight has increased to 145 pounds. She is married and has given birth
to twins, pretty husky children. She has remained well to date (January,
1957).
<p>The large mass in the splenic area disappeared completely, but the first
improvement was noted in the nervous system, the disappearance of the opisthotonus
and comatose state. This showed the SSR had taken effect, but still it
was doubted that so much lung destruction could ever be repaired. Time
showed that the advantage given here by the SSR not only permitted full
lung reconstruction and return of the abdominal lesion to normal, but a
general excellent health was gained that proved resistant to the usual
infections. Her twins showed a remarkable immunity to the usual school
children infections that none other exhibited, indicating a possible gene
change.
<p><b><font size=+0>FAR ADVANCED TUBERCULAR PNEUMONIA</font></b>
<br><b>Or Acute Military Invasion, in Extremus at Time of Treatment</b>
<br>CASE No.49
<p>Another case of pulmonary tuberculosis in extremus at the time of Treatment
with a dose of SSR is that of Mrs. M. B. and is of the type that has always
advanced to fatality, namely originating in subclavicular lesions in both
lungs. At the time of our Treatment April 2, 1934, her condition was too
critical to permit a thorough differentiation as to whether she was dying
of an acute tubercular pneumonia, or of an acute widespread military tuberculosis.
She was “sunk in bed,” fever hovering about 104&deg;F., rapid, thready
pulse, cyanosis, with flush from the fever, yet the skin showed yellow
hemolytic color after compressing the flushed capillaries. The breathing
was very shallow and rapid, and very little but bloody sputum was raised.
The physical findings scarcely revealed the cavity, only rales and solidification.
No radiograph was taken at the time. A 2 cc. injection of the SSR, 10-(12),
was given immediately. She had progressed to this stage from an early subclavicular
and apical involvement thought to be a “cold” in August 1931, when
she entered the Herman Kiefer Hospital of Detroit. The condition advanced
to that shown in their film of April 23, 1932, Radiograph I. She remained
in the two Detroit Public Tuberculosis Hospitals up to late in March 1934,
when she was brought to our Clinic. Films of January 18, 1934, and March
8, 1934, show the advance of the disease under their care with the development
of the large, shaggy cavity with slight fluid level behind the right clavicle.
The latter film being reproduced here, Radiograph II. The experts offered
to perform a Thoracoplasty operation upon her at that time. She left because
she did not want this operation. She felt too sick for such a drastic operation,
with her high fever and exhaustion. Her sister brought her to our Clinic
on March 31, 1934. The sputum was loaded with tubercle bacilli. The films
show the advance of the disease in both lungs and the infiltrative development
of the cavity wall.
<p>This report shows the condition of Mary B. when she entered the hospital.

<p>Radiograph I, made in April 1932, shows advance of disease from August
1931, in the hospital.
<center>
<p><img SRC="18012.jpg"></center>

<p>The films show the advance of the disease in both lungs and the infiltrative
development of the cavity wall. We took no radiographs until six months
later when she was up and about and doing light work. Radiograph III, September
24, 1934, shows a smooth wall cavity. At this time there were no tubercle
bacilli found in the sputum at daily tests for two weeks.
<center>
<p><img SRC="18014.jpg"></center>

<p>Radiograph No. II., shows advance of disease in hospital up to March
8, 1934, with cavitations.
<p>This cavity represents the area where the infection had taken place,
and where lung tissue was again healing in after the disease tissue was
removed, and the completed process is shown in Radiograph IV, September
12, 1942.
<p>She left the city after leaving our clinic and within a year went to
work, at which she has remained ever since besides being married and living
a normal life. Frequent sputum tests showed no more germs of tuberculosis
and her gain in weight and perfect health mark her cure as complete. Physical
findings are normal. Her X-Ray report at the time of entering the Herman
Kiefer Hospital is reproduced in Photostat, from the Court Documentations.
Reports in June 1960 show persisting recovery, good health, and working
regularly. (See Appendix).

and a sterile cavity undergoing healing. This radiograph was taken on September
24, 1934, about 5 &frac12; months after Treatment.

<p><b>ADVANCED TUBERCULOSIS</b>
<br><b>With Cavitations in Both Lungs</b>
<br>CASE No. 50
<p>This is a case of bilateral cavitation with subclavicular lesions and
two large thin walled apical cavitations on the right side. She steadily
deteriorated under the best sanitarium care in Cleveland, Ohio (Sunny Acres),
and in Detroit, Michigan, from 1931, when her thyroid gland was removed
at the Crile Clinic of Cleveland, until September 2nd, 1934, when she received
Treatment in our Clinic at Detroit.
<center>
<p><img SRC="18020.jpg"></center>

<p>Miss C. P. was examined at Herman Kiefer Hospital, Detroit, Michigan,
in March 1932. A Photostat of the hospital X-Ray report is reproduced here.
This is done because the radiograph does not show all of the lesions well.
<p>Radiograph I shows the extent of the disease on February 24, 1934, about
six months before she came to us for Treatment. Phrenectomy and pneumothorax
had been unsuccessful in curing this patient. At the time we first saw
her, the prognosis was serious. Bloody sputum loaded with tubercle bacilli
was expelled up to the time of our examinations in September 1934. We found
the upper half of both lungs invaded and a highly toxic state that resulted
in unusual muscular weakness. On September 2, 1934, she was given 2 cc’s
of the serially arranged SSR Carbonyl groups. This toxic state quickly
left so that two weeks later she went to work instead of being confined
to bed rest. She received a second Treatment on November 24, 1935. Since
then she has had three more Treatments over the years, one in 1937, 1939,
and 1942. She has been working, is married and in good health, according
to our last report. Radiograph II, taken March 22, 1943, shows the cured
state, with minimum of scar tissue and return of normal lung parenchyma.
<p>This case shows how the basic toxic state that caused hyperthyroidism
requiring thyroidectomy, also removed her resistance against tuberculosis
infection, and caused other disturbances resulting in muscular weakness.
This latter effect persisted until the time of receiving the Carbonyl Therapy,
and then very quickly disappeared<b>. <i>It was no doubt due to suprarenal
cortex inhibition.</i></b><i> </i>Her statement on her weakened condition
includes this: “When I first visited Dr. Koch, I was very short of breath
and was able to walk a short distance only,” and “I felt better almost
immediately after the Treatment, and went back to work fourteen days later,
September 16th.”
<p>The testimony of Dr. Hague on this patient’s X-Rays has been paraphrased
and reproduced here.
<p>After examination of the X-Rays from Sunny Acres Sanitarium, Dr. Hague
stated in regard to the X-Ray taken 8/6/32 that: “This is a radiograph
of a thorax of a female patient, showing the chest cavities with a tuberculous
process in the upper half of both lungs, of an advanced degree, with cavitations
in the left apex, about three of them contiguous with one another, so I
shall measure them all together. They measure two inches by one inch.
<p>“There are also some shadows in the opposite side that suggest smaller
cavitations behind the second rib anteriorly on the right side. This area
of whiteness is an extensive tuberculosis process in the upper lobe of
the right lung. A similar condition exists on the left side, but it doesn’t
show so much density as on the right, because there is a cavitation process
which has taken away some of the fibrosis and that has been spat out as
sputum.”
<p>“The descending bronchi are thickened because of repeated drainage from
the upper areas of infection that have passed down into the lower trunks
on both sides — lower bronchial trunks on both sides.”
<p>X-Ray film dated 11/5/32: “This film shows the same patient with an
aggravation of the disease, in which there is a shadow in the first interspace
anteriorly, suggesting cavitation; and an enlargement of the shadows on
the left side, indicating enlargement of the previous cavities. And, I
believe an angular shadow that is on the left side in the previous film
now shows more clearly that it is becoming a cavity, too. So that you now
have an area of potential multiple cavitations measuring three inches by
two inches. I would say that this patient is worse on this (11/5/32) film
than on that one (8/6/32).
<p>“X-Ray film dated 2/11/33: “The tuberculosis process in the right lung
has increased. The cavitation is large; measures an inch and a quarter
outside measurements in both diameters. The total area of cavitation in
the left upper lung is slightly more, but there is a concurrent factor
of a pneumothorax in which there is air in the base and up over the upper
lobe of that lung.”
<p>X-Ray film dated 5/17/33: “The only significant change in these two
sets of film is that there is a little better compression over the apex
of this lung, and one fairly strong adhesion band at a level of the third
rib anteriorly is holding lung structure from complete collapse in that
area.”
<p>X-Ray film dated 8/16/33: “The same conditions exist in this film, with
the exception that the outline of cavity in the right upper lobe, measuring
two by one inches, is more clearly seen. There are still adhesions on the
left side.”
<p>X-Ray film dated 11/29/33: “I would say the left lung doesn’t show any
significant change from the left lung in the immediately preceding, but
the changes in the right upper lobe indicate the cavitation a little more
sharply outlined, and a little heavier in cavitation wall thickening, which
would suggest to me that there is more activity (the tuberculous process
would be more active, creating more inflammation), and the response to
the inflammation is characterized by a deposit of fibrous tissue surrounding
that cavity.”
<p>X-Ray film dated 2/24/34: “This is a little lighter film. The right
apical cavity is clearly seen. The fibrous tissue surrounding it is a little
less in density, but it is still present.”
<p>X-Ray film dated 5/26/34 was then shown to Dr. Hague and he stated his
opinion as to the general picture of the pathological condition of this
patient at the time of this picture. “The three last views show no appreciable
improvement under pneumothorax therapy. The diseased area of the left
lung, with its cavitations, has not completely collapsed, because there
are adhesions remaining, and the cavitation in the right apex with the
associated fibrosis still exists, and I would say that that is a very serious
case of active tuberculosis.”
<p>Where the patient is still showing positive sputum, the prognosis is
serious. (It should be noted that this last X-Ray (5/26/34) was taken over
3 months before the author treated the patient.)
<p>Dr. Hague was shown an X-Ray taken about seven and one-half years after
the patient was first treated in Dr. Koch’s Clinic. He stated that the
X-Ray taken February 19, 1942 “indicates a very marked improvement of this
patient. The pneumothorax previously seen has now disappeared, the gas
has been absorbed, and the lung has re-expanded to fill the chest cavity.
The areas of former large cavities in this side, in the left upper first
and second interspaces, have practically gone, and the annular shadow on
the right side in the first interspace also is gone, but there still remains
a mild fibrosis in the first and second interspace at the site of the previous
infection. There are fairly heavy hilar shadows in the left upper mediastinal
area which have come from the inflammatory reaction of the large area of
cavitation previously seen.”
<p>The last film that had been taken, on March 22, 1943, is reproduced
here and is Radiograph II. Dr. Hague stated: “That it does not show very
much change from the one immediately preceding (2/19/42). I would say it
is about stationary.”
<p>To the question: “Assuming at the time of the last two films that the
general health of the patient was good, and there was no sputum or no blood,
what would you say as regards improvement or recovery process in these
films?” Dr. Hague answered: “Well, having seen all the cavitations of the
left side and the large one on the right — these two show a remarkable
removal of disease process. It would be considered an excellent recovery
if it were in the ordinary course of observation in a sanitarium. We would
consider that a cure, under sanitarium conditions.”

<p><b>TUBERCULOSIS OF LUMBAR SPINE</b>
<br>CASE No. 51
<p>J. A., age four, came to us with a diagnosis of tuberculosis of the
spine in August 1924. He had been diagnosed by Detroit’s leading Orthopedist,
Dr. La F----, Sr., who advised an Ablee Splint operation. He was supported
by a brace that limited motion and reduced the pain only partially.
<p>The family history showed his older sister had far advanced pulmonary
tuberculosis.
<p>For about a year he had increasing pain in the lower back and legs,
found it difficult to get up after falling and would cry out with pain
when he relaxed in bed on going to sleep. We fitted him with a brace, too.
It did not limit his motion too much, but it did aid him during his sleep.
<p>Examination showed a typical tuberculosis kyphosis in the lower lumbar
spine. The two lower vertebrae showed a sharp angulation that protruded
with collapse of the bodies of the vertebrae. There was considerable swelling
of the soft tissues and muscle spasm about the region, which limited motion.
<p>We gave him 1 micro-microgram of the SSR serial system of Carbonyl groups.
There was a steady improvement so that he could discard the brace entirely
in November 1925. The kyphosis gradually disappeared and the pain and limitation
of motion disappeared with it. Within a year the spine was straight.
<p>The radiographs made by the Orthopedist, at the time, showed the collapse
of the bodies of the fourth and fifth lumbars and the angulated deformity.
The radiographs taken after he was cured more than eighteen years showed
the two vertebrae fused in perfect alignment so as to form one vertebra.
In the upper thoracic spine an area or rarefication the size of a large
pea was to be seen. This showed in the healed spine as an area of dense
bone where the disease was cured before it could do any damage. The radiographs
showing the healed state were submitted as exhibits to the Federal Trade
Commission, but we did not receive them when the exhibits were returned
and thus we are unable to reproduce them here. In April 1957, two radiographs
were taken of the lower spine; one an anterior-posterior view and the other
a lateral view. The perfect alignment in all directions is seen. The spine
is found now to be one vertebra short.
<p>In high school he participated in sports and received a letter in track.
He attended the University of Michigan. Since his graduation, he has continued
to live an active life and earn his own living. In April 1957, he reported
that he is in excellent health and that his back never bothers him.
<p>Normally, tuberculosis of the thoracic vertebrae usually results in
severe deformity under conventional methods of treatment, i.e., by holding
the patient in a rigid shell for many years. Where there is present a metastatic
lesion as in this case, the chances of survival are only slight.

<p>Radiograph II was taken in April 1957, of Mr. J. A. and shows the lateral
view of the lower spine.
<p>Extensive discussion is due this disease since it supports our working
hypothesis so nicely. After the dilute dose of the Reagent, the most virulent
tubercle bacilli, even as found in exceedingly destructive skin tuberculosis
in Brazil seem to lose their pathogenicity, and the most resistant and
progressive lesions have healed with complete cure, just as we have seen
in leprosy. The disappearance of the fibrosis with its captured germs and
the replacement with angioblastic tissue and then with normal lung parenchyma,
the increase in strength and general health of the patient, even while
tubercle bacilli are thrown out during recovery has been our observation
for nearly 40 years. It suggests the curing of the germ as well as the
patient, and implies that the germ was pathogenic only because it was sick
itself — defective in its own Oxidation Catalysis.</div>
