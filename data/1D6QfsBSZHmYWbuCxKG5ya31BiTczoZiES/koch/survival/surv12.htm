<p><b><font size=+2>GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE REAGENTS</font></b></center>

<p>The structure of the Survival Reagents is designed to carry out the
chemical acts that are desired, and these are certain specific dehydrogenations
to initiate oxidation progressions in pathogens integrated with the host
cell’s functional mechanisms. <i>The atomic groups of these functional
mechanisms are their functional Carbonyl groups and supporting ethylenic
linkages that activate them and with which they are conjugated.</i> <i>Two
types of pathogen host cell unions were described, one via an azomethine
condensation of the FCG and a tightly binding amine group, and the other
via a free radical addition to one pole of the activating double bond.
Anoxia or hypoxia was a deciding factor toward pathogenesis and molecular
oxygen plus an adequate dehydrogenator were the essentials for the restoration
of normal.</i>
<p><i>Necessarily the Reagents are highly reactive, with energy content
reaching the “bursting point” so to speak. Nevertheless their chemistry
is not crude mass action chemistry, but instead, catalytic in the sense
that they initiate reactions that convert amounts of material far out of
proportion to the amount of Reagent used. High dilutions are necessary
for their best action. </i>Activation also depends upon the high dilution,
wide molecular and group dispersion, in addition to the activation of the
specific groups that do the work. High dilution probably aids the electron
migrations toward these groups that endow them with high activity. It is
also characteristic that in nature the activating molecules or structures
similar to the Reagents we offer, also work best in high dilution. This
is true of Echinochrome A, Crocin and many other substances. (See Chapter
XIV).
<p>Highly reactive substances used in high dilution, require the greatest
care in production and the higher the dilution, the greater is the care
needed. Likewise in the management of any case that is treated, precautions
against inactivation by contaminating influences or injuries from exposing
the Reagent to strong light or even mild heat must be avoided. Contact
of the Reagent with foreign substances may cause the expenditure of its
energy, so that it is inactivated when it reaches the blood stream. Clean
needles, syringes, and clean air are essential, and these must be FREE
from even the slightest traces of contamination.
<p>The physician’s eyes must be “wide open,” too, so he knows for sure
that the regime that is selected for the patient to follow is entirely
harmonious with its chemistry. This means the diet must be chosen scientifically,
and not by guesswork, and other hygienic methods and measures must be helpful.
Every patient is a complex of many factors in this complicated world, and
the environment must be studied so the patient is protected from contrary
influences both mental and chemical. <i>The principle of the Therapy
is simple, but its management is a job requiring expertness, intuition
and patience plus a large measure of devotion.</i></blockquote>
