        <p><b><font size="+2">PROOFS OF REVERSIBILITY</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>The first official cures of cancer of the vital organs in the
        far advanced stages were had in 1919 under the auspices of the
        Wayne County Medical Society branch of the American Medical
        Association. Five cases were selected by an officially appointed
        committee of surgeons and one pathologist numbering five in all.
        The cases were officially selected as fit for the test, and the
        test was officially closed three weeks after the patients were
        treated and improvements began to show. Five years later it was
        seen that three of the cases were cured and possibly a fourth
        who lived too far away to be examined, but through the results
        in his case, new patients were sent to the writer, five years
        later. One of the test patients with cancer of the uterus,
        proven at laparotomy as extending throughout the abdomen and
        perforating the stomach so as to cause severe bleeding, lived
        fifteen years in good health after the Treatment, died from an
        accident, and the coroner’s autopsy showed no cancer was
        present, and the cause of death had been a brain injury. Yet the
        Official A.M.A.-W.C.M.S. Committee reported no results, and the
        W.C.M.S. Cancer Committee that was appealed to five years later
        to change the false report, refused to do so and summarily
        denied all the diagnoses made by the Official Committee. The
        cures, however, could not be denied. They refused any further
        tests. No other official test was ever made. Every request for
        one has been refused. But the false report is still being
        circulated. </p>
      <p>(A complete record of the W.C.M.S. research is reprinted in Dr.
        Koch’s article, <i>A Vindication of My Patients, an is
          available on this web site).</i> </p>
      <p><b>NATIONAL STATISTICS</b> </p>
      <p>Cancer mortality statistics during the decade, 1920 through
        1929 inclusive, for the six largest cities of the United States,
        reported by Hoffman, in the “<i>Spectator</i>”, and elsewhere
        while we specialized in cancer treatment at Detroit, are given
        below. Since the only variable that entered the picture was our
        own therapy, we take the credit for the drop in the death rate
        in Detroit and its lesser increase in cities that sent us
        patients, as compared to the high increase in death rate in all
        largest cities that did not send us patients.<b> </b>While
        Philadelphia and Los Angeles showed a 30% increase in this
        decade, Detroit showed a drop of over 20%, and it was the only
        large city that showed any fall whatever in the death rate from
        cancer. </p>

      <p>Individual case studies that support this thesis are taken from
        the testimony of collaborating physicians in the U.S. Federal
        Court where they were proven factually incontestable. They
        demonstrate the different features of the <i>reversibility.</i>
      </p>
      <p><b>UTILITY IN GENERAL PRACTICE</b> </p>
      <p>What is most important to the physician is the field of utility
        of Synthetic Survival Factor Therapy. The following table is
        contributed by Dr. Wendell Hendricks as part of a paper given
        before a convention of collaborators who were making
        observations with this Therapy. The best showing is in the viral
        diseases which gave a 100% recovery rate, measles, mumps,
        infantile paralysis, and the acute infections as gonorrhea,
        rheumatic fever, sinusitis, etc., and influenza. The poorest
        showing was in Arthritis Deformans which gave only a 50%<i> </i>cure
        rate. This disease is 100% incurable otherwise, however, and
        perhaps the patients did not stay with the Treatment long enough
        to give it a chance. In the 100% incurable hyperthropic type of
        arthritis a cure rate of 82% of 144 cases is certainly a good
        service with observations showing the permanency of the cures
        over a period of 4 years of checkup. </p>
