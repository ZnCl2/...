<p>This whole text has developed the Thesis of Prevention and Cure of these
conditions and some others not classified with exactness. One might give
a brief summary as a reminder, however.
<p><i>The role of suppressed or buried infection in causing chronic diseases
has been exposed in detail. It is only logical that such foci should be
removed if at all possible. Most of them can, if they are discovered in
time. They are dead teeth, infected teeth roots, the scarred-in buried
tonsil and associated hardened lymph glands, the infected appendix that
gave an acute attack years earlier, and the infected gall bladder.</i>
Most of these sources of suffering and death can be removed by expert surgery
without real inconvenience to the patient, and a good surgeon can diagnose
their presence without error.
<p>The gastrointestinal tract as a source of the toxic amines and of viruses
living in symbiosis with various germs, requires all the attention spoken
of under diet and intestinal hygiene. To this end the enema should be used
freely and intelligently to strengthen the bowel wall by washing away the
toxins that paralyze it and cause diverticulosis. Special lavage systems
are available most everywhere, but when this is not convenient, one can
learn to use the enema at home with good results as well. It is discussed
in Chapter 27, Case Management. Correct eating, as to quality and quantity
are discussed sufficiently in the text. But some factors need emphasis.
<p>The choice of foods calls for the avoidance of selenium containing wheat,
peas, corn, etc. and the avoidance of foods poisoned with insecticides.
It is within the power of the Food and Drug Administration to correct the
whole food poisoning situation, and just now the public’s worry over insecticide
and carcinogenic contaminations of our foods is calling for some protective
action. But this action is even now as stingy as it can be and no protections
against Selenium contaminations are offered as yet. If such neglect continues,
it will be necessary for those who are able to organize their own farming
services and see to it that the ground is fertilized scientifically by
organic procedures so the plants are correctly nourished, healthy and resistant
to insect attack. In fact, it is demonstrated that insects attack the sickly
plants rather than good healthy stock. Selenium-free soil will be used,
and crops rotated wisely.
<p>Whole rye is the superior grain, and the whole grain should be bought,
washed, dried and ground fine for baking the bread and muffins at home,
and for making porridge. Freshly ground grain is preferred.
<p>Whenever possible, honey should be used instead of sugar, and olive
oil in preference to other fats. Foods should not be fried or roasted with
fat and, of course, no animal proteins should be taken at all.
<p>Sufficient exercise to meet the personal needs must be taken, especially
such exercises that massage the abdominal contents. Each day the muscles
need to be fatigued a little.
<p>Plenty of sleep, free from worries or fears, a clear conscience, forgetting
oneself with a healthy interest in the welfare of others so that constructive
attitudes dominate, have good effects on the circulation, and prevent harmful
mental influences from dominating the body chemistry. This is particularly
true with reference to the harmful secretion of adrenaline, adrenochrome,
etc., that are thrown into the circulation by anguish, anxiety, fear and
insecurity. Many amines possess high reduction potentials and can inactivate
the FCG of the tissue cells, laying them open to other pathogens, just
as the toxic amines absorbed from the toxic intestines do. In this respect
toxic amines were found, in recent psychiatric research, to disturb brain
function in line with our Thesis. The stabilizing influence of religion
is seen in our ancestors. Bureaucracies tried to serve the national welfare,
instead of betraying it, as is happening to the knowledge of every thinking
citizen today. In those days the vote counted and there was “something
one could do about it” to keep one calm. Today, it is just the opposite
and people are worried over their own fates and the future of their dependents.
Terror is gripping the world and with it the two great killers, heart disease
and cancer are increasing their toll.
<p>The mental influence over the reflexes that govern digestion and intestinal
movements is to be considered here. Spastic bowels with dry walls, the
failure to empty the rapidly increasing bacterial poisons, add to the mental
instability that brings these conditions about. Calm joy serves otherwise.
<p>In the prevention of cancer it is important to consider the structure
and behavior of the lower end of the large bowel, namely the descending
colon, the sigmoid sphincter, the sigmoid cavity that ends with the inner
anal sphincter, the short rectal canal and the external anal sphincter
muscle. Much cancer of the bowel is located in this region and much intoxication
is developed in the sigmoid cavity that poisons the body generally and
gives rise to cancer in other parts that are disposed to anoxic effects.
One must give attention then to the causes of anoxia in any particular
tissue. Much information is given on this matter that is unreliable. It
is stated that one blow on the breast will not cause cancer. Many times
this is true, but anyone with long experience in medical practice knows
better and can recall specific instances where the broom handle was to
blame. It depends upon the deep injury to blood vessels and resultant block
to the circulation. Then the anoxia, plus the intestinal diamines, the
virus or some other carcinogen from the food or from an old scar with a
buried infection, are the other elements that are needed. The blow may
not be avoided, the scar may be identified and removed and the bowel can
be trained to not produce the diamines that serve as a vanguard to the
neoplastic change.
<p>Cancer of the bowel, the sigmoid flexure and cavity, most noticeably
develops in patients who neglect the emptying of the bowel once or more
times a day including their failure to completely empty the sigmoid cavity
at each movement. The accumulation of material in the sigmoid area can
prove most disastrous. It has lost its parastaltic wave that normally strips
the contents out through the anus without leaving any residue. In many,
only the “overflow” gets out so a big portion is retained. Here the bacteria
have their chance to continually re-infect all material that is admitted
which keeps the intoxication going at its highest rate. The bowel wall
gets poisoned so it cannot produce the energy necessary to make the muscle
fibers contract. The pressure developed inside by accumulation and gas
production, causes the wall to dilate and form sacs or diverticulae that
hold the feces indefinitely thereby, poisoning the wall more, making it
dilate still more, resulting in a vicious circle.
<p>Obviously, the obligation is to wash out the accumulated feces and keep
on washing them out twice a day or oftener depending on the case, but at
least keep the cavity clean and free of the paralyzing poisons. Then the
system that has been poisoned generally from the fecal toxins needs a boost
in its oxidation advantage so as to defend any poisoned tissues and particularly
the bowel wall itself. It should be understood, too, that not only the
sigmoid is injured by the constipation, but the whole colon and particularly
the caecum at the beginning of the colon. A constitutional aid is required
to give the wall enough freedom from FCG inactivation so it can start to
have muscle contractions and abundant secretions again. However, the
daily lavage as often as required will give the bowel a rest as well as
remove the source of poisoning. The diet will also help in removing the
substances that produce poisons at the hands of the bacteria.
<p>When this procedure is carried on long enough the bowel will regain
its normal parastaltic habits and the parastaltic wave will progress forward
right through the two sphincters of the anus and to the outside. It is
an error to state that intestinal lavage carried out scientifically causes
a habit that one must depend upon ever after. Indeed, the best possible
aid to cure is to be had via the lavage system. This will result in the
complete emptying of the bowel as one observes in healthy children. The
heart, bowel, and all other tissues will then benefit and have the advantage
of remaining healthy.
