TISSUE DISEASES</font></b></center>

<p>When one compares the tireless activity of the child with the aches
and restriction on motion as age advances, it is evident that the exchanges
between the tissue parenchyma and blood stream of the child have no impediment
so that waste products get out as fast as formed, and oxygen fuel and food
enter as freely as is required for full combustion and tissue construction.
There is no separating fibrosis between the parenchyma and the blood supply.
In old age, the separation reaches the limit where the exchanges are practically
abolished and finally where life is no longer supported. One organ or other
as habits and heredity have determined has suffered most at the hands of
the fibrogenic agent, and cerebral paralysis or heart or kidney failure
may be the immediate cause of death.
<p>We have identified the initiating factor as an activated amine, which
causes a gellation of the plasma and cellular colloids and this gellation
blocks the transport of oxygen causing a local hypoxia or anoxia.
In addition to producing the gellation as we have observed results from
the guanidin poisoning in our parathyroidectomy work, the amine condenses
firmly with the tissue function Carbonyl groups so as to block its initiation
of energy producing oxidation chains. Incompletely burned metabolites of
tissue cell origin or of germs caught in the anoxic area, then may be dehydrogenated
so as to become free radicals but under the anoxic state cannot be burned.
Since the amount of dehydrogenation accomplished under such circumstances
is small, at any time, a slow polymerization of the metabolite can proceed.
This is especially true where scarring has reduced the oxygen transportation.
The free radicals, be they of tissue cell or germ origin, may also co-polymerize
with each other or with the collagenous material that is produced by fibroblasts,
in response to the irritant effects of the incompletely combusted state.
<i>Thus
they are incorporated into the fibroblastic tissue intended to dispose
of the toxicity. Cancer cells likewise, we hold, take up the toxic products
into their structure in the same way and thus serve as detoxication agents.</i>
(Koch, <i>Cancer and Its Allied Disease</i>, 1926, Koch, <i>Cancer Journal</i>,
October, 1924). <i>As the fibers increase by added deposition of collagenous
and toxin co-polymers, the last depositions must present the highest molecular
weight and as such, each group produces a characteristic set of disease
symptoms because each fiber carries a history of the intoxication
from the inception of the anoxia. The same appears to be the case for each
cancer cell, as well. If the cancer cell could complete the combustion
of the toxin, it would offer protection and serve the immunity mechanism,
which we feel is its intended goal</i> (Koch, <i>Cancer Journal</i>, October,
1924) <i>in antitoxic hormone evolution.</i>
<p>Our observations showed that the flu epidemics of the first world war
gave cancer a boost, and its symptomatology was much more uniform after
this event. <i>As a rule, the pre-growth symptoms were found to exist five
to twenty years before the growth came and the longer they existed in the
parent with cancer, the shorter their appearance in the offspring that
developed the disease. Thus the pre-growth toxic period became shorter
and the growth appeared earlier in life, by some five to ten years as a
rule, in each successive generation that showed it, — quite a virus characteristic.</i>
<p>The symptoms are generally a neuritis, which may be rather violent and
exist in the arm or shoulder in cases that develop gastro-intestinal neoplasms.
It may show up as sciatica, dizziness, epilepsy, headaches or visual disturbances,
etc. The nervous tissues seem to be the favorite site for the toxic action
but there may be psoriasis, some other form of skin allergy, or a compulsory
neurosis, while the lymphatic reticulo-endothelial system undergoes some
atrophy. Before the growth appears, for some six years or so, there may
be a gain in useless fat, of a watery variety and weakness develop concomitantly.
<i>After
the growth appears, the symptoms disappear, wholly or in part, only to
return again if the growth is removed and then again disappear with the
recurrence of the growth.</i> Depending upon the rate at which the toxin
is produced, as compared with the rate of growth of the neoplasm and its
adsorbing and co-polymerizing with the toxin, the latter is stored, out
of the way more or less, and the symptoms will disappear proportionately.
(Koch, <i>Cancer Journal</i>, October, 1924; Koch, <i>Cancer and Its AlliedDiseases</i>,
1926).
<p>To illustrate this situation, included is a letter received in Brazil
from Pasadena, California. It runs as follows:
<p>“In 1932, I brought my mother to you from La Crosse, Wisconsin, with
cancer of the stomach. She was an advanced case, and the symptoms that
she had suffered for years before the tumor was discovered are being repeated
through me. I am asking your advice about an exploratory operation to see
if I have what my mother had, and the doctor’s examinations here indicate
that I have, and only time will give the full proofs - your Treatment was
given my mother and she got well and lived fifteen years longer and died
of a heart attack . . . I started out with a terrible neuritis in my left
arm, and could not raise it above my head. It increased in severity until
I had to carry it in a sling for months. It gradually left there and went
to my sciatic nerve, I also fell and hurt my knee. Tetanus antitoxic serum
was given me and I developed a terrible urticaria that nothing helped except
Cortisone. Then my body became covered with boils and I am taking an antibiotic
for that, but have to keep it up. Before the trouble located in my abdomen,
I began to take on weight and dieting has not helped a bit. Obstructive
symptoms in the abdomen are the trouble now, and the neuritis has improved
a great deal. This is the way my mother’s cancer developed.”
<p>Such reports are the rule, with slight variations. But there are exceptions
also. In this case the pre-growth toxic symptoms were easily contrasted
with the symptoms of the neoplasm.
<p>The fact that the toxin causing the symptoms can add to the structure
of a developing fibrosis or of developing cancer cells, shows that it presents
either highly polar double bonds or free radicals and hence, exists as
a sub-oxidized residue of some sort of metabolism, tissue cell, germ or
virus, in the sense offered below and operates as we diagram, later. This
incompletely combusted state and the anoxia that governs it, are the important
factors we must consider in order to secure a correction of the pathology.
<p>So long as fibrogenesis can absorb the pathogen, there will be no neoplastic
response. But when this defense of the mesoderm fails, and the reticuloendothelial
cells of the spleen and lymph glands become exhausted, the way is open
for the pathogen to attack epithelia and cause cancer. This defense of
the fibroblastic mechanism is a physiological hyperplasia to combine and
wall off irritants and germ products. On the other hand, the neoplastic
hyperplasia, as seen in spindle cell sarcoma, lacks the FCG needed to keep
the activity under control. In the malignant situation, the FCG is inactivated
and requires liberation in order to resume its correct behavior. In the
protective hyperplasia situation, the SSR is needed to burn up all combined
and circulating toxin, including that in the germ that is its producer.
Then the fibrogenesis is obsolete and involutes. So in both situations,
the SSR is required to remove the cause.
<p><b>VASCULAR DISEASE</b>
<p>Arterial sclerosis and the thickening of the interstitial connective
tissues are all protective attempts to: dispose of a toxin, an imperfectly
burned metabolic product of the tissues or of some germ hidden in an old
scarred-in focus of infection, where anoxic conditions prevent the full
combustion of its products. They then have the chance to polymerize thereby
passing through stages that are different pathogenically, temporarily resulting
in various diseases, in route to the production of cancer. The fact that
the cancer patient gives a history of a series of disease states before
the growth appears, which after the growth is made to disappear, repeat
their appearance briefly in the reverse order to their coming, is observed
very regularly and indicates a de-polymerization of the toxin from the
cancer producing stage, down through each disease producing form until
finally the monomeric form is reproduced, which was the initial disease
form produced by the acute infection. Indeed in cancer of the breast, after
the tumor is absorbed, one observes a sudden acute swelling of the tonsil
area of the same side, and a sore throat that lasts a week or so and then
clears up with the disappearance of any scar tissue or hardened lymph nodes
in the area. A breast case may get a final reaction in an old scar in some
other part of the body, after the growth is absorbed. Thus, we link cancer
and its allied conditions with germ toxins or viruses developed in anoxic
areas.
<p>One of the pre-growth symptoms is vascular sclerosis in general, or
in some organ as the brain, kidney or heart and is accompanied by an interstitial
fibrosis. The toxin integrates with the developing fibroblasts that come
to give protection against the poison or its co-polymer with an incompletely
combusted tissue metabolite. It may be taken as a rule that fibrosis protects
against cancer so long as the tissues show the ability to produce the necessary
fibroblasts, but when this ability fades away, the toxin can keep on polymerizing
until it either produces cancer or, let us say, the fibrotic protection
is lost before it achieves that property, and for this to occur, an hypoxic
focus is necessary as in a scarred-in tonsilar crypt or focus of infection.
Then one must agree, with our first experiences, that the carcinogenic
agent was primarily fibrogenic.
<p>In
<b>Case No. 55</b>, the fibrosis with all its tissue accompaniments
of depressed oxidations, such as cholesterol deposits, calcified plaques,
parenchymatous hypoxia, malnutrition and blocked elimination, had
reached the limit. Still, the restoration of FCG function cleared up the
whole pathology in a progressive undoing of the pathogenesis. The “disease
building” was torn down starting at the “roof,” and new tissue was healed
in where the repair was needed. In the Coronary Cases, however, besides
the diseased arterial walls and interstitial hyperplasia, there was the
element of blood gellation that caused the acute attack. The gelled blood,
as in the parathyroidectomy situation, blocked the circulation, but true
coagulation would not have taken place for a while anyway, though it was
inevitable, had not the Survival Oxidations been restored. Therefore, the
recovery was just as fast as the restored oxidations could charge the blood
colloids and restore their correct dispersion. In acute apoplexy, this
has only taken a few hours at times. The Coronary Cases thus picture the
acute action of the toxin along side the chronic action and the Senile
Sclerotic Case and the Bright’s Disease Case expose the chronic action,
with the reversal of the pathology.
<p>Here we see in the polymerization tendency, the action of the free radical
and the double bond. This free radical, when it gets a chance, can add
to a double bond of fibroblasts and cause the sclerosis or the free radical
can add to the FCG system of the parenchyma and cause various allergies
or other disease pictures, like pityriasis rosea, or psoriasis. And when
it polymerizes to the point where it has reached the correct steric advantage,
it can add to the FCG of the mitotic mechanism of cells to cause cancer.
It is our opinion that wherever it has integrated with a tissue FCG system
and interfered with function, it stays there undisturbed. But it undergoes
destructive oxidations as fast as exposure permits at the same rate no
matter where it is lodged. Thus the orderly reversal of the pre-growth
symptomatology is possible.
