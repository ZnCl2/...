<center><b><font size=+2>&nbsp;PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE FORMER CHAPTERS
AND OTHER ESSENTIAL INFORMATION</font></b></center>

<p><b><i>One has seen that the reversal of pathogenesis of microorganisms
follows much the same pattern as the reversal of neoplasia in tissue cells.
Virulence is proportional to pathogenicity in both, and their parasitism
is a necessary property depending on the degree of deficiency against which
survival is attempted.</i> </b>It is also an economic provision that normal
tissue survival arises in the successful performance of the specific function
of any form of life in its contribution to the Great Biological Economy.
<b>Under
this circumstance, parasitism, pathogenicity and their virulences are utterly
impossible, as the pattern of activity is determined by functional procedure
and restoration of function eliminates all three.</b>
<p><i><b>One has also seen that normal function depends on normal structure,
the key to which is the unhindered Carbonyl group in the presence of molecular
oxygen.</b> <b>Energy production in any form of aerobic life can then proceed
by dehydrogenation, free radical production, peroxide free radical production
and the rest of the oxidative progression.</b></i>
<p><b>It is axiomatic therefore, that where any one of the three features,
virulence, pathogenicity or parasitism is eliminated by this basic corrective
provision, all three are eliminated as well.</b> Clinical demonstrations
were given in the testimony of many physicians and veterinarians in the
1942 and 1946 Federal Court Trials by the Veterinarian Department of the
University of British Columbia, Canada, as well as by the Ministry of Agriculture
of that same province. Their testimony showed that highly virulent hemolytic
staphylococci lost their toxicity and hemolytic properties together with
the restoration of the normal calcium balance and the restorative healing
of the parenchyma of seriously infected mammary gland structures instead
of by scar tissue. At the same time, a rapid return of health followed
after the Therapy of the text was given, and most important of all, the
rate of recuperation was proportional to the rate of increase in the germs
that had formerly produced the disease. <b>One concludes that the normal
function of bacteria cleaning out dead tissue debris had been restored
by the action of the activated Carbonyl group.</b> The same effects were
observed in the healing of huge tubercular cavities, the healing of fulminating
and chronic terminal Osteomyelitis, as well as, other infections. Toxicity
tests done before and after Treatment, of gangrenous mastitis in dairy
cows, showed that filtrates from the bacterial cultures taken from untreated
animals were fatally toxic, while those taken from treated animal lesions
were non-toxic.
<p>To test the above principles, Dr. Dieter Reinstorff ran various bacterial
cultures of which the photographic plate pictures an example. It served
as a test for virulence. The inoculum was a highly virulent hemolytic streptococcus
taken from a child. At two weeks after the inoculation of the test and
the control cultures, the latter showed rich growth while the test plate
showed no growth at all. The test plate was treated with 2 milliliters
of the 10-(12) concentration of the Reagent. This test for virulency is
in accord with the loss of pathogenicity after Treatment as reported above.

<p><b>REVERSAL OF VIRULENCE OF HEMOLYTIC STREPTOCOCCUS BY CONTACT WITH
GLYOXYLIDE SOLUTION, 10-(12) CONCENTRATION</b>
<p><b><i>It is also evident that the data shows that the pathogenicity
was not removed by a destructive reagent, but rather by the corrective
function of the activated Carbonyl group. There was no longer any necessity
for parasitism to win survival and no forced effort at reproduction was
necessary to try to overcome a deficiency, for the correction was already
made by supplying the normal source of energy for its created function
and hence, pathogenicity could not result.</i></b> Similar patterns of
recuperation are observed clinically.
<p>The delay in the occurrence of the first reaction to Treatment, be it
24 hours, 36, 72 or more hours, or even days and weeks or months (as in
the case on Multiple Sclerosis of Mrs. R. P.) after the Remedy is injected,
presents the characteristics of the induction period to a chain reaction,
a free radical affair, and hence shows that fundamentally the result of
the activated Carbonyl to be not an equimolecular affair, but an inductive
affair. It resembles the refractory period following a toxic drug when
sub-fatal, but when the tissues fail to respond to a second or third dose
all of which together are more than fatal in amount, is given at the start
all at once. The culture plate is also an example, for the adaptation of
the parasite to the medium took two weeks to reach full bloom while the
test plate showed no growth. So the parasitic survival effort is likewise
a chain affair, another instance of the universality of free radical phenomena
in life processes. One should therefore observe the response to the Treatment
with the Carbonyl groups of the text with careful attention before deciding
that a dose is inactive when visible changes of recovery do not show up
immediately.
<p><b>MAGNETIC ASPECTS OF CARCINOGENESIS AND ITS REVERSAL</b>
<p>Ever since 1920, treated cancer patients in transit from Western parts
of the country to Detroit reported that they felt much better after passing
East of Ypsilanti, Michigan. The reports were too numerous to ignore, so
we investigated the district between Detroit, Ypsilanti, Wayne and Redford.
After eliminating alpha, beta, gamma, and cosmic rays, we settled on the
magnetic flux of the district as responsible. The dip-needle did not vary
as much as 20 degrees from the horizontal but the flux was stronger than
that in unfavorable places.
<p>We found many residents of the district who made rapid easy recoveries
from widespread neoplastic invasions of the vital organs had reversals
that were permanent and complete. So the recovery process was favored as
well as the feeling of well being of the patients in transit. The soil
was a rich, sandy, black, shiny, loam with rich vegetation and many earthworms
and grubs, so we figured that the magnetic flux favored soil building by
the flora and fauna of that function. Centuries of fertilization by animal
excreta and decaying organic matter, that supplied iron-porphyrin
compounds from bile, blood and flesh, with paramagnetic oxygen profited
by the magnetic flux to accelerate its soil building reactions. Foods raised
here were therefore the very best.
<p>The cancer incidence was just as high and the neoplasms just as malignant
as ones found elsewhere. But the recoveries from cancer by the Therapy
of this text were exceptionally rapid and easy. Both carcinogenesis and
its reversal are free radical affairs. The former is anoxic while the reversal
stages use paramagnetic oxygen and peroxide free radicals as its principle
actors. So, since oxygen is 4,000 times more magnetically susceptible,
like iron with which it coordinates, than most other elements in the tissues,
it concentrates with other paramagnetic materials as calcium and iron in
the activated spots of the mitochondria to boost the reaction rates of
function and detoxicative oxidations.
<p>Confirmatory are the boosting effects of magnetic storms that occur
with the sun’s rotation every 27 days, on both the rates of neoplastic
activity and the reversals to normal. Here again the recoveries are boosted
far beyond the pathogenic rates, and no doubt for the same reasons, for
in addition to the paramagnetic oxygen and trace elements, the mitochondria
hold the activated Carbonyls and quinones and the necessary calcium in
their activated spots. These claims included in our Postulate were opposed
decades ago, but are now being confirmed by modern microbiologists even
those including the blocking effects of guanidin. We hold that the electron
mechanics of the double bond of the Carbonyl and its activating ethylenic
linkage are also magnetically susceptible whereby their dehydrogenations
are also hastened. Antagonistic are mercuric salts, amines, and sulphides,
against which cyanide protects, though antagonizing the cytochrome system,
and tends to prevent neoplastic change. <b>This indicates that the primary
pathology of cancer follows proton withdrawal and blocks electron transport
for it depends on hypoxia. The curative progression depends on vigorous
proton withdrawal in the presence of oxygen and is aided by the magnetic
activation of free radicals.</b>
<p><b>SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ETHYLENE BRIDGE</b>
<p><b>In reality, the ethylenic linkage is not an electron donor, but a
weak withdrawer of electrons. When conjugated with a Carbonyl group which
is an active electron attractor, the ethylenic electrons are mobilized
toward the Carbonyl group, and such substituents as CH(3) CH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>
CH(CH(3))<sub>2
</sub>and C(CH(3))<sub>3 </sub>which are active releasers
of electrons will, when located at the opposite end of the double bond,
supply their quota for attraction to the Carbonyl group of the FCG system.</b>
In addition,
<b>the Carbonyl group is negatively polarized with an
oxygen atom rating 3.5 electronegative units and a carbon atom of 2.5 electronegative
units. Only fluorine exceeds the electro negativity of oxygen. <i>Therefore,
the Carbonyl group of the FCG system as conjugated with an ethylenic linkage
serves as an active dehydrogenator of fuels and pathogens that enter its
field and the ethylenic linkage serves as the bridge for the electronic
migrations toward the Carbonyl group. Where two or more Carbonyl group
double bonds are conjugated in series, the orbital mechanics determine
so heavy a concentration of electrons and electro negativity at one of
the groups, that it becomes a most active dehydrogenator and, as in Triquinoyl,
the strain becomes so great that one group even becomes expellable to form
the more stable five member ring.</i></b>
<p>In addition, fuels and pathogens are especially equipped to mobilize
their critical hydrogen atoms. In glycogen and the polysaccharides, the
Carbonyl groups are inactivated and in the monosaccharides the lactone
structure alters the activity. <b>When the Carbonyl group is free; however,
it attracts the electrons away from the hydroxyl groups so that the hydrogen
atoms tend to be liberated with ease as protons.</b> This mobilization
is seen when glucose or fructose are dissolved in heavy water. Here it
is found that the hydrogen atoms trade places freely at random with the
deuterium of the heavy water. Such mobility is surprising in view of the
fact that the bond energy of the OH group is one of the highest for a covalent
bond; namely, 110.2 Kilo-Calories and the bond length is one of the shortest,
namely 0.95 A units. Thus one sees the power of mesomeric induction to
bring about reactivity without causing ionization. The same applies to
the C-H linkage.
<p>Pathogens, like unsaturated fats, also invite dehydrogenations in various
degrees.
<b>Here we Postulate that a methylenic group positioned alpha
to a double bond of an ethylenic linkage offers two activated hydrogen
atoms; one is important for the integration with the FCG system during
the anoxia and the other invites removal from the integrated pathogen by
the Carbonyl group of the curative Reagent.</b> (This dehydrogenation can
also be accomplished by an appropriate free radical). The activation of
the pathogen’s hydrogen atom is secured by withdrawing electrons from
the alpha placed methylene group by the substituents placed at the
other end of the double bond. <b>Those that withdraw electrons are halogens,
methoxyl, hydroxyl, aldehyde, carbonyl, vinyl <i>,
</i>phenyl, cyano and
sulphydryl as well as the imide groups. </b>Here one sees the possible
place of iodine in activating the initiation of physiological oxidation.
The withdrawal of electrons from the alpha positioned carbon-hydrogen or
oxygen-hydrogen bond weakens it to facilitate dehydrogenation. <i><b>The
stage is thus set intrinsically in the pathogenesis for its oxidative reversal.
The pathology actually provides for its correction</b>.</i> The philosophic
implications deserve thought.
<p><i>The basic pathology in endocrine, viral and neoplastic disease is;
therefore, of the same pattern and depends upon the electron passing powers
of an ethylenic linkage to activate the position alpha to it. The Carbonyl
group is an electron accumulator and the alpha methylene group an electron
donor.</i>
<p><b>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FREE RADICAL</b>
<p>Recently, Prof. Cheves Walling of Columbia University stated: “Twenty-five
years ago free radical chemistry interested only a few gas-phase kineticists...
It is remarkable that one set of simple principles is basic to such a diverse
group of processes and products.” <b><i>As our investigations show, the
service of free radical products and processes made it possible to understand
and reverse the pathogenesis of cancer and liberate the host cell from
fatal viral integration decades earlier than 25 years ago, and in fact,
concomitant with the development of the plastic</i> <i>industry. </i></b>Thus
the free radical occupies an important field in biological processes as
well.
<p>(It is interesting to note that Dow Chemical Company and Dr. Willard
H. Dow first became aware of Dr. Koch’s free radical research due to their
independent study of the free radical as it related to the development
of plastics).
<p><b>The free radical made possible an explanation of the Pasteur Effect,
and its reverse the Crabtree Effect, which in our opinion is a means of
measuring the contents of respiring elements that conduct cell functions.</b>
Crabtree (1929) showed that when glucose was added to cancer slices, the
use of oxygen was inhibited in favor of glycolysis, which was not the case
with normal tissues as liver and kidney cortex. Here addition of glucose
stimulated respiration. It was also shown that such metabolically inert
tissues as cartilage and kidney medulla exhibited the Crabtree Effect much
like cancer tissue. Natal retina did also, until it matured and could function
as an oxidation mechanism. Thus, where and to what extent that respiration
is possible, addition of glucose will stimulate oxygen use, and where this
function is limited, glycolysis is used to dispose of the added glucose,
and the use of oxygen is depressed to the extent that common factors engage
in both respiration and glycolysis. <b>Thus cancer tissue has a limited
oxidation rate or capacity that it cannot increase under stimulation,
and is using to the limit all the time, thus revealing the inability to
supply further oxidative facilities. What is the cause of this deficiency?</b>
<p>Aisenberg (1961) offered the two explanations that are supported by
data given in this text, (a) the diminished amount of mitochondria in tumor
cells, as Warburg also suggested; and (b) the statement forwarded by Chance
and Hess (1959) that the respiratory elements are still present in normal
amount, but are under a restraining influence which blocks the oxidation
ability proportionately. <b>This is exactly what our text has demonstrated
together with an explanation of both the hindering mechanism’s chemistry
and that of the liberation of the oxidation mechanism. Thus our Thesis
is supported again.</b>
<p>Not only the FCG’s of the various specific functions may be concerned,
but also the Carbonyl groups of the accessory factors to the oxidation
process, and the electron or hydrogen acceptors as the quinones so recently
discovered to exist in all living cells. Their structures are essentially
Carbonyl groups activated by conjugation with double bonds of ethylenic
linkages. Similarly we find activated Carbonyl groups in the keto-steroids,
and the spent products of all such structures, are hydrogenated and reduced
to hydroxyl. In the case of the ketosteroids the double bonds are
also inactivated, and so the molecule cannot be reversed to function again,
but <b>in the case of the quinones the double bonds are not altered and
reversal with return of function is possible.</b> Thus Coenzyme Q can function
as a coenzyme over and over again as an electron transfer agent.
<p>The quinone structure is also admirably adapted to such function so
as to meet the requirements of specificity in oxidation-reduction potential
and for selecting the specific materials it will react with in each particular
cell activity. <b>The substituents placed about the quinone’s double bonds
give the steric advantages and hindrances required for specific reactions
and for elevated or depressed negativity and oxidation-reduction potentials
of the Carbonyl groups.</b> Twenty years ago the most celebrated biochemists
testified that the quinone structure had no place in biological processes
in opposition to our Thesis<b>. <i>Today, we know otherwise and the position
of the free radical, which can now be proven by electron spin resonance
techniques, is demonstrated as fundamental to all living processes.</i>The
present writer’s Professor of Chemistry was the discoverer of the Free
Radical, Moses Gomberg. He developed his thesis as a pure piece of philosophy,
but he lived long enough to see it become the basis of the plastic industry,
and even learned of the first adventures of this writer’s application
of the free radical in the interpretation and correction of pathologic
states. We join Prof. Walling in saluting the glorious work of Gomberg.</b>
<p>In our early work we found that polymerizing unsaturated free radicals
of low molecular weight stimulated cancer development decidedly, whereas
large inert polymers blocked cancer growth and involution soon followed.
<b>Our
conclusion was that the carcinogen integrated with the host cell nucleus
by a co-polymerization process of free radical double bond additions, whether
the carcinogen is a polymerizing bacterial toxin or a vegetating provirus,
whose units were largely host cell nuclear products; the symbiosis held
through the mitotic act. The small polymers offered more double bonds and
free radicals for hastening the mitosis point; whereas, the large inert
polymer blocked further additions as a terminator of the chain. </b>Moreover,
the energy for the mitotic act was provided by the polymerization and was
not dependent on usual sources as glycolysis or oxidation. Hence, the small
free radical additions provided more energetic cell division. <b>Dehydrogenated
synthetic carcinogens initiate the integration of either pathogen with
the mitotic mechanism’s FCG activating double bond when during anoxia the
free radical formed adds to one pole of this double bond. The free radical
formed thus at the other pole adds to the critical ethylenic linkage of
the pathogen producing a free radical at the other pole that continues
the polymerization process that supplies the energy for uncontrolled mitosis.
This is why the synthetic carcinogen is lost track of when the malignant
change sets in. <i>Such is our explanation.</i></b>
<p><b>REVIEW OF CARCINOGENESIS AND ALLERGENESIS</b>
<p><b><i>As we have seen, the cause of cancer is a multiple affair in which
anoxia and two pathogens are the principal actors, and the same pattern
holds for the production of allergies.</i> The only difference is that
in cancer the basic functional cell unit attacked is the mitotic mechanism
for cell reproduction. </b>In respiratory allergies, the secreting mechanism,
the contractile mechanism, and the energy producing and receiving FCG’s
as well as their activating double bonds are involved. Where as in neurological
allergies like epilepsy, compulsory neuroses, and fixed ideas, the conductile
energy producing and receiving FCG systems of the activating double bonds
are attacked. <b><i>We have classified cancer as an allergy of the cell’s
mitotic mechanism decades ago </i></b>(<i>Natural Immunity</i>, 1934, Christopher
Publ. Co. - Koch).
<p>The energy for excessive action of an allergy or neoplasia is not received
from the normal sources of oxidation nor even glycolysis as Warburg suggested,
for the FCG of energy production and acceptance is blocked by the pathogenic
additions. <b><i>We conclude that the energy comes from the polymerization
of one of the pathogens integrated with one terminal of the FCG activating
double bond as a free radical addition. In the case of cancer and any other
allergies, the pathogen is a virus or a polymerizing toxin produced by
bacteria trapped in the scar of an old infection where ischaemia protects
it from oxidation.</i></b> This pathogen is the sustaining toxin that
may be difficult to differentiate from a virus, or bacteriophage living
in symbiosis with the germ and paralyzing its activity, instead of causing
its lysis. When it gains entrance into the blood stream and into the host
cell, its critical double bond adds to the distal pole of the FCG activating
double bond which has become a free radical through addition of the free
radical offered by the exciting or sensitizing pathogen to the proximal
pole. <b>The sensitizing or initiating pathogen may be a synthetic carcinogen
that has been dehydrogenated by the FCG during anoxia or the free radical
of an incompletely combusted metabolite, a dehydrogenated sulfhydryl
bacterial product, or a free radical produced by sunrays in the polymerizing
units of a maturing pollen. The latter would be the initiating pathogen
in hay fever or asthma. When it adds to the distal pole of the FCG activating
double bond, the free radical formed at the other pole can co-polymerize
with the sustaining pathogen as just stated whose energy liberated by polymerization
forces the excessive uncontrolled mitosis or other functions as an allergy.</b>
The smaller the molecule, the greater the content of double bonds, the
more rapid the polymerization, and the greater the amount of energy produced,
and hence the more intense the pathogenic action, be it an allergic affair
or a neoplasm. Also the smaller the molecule, the more energy is shown
by the free radical wandering in its domain, to force the polymerizations.
<p>The initiating toxin could be one of the sulfhydryl products of certain
bacteria trapped in occluded tonsilar crypts, the apical infection of teeth,
or some occluded scarred sinus of long standing. <b>Sulfhydryl readily
forms free radicals on dehydrogenation by the FCG, and it also has the
ability to add to double bonds of ethylenic linkages conjugated with Carbonyl
groups.
</b>It can thus interfere with oxidations in several ways for it
can inactivate the quinone type co-enzymes as Co-enzyme Q-10, which is
an electron carrier or transfer agent. When one closes a culture of such
bacteria taken from a focus of infection just mentioned, it soon shows
the development of malodorous mercaptans. <b>In like manner it may
add to the FCG activating system to initiate the pathogenesis.</b>
<p><b>To show that the focal infection of long standing is a factor in
carcinogenesis, a typical case history will suffice.</b> This woman
was then 56 years of age and her case history was included in the Testimony
before the Federal Trade Commission in 1943, as a demonstration of the
nature of the recovery process after the Koch Reagent was given. The uterus
and most of the pelvis and lower abdomen were involved by a biopsy proven
cancer of the uterus, and the right breast also presented a massive cancer
of the simplex type which extended into the axilla. There were numerous
metastases to the skin as well when she received the Koch Reagent in 1938.
Recovery was in evidence within three weeks and continued with reactions
at the twelfth and twenty-fourth weeks. At the end of the twenty-fourth
week the absorption of all growths was complete and an acute violent inflammation
of the tonsil and lymphatics of the neck on the right side set in. She
could neither swallow nor speak for about a week, then it quickly subsided
and she felt very well in all respects. When describing her symptoms, she
stated that she had the very same symptoms some 20 years earlier, and her
health was never good afterwards. During that attack she could not
speak nor swallow. It was determined that both symptomatologies were identical,
except that in the recent attack the symptoms left rapidly leaving her
in exceptionally good health.
<p><b>Here we have an example of the reversal of the pathogenesis as the
essence of the recovery process. The first symptom in the initiation of
the disease was the last symptom to be brought to light and its causative
pathology cleared away at the wind-up of the correction process.</b> <b><i>The
interpretation is what we have offered since 1926. During the recovery,
the de-polymerization of the sustaining pathogen was going on and finally
when the growth was gone the monomeric form of the toxin only was present
to produce the same symptoms as it did when the germ (and its virus) infected
the tonsilar area and produced the original inflammation and its subsequent
cicatrization.
</i></b>Both inflammatory reactions to the monomeric form
of the toxin were identical except that the recovery reaction induced by
the corrective Reagent burned the infection away completely including the
toxins adsorbed in the protective scar tissue. Since these were also burned
away, the scar tissue became obsolete and was absorbed like the neoplasms
themselves. The correction was therefore complete for no scar tissue was
needed after the toxin was burned away. The completion of the recovery
from diabetes with its gangrene conforms to the same pattern. Here the
block to FCG function of energy production and acceptance left the islet
cells unable to produce insulin and the evolution of the pathology that
followed included bacterial infection of the ischaemic bones, which then
underwent necrosis. The recovery process removed the basis for this infection
and the infection left so the bones could be restored in minute detail.
The radiographs demonstrate this. The pathogenesis patterns as outlined
here need not be rigid and must conform to the attending circumstances.
They are in harmony with clinical experience and the established facts
of physiology and chemistry, and are a guide to successful Treatment, which
after all was the goal of 50 years of investigation.
<p><b>GRAPHS SHOWING BLOOD SUGAR BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT</b>
<p><img SRC="image004.jpg">
<p>1,2,3, and 6 are cases that had no previous insulin or other treatment.

remedies, but could not tolerate them and were not helped by them except
transiently.

<p><img SRC="35006.jpg"></center>

<p>These cases show the immediate return of function of the islet cells
that still remain after the inhibiting toxin is removed, and a slower return

and 9.</b>

such as <b>Cases No. 4 and 8.</b>

and their health returned fully after the Treatment, and in the late cases
the return of full health took plate before the sugar came to its
low point or the normal.
<p><b>DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF DOUBLE BOND</b>
<p><b>CLINICAL DEMONSTRATION PREDICTABILITY</b>
<p>One recalls that the conjugated double bond of a Carbonyl group or of
an ethylenic linkage activates many physiological processes, pointed out
in the text. These activations demonstrate its value as an electron bridge,
even in the high energy carrying phosphate esters and especially the enol-phosphate
esters. Activation of the function of the Carbonyl group in various capacities,
as in the deaminations and decarboxylations co-enzymed by pyridoxal phosphate
are demonstrated in their structural formula. However, no attention has
been given to this dynamic function of the double bond. Our own Thesis
made use of this action long before such ferments were discovered. <b>Thus,
one recalls that the mobile electrons of an ethylenic linkage activate
both the dehydrogenating and condensation processes of the FCG’s of energy
production and energy acceptance.In the pathogen, it activates the position
alpha thereto and determines its ability to integrate with the host
cell FCG’s and with their activating double bonds. And after integration
has taken place, it invites the oxidative separation of the pathogen from
the host cell. We saw that the various unions were accomplished by azomethine
condensations and free radical additions, as mentioned in the text. In
Pyridoxal phosphate’s coenzyme services as in some other recently discovered
activities, the azomethine condensation is now identifiable. </b>All
such activations depend on the ability of the ethylenic double bond to
pass its mobile electrons on to the position alpha to it, of course, as
influenced by the substituents present in the molecule. <b>The double bond
is therefore identified by the fact that the condensations and cleavages
take place at the point alpha to it and it holds a critical value physiologically,
pathogenically and therapeutically.We can also demonstrate the presence
of this double bond in the pathogen after integration has taken place,
by causing cleavage of the double bond itself, when we make use of its
identifying characteristics. The cleavage results in the liberation
of the host cell’s FCG from the pathogen. This is demonstrated biologically
by the cure of the disease.</b>
<p><b><i>The identifying characteristics</i> are: (a) the greater rigidity
of the double bond against steric rotation, as compared to the greater
ease of rotation of the single covalent bond in response to environmental
influences; (b) the ability to add a radical or atom at one pole or at
both poles in response to the number of atoms or radicals supplied; and
(c) when an addition is made at one pole, a free radical is formed at the
other pole. In the presence of molecular oxygen, peroxide free radical
formation and cleavage of the bond follows with separation of the
pathogen from the host</b> <b>cell’s FCG system by forming two terminal
Carbonyl groups. The biological evidence is the rescue of the host cell
with return of its normal functional status. The pathogen is no longer
found.</b>
<p><b><i>The double bond is further identified since its characteristic
rigidity against rotation provides that the distal pole will hold the same
steric relation to the plane of the double bond of the functional Carbonyl
group (FCG) in any particular disease or pathogenic integration.</i></b>
Whereas if the bond were single, easy rotation in response to various influences
would place this pole in positions where attacking atoms or radicals could
not always reach it. Therefore, the number of successful attacks would
not be predictable because of steric hindrance. <b>The number of successful
attacks on the other hand, is predictable where the bond is double because
the steric advantage holds throughout any particular pathogenic category.
In other words, where the double bond is concerned, if a successful attack
is made once in any disease category, it can be expected to be successful
in all other instances of the same disease, other things being equal.</b>
<p><b>Different pathogens would be judged to present the distal pole in
the same steric relation to the FCG double bond, if a predictable response
is had in each of a series of diseases caused by different pathogens. This
fact has been realized. So we conclude, that the Least Common Denominator
both in the pathogenesis and in its correction depends upon this ethylenic
linkage of the pathogen, and <i>nature provides for the cure right in the
pathogenesis</i></b><i>.
</i><b>It is easy to conclude on this basis that
animal life was originally free from disease. Only one protective atomic
value was needed. We have shown in the text what it is, the SSR.</b> Now
we will show by an alternate procedure what the curative process is and
thus corroborate our Postulate, and also the standard status of the pathogen’s
activating double bond.
<p>For this demonstration, we used the following procedure, which differs
from the procedure used throughout the text. The latter, one will recall,
was the use of a highly activated <b>DEHYDROGENATOR CARBONYL GROUP, the
SSR</b>, which brought about a free radical alpha to this double bond of
activation of the pathogen after integration. The sequence was peroxide
free radical production and cleavage alpha to the double bond. Now instead
of an oxidizing agent, a HYDROGENATOR, a reducing agent of high activity
is used to add hydrogen to the distal pole of this double bond by preference,
when given in sufficiently high dilution and which adds to both poles when
given in adequate or saturating concentration. For steric reasons, Hydrogen
is a better carrier of the free radical that makes the additions than any
complex group of atoms.
<p>When a dilution of one part to a billion or higher is given, only one
pole, the distal pole, is reduced and a free radical is formed at the other
pole. This free radical goes through the regular sequence of adding molecular
oxygen to become a peroxide free radical that causes cleavage of the double
bond itself with production of two Carbonyl groups, one belonging to the
FCG and the other being terminal in the pathogen, as an activator of further
oxidation. Biologically the results are restored FCG function and cure.
<p>Further as the double bond can add two atoms of hydrogen, one at each
pole, and thus become resistant to oxidative attack when sufficient reducing
Reagent is given, the integration with the host cell is made permanent
and the disease remains. In serious vital diseases, in animals as Hog Cholera,
fatality resulted in 100% of cases treated with concentrations of one part
to a million. The same was true in Aftosa, dog distemper, and some bacterial
infections after poisoning with a tetanus toxin. In animals and man with
the high dilution of one part to a trillion and higher, rapid corrections
were had in all diseases treated, predictably. These include anterior poliomyelitis,
malaria, cancer, and the acute crises of coronary occlusion with infarction,
chicken pox and in some hereditary degenerations of serious degree.
<p>Thus by steric and bi-pole evidences, the double bond of activation
of the pathogen is demonstrated after integration has taken place and its
part played, in both the pathogenesis and in the restoration of normalcy,
are also seen.
<p>It is helpful to contrast this action with that of the SSR of the text,
since the latter is a dehydrogenator and directly an Oxidizing Agent, while
the action of the reducing agent is indirectly an oxidation, but only when
used in very high dilution. <b>The SSR shows corrective effects in every
dilution from one to a million up to one to a trillion and higher.</b>
Here only one action can take place and that is the removal of a hydrogen
atom alpha to the activating double bond. This dehydrogenation is followed
by the usual sequence of peroxide free radical formation and cleavage alpha
to the double bond, and liberation of the host cell. Thus only a curative
action can be had when the concentration is needlessly high, as one part
per million, the recovery reactions are uselessly too uncomfortably vigorous,
without anything being gained over the recovery had by a reasonably dilute
dose. The recovery gained by the reducing agent requires an appreciation
of the basic chemistry involved. When correctly conducted, it is just the
same as when the Oxidizing Agent, the SSR, is used. A few cases will show
this. They will be greatly condensed to give the main facts.
<p><b>ANTERIOR POLIOMYELITIS PARALYTIC</b>
<p>Miss N. L., trained nurse, age 33, took ill August 16, 1947 with the
prodromal symptoms, headache, nausea, terrible leg and back pains and leg
stiffness. On August 19, at 4 p.m., both legs from hips to toes were paralyzed,
could not support her, and the pains were worse. I saw her at 11:30 that
night. There were no tendon reflexes in the legs, no knee jerk. When a
pencil point was jabbed forcefully into the soles of her feet, there was
no effort at withdrawal, and no muscle contractions could be felt. This
is the best test of all. The fever was only 102.5&deg;F. The spine was
getting stiffer and the neck also, so the disease was spreading. The injection
of 2 cc. of the one to a trillion dilution of the Reducing Agent was given
in the right triceps muscle. Results: On the next morning at 8, the mother
phoned that the girl could move her legs, slept some and ate a little.
At midnight, I saw her again. She could walk, felt pretty well, and was
hungry. In two more days, she was ready to work. All reflexes were normal.
<p><b>MALARIA, CHRONIC MALIGNANT TYPE</b>
<p>Mr. L.M., age 36, gas station attendant, World War II veteran, contracted
malaria in the Pacific area, treated in Veteran’s hospitals for many months,
but without results. Attacks still came. After one on June 13, 1947 he
was given an injection of 2 cc. of the one to a trillion solution of the
Reducing agent. Result: No more attacks in the two years that followed
under our observation. His health returned very nicely. The history states
this was a falciform infection.
<p><b>CANCER</b>
<p>Mrs. F., age 58. The history claimed full diagnosis of cancer at the
Henry Ford Hospital, with hopeless prognosis. Examination showed a weak
cachectic woman with an abdomen greatly enlarged with hard irregular tumefaction
and a pelvis so involved the landwarks were completely obliterated. Hemorrhage
and drainage from vagina and rectum and the enormous involvement, with
the great anemia, indicated she could not survive many days. We did not
wait for the biopsy report, as we considered the situation hopeless and
made a clinical diagnosis only. The Reducing A gent was given 2 cc of the
one to a trillion dilution on August 17, 1947. In a month’s time drainage,
pain, bleeding and functions had improved. She gradually recovered according
to reports. She moved to California. The last report came in August 1961,
stating that she fully regained her health and is still well.
<p><b>CORONARY OCCLUSION</b>
<p>Mrs. S., age 74, with a long history of arterial sclerosis and aortic
insufficiency, usually carrying a blood pressure of 200/100, had a severe
coronary attack in June 1960. The SSR was given before true infarction
could happen and the recovery was immediate. The ECG showed no infarction.
The following year on June 27, 1961 she had a very severe attack. She was
hospitalized and given every possible aid while under the oxygen tent,
but without favorable response. The situation rapidly deteriorated, B.P.
190/100, great pulmonary edema, thin weak pulse at 130 P/M, great dyspnoea,
general cyanosis, chest pain and she was at the point of collapse when
the Reagent was injected in the triceps muscle, 2 cc. of the one to a trillion
dilution. The response was immediate. The house physician took the pulse
while the injection was being given to check the change that followed.
The needle was a No. 12 bore, one inch long, to accommodate the rapid injection.
Just after the needle was withdrawn, a part of a minute after the injection
was made, the pulse immediately changed to 60 per minute, the dyspnoea
ceased, the cyanosis faded away, and as fast as the blood pressure could
be taken it was found to be 140/80. She was comfortable in a minute. The
house physician was “shocked.” The next morning the ECG was taken, amid
showed nodal fibrillation, extensive infarction of the Septum, and ischaemia
extending over the lateral wall of the left ventricle. Another ECG taken
a week later showed marked improvement with diminution of the area of infarction.
The day following the crisis the Blood Pressure was back to its normal
for her, 180/100. Her health remains what is considered good for her.
<p>During the first attack the blood was extremely jelled so that the ischaemia
of the heart muscle gave the same symptoms as a thrombosis, since the blood
was not flowing. But on receiving the SSR, the blood colloids were quickly
charged and good dispersion restored the fluidity for normal movement.
Infarction was prevented. During the second attack, the jelling of the
colloids went on long enough to injure the vessel intimae and true clotting
took place over a wide area and besides, a still wider area was ischaemic
from extensive blood jelling. Wherever the true clot had not interrupted
the circulation, the dispersion was restored and a good flow assured. The
periphery of the infracted area showed so much improvement within a week,
that one could conclude, that much of the integrated toxin was really removed.
The speed of the restoration to normal in both instances was the same and
in each instance depended on the separation of the pathogen from the FCG
of all the cells concerned. Dr. Jayme Treiger attended her in both attacks.
<p><b>CHICKEN POX</b>
<p>Dr. Treiger reports on 14 cases of Chicken Pox treated during an epidemic
in 1961. Twelve cases gave immediate responses so that the lesions did
not progress any further after Treatment with the reducing agent, but started
to involute right away. Between 24 to 48 hours, the recoveries were complete.
The other two cases recovered between 5 days and a week. Thus the virus
was instantaneously removed from the tissue cell’s FCG, in the first 12
cases. The results in the two cases that failed to respond to the Reagent
were also predictable, since they did not follow the regime and ate such
antagonistic foods as smoked ham. As in measles, where the recoveries require
about 12 hours after the patient has been treated, the response is predictable
and the scientific basis of the Therapy is thereby established.
<p><b>HEREDITARY GENERAL ATROPHY-IDIOCY</b>
<p>A girl of 11 years of age, with the intelligence of a child of one year
could walk before she was three years old, but not afterward. Her arms,
legs and body were atrophied, but not her head although her brain failed
to develop. She had convulsions every day of her life until July 1, 1961
when the Reducing Agent was given. On that day, she had convulsions and
was unconscious all day until Dr. J. Treiger injected the Remedy. After
the injection, the convulsions stopped and she had no more until during
thesixth week reaction, when one mild convulsion took place. There has
been a steady improvement in her health during the 2 months that followed
the Treatment, up to this date (9/1/61).
<p><b>DIABETES WITH GANGRENE</b>
<p>Dr. Julian Baldor reports the following case of diabetes with gangrene.
Mr. A. C., age 71, had been diabetic for five years. He had had many high
blood sugar analyses and insulin injections, but a steady decline in health:
On January 5, 1961, he had a severe crisis; blood sugar 375 mgm.%, high
fever, much pain in the right foot and was approaching coma. Gangrene of
the fifth toe set in. Following toe amputation on February 12, 1961, fever
continued and there was a rapid spread of the gangrene to involve the entire
foot with numerous fistulae on the dorsum and plantar surface. Further
amputation was considered, but because of the virulence of the gangrene,
it was considered useless, even though done above the knee.
<p>The Reagent was given on March 18, 1961. Two days later, on March 20,
1961, Radiograph I of the right foot was taken showing bone destruction
from diabetic gangrene. After Treatment, improvement followed. On March
30, 1961, without insulin his blood sugar was 124 mgm.%. No medication
was required. In eight weeks, the lesions were healed, the edema was gone
and healing of the destroyed bone tissue in exact normal detail was observed
in the Radiographs. Radiograph II, taken on June 3, 1961, shows bone reconstruction
where the gangrene had formerly destroyed the bony structures. Only where
amputation removed the bone was no reconstruction possible. His foot became
normal, all fistulae were healed, function was good and he is able to walk
normally. On August 25, 1961, his blood sugar was 80 mgm.% and his health
remains good. He is a good demonstration of the reversal of the pathogenesis.
<p>We have fully reviewed the established theoretical chemistry basic to
our Postulate, and have seen how it is exemplified in Nature’s biochemical
systems. We have seen how the double bond is postulated to serve in the
production and correction of ALLERGY AND ESTABLISHES A LEAST COMMON DENOMINATOR
IN DISEASE CONDITIONS.
<p><b>The reversal of the pathogenesis has been observed many times in
the reconstruction of bone that was destroyed by cancer. In this process
soft bone is formed first and after its shape and dimensions conform to
the normal with the fragments drawn to their normal</b> <b>positions, the
soft bone calcifies and is hardened so it can function normally.</b> The
original normal structure is thus restored as seen in the Radiographs.
Soft tissues as the vocal cords, the uterus and the stomach wall, have
also been observed to reconstruct to good, normal functioning. Thus the
pathogenesis was reversed in its totality. <b>So it is not unreasonable
to suppose that if the FCG of the tissue cells and of the reticulo endothelial
system possesses an O/R potential equal to or superior than that of the
SSR, disease changes, as we know them today, could never be initiated nor
propagated. Was man so equipped when the Creator pronounced him perfect
in the beginning? And what has unnaturally produced foods and other features
of civilization have to do with our present status?</b>
<p>Without doubt it has to do with the anoxia that makes possible the integration
of foreign material with the host cell’s functional mechanism, for the
eating of meat was never prescribed by the Creator, and wherever dead animal
tissue is found, be it in the ground or in the colon, the germs that putrefy
it into fertilizer for plants are there and the toxic amines are one of
the products. These cause the jelling of cellular, blood and lymph colloids
that block the circulation and combine with and inactivate the Carbonyl
groups that should initiate the oxidation progressions and serve the electron
transport from substrate to oxygen. Sulfhydryl compounds add to quinones
and interfere similarly.
<p>Then how often can the functional mechanism, as we have outlined it,
take on a pathogenic free radical and accommodate the oxidative cleavage
to get rid of the pathogen and function normally again? In the case at
hand, the diabetes has not returned and the leg and foot tissues remain
normal, as he lives on a clean vegetable-fruit-cereal diet. Moreover, there
are other sequelae to diabetes that offer data that answer this question,
for example, diabetic retinitis. Here the basic cellular pathology is the
same, which can be estimated by<i> </i>the delicate sense of vision.
Also in myelogenous and demyelinating diseases of the nervous system, the
pathology can be estimated as it comes and also as it is caused to leave
under the Treatment of this text.
<p>In all cases, the toxic amines, sulphides, etc., produced in the putrid
colon, strike the endothelial cells and intima of the small blood vessels
first to cause them to swell and multiply while the tissue colloids are
jelled to a hyalin substance, all of which tend to shut off the circulation
and oxygen to the functional elements and allow the pathogenic integrations
that constitute the specific diseases. This can be seen in daily practice
and two cases that recently appeared for consultation, illustrate them
very well. One is a case of diabetic retinitis, where the pathogen stepped
in as supplied by a toxic colon and was separated out when the Oxidation
Therapy of the text was employed, again returned upon neglect of colon
hygiene and then again responded to additional Treatment. The other is
a case of multiple sclerosis, which shows the true course of the pathogenesis
as responsive to a putrid colon.
<p><b>DIABETIC RETINITIS</b>
<p>A few pertinent facts will suffice. Mrs. J. C. C., age 39 years, was
under good insulin management for 12 years for diabetes discovered after
a stillbirth. The vision did not start to deteriorate until a year later
when the glycemia was found to be 350 mgm.%. Put on Protamin, zinc insulin
and restinon, the glycemia dropped to 280mgms.%. A good cardiologist found
the circulation to be grossly normal, the B.P. 14/8, pulse 90 b.p.m.
<p>Blood examination on 9/10/64, showed a glycemia of 216 mgms. % and at
this time the distinguish light from dark faintly. She was given a dose
of the 6x dilution of Parabenzoquinone and 18 days later, the dose was
repeated. In a few days, a reaction set in with vision entirely absent
for a day. Thereafter, the vision improved steadily so that at the end
of 3 months, she could read large newspaper print and got around very well.
She then deserted her vegetarian regime and indulged freely in the animal
proteins she enjoyed so well and the retinitis returned, but vision was
still practical enough to get around. Treatment was again instituted, as
before, and the response was satisfactory to her, she reports. However,
she did not return for vision tests.
<p><b>MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS</b>
<p>Demyelization of the pyramidal tracts is the visible pathology, with
gliosis and axon degeneration in advanced cases. The case history facts
of the following case under Treatment at present shows that the chemical
pathology lays primarily in the functional elements and the demyelization,
is secondary or concomitant. The course of the recovery process demonstrates
this.
<p>Mrs. R. P., age 40, first started to show paralysis of the lower limbs
late in the fall of 1963, following an intestinal infection that was diagnosed
as typhoid fever but probably was a different infection, as she had typhoid
at the age of eleven, followed by falling of the hair during convalescence.
This latter “typhoid” attacked her in October 1963, and its terrible headaches
kept repeating every day thereafter between 11 a.m. and 11 p.m. with a
fever of 37.5 to 38, until she was placed on our colon cleansing diet and
lavages and given the Parabenzoquinone injection on August 3, 1965. It
was during this two years of poisoning that the paralysis developed, and
then reversed toward normalcy under our “get rid of the pathogen” system.
<p>The diagnosis, multiple sclerosis, was made by the experts at the Lahey
Clinic and at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, with the usual prognosis
summed up in a letter by Dr. Chas. Fager and Dr. Norcross as follows: “Spastic
type of paraparesis affecting the lower limbs quite symmetrically, worse
in the distal segments than proximally, associated with pathological reflexes
in the toes and absent abdominal reflexes. For the most part the long sensory
tracts testing was normal except for slight impairment of vibrational
sensation in the feet. In the upper extremities and mandible, the reflexes
were also hyperactive but from a neurological standpoint, there were no
other abnormalities, no evidence of any cranial nerve, optic nerve, cerebellar
or upper extremity dysfunction. I am sorry we have nothing further to offer
but this seems clearly to be a case of demyelinating disease of the spinal
cord for which, unfortunately, there is no specific treatment.” The cerebrospinal
fluid showed a Gamma globulin of 12.25 mgms. % and there was an eosinophils
of 17%. They recommended heavy animal protein diet for strength.
<p>The recovery course showed that after the two weeks of colon cleansing
on a fruit-vegetable juice diet and the injection of the two cc of a one
to a million dilution of Benzoquinone and then a regular vegetarian diet;
reversal of the pathogenesis followed the rule of the first to come was
the last to go, and vice versa. The headaches and fevers left immediately,
only to return during the reaction periods the third day, the third week
and the sixth week for an hour or so. But the point, for which we recite
this case, is that within one-half hour after the injection of the Reagent,
she had a reaction of fibrillation of the muscles that control the toes
of the left foot. This lasted for 20 minutes and returned for similar periods
several times that day and continued to come for a few days when the reaction
also started, in the same way, in the muscles of the right foot. These
fibrillations traveled from the feet to the calves and then after the sixth
week, to the thighs and slightly to the abdominal muscles and as they left
the feet and calves, the use of these muscles lost most of their spasticity,
gained much more control so she could walk to the chair, sit down and get
up again easily without help, as was previously required by two attendants
and her balance became almost normal. After the sixth week reaction, her
improvement slowed down so that by the ninth week it was stationary. This
meant, that necessary elements to the tissue reconstruction were exhausted
and one had to wait until the deficiencies could be overcome. Such recuperation
takes time and in one case, had to wait for one and a half years after
Treatment in a man whose multiple sclerosis was developing for 15 years
and was completely hemiplegic for 4 years before he received his dose of
GLYOXYLIDE. Then after a year and a half, restoration set in and in the
course of 4 months he could walk across the room with a little support.
In this case during the recuperation, his legs jerked every third week
for a few days and then improvement set in resembling somewhat the fibrillations
referred to above. So in the case of this woman, time must be given to
accomplish whatever changes are necessary for further progress.
<p>Time factors cannot be predicted!
<p>It will be recalled that at the beginning of Treatment, the woman was
running high fever with intense migraines for many months, until the two
weeks of comparative starvation with colon washings, cleansed her system
of the load of the debris from the forced meat diet that had stuffed the
mitochondrial spaces and covered their surfaces, so that the necessary
electric potentials and diffusion facilities were obliterated and normal
function was prevented. Then after the Treatment within several hours,
she was freed of the headache, the fever disappeared and the toe muscles
twitched, etc. To me, this meant that the mitochondria were unloading their
metabolic debris and in time they were able to function with improvement,
until the period of exhaustion set in. Another fast was recommended along
with colon cleansing to prepare her for the further progress, she required.
There can be no doubt about the mitochondria being injured by her prolonged
toxic condition, as favored by viral and toxic invasions, the extent of
which one is not able to estimate.
<p>However, the SALUTARY effect of fasting in all chronic diseases must
be emphasized and a brilliant case in mind, will illustrate. It is a woman
of about fifty years of age who had an enormous cancer of the right breast,
that had metastasized to all quarters of the lungs causing difficult, painful,
breathing and also metastasized to the brain so that she was paralyzed,
quite generally blind, unable to take nutrition and then proceeded to fall
into a coma, for about ten days before the cardiologist was called to strengthen
her heart. On seeing the full situation, he gave the Treatment of the text,
giving a dose of Parabenzoquinone in one arm and a combined solution of
Glyoxal and Methyl Glyoxal (one of the original forms of Glyoxylide) into
the other arm. The heart responded immediately and continued to become
normal; the breast, lung and brain neoplastic invasions absorbed so that
in eleven weeks, when I saw her, she was perfectly normal, up and about
and free from all traces of the disease. Soon thereafter, she took a trip
to Sao Paulo as any normal person. Subsequent X-ray investigations
showed she was free of all traces of the disease.
<p>Now then, what was the secret of her brilliant response? It was the
prolonged fast she had been forced to follow when she was entirely helpless.
This unloaded the mitochondria of their metabolic debris, so that the oxidations
instituted by the pathogens and integrated with the mitochondria, could
be burned away without further impediment. Never force feed, but fast the
patient!
<p><b>INSOMNIA</b>
<p>Whether insomnia is an allergy of the waking centers in the mesocephalon,
or an inhibition of the sleeping centers has not been decided, so far as
I know. But it makes little difference. For wherever the interfering pathogen
is integrated, it has proved subject to oxidative removal and freeing of
the center, within a matter of a few days, so that normal sleep became
the habit. One case of insomnia lasted twelve years without sleep, in spite
of all of the best efforts by the therapists. He recovered, permanently,
in less than a week after one dose of Benzoquinone. Another case was of
two years standing and also recovered, in a few days, following a dose
of the same Reagent. One must conclude, therefore, that sleep is a function
in which energy is used and the oxidation mechanism supplies it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Interference with this energy production, as by toxic amines
and sulphides, lead to schizophrenic and paranoid states, hallucinations
and compulsions, mentioned only a few times in this text. But there are
many others who responded more quickly and with perfect sanity. One therefore
concludes, that the integration of the pathogen in nerve tissue is weak
and readily ruptured by the high oxidation potential of the Koch Reagents
and the pathogens would then be products of bacterial action generated
in the colon, as for example, by the Tryptophan changes leading to rearrangements
of the pyrrol ring to produce lysergic and reserpine types of products,
as well as plenty of others.
<p><b>Heart muscle has not entirely lost its nerve characteristics in its
differentiation and so its higher tendency to survive oxidation defects
influenced the decision to test out heart muscle, as a carrier of the glyoxal
derivatives, used in the 1919 Official A.M.A. Investigation. Its cure rate,
between (60% to 80%) in terminal cancer, was falsely reported by the A.M.A.
The report, published in the <i>Medical Record</i> of October 30, 1920,
demonstrated a similar curative action in heart muscle. And on this fact,
was built the larger serial systems of Carbonyl groups mentioned in Chapter
13, of this text.</b> <b><i>Further activation of Carbonyl by conjugation
with ethylenic double bonds confirmed the truth that highly negatively
charged Carbonyl groups, in correctly constructed molecules, are the guardians
of perfect tissue function.</i></b>

<br>A little more discussion should be given to the easy rotation of the
single covalent bond and also, its ability to be fixed in one plane by
mutual polar attractions and repulsions of component atomic groups, in
both the host cell and the integrated pathogen. This rigidity exhibited
by each species, in each of its viral infections, has been observed as
a constant feature and would be the only explanation available, if we assume
that the pathogenic integration takes place by an addition at one position
in the host cell’s FCG’s activating double bond.
<p><b><i>The additions of the two pathogens, the initiating and the supporting
pathogen(s) cannot be formulated with exactness as the chemical structures
are not known with exactness; we have arrived as far as we have by Postulates
and check-up of each Postulate, all of which were based on sound chemical
principles.</i></b> With this reservation in mind, we may also formulate
the integration of both pathogens with the critical atomic group of
the host cell’s energy producing and receiving mechanisms, as directed
by the polarity forces, exhibited by the double bond and its substituents.
This cannot be claimed to be absolute for we do not know the atomic groupings
sufficiently for an absolute diagram. However, any utility in a conclusion
reached by a Postulate is just as good a utility as that reached by cold
fact, for it is the utility we need now to face the cancer and viral plagues
we fret about or are not willing to tackle. The utility of an explanation
is some reward.
<p>We have observed that Hog Cholera fails in 100% of cases, to respond
to the serial system of Carbonyl groups that Hog Aftosa, Cow Aftosa and
rabies respond to very satisfactorily. Many epidemics of Aftosa in cattle
have responded 100% to this Reagent. On the other hand, Aftosa does
not respond to Benzoquinone nor does rabies respond to diphenoquinone,
to which 100% of Hog Cholera has responded to in more than one epidemic.
So the species pathogen integration for each disease is set. A diagram
in one plane only can be given on paper and will have to be interpreted
by the reader with reference to other planes. <b>The substituent groups
R, R’ R” cannot be given in detail for they are not known. However, the
signs will have to be understood to carry the polarity values that cause
the fixation of the single covalent bond that joins the two parties, as
we outlined before. What we can show is how the polarity values of the
critical atomic groups of the autonomous host and of the parasitic
pathogen, favor the pathogenesis and also the separation of the host’s
critical atomic group from the pathogen which, undergoes a stepwise oxidation.
</b>There
is, however, more than one question that is not answered by the diagram.
Further data must first be won. <b>The main question answered is how and
why the Reducing Agent is successful in all of the pathogenic integrations,
regardless of species or viral type. This, one can see, is due to the firmness
of the</b> <b>double bond against rotation since, the cleavage is had between
its two terminals and they remain fixed with reference to each other</b>.
<b>The
diagram also indicates the fixation of the single covalent bond that combines
the pathogen and host cell, in each specific disease integration, so as
to offer steric hindrance to successful attack by certain reagents and
steric advantage to others; this is confirmed by clinical experience. This
fixation is, of course, electrostatic.</b>
<p><b>CRITICAL ATOMIC GROUP OF PATHOGEN, ESSENCE OF PARASITISM</b>
<p><b>The pathogen may integrate with the host cell’s FCG by the condensation
via its amine group and block FCG function or pour polymerization energy
into it, to force an allergy or a neoplasia.</b> This does not need to
be diagramed, as only one pathogen is required. Blocked functions as in
diabetes or mental suspensions following the toxic amine carrying
antibiotics, are examples. But neoplasms as caused by butter-yellow
and diacetylaminofluorene require a supporting carcinogen to supply the
energy for mitosis. <b>Where the amine condenses with the FCG to form an
azomethine double bond and initiate neoplasia, a nitrogen free radical
would be expected to mediate the carcinogenesis.</b> 

<img SRC="image018.jpg">

<p>The
polarity of C(4) is positive like C(6) through withdrawal of electrons
by R’ and C(7), which thus become negative. R’could contain halogens, nitrile,
etc. 


<p><b>CRITICAL
ATOMIC GROUP OF THE FUNCTIONAL ENERGY PRODUCTION AND ENERGY ACCEPTING SYSTEMS
ESSENCE OF AUTONOMY</b>
<center>
<p><img SRC="35020.jpg"></center>


<p>The
polarity of the Carbonyl group (12) is strongly negative through the electrons
it has withdrawn from the double bond and C(13) is also negative because
of lying in the orbit, the Carbonyl electrons that polarizes the electrons
to the pole nearest to it and removing them from the distal pole which
makes C(14) positive, comparatively. The methyl functions at C(15) contribute
electrons via the double bond to the Carbonyl group. R” carries groups
like R and R’ of the pathogen that determine the line-up of the two when
they integrate and the polarities of the critical atomic groups’ atoms
determine which make the unions or additions to the double bonds. C(4)
being positive tends to expel H(5) for easy removal by the Carbonyl group
(12) forming the free radical that makes the addition of C(4) to the negative
pole of the FCG’s activating double bond at C(13). Thereby, a free radical
is produced at C(14) which adds to the negative pole C(7) of a fresh molecule
of the pathogen to start the polymerization chain which continues as an
end to end addition, yielding the energy that supports the allergy or the
neoplasia.

polymerization continues at C(6) free radical.

<p>To
rupture the integration oxidatively, the Therapy dehydrogenator removes
H(3) of the initiating pathogen producing a free radical that adds molecular
oxygen to become a peroxide free radical that cleaves C(4) from C(6)
producing a Carbonyl group at the latter. C(4) also becomes a Carbonyl
group and by being positive remains attached to the negative C (13). <b>By
gaining a Carbonyl group the pathogen looses its parasitism and becomes
autonomous.</b>

<p>The
polymerization bond between C(14) of the host’s FCG activating double bond
and C(7) of the pathogen invites cleavage as C(14) which is positive in
polarity and tends to release its H atom to the action of a dehydrogenator
of appropriate qualities, as offered in the Therapy Reagent. A free radical
is formed there and a peroxide free radical results in the presence of
oxygen that cleaves C(14) from C(7) of the pathogen forming two terminal
Carbonyl groups. <b>The Functional System of the host cell thus now holds
a cluster of three Carbonyl groups to serve its dehydrogenating function
as activators</b> <b>and as dehydrogenators. This is a quite formidable
array, via its orbital mechanics. The Carbonyl group won by the pathogen,
attracts electrons from the methylene group alpha to it and thus releases
its hydrogen atom to any dehydrogenator at hand, as the cytochrome or ferrous-ferric
electron acceptor systems and so a new Carbonyl group is formed at each
terminal again, a process that can be repeated until the pathogen is burned
out of the way.</b>

<p><b>SEPARATION
OF THE INTEGRATION VIA THE REDUCING AGENT</b>

<p><b>The
Reducing Agent is constructed to yield a hydrogen free atom, which C(7)
of the pathogen being of high negative polarity, immediately combines.
A free radical is thus formed at the C(6) pole, which being of positive
polarity, immediately combines the molecular oxygen in which it is bathed
to form a peroxide free radical that splits the double bond to form a Carbonyl
group at C(6).</b> <b>The Carbonyl group withdraws electrons from C(4),
which is already positive and makes it release H(3) to any ordinary dehydrogenator,
as before mentioned. The initiating pathogen is thus removed and the FCG
system gains a Carbonyl group joined to its functional mechanism. Another
Carbonyl group is gained at C(14) by the progressive oxidation of the integrated
supporting pathogen, starting at the closest C(4) to the newly formed
Carbonyl group, which now reinforces the FCG, so it is amply able to remove
the H(5), which is already repelled by the positive polarity of C(4). C(4)
thus becomes a Carbonyl group as a result of the usual sequence of free
radical action. Likewise, so does C(6) that draws off the electrons from
C(7) so that it tends to release its hydrogen atom to the ordinary hydrogen
acceptors and become a Carbonyl group that, in like manner, causes C(14)
to release its hydrogen and become a Carbonyl group. Now the FCG is a triple
Carbonyl group affair with properties, as just described, resulting from
the action of the oxidation process instituted through the Therapy dehydrogenator.
Whatever toxin debris is present in the FCG, is readily burned away by
the high power of the triple Carbonyl system of the FCG as a dehydrogenator.
The rapid action of the recovery process in cases where the Reducing Agent
was used in dilutions of one part per trillion, may be explained on the
basis of the procedure just outlined.</b> The polio case, the coronary
case and the diabetes case being typical examples.

<p><b>The
processes just outlined must be considered in any investigation of cancer,
allergy and infection, as they use the most basic of chemical phenomena,
as we understand chemistry today.</b> <b>Whether the outlines given are
the actual processes that take place is not easy to prove without much
work</b>. However, they lay out the paths to be followed in any basic investigations
of the subject and they were fruitful to us in our limited approach. <b>The
results cannot be overlooked, as such results have never been known before
in the whole history of medicine unless, of course, we are scientific enough
to factually examine the superior results of Divine Miracle Healing as
reported by Nobel Laureate Alexis Carrell, which he compared to his tissue
culture data and which yielded some enlightening conclusions that cannot
be scientifically brushed aside, though they follow Laws of Nature we are
not as yet able to understand.</b> The cases we present follow basic cycles
and laws that we have observed whether interpretable or not.

<p><b>MITOCHONDRIA
AND THEIR CLINICAL ASPECTS</b>

<p><b>Complicated
as the mitochondria are now shown to be by modern methods, the patterns
detailed are far too simple to account for their complex performances.</b>
And while our observations are made on the intact patient via case history
and physical examinations, we were able thereby to outline decades ago
what the microbiologists are demonstrating today. <b><i>The clues gained
from our parathyroidectomy experiments were indeed fortunate not only in
teaching us the effects of activated amine groups in bringing about anoxia,
but also the mechanism whereby they blocked the use of oxygen and the operation
of the Pasteur Effect. These clues, followed in a step by step process,
led to the Conclusion that the direction of flow of electrons over the
double bond bridge, whether to or from an alpha placed Carbonyl, amine
or methylene group, determines the resulting normal, pathogenic, or corrective
process.</i></b> Other guides for determining the most likely reaction
sites and courses in oxidation reduction substitution affairs, were the
loosening up of hydrogen-carbon, hydrogen-oxygen, and hydrogen-nitrogen
bonds, by the electron mechanics of neighboring groups, as in the hydroxyl
of the phosphate and the exposed amine group of the adenine and the methylene
(2) group conjugated with the ring oxygen of the ribose fraction of
the ATP. The same earmarks of energy transfer agency admit creatine, phosphate,
guanosine criphosphate and the whole series of substituted quinones to
the energy transmission belt, each holding its specific position in
each particular function, and the ketosteroids may also be included. <b>Each
must be identified with its clinical signs of deficiency, as the basis
of a rational therapy.</b>

<p><b>Another
simple principle in chemistry recalled by the clinical events, is that
the energy liberated by exergonic reactions, must be disposed of or the
reaction will be blocked.</b> It usually passes into and energizes another
process or is lost as heat. Intrinsic in the mitochondria is the function-trophic
balance whereby the gene pattern of its architecture is maintained. So
it appears that the energy, in the working mechanism, is inadequate to
use and is shunted into trophic processes that build up the mechanism until
it is able to use supplied energy efficiently. In a sense, the need for
the function determines the amount of energy offered and the mechanism
either uses it, is built up by it, or passes it into the mitotic mechanism
in cells that can reproduce. No reproducing cells, as the anterior
horn cells, undergo mitochondrial reconstruction and Nissle substance rebuilding,
needed to meet the functional demands after the obstructing virus or carcinogen
is oxidatively removed. Thereby, the trophic neurons are enabled to again
resume the development of tissues that were destroyed by cancer, or were
stopped from developing during a symbiotic polio infection, as the case
histories show. <b>Retarded growth of a limb may thus be corrected 20 years
after the polio infection took place, even returning to a nearly normal
state.</b>

<p><b>PROVEN
REVERSIBILITY OF CANCER</b>

<p><b><i>And
this
leads to the question posed by Warburg as to the irreversibility of cancer
which we show exists only so long as the carcinogen is integrated with
the cell’s energy producing and receiving mechanisms for function and mitosis,
and which is reversed by oxidatively removing the integrated carcinogen,
virus, etc.</i></b> The case histories of the text are good examples.

<p>America’s
most noted expert surgeons and pathologists, at our proudest institutions,
made the diagnoses utilizing all the facilities for making a firm diagnosis,
in the regular course of business.<b> Only a few examples are used here,
but they are enough. <i>Besides, the American Medical Association and its
Wayne County Medical Society officially, but begrudgingly, proved that
cancer is fully and permanently reversible in 1919 when they investigated
this Therapy on “five undoubted cases of cancer” treated in the terminal
stages, as is fitting for such a test.</i></b><i> <b>Three weeks after
the Treatments were given, several patients started to improve so rapidly
that the Official Committee began to panic and closed the investigation,
sending the patients back to their distant homes with the instruction that
further Treatments would not be allowed! In spite of the committee’s actions,
follow-up medical documentation on three of the five patients showed that
they all continued to recover until they were again normal with full reversal
of the pathogenesis, and permanently so.</b></i> A fourth patient made
such a rapid recovery from a generalized von Recklinghausen neurosarcoma
that had invaded his entire body, that when the uncountable tumors began
to rapidly dissolve away, the Committee warned the patient that if he received
another Koch Treatment, he would melt away just like his tumors and so
he had better return home for safety’s sake. He lost no time in doing so.
It was not possible to follow him personally thereafter, as he lived over
300 miles away. So I cannot personally state that I found him cured like
the others. <b><i>However, five years later, patients continued to come
from his hometown because of the good results they observed in his case
and unless he were cured, he certainly could not have survived over a few
months from the time of Treatment.</i> <i>Certainly a recovery rate of
60% or 80% of cases treated in the terminal stage is not, “nothing came
of it”, as was officially reported. Moreover, five years later, when I
presented the follow up documentations of the curative results to the Wayne
County Medical Society and requested that they correct their misleading
report, they persistently refused.</i></b>

<p><b><i>The
full and permanent reversibility of far advanced cancer was also firmly,
factually and with uncontradictable evidence, proven in two Federal Court
Trials of daily sessions, each lasting five months, in 1942 and 1946. And
at their conclusions, the Food and Drug Administration was forced to withdraw
their false charges stating that the Remedy of this text was ineffective.
The answer to the Warburg question is established, “Cancer is fully reversible,
permanently and completely so.”</i></b>

<p><b>ELECTRON
TRANSPORT, SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT 1964</b>

<p>Continuing
the discussion from Chapter 9 of the text on Coenzyme Q10, a supplementary
statement is required. In 1953 when the first edition was written, nothing
was known by the author about the <b>Ubiquinones</b> and in 1959, when
the present text was written, all that was known by the writer, was included
in Chapter 9. But up to the present day, an enormous amount of literature
has been developed, contributed to by biochemists in the leading research
centers throughout the world. <b>Since they give practical information
yielded by precise methods and instruments, not even dreamed of when this
Postulate was formulated, they confirm this Thesis throughout and the student
will profit by reviewing some of the facts. </b>This is not a review of
the entire subject, but only some of the outstanding facts as well as our
interpretations, which are helpful to the conduct of the Therapy.

<p><b><i>Because
of the intriguing nucleophilic properties of Parabenzoquinone, and the
facts stated in the early pages of this text regarding the parathyroidectomy
experiments, it was chosen with other activated Carbonyl groups, as in
the alpha-keto-aldehydes, triquinoyl, and other polymers of O=C=C=O, as
a key for investigating and demonstrating the principles whereby pathogens
could be dehydrogenated and thus detoxicated before and after they had
integrated with the host cell’s energy producing and receiving mechanisms,
and of course, to open up the electron transport where a bottle-neck blocked
the metabolism.</i></b> It is of special interest here that the Benzoquinone
nucleus now offers a historical background that supports the demonstrations
we have made over the past half of a century. For it is the nucleus of
the Coenzyme Q series, the Ubiquinones, that are so named because of their
universal distribution in all aerobic cells, animal, plant, and microbial.
<b>Their
intensive investigations over the past few years show that the chemical
properties, we relied upon to develop our Postulate, are actually used
biologically by all aerobic cells. <i>This is in contrast to the swornTestimony
of leading biochemists in 1942-1946 who claimed, based upon their broad
general knowledge and great education, that the quinone structure, as well
as calcium, oxygen and its catalysis, had no significant place in health
or in the treatment of disease, of course, in opposition to our Thesis.
</i></b>In
the Preface to the 1963 edition of the <i>ANNUAL REVIEW OF BIOCHEMISTRY</i>,
Szent Gyorgyi gives biochemists some moral advice they may weigh profitably.

<p>The
specific place in metabolism held by the Ubiquinones depends upon the way
in which the Benzoquinone nucleus is dressed up by its substituents so
as to fit some specific function, as a key in a lock.<b> What we showed
was that the properties, so used in a particular position, can be used
generally when the dressing is removed, that is, when it is stripped of
its steric hindrances.</b> In other words, when the substituents are replaced
by hydrogen atoms as in Benzoquinone.

<p>The
structural formula of Coenzyme Q10, in Chapter 9, shows a methyl substituent
at position 2 of the quinone nucleus, an isoprenoid side chain at position
3 and methoxyl groups at positions 5 and 6. The isoprenoid side-chains
of different Ubiquinones have different lengths. Those in man and higher
animals have ten carbon atoms and are named Co Q10. Lower forms have from
6 to 9, as the suffix in each case indicates. This side chain gives the
quinone greater lipoid solubility and plays a part in the chromanol change
made possible by the position of its first double bond. It does not alter
the redox potential of 98.8 milivolts, which is to be attributed to electrons
received by the Carbonyl group from the other substituents. <b>The coenzyme
is therefore a specific dehydrogenator and electron carrier and is placed
between the flavoproteins and cytochromes in the electron transport chain
on the way to oxygen. It is also agreed that it does not serve on the main
transport path, but on a different undetermined pathway.</b> One might
suggest also that it acts on a very special substrate as well. It therefore
serves the general immunity only in a very restricted way.
<b>Other highly
activated Carbonyl groups present with it in heart muscle lipids are far
more important as we have seen.</b> Since the average human cadaver contains
about one gram of Co Q10, but because it is present in the urine in health
and disease in amounts far greater than catalytic doses, its high substitution
is in agreement with its restricted protective value, in contrast with
the general high protection offered by the naked Benzoquinone structure.
The same facts hold for the serial systems of Carbonyl groups.

<p>As
Coenzyme Q occurs in 5 times the quantity as other members of the electron
transporting chain in some tissues, it must have other functions besides
the simple electron transport, although it is present in proportion to
both the capacity and continuity of oxidation. So with its neat redox potential,
one would assume that it serves as a dehydrogenator of a special grade.
Since it is known to undergo chromanol change, as does both vitamin K and
vitamin E, in order to serve as a phosphorylator, it is shown that this
latter function is also tied up with the Carbonyl group. All three
substances are known to enhance sperm motility, to serve in blood coagulation,
and to serve in the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.

<p>However,
long before these functions were known, this writer used the naked Benzoquinone
nucleus, which does not undergo chromanol change, to not only enhance sperm
activity in bulls but to restore their total fertility. It was used not
only to stop a hemorrhage immediately but also to restore the colloidal
dispersion of the blood so it flowed freely after such gelling had been
caused by the presence of guanidine bases and other toxic amines. Thus
it prevented coronary thrombosis, cerebral apoplexy, etc. The section,
<b>“Practical
Application of the Former Chapters and Other Essential Information,”</b>
illustrates the inexplicable speed by which the blood flow was restored
by the more active of the Carbonyl structures, as well as, the reducing
substance. Likewise, the naked un-substituted quinone can serve as a phosphorylating
agent in a very neat and efficient process, when as it is reduced by its
dehydrogenating function, may add phosphoric acid with withdrawal of hydrogen
and by losing another electron, is thereby re-oxidized to the quinone
structure as it hands over its phosphate group to ADP. <b><i>Thus it prepares
to go through another cycle of dehydrogenating and phosphorylating
as an example of highest efficiency with which nothing in the Krebs Cycle
can compare.</i></b>

<p>Echinochrome-A,
a quinone secreted by the Sea Urchin egg’s to mobilize and attract the
sperm for fertilization is proven to be active by Kuhn and Wallenfels in
dilutions as high as one part for two billion parts of water. Also, Kuhn
and Moweus showed, at approximately the same time during the 1940’s, that
the female gamete of certain algae mobilized the male gamete by secreting
Crocin, a carotenoid which presents a Carbonyl group activated by conjugation
with a series of ethylenic double bonds in equally high dilutions. <b><i>Thus
Nature presents a pattern whereby a Carbonyl serves as an initiator and
transferor of energy oxidatively in order to serve many functions; the
unrestricted “core” of which forms the basis of the Therapy of this text.</i>The
Ubiquinones are just one class, and the ketosteroids are another.</b> Coenzyme
Q is part of the liver oxidase system that catalyses the burning of certain
aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. It is also present in succinic oxidase
and is found in richest amount in the lipid fraction of heart muscle, —
all since 1955, while its structure was definitely determined before 1960.

<p>However,
this writer had experience with it and other Carbonyl groups as early as
1917 on finding a lipoid soluble agent in the cephalin fraction of heart
muscle, which could be inactivated by adding guanidine. <b>So on the basis
that cancer cells were lacking in functional capacity, it was used to treat
far advanced cases of cancer to learn if it would correct the deficiency.</b>
Biopsies from the tumors after parenteral treatment was given, however,
showed no return to normal cell structure, but a calcification followed
by coagulation in only the tumor cells, which were then invaded by capillaries
and absorbed like a blood clot. I therefore named it<b> “Tissue Thrombin”</b>
in a paper published by the <i>Medical Record of New York</i> on October
30,<i> </i>1920. Then at the request of the <i>Journal of the American
Medical Association</i>, the <i>Medical Record</i> refused to publish any
follow-up papers. The Editor of the <i>Medical Record</i> personally informed
this writer that the pressure, which would be brought to bear upon his
publication if he disobeyed their directive, would totally incapacitate
this scientific magazine. The obvious conclusion was that the medical profession
was not free to receive future information, because of the monopolistic
impasse imposed by those in control of the American Medical Association.

<p>Forty
years later, in the <i>1964 Annual Review of Biochemistry</i>, Warburg
states, in his Preface, that he found quinone to show slight curative value
in mice with Ehrlich ascites cell cancer, but it proved too toxic for practical
use.
<b>He depended on large doses to produce hydrogen peroxide as the
destructive agent, instead of utilizing catalytic doses to initiate dehydrogenations
and free radical progressions, which we have established in the text and
in our Court Testimony to be entirely harmless and efficient in the true
cure of cancer and other serious affairs.</b> Warburg also reports the
successful use of L and D- glyceraldehyde in the cure of Erlich ascites
cell cancer, both with equal effects, in spite of the fact that the L form
is more efficient as an inhibitor of fermentation in cancer cells; thus
indicating that the effect is not enzymatic, and claiming the mode of action
is unknown<b>. In both instances, Warburg overlooks the properties of the
Carbonyl group, which we have demonstrated in our literature to be highly
curative when activated by conjugation with other Carbonyl groups as in
pyruvic aldehyde.</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<b><i>For
decades, an intentional blockage to the advancement of cancer research
imposed by the American Medical Association and the U.S. Government has
resulted in the prevention of valuable scientists, such as Warburg, from
learning about and building upon our findings.</i></b>
<p>A most significant clinical fact is the presence of Co Q10<sub> </sub>in
the lipoid fraction of the mitochondrial membranes together with cholesterol,
lecithin and cephalin. Here with variations, cholesterol occurs in about
equal amount to the sum of the other two. In liver, the lecithin and cephalin
are each about 40% of the total, while in succinate CoQ Reductase, the
cephalin fraction is only half as much as the lecithin fraction, 24% and
48%, respectively. Since it is also known that the reduction of CoQ accounts
for only about one third of the oxidized substrate, <b>one concludes, that
other dehydrogenators, like our FCG, must carry the major part of this
function within as well as outside of the mitochondrial membranes.</b>
<p>The most intriguing fact, however, is that the amine groups of lecithin
choline each carry two substituent methyl groups, while the hydrogen
atoms of the cephalin ethanol amines are free and unsubstituted, so they
can condense with the Carbonyl groups under discussion, to form labile
azomethine bases which are thereby protected from forming permanently,
inactivated, condensations with guanidine and other toxic amines. An example
of the other value of the Cephalin Schiff Bases, is their ability to carry
the coenzyme right to the substrate when the phosphate of cephalin is transferred
to ADP followed by the ready liberation of the Carbonyl structure, which
is then free to start another cycle. Lecithin, in this respect, would serve
in contrast as a vehicle<b>. Here we find the explanation of some clinical
facts that assign cephalin a role in the immunity mechanism.</b> 


<br>In many years of medical practice, one has seen among members of families
with tuberculosis, that those who ate the fat of the meat did not have
nor acquire the infection, but those who had the infection, never ate the
fat. No doubt, the cephalin in the fat protected the functional Carbonyl
groups all the way from the intestinal lumen to the mitochondrial membranes,
as stated above, so they could initiate oxidations in the fatty capsules
of the tubercle germs, if that be necessary, or at least correct their
faulty metabolism as described in Chapter 18. Two additional observations
are: the reduction in weight of obese patients following a dose of the
Carbonyl structures of the text, and the restoration to normal of the very
erratic cholesterol counts found in the blood of cancer patients, by restoring
adequate dehydrogenation potentials within the mitochondrial membranes,
where fats and cholesterol are burned. Further, the efficient burning of
acetate chains prevents the excessive production of cholesterol. <b>It
appears that not the eating of fats, but the paralysis of the oxidation
facilities here mentioned, is the cause of arterial disease. This was our
conclusion in Case 56.</b>
<p>All aerobic germs possess Ubiquinones. This means they have Carbonyl
activation through conjugation with ethylenic linkages that serve the dehydrogenation
function. They can also be inactivated as described. <b><i>We Postulated,
that such activated Carbonyl groups produce free radicals followed by peroxide
free radicals in the substrate to be oxidized; that they actually do produce
free radicals, is now proven by electron spin resonance spectroscopy.Our
Postulate is thus supported in this respect, so that when a germ’s dehydrogenating
power is crippled, it cannot obtain energy for survival in the normal way
by making harmless oxidation products, but instead produces such toxic
products as toxic amines and hemolysins, which cause disease.</i>It is
not surprising, therefore, that after contact with the Reagents of this
text, the dehydrogenating power would be restored and is<i> </i>again able
to oxidize to harmless materials, the toxic products it had formerly produced.
</b>Note
the examples in Chapter 9, where gangrenous mastitis of high toxicity in
dairy cattle recovered rapidly after a dose of the Reagent, with rapid
healing, loss of toxicity and concomitantly, a rapid increase in the
number of germs. The same holds true for the rapid cure of terminal cases
of fulminating tubercular pneumonia and cases with huge cavitations. Chapter
18 contains cases that reference the above statement. The time element
gives the clue and culture studies confirm it.
<p>In line with this explanation, a recent report from a physician in the
frozen North, where an epidemic of fulminating pneumonia was raging, sometimes
complicated with measles or scarlet fever, states the following, “I had
to use five doses to save the lives of five small children with fulminating
pneumonia, who certainly would have died without it. The results in these
cases were spectacular (about five hours in each case cured them).” Such
are the usual experiences. <b>Carbonyl, free radicals and molecular oxygen
are the principles.</b> Electron spin resonance techniques show that all
aerobic tissues contain free radicals, so long as they are alive. (Schoffa
1964) Cancer cells are shown to contain less free radicals than normal
tissues. This is of course in proportion to their anaplasia and inability
to function oxidatively. Any increase in free radical content above that
of normal tissue must be attributed to the polymerizing of the carcinogen
in proportion to its malignancy, and as activated by magnetic influences,
magnetic storms, etc.
<p>These techniques show also that gamma rays are able to destroy Carbonyl
groups and thus, tend to make the tissue metabolism of the malignant order,
as in Warburg’s Oxygen Starvation Techniques and with complete reversibility,
for the addition of quinones or other Carbonyl structures (mentioned in
the text) restore the normal oxidative progression, when oxygen is also
admitted. <b><i>This is another confirmation of our Thesis that the Pasteur
Effect is a function of the Carbonyl group, and unless the functional Carbonyl
group is present to dehydrogenate, when oxygen is admitted, the Pasteur
Effect will not be observed.</i> </b>Inactivation of bacteria, reduction
of inflammation by gamma rays and negative consequences from the use of
modern toxic amine antibiotics, may be considered also under this heading.
<p>Intimately connected with the function of Carbonyl groups as activated
by conjugation with other Carbonyl groups or ethylenic double bonds stands:
copper, zinc and the divalent paramagnetic cations of calcium, magnesium,
manganese and iron. Copper is mainly diamagnetic, its oxide being weakly
paramagnetic. Still its presence is essential to the action of polyphenol
oxidase, vitamin C, the Ubiquinones and for the utilization of iron in
hemoglobin and other activities. We found copper, as supplied by the waters
of the Great Lakes, as essential to the best success of our Reagents in
the treatment of cancer for nearly half a century. Where the tissues held
a good quota, such successes as illustrated in, <b>“The Integration of
Pathogen and Host Cell Critical Atomic Groups and Their Separations”</b>
were the rule. Here we have given a few recent confirmations of our Thesis
from leading research centers that certify our Theoretical basis, long
established by the clinical results.
<p><b>THE O=P GROUPS COMPLEMENTS CARBONYL, AIDS IN RECOVERY</b>
<p>Before the historic work of Coris, Lipmann and some others had elucidated
the energy carrying phosphate esters during the 1930s, we took<b> </b>interest
in the hydrogen attracting powers of the O=P group of phosphoric acid,
to compare this double bond with the O=C group, chemically and clinically.
We had observed the dampening effects of hydroxyl and amine groups on Carbonyl
action, and by analogy figured that the three hydroxyl groups of phosphoric
acid must reduce the dehydrogenating powers of the O=P group. At that time,
the electronegative units of neither the Carbonyl nor the oxygen phosphorous
double bond had been estimated. But the dehydrogenating facility,
as hindered by hydroxyl and amine groups, was very evident. <b>Today one
can measure their effects mathematically, and it is seen that while the
Carbonyl group offers 6 electronegative units, the O=P group runs a close
second, with 5.6 such units. The position of the O=P group is therefore
to be reckoned in the oxidation process as something more than a passive
unit in the phosphorylation energy passing function.</b>
<p>One may appreciate the repelling effect of hydroxyl on the electron
attraction power of the O=P group by analogy, when one recalls its effect
in maleic acid, as compared with the anhydride on the attracting power
of the Carbonyl groups. Similar effects are seen where chlorine replaces
hydroxyl as in acetyl chloride. A similar effect should be considered in
the increase of energy carrying power of pyrophosphate, by condensing two
molecules of orthophosphate. Likewise, the increase in the attracting power
of the Carbonyl group produced by conjugation with unsaturated groups,
as in maleic acid as compared with malic acid, and by the increase of O/R
power of diphenoquinone as compared with paraquinone. The effects
of un-saturation and anhydride formation, all of which are dehydration
affairs, influence Carbonyl and phosphoryl in affecting their electro-negativity.
<p>To test this proposal, one combines rich, hydroxyl carrying molecules,
as glucose or fructose, with phosphoric acid under forceful dehydration
and un-saturating conditions to produce their polymeric unions. The
resulting increase in oxidation-reduction potential did not reach
that where Carbonyl is involved, still the energy carrying power was tremendously
increased in a way that was useful in the reconstruction of injured tissues
and in restoring bacteria from their pathogenic states. Bacteria lost their
pathogenicity and virulence, as is demonstrated by bacterial plate cultures,
similar to that shown in the Supplement, <b>“Practical Application Of The
Former Chapters And Other Essential Information,”</b> and by clinical observations
in Chapter 15 and Chapter 18. <b>One concludes, that bacteria and tissue
cells regained the energy utilization powers required for their normal
metabolism and function and thus, their parasitism and pathogenicity was
lost.</b> <b>Since the recuperation of tissue cells and of bacteria is
accomplished by the Carbonyl structures of the text, as observed in other
case reports of the text, it is concluded that energy was produced and
transferred into the same functional structures by both the Carbonyl and
the phosphoryl double bond structures under similar means of activation.That
both groups serve complementary to each other with Carbonyl holding the
initial position, is seen in cases where both types were administered to
the patient and followed by an increase in the recovery rate.</b> It is
also to be noted that the Reagents were given in such high dilution that
the amounts represented only 10-(12) grams per dose, which obviously
is not an injurious dose, but instead could only be a catalytic constructive
dose. <b><i>The conclusion therefore follows that the bacteria and tissue
cells are restored to their normal places in the biological economy by
these two atomic groups and that disease germs, in active and suppressed
focal infection, loose their pathogenicity whether they are arsenic fast,
antibiotic resistant, or otherwise unresponsive to medications, like many
trypanosomes, thus showing that the position of Carbonyl and phosphoryl
action is different from that of the current anti-germ agents and their
high position in biology is assured.</i></b>
<p><b>USEFUL REMEDIES FOR CLEANSING THE MITOCHONDRIA</b>
<p>As was seen, the origin of tissue intoxication via the decarboxylated
amino acids and sulphides, as found in the putrid colon and chronic focal
infections, as infected tooth roots, infected sinuses and diverticulae.
The colon can be cleansed by the use of pure <b>linseed oil,</b> taken
every day at amounts of a soup spoonful once or twice a day or oftener.
The oil must be un-oxidized for otherwise it forms irritant peroxides.
It offers three sets of double bonds, which probably present free radicals
that activate molecular oxygen which detoxicate bacteria and their products.
It makes a good salad oil, but must be protected from exposure to air.
<p>Catalase combines with peroxides to form a peroxide complex, which reacts
with the toxin substrates, and possibly also with unburned food residues
to produce oxidation products, as for example, ethyl alcohol is oxidized
to aldehyde. If large amounts of peroxide are at hand, it dehydrogenates
hydrogen peroxide to form molecular oxygen, that is when more H(2)O(2)
than any toxic substrate, is present to be burned. It should be used first
in small doses in such cases as cancer victims, for the catalase content
is reduced in such persons and the amount of peroxide used should be increased
as the ability to produce more catalase increases, as for example, during
the recovery from cancer under the Treatment of the text. Ordinarily, one
drop of the 10% solution of H(2)O(2) per 50 kilos of body weight used but
once a day, is recommended as a safe procedure. However<sub>, </sub>one
has observed angiospasms of a dangerous type in persons where a dose of
ten times as much had been used.
<p><b>PSYCHIC EFFECTS ON PATHOGENESIS</b>
<p>Psychic influences on the recovery process are of utmost importance
since the ischemia and its anoxia consequent to sympathetic-adrenal action
on blood vessels of neoplastic and infected lesions can block the recovery
process. This is because oxygen is essential to it. Therefore, inquiry
must be made in every case under Treatment to learn if a subconscious conflict
needs to be identified, analyzed, harmonized and eliminated, so that no
psychosomatic effect can emerge to hinder the blood supply to any lesion.
This is important.
<p>Conscious fear-induced protective vasomotor reflexes are coordinated
and controlled to meet the need. Subconscious fear-induced sympathetic-adrenal
produced ischemia is not adapted to protection, is uncontrolled, and may
strike any area of irritation, injury, or an area associated with a guilt
complex. It may produce fatal ischemic crises through anoxia that favors
carcinogenic or viral integrations with the tissue cells. Aside from viral
agents, the pathogens are generally produced in old scarred-in focal infections,
as stated in the text<i><b>. Being free radical products in anoxic foci,
they polymerize through the neurotoxic state and then on to the carcinogenic
state after which, the neurotoxic symptoms disappear only to return transiently
during the reversal process from the neoplastic state back to the original
form of the toxin, as were originally produced during the initial acute
state of the infection. Then as the oxidation continues through the action
of the Therapy agent, the germ, its toxin and its protective scar are eliminated.
The disease is thus cured completely from its very inception when the blood
supply is good</b>.</i> However, <b>there are the ischemic psychosomatic
effects on existing lesions referred to above as caused by <i>submerged
concepts of guilt.</i></b><i> </i>The vigor of the ischemia so produced
and its persistence, are proportional to the depth of the conflict. Persons
holding to higher moral standards, show greater depths of the conflict
and proportionately greater psychosomatic sequelae. Whereas those who do
not carry the negative guilt and are able to excuse, justify or shift culpability,
will not submerge negative feelings to the subconscious and set up conflict
of sufficient violence to bring on the psychosomatic effect, or if
they do, the sequel will be delayed and not as violent.
<p><b>NATURALLY OCCURING ANTICARCINOGEN QUINONES</b>
<p>While searching in Nature for plants that present chromophore groups
of the order we have proven to be anti-carcinogenic, namely Carbonyl as
reinforced by conjugation with ethylenic linkages or by adjacent Carbonyl
groups, as stated in the text, three were found, one in Australia and Africa,
and two in Brazil. All are naphthoquinones of para and ortho structure
existing isomerically and interchangeably. Energy is gained by the
change from para to ortho structure and probably the sun and soil provide
the agencies for it. None of the African or Australian pigments have been
identified with medicinal activity. And still we may do so simply on the
basis of the Carbonyl arrangements in each, as they all conform, including
the Brazilian product, to the laws we have identified with anti-carcinogenic
activity. The Brazilian pigment has not been identified as to structure
except by ourselves, since we find it to be both the para and ortho forms
of a naphthoquinone in isomerism, in two different trees<b>. Here they
can be extracted from the inner bark, and are named the Pau d’Arco Amarilo
and Roxo, for the paraquinone and orthoquinone forms respectively. Both
are proven to be curative in cancer and other diseases, the ortho form
being most active in conformance to our Thesis. Both are of lower oxidation-reduction
potentials than the Synthetic Agents we offer in the text, and run from
0.3 to 0.9 volts lower than our Reagents including: Glyoxal, Methyl Glyoxal,
Rhodizonic acid, Triquinoyl, Compound C and the long straight chains of
Carbonyl groups of the text, simple Parabenzoquinone and Diphenoquinone.</b>
They hence have a much-limited field of activity and are adapted to continued
use over long periods by mouth, in which form they meet the needs of primitive
people. However, as civilization has changed disease systems, the Synthetic
Products we have used for the past fifty years, which were kept from the
sufferer by bureaucratic and commercial interests, must be awaited by present
and future generations. It will be of interest also that Rhodizonic acid,
being stabilized and though reduced in activity by the two hydroxyl groups,
is of use when taken by mouth and will thus serve those who cannot afford
professional assistance. The structural patterns of the others can be represented
by that of the Australian pigment Lamatol or the African Lapachol with
but slight changes in their side-chains.
<p>The Brazilian pigments run very similar and all must have about equal
medicinal values, as the others will be found to have.
