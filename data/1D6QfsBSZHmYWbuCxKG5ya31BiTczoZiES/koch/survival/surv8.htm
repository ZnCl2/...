<center><b><font size=+2>ATROPHY, ANAPLASIA, AND NEOPLASIA</font></b></center>

<p>One may compare the correction of nerve atrophy and neoplasia very nicely
in retinal cases where cell reconstruction can go on, but not cell reproduction;
we may also compare the corrective responses of anaplastic and neoplastic
tissues in reproductive cells. <i>In all four situations, the correction
is had by restoring normal FCG function and thus a Least Common Denominator
is established in these supposedly widely varying conditions. So the basic
pathology is the same. There is a suggestion that the requirement for neoplasia
is the loss of the functional mechanism.</i>
<p>In Glioma, there is no development of functional mechanism, because
the cells are too embryonic and immature or undifferentiated. In the Sympathicogonioma
case, one sees how the nucleus is separated from the functional mechanism,
the fibrillar structure. The latter lays separated as a fibrillar syncitium
supported by cytoplasm, while the reproductive portion is separated off
as individual entities, — cells. Thus the functional mechanism is discarded.
The return to normal which, we are not able to see must be like the maintenance
of the normal; a correct balance and interaction of the reproductive and
functional mechanisms. Thus the energy production in nerve cells must serve
their work of repair and Nissle substance synthesis only to keep them normal.
But when these systems are blocked, the energy has only one place to go
and that is mitosis. When the working part is shed as in Sympathicogonioma,
of course, there is the visible separation. The very high-grade malignancy
of such neoplasms may therefore be understood.
<p>In this case of Neuroblastoma, which will be detailed a few pages further
on, visible separation of reproductive and functional elements of the cell
is demonstrated, even though the child is born with the neoplasm, latent
in his system. In the Retinoblastoma case, the functional mechanism did
not exist in the cells that went malignant, so the mitotic mechanism had
no other course than to use the energy produced in the nucleus for reproduction.
There was no other path for it to follow. It appears from these two cases
alone, that energy production is primarily evolved in the nucleus, even
though the nucleoprotein grana are found throughout the cytoplasm.
In the Glioma case, these granules did not exist, while in the Neuroblastoma
case their connections with the nucleus were severed.</div>


<br>In the Optic atrophy case to follow, complete atrophy was not possible
as yet, as a result of the Retino-choroiditis, for regeneration of the
affected cells took place with restoration of function. A bacterial origin,
of the toxic injury, is of concerned here.
<p>There is another situation due to toxic injury, that of chronic alcoholism,
where this weakness can be transmitted from parent to child for several
generations. A case of Delirium tremens presented on this topic, should
interest the geneticist, in view of the foregoing remarks, for indeed hereditary
transmission is concerned in all of these conditions. Even in<b> </b>this
case of Delirium tremens, the effect of a toxin on the cerebral cells,
the connection between the genes and the functioning elements is concerned,
— the nucleus and the mitochondria. Evidently, this is the toxin that caused
the cancer in this case, for the Delirium tremens returned during the 12th
week reaction in his recovery from cancer of the face. The patient himself
had never used alcoholic drinks but his father, and other predecessors,
did drink themselves to death. Still, the patient gave the D.T. symptoms
during the correction of the neoplastic defect. Both defects were corrected
by the Reagent, which corrected the hereditary Neuroblastoma defect, in
the case to follow very shortly.
<p>This case, with its high malignancy characteristics, teaches another
very important fact; namely that trauma, with its circulatory injury and
consequent anoxia alone, is not sufficient to cause cancer. Also it teaches
that the recovery from this disease removed the carcinogenic factor that
requires anoxia to become effective as our Postulate outlines. For as will
be seen this boy, after being cured by restoration of his FCG Survival
Factor, did not again get cancer after being severely injured by the automobile
accident that bruised him at the site of the former rumor. This case repeats
the lesson learned from case <b>No. 11</b> to follow.
<p><b>Recovery Reactions</b>
<p><b><i>Cyclic reactions: 1) often characterized by the symptoms of the
pathogenesis showing up in the reverse sequence to their coming, 2) accompanied
by a local congestion at the lesion, 3) as well as constitutional symptoms
of grippiness, as occurs in so many virus infections, are to be expected
periodically, while recovery is in progress.</i> </b>The cycles run in
a definite periodicity, in which a three-hour unit, or more often, a twelve,
twenty-four, thirty-six, seventy-two, or eighty-four hour interval, is
usually observed. Thus a reaction of chills, fever and achiness can show
up twenty-four, seventy-two or eighty-four hours after the Treatment. Or,
it may come the third week, the sixth week, the ninth week, or the twelfth,
twenty-fourth, thirty-sixth, sixtieth, seventy-second, eighty-fourth, ninety-sixth,
hundred and eighth, or even later multiples of twelve weeks.
<p>The local features in the lesion are: congestion, swelling, hyperasthenias,
hyperreflexia, more or less pain, local heat, and maybe some bleeding.
But this passes off in three hours or a multiple thereof, and improvement
is then noted. <b><i>When biopsies are taken of the lesion undergoing recovery
in this way, it will be found to undergo: 1) a coagulation necrosis, 2)
then a calcification, much like accompanies or mediates the digestion of
a blood clot or of milk, 3) vascular in-growth is observed, first angioblastic
and fibroblastic tissue, and 4) mast cells or other white blood cells to
help carry off the debris.</i> </b>(Koch, <i>New York, Medical Record,</i>
October 30, 1920), <i><b>4)</b> <b>Angioblastic tissue finally replaces
the growth, and then 5) functionating parenchyma grows in to reform the
organ on physiological lines.</b></i><b> The cure is therefore complete,
as it could not start without preliminary elimination of the pathogen,
and its functional status is returned.</b> The sequence of events during
reconstruction is exceedingly interesting and will be discussed.
<p><b>PRIMARY ATROPHY OF THE OPTIC NERVE AND RETINA SEQUEL TO SCARLET FEVER</b>
<br>CASE No. 6
<p>R. J., 14 years old, gave a family history negative to tuberculosis
and cancer. The pretreatment control period and diagnosis are well described
in the correspondence between the Henry Ford Hospital and Jennings Hospital
experts as follows:
<p>HENRY FORD HOSPITAL
<br>DETROIT, MICHIGAN
<br>Henry A. Du----, M.D. September 10,1946
<br>7815 E. Jefferson Ave., Detroit, Michigan
<p>Case No. 453242 Re: R. J.
<p>Dear Dr. Du----:
<p>Our first contact with the above named child, according to our records,
was a precamp examination done by Dr. J. A. Jo---, of the Division of Pediatrics,
in July, 1945. At this time his vision was recorded as being 20/20 bilaterally.
He was seen by us April 15,<i> </i>1946, at which time he had developed
a scotoma in the right eye. Vision without correction on the right was
8/200, left 20/20. External examination of both eyes revealed them to be
normal. Funduscopic examination of the right eye revealed a normal lens.
In the macular area there was a chorioretinitis which fits the description
given by you in your letter. The left eye was normal to Fundascopic. Tangent
screen examination was done which showed an absolute scotoma in the supracentral
region. The periphery was normal; red field was reduced.
<p>He returned to Pediatrics for a general physical examination by Dr.
Jo----April 17. Dr. Jo---- noted that the child had been seen by Dr. Ca---
who had applied .1 mgm. of 1/10,000 O.T. He had been negative to 0.01 mgm.
when seen by Dr. Jo---- the previous year.
<p>Sinus and chest X-Rays were made. Dr. Do--- reported them as showing
chronic pathology of both antra and probably the ethmoids and frontals
as well, and were suggestive of a pan sinusitis. There was only a moderate
increase in the broncho-vascular markings in the bases.
<p>Blood count showed on 4-16-46 a hemoglobin of 13.5,<i> </i>white blood
cells 10,100, red blood cells 4.66, polymorphonuclears 46, small lymphocytes
52, monocytes 2.
<p>He was last seen April 20 by Dr. Di---- for ear, nose, and throat consultation.
No foci of infection were found in the ears, nose or throat to account
for his eye condition. Dr. Di---- reviewed the sinus X-Rays and washed
out the left antrum. The return flow was clear.
<p>He did not return for follow-up eye appointment, and we have not seen
him since. Trusting this information will aid you in your studies, we are,
<p>Sincerely yours,
<br>Henry Ford Hospital
<br>Per; /s/ E. L. W.----, M.D.
<br>M. W. S---, M.D. Surgeon-in-Charge
<br>rms. Division of Ophthalmology.
<p><b>Our History</b>
<p>Our examination made April 26, 1946, gave a history of headaches and
chronic sinus drainage with acute exacerbations, sore throats often, and
a history of exposure to scarlet fever that did not take on him. He was
slightly sick, but had no rash and did not peel. He noticed the eye condition
when at a shooting gallery he aimed a gun using the right eye and found
he could not see with it. Thus in one year exactly, a 20/20 vision went
to zero so far as practical use was concerned. He could not make out objects
with it nor read any size print. The area of “absolute scotoma” noted by
the experts was an area of retinal and optic nerve “atrophy” that involved
the upper half of the retina and the central field. There was some peripheral
vision but it did not help much.
<p>We gave him a 2 cc. injection of the 10-(12) solution of the serial
system of Carbonyl groups (SSR), the Synthetic Survival Reagent, on April
26th. The sinus drainage and headaches soon ceased. The sore throats returned
only twice during two reaction periods. But the other symptoms were aggravated
during the 12th, 24th, 36th, and 60th weeks. During this last reaction
the throat was most sore, and he had a fever of 103&deg; F. as well as
a typical scarlet fever rash that lasted only 12 hours. His health was
perfect after that.
<p>Examinations of the eye by the same experts found that the vision in
the right eye was 20/400 in August 1946, that is four months after Treatment.
Thus a definite improvement had taken place. In June, 1948, it was 20/100,
and in October 27th, 1948, it was 20/40. Thus the improvement was continuing.
Further reports, but without examination, claim his eye is perfect so far
as reading fine print is concerned or for any other use. Here we see the
polymerized scarlet fever toxin causing a degenerative change, and after
it was broken down to the monomeric phase, it gave rise to the symptoms
of the acute infection transiently. This was burned away in only twelve
hours, and the recovery was complete. Other similar occurrences could be
reported.
<p><b>ACUTE CHORIORETINITIS SEQUEL TO PELVIC AND TONSIL INFECTION</b>
<br>CASE No. 6A
<br>Dr. Jayme Treiger
<p>Mrs. L. P. S., age 35 years. April 9, 1957 when first examined. Her
Pretreatment Control Periodof observation extended until December 5th,
1958, during which time she received all of the homeopathic remedies, and
a course of Cortisone and its derivatives with the most recent and efficient
antibiotics. There was a steady downward course in her general health and
her two chief areas of infection, the pelvis and the tonsils, and steady
deterioration of the function and pathology of the retina of the left eye,
that developed during the last six months of this period.
<p>Physical Examination on entrance showed, fever of 38.6&deg; C. with
a bilateral tonsillitis that had persisted for the past three years, worse
at the end of the menses. She was very exhausted because of excessive use
of antibiotics and antipyretics. Also there was an inflammatory process
in upper and lower abdomen, sequel to violent gynecological infection sustained
shortly after marriage. The tonsils—red, hypertrophied; tonsils full of
pus, Heart—O.K., Gall Bladder sensitive XXXX, Chaufford Zone XXX, and Ovaries
inflammation. The menses were prolonged. There was no benefit from medication
followed during the first six months. Indeed headaches, fetid leucorrhea
and varicose veins were aggravated. Three months later oedemas of feet
and hands on waking, and of the upper eye lid with severe sacro-ovarian
pains were added to the symptoms, with severe chest pains, and blurred
vision, also cracking of the skin on the palms of her hands. Fundascopic
examination by the ophthalmologist showed no retinal pathology at this
time, 7/18/58. The examination on 10/28/58 showed the left eyelid congested,
vision blurred, photophobia. Fundascopic examination on 11/5/58 showed
left eye vision 0.67 fundas turbid with exudate, and a focus of Chorioretinitis
in evolution, juxta-papillary. Right eye normal. V--I, Signed Dr. A. H.
<p>Prognosis — Healing with scar causing corresponding scotoma. This Ophthalmologist
placed her on Cortisone and its derivatives, antibiotics and topical
applications. One month later the eye was strongly congested, much worse
than a month previously, and she could see nothing at all with the left
eye, much worse than at the beginning when she still had some vision, Her
weight was 80 Kilograms. Two millimicrograms of the SSR were given intramuscularly,
12/5/5 8, by Dr. J. Treiger.
<p>Post Treatment Period-12/6/58, swelling of peritonsilar lymph nodes,
dizziness, uneasiness, and violent pain in the pelvis recalling the
time of her acute initial pelvic infection, with exquisite tenderness.
Vision more blurred for 2 days. Copious flow of pus from genitals for the
past three weeks, 12/31/58. On January 12, 1959, she had severe tonsillitis
that lasted for 3 days at the end of her menses, fever 39.5&deg; C., great
hypertrophy of the tonsils, weight down to 74 kilos. with terrible vaginal
itching, that soon improved. By the middle of 6th week, 1/14/59, much better,
temp. 36.7&deg; C. On 2/17/59 her weight was 72 kilos, feels better, and
shows cracking in the skin of the palms of hands as of ten years earlier,
and skin desquamation. Temporary improvement of left eye vision. On 3/18/59
she reported she spent a wonderful week, including her eye. On 5/5/59 she
reported she had two weeks of normal vision and was in good health generally.
On 4/9/60 she had three days of reaction with slight swelling of the left
tonsil, pain in the left eye, slight blur in vision, and then quickly normalized
and has stayed well ever since. The pelvic and throat pathology completely
disappeared. This was the 69th week reaction,
<p>Fundascopic examination by Dr. B., reads as follows:
<p>Dr. A. De S. B.
<br>Petropolis
<br>Estado de Rio de Janeiro
<br>December 21, 1959
<p>Dear Dr. Treiger:
<p>The “Fundus Oculi” examination which was done on your recommended patient,
Mrs. L. P.S. accused on the left eye an inferior nasal focus, entirely
healed of chorioretinitis all the way well into the periphery. There is
no abnormality concerning the vascular supply.<i> </i>The visual field
through comparison showed no abnormality. Therefore I did not try
the instrumental perimetry.
<p>Yours truly,
<br>Dr. B.
<p><i>Discussion
</i>-- No scar was produced as always happens with corresponding
blindness. The retina was restored. If or not a scarlet fever infection
played a part in the etiology no one can say. However, the cracking of
the skin of the palms of the hands and the desquamation that showed up
as she finished her recovery may have some indicative value. Even though
it may not be scarlet fever, it is a toxic effect of infection antecedent
to the retinal lesion. In contrast to the former case which showed no inflammatory
change reportable, but only the atrophic changes here the inflammatory
changes predominated and the degenerative effects were also in evidence.
This woman was also too heavy at first. She lost weight down to 70 kilos
and then got thinner without losing more weight, showing a building of
solid tissue with functional efficiency that went with her return of happy
good health. Both foci of pus infection cleared up, and the non-pusy inflammatory
and degenerative changes likewise disappeared. Thus an integration of the
toxins of bacterial infection that excite no leukocytosis, as they are
bound to and become part of a different tissue, are separated from their
host cells by the SSR as we will show viruses are separated and carcinogens
are separated, leaving the host cell in good functional status while the
pathogen is destroyed. This accompanies destruction of unbound toxins that
excite leukocytosis in other parts of the body.
<p>Her reactions<i> </i>occurred typically, twenty-four hours after the
Treatment was given and at multiples of three week intervals thereafter
for a few times only, the sixth and the 69th weeks. The last reaction occurred
after the retina function had returned to normal and examination showed
it was structurally normal.<i> Thus the reactions are not to the lesion,
but to the cause of the particular lesion, a matter much deeper than the
toxic factor of the etiology.</i> One case alone demonstrating this phenomenon,
would be good to remember, but many such cases showing reactions for example
coming five years after a large cancer of the stomach has been absorbed
and health follows a normal course, indicate that a phenomenon is observed
that clears up the predilection to the pathological response to the etiological
factor rather than an attack on the pathogenic factor which is long out
of the system. The correction is more basic than getting rid of the etiological
agent and healing the lesions.
<p>Confirming this, one recalls the case of cancer of the face of Dr. M,
of a small town in Texas in 1927. He was 81 years old and blind with bilateral
retino-choroiditis of several years standing. He was treated with the SSR
for the cancer and while that lesion was healing up, the vision returned,
so that before the growth had entirely healed, his vision had so perfectly
improved
that he could see the string that was used to tie up packages in the country
store that hung from the ceiling. This was visible to him as he entered
the store. He had reactions which he reported long after he considered
himself cured. There was high fever, 106.5&deg; F. three years after full
recovery. During this fever, which was different from any he had seen in
his long practice of medicine, he was surprised by a good appetite and
the desire to work and expend effort. Here is food for thought. He reported
the best health for years afterward.
<p>Here are three different etiological factors, scarlet fever, a mixed
infection of the gonococcus with strep and staph resistant to all latest
antibiotics, and the etiological factors in cancer. In the latter case,
an infiltrating type of basal cell, solar rays were one big factor and
high winds, frost bite, etc. that caused a circulatory injury, anoxia,
etc. This circulatory injury was present in the mixed infection case too
as scar formation was in progress with the vascular injury that goes with
the inflammation, and neuron injury. In <b>Case 6</b>, the inflammatory
changes were a minimum but the degenerative changes were neuron loss and
scars were most prominent. This is rather strange as there was no inflammatory
history, but a very rapid development of the degenerative change. The other
cases of this disease, we may review, add nothing to the present meager
information. This is unfortunate, since the presence of degenerative change
away from the pus forming areas that supported the infection and toxin
production gives one a chance to investigate the cause of degenerative
disease. If we had sufficient data, we could demonstrate its different
steps. This much is brought to mind anyway, it is the job of an Ophthalmologist.
<p>The old doctor had plenty of contact with scarlet fever, and he no doubt
had an attack that gave lasting immunity of high degree, but maybe not
enough to prevent or clear out a suppressed infection he had carried for
some years. Did his immunity lay the foundation for the degenerative change
in the retina? If so does vaccination which, brings about comparable condition
not play a big role in the great dominance of degenerative diseases of
today? We say the virus or the germ toxin must integrate with the cell’s
functional structure to bring about the loss of function and its sequel
of tissue degeneration and visa versa. Does not vaccination do the same?
If vaccination altered the steric set-up of the cell so fresh entrance
of the pathogen could not take hold, then the vaccine must persist and
do its damage to function. This would lead to degenerative changes with
gene effects.
<p>Let us compare this type of immunity with the oxidative protection used
in Dr. Treiger’s <b>Case 6A</b> and in the others. The scars did not form
or they went away, as they were replaced by functional parenchyma and the
distant site of the infection that brewed the toxin, be it scarlet fever,
ordinary pus infection, or some other factor that enters the etiology of
cancer, was also wiped out.
<p>The cow experiments, a few of which are reported here, show that the
most vicious Staphylococci, etc., lose their pathogenicity and maybe become
faithful members of the great Biological Economy after they are “cured”
by oxidation restoration facilities. <b><i>Inferior oxidations, it will
appear as we go along, are the basis of disease.</i></b>
<p><b>RETINOBLASTOMA OF BOTH EYES (GLIOMA)</b>
<br>CASE No. 7
<p>Rita Long was one year of age when the disease first made its appearance.
In less than a year the left eye was filled with a tumor mass, irritated,
swollen, and blind. The diagnosis was made clinically by Dr. C., a noted
Ophthalmologist, of Wichita, Kansas, He removed the eye. The pathological
report confirmed his diagnosis of Retinoblastoma.<i> </i>The accompanying
document from the court records gives the gross and microscopic pathology.
This was in May 1934.</div>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<center><img SRC="8002.jpg"></center>



<p>Within a year,
the right eye showed the same changes. The same surgeon observed the same
disease here and so stated that it was the same disease that had attacked
the left eye. This is a well known characteristic of this disease, Prof,
Frohlich, of the University of Michigan, testifying as an expert, stated
that there is nothing known to scientific medicine that can combat this
disease. Even when operated early it returns and kills. She was taken to
a renowned Ophthalmologist in Niles, Michigan, who made the same diagnosis
and referred her to us.
<p>We examined her with Dr. H., a good specialist, and made the same diagnosis.
He found that one-third of the retina was replaced by the neoplasm, including
the optic disc. The eyeball was bulging and distorted, the iris dilated
and fixed. There was no ability of the iris to move from its infiltrated
attachments. Behind the pupil was a yellowish, pinkish reflection to light,
showing that a tumor was present within. The area where the left eye was
removed was not healthy, but showed neoplastic degeneration, though only
in a minor degree. Both foci disturbed her. At this time, November 25,
1935, she was over two years old, and we gave her one cubic centimeter
of the 10-(12) solution of the SSR serially arranged Carbonyl groups with
free radical terminals by intramuscular injection. The irritation of both
foci soon left. Every third week, she exhibited a reaction with general
achiness, slight fever, and an aggravation of the irritation of both foci.
Each reaction lasted a few days and was followed by improvement.
<p>Examination on August 18, 1936, showed that all visible pathology had
been removed. Dr. H---- and Dr. W. made Fundascopic examinations and found
the retina normal, fully restored. Since she lived so far away, we gave
her another dose for assurance, and no reaction thereto ever developed.
She has remained well to date with perfect vision in the right eye. She
went through her school courses and college at the head of her classes,
is now married and a healthy, happy woman. Reports made in June, 1950,
and June, 1953, and September, 1960 confirm her full recovery.
<p>This case along with the cases treated in Canada, all used the same
Treatment and are the only cases of Retinoblastoma ever cured. And as Prof.
Frohlich, of the University of Michigan Department of Ophthalmology stated,
“there is nothing known to scientific medicine that can cope with this
disease,” there is no information available as to the changes in the retinoblastoma
cells during the recovery process. This is unfortunate for here we have
a tumor of a nerve tissue that is supposed not to be able to reproduce
in its normal state, even for a reconstructive or compensatory purpose
that does reproduce wildly with great stubbornness, as a malignant tissue.
In this case and the others, the retina was restored with good vision performance.
In this case, the reconstruction was back to 20/20. The question is, where
did the new neurons come from, or were they some of the tumor cells that
were able to reconstruct functional mechanisms, as soon as the FCG’s were
liberated by the SSR? Thus an undifferentiated tissue, probably because
of FCG inactivation, went malignant and then underwent normal differentiation
so as to be able to again function and take its place in the organism’s
economy, after its FCG’s was liberated. This sequence of events calls for
deep thought. It shows full reversal of the malignant state.
<p><b>EUNUCHOIDISM</b>
<br>CASE No. 8
<p>J. S., at age 14, was subject to infections of the respiratory tract
and skin, presented marked obesity, female type shape, was very dull mentally,
was found to have an infantile penis and undescended testicles. In fact,
they had not even descended to the canals. He had been under thyroid and
pituitary hormone therapy from the age of 10 in 1931, to age 14, in 1935,
without any improvement mentally, physically, or<b> </b>in his resistance
to infections. He was closely watched by Dr. S., a relative, who reported
that in this time the testicles had not even entered the canals. Thus the
disease was classified as the type that is not helped by modern therapy
and is permanent.
<p>He received his dose of the SSR serial system of Carbonyl groups in
November 1935, and within three months, he lost weight, his infections
were gone, and the left testicle had traversed the canal and was entering
the scrotum. After the sixth month, both testicles were in the scrotum,
the penis was developing, and the pubic hair distribution became masculine.
He grew taller, his hips reduced and his shoulders and jaw developed to
good proportions. He became very bright in his schoolwork, soon making
up for his backward position. He became a good athlete. He entered the
army and was soon promoted to a corporal. He is married, and is raising
a nice family of children of his own. At the time this Testimony was given,
he was in the Army Law School where he was making splendid progress. His
boy and girl are physically normal and mentally excellent. Thus his genes
were re-established in normal line. One may contrast 14 years of FCG insufficiency
with a few months of rescued FCG efficiency, placing him in the normal
progression of full health. *
<p>* Photographs and a more complete case history of this patient are included
in <i>The Birth of a Science</i>.
<p><b>CANCER OF THE TESTIS</b>
<br>CASE No. 9
<p>Mr. T., age 38 in June 1925, when treated with SSR serial system of
Carbonyl groups with free radical terminals, his testis had become malignant
six months previous to its removal. At this operation, no metastases were
noted. The biopsy report was “Medullary Carcinoma of the Testis.” Recurrence
showed in the groin and scrotum within six months, and another operation
revealed that the neoplasm had invaded the abdomen. Removal was attempted
and the microscopic report on the material removed read again “Medullary
Carcinoma of the Testis.” Recurrence was not long in coming with more rapid
spread of the disease. The abdomen was again opened, but was found so inoperably
involved and a biopsy is all that was done. This biopsy was reported: “Carcinoma,
probably secondary to previous carcinoma of the testis, as the cells are
histologically similar.”
<p>At this time he was rather emaciated, exhausted, and a general cachexia
called for an early termination, — a hopeless prognosis. Through the intervention
of Dr. Alpheus Hoyt, this patient was given the SSR Reagent in June 1925.
He regained his health and all tumorous tissues disappeared. He remained
well thereafter and in 1946 he offered his report stating he was perfectly
well. This was 21 years after he received his Treatment in the terminal
phase of the disease. The preceding case of anaplasia and this case of
neoplasia were corrected by the same Reagent, which restored good FCG function
in both. Here is food for thought.
<p><b>MALIGNANT SYMPATHICOGONIOMA</b>
<br>CASE No. 10
<br>Dr. Julian Baldor
<p>John L., age 13 months, developed a tumor in the abdomen that required
an exploration on September 25th, 1951. A retroperitoneal growth had infiltrated
the region too thoroughly to permit removal of any more than a biopsy.
On October 6th, examination revealed a visible bulging of the abdomen in
the umbilical region which we found on palpation to be the size of an ordinary
Florida grapefruit, about 10 to 15 cms. in its diameters, firmly fixed
to the surrounding structures. The stools were bloody showing the intestine
was invaded, and the blood count agreed with his pallor, — 2,300,000 red
cells with a hemoglobin of 52%. The next day he received from Dr. Julian
Baldor an injection of the SSR Reagent, the serially arranged system of
Carbonyl groups with free radical ends, 2 cc’s 10-(12) solution. Recovery
began promptly and at the end of a year no more tumor could be palpated
on careful examination.
<p>On May 5th, while in good health he was run over by an automobile and
sustained a broken leg and abdominal injuries. While in the hospital for
repairs, he was carefully examined by the same surgeons who had removed
the biopsy. They found him free of any trace of palpable growth. He made
a nice recovery and is in excellent health still. His blood count on April
5, 1953, was 4,750,000 red cells, hemoglobin 87.5%. All the documentation
and facts of this case were put in the Florida State Court Records by his
surgeons in May 1953. His last report was good health in 1958.
<p><i>Discussion --- </i>The case of Sympathicogonioma is of interest not
only because it is so very highly malignant, but also that the mitotic
mechanisms, which are now the malignant cells, are separated from the nerve
fibrilla, the functional mechanism, as entities. The functional mechanism
is entirely shed or discarded and, of course, as an immature and unorganized
fibrillar syncitium. The malignant cells are practically only made of nuclear
material. It is unfortunate that periodic sections could not have been
taken of the tumor as it normalized, to see if the neoplastic cells made
any efforts to form cytoplasm and fibrilla, as a recovery response. In
the Retinoblastoma case, the new neurons that restored the retina to normal
structure, probably had their origins in the neoplastic cells, as new neurons
are supposed never to be formed. In the case of Optic atrophy, this assumption
would also have to be made with the conclusion that the new functional
retinal neurons were developed from remnants of atrophied cells that probably
were integrated with toxin as in symbiotic viral infections, and the atrophy
was never complete enough to prevent reconstruction after the FCG was relieved
of impediment.

<br>That the FCG is the position that is stopped from functioning to cause
the pathology in each condition is quite evident.
<p>Often a biopsy may reveal a tumor to be of grade one or two malignancy,
and after the tumor is removed the sections show it is definitely a grade
four, thus being changed by the manipulations of the biopsy, the effect
of the anesthetic, etc. The case to be reviewed now is one that was exceedingly
anaplastic and a grade IV malignancy at biopsy, as the examinations of
the specimen by several leading pathologists and many well-trained practitioners
of medicine found. Some microphotographs are submitted besides.
<p>This case shows that the Survival chemistry, as established by the high
efficiency synthetic Carbonyl activity, may fade out in ten years when
the environmental conditions are adverse as they were in this case, and
the data should be compared with that of the case that follows it, where
a similar neoplasm of malignancy was cured after the Synthetic Reagent
was given, and still remains cured 36 years afterward. Here the environmental
conditions were satisfactory, even though she was submitted to the trauma
of four natural perfect childbirths, and no return of the neoplasm ever
threatened. As in the neuroblastoma case just reviewed, trauma alone is
not sufficient to cause cancer or its return. The anoxia may thus be established
for a sufficient time for the co-factor and the pathogen to make the integration.
However, with the improved Carbonyl function established by oxidizing the
pathogen away from the FCG system so that the FCG is activated by a Carbonyl
group, a sufficiently high O/R potential is established to burn the pathogen,
instead of condensing with it. Still the Survival chemistry is a comparative
matter, as any other phase of life, and as this case demonstrates.
<p>It will be seen as we go along, as in the above case, that anoxia alone
is not sufficient to cause cancer, <i>A CO-FACTOR, be it a virus or another
carcinogen, is required.</i> Where trauma is not concerned in causing the
anoxia, toxic amines of colonic origin may prepare the soil, and the response
may not be neoplastic, but a necrosis instead.
<p><b>GRADE IV SQUAMOUS CELL CANCER OF THE CERVIX UTERI</b> 

CASE
No. 11
<p>Mrs. M. W. came under the care of Dr. L----, Dr. H----, and Dr. D- -,
of Medford, Oregon, in January, 1940. Dr. L---- examined her and found
that she had an enlarged and fixed uterus. She had a cervix that protruded
into the vagina and could be seen by a vaginal examination with a speculum;
a cervix which was indurated and showed islands of apparent new growth.
A diagnosis of far advanced cancer of the uterus was made clinically. Dr.
L---- reported that her cancerous condition would probably, if untreated,
end her life within a year. That because of the fixation of the uterus
and the involvement of the adnexia, it was his opinion, that it was not
a surgical case, as surgery would have had to be too extensive. It was
too late for that sort of thing. The case had already entered the cachexia
stage as Doctor L----’s Testimony reveals:
<p>“She had lost 30 pounds in six weeks, was complaining of general weakness
and had a rather poor color at the time.” As Ewing states: “Characteristic
cachexia in uterine cancer develops in the terminal stage of the generalized
disease, but when the lesion is localized in the pelvis, cachexia is missing.” 


<br>Dr. L---- gave the SSR Treatment, 2 cc.’s of the 10-(12) solution on
March 20, 1940, December 30, 1940, and October, 1941. His examination made
a year and a half later, in the summer of 1942, found that: “She had gained
weight, she had gained color, and improved in general appearance. The mass
in the abdomen had subsided to the extent that he could no longer palpate
it. The appearance of the cervix by examination with the speculum appeared
normal.”
<p>Before giving the SSR injection she was placed in the Medford Hospital,
and there Dr. L---- removed a specimen from the cervix for microscopic
study. The slide was very carefully prepared by Dr. Green, the hospital’s
Pathologist, and diagnosed by him as squamous cell cancer of the cervix
uteri. But the case was so interesting that he sent the slide to Professor
Hunter, the Pathologist at the University, who established the grade of
malignancy. Dr. Hunter, in his letter to Dr. Green on January 27, 1940,
wrote: “I see a decidedly invasive and anaplastic carcinoma which occupied
well over half of the tissue . . . I would if asked to do so, grade this
one as a IV.”

<br>The confirmatory diagnosis made by Dr. Weller, professor of Pathology
at the University of Michigan, was secured to complete our records. He
found the specimen well prepared, and diagnosed it instantly as follows:


<center><img SRC="8008.jpg"></center>

<br>Dr. Weller’s statement that the slide was well prepared is incorporated
in an Affidavit which reads: 
<center><img SRC="8010.jpg"></center>

<p>During her fifth year after Treatment, it was desired to ascertain her
exact status so an exploratory laparotomy was done by Dr. Haines in June
1944. He found a normal cervix and uterus to which a small fibroid was
attached. He removed the body of the uterus and the fibroid, but left the
cervix in place as he found it perfectly normal. On gross examination the
uterus and fibroid were normal, that is no signs of malignancy were observed
but they were both submitted to careful serial section for a thorough microscope
search for malignant cells. None were found. Dr. Inskeep, the Pathologist,
found no malignant cells and testified that the fibroid was benign.
<p>Here we see, that at the time Dr. Haines operated on Mrs. M. W., there
was no evidence of this Grade IV carcinoma present. Dr. Inskeep’s report
shows that no cancer cells were found. This indicates that, except for
the benign fibroid tumor like so many healthy women carry ordinarily, the
uterus was perfectly normal. Thus, we believe, she was found cured several
years after being treated in the terminal stage of Grade IV cancer of the
cervix when her life expectancy was less than a year.

<p>Mrs. M. W. was seen by Dr. L----. again just a few months before her
death in December, 1950. At the time of her death he was not aware of the
subtotal hysterectomy. Dr. L---- found a very foul smelling friable mass
with the gross appearance of a disintegrating carcinoma in the left side
of the pelvis and involving the lower end of the large bowel. A complete
autopsy was not performed and no biopsy was taken post mortem. He reported
that the condition leading to her death was cancer of the uterus.
<p>In light of the whole case history, it is questionable that the original
Grade IV squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix uteri in 1940 was the cause
of her death in 1950.<i> </i>Her death should have occurred within the
year period, had there been a connection between this pathological condition,
and her death.
<p>Even though the exact cause of death is not established, this case serves
our purpose here, namely to show that the Survival chemistry can be restored
to curative efficiency and that it persists for a period of years without
further Treatment. That when ill health threatens again, its repetition
must be required to restore the desired Survival chemistry again as in
the first instance.
<p>This case also illustrates the importance of continued medical observation
of a patient even after the accepted five-year period. That the Survival
factor, after being restored synthetically, can be subsequently destroyed
by inhibiting factors.
<p>This case should be compared with the case of Mrs. T., who also had
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix uteri. Mrs. T. is enjoying
best health over thirty years after Treatment. One sees that the Survival
chemistry is subjected to environmental influences. In Mrs. W.’s case,
they were the worst possible. She was on Welfare for many years prior to
her death and the type of care she could receive was limited. In the case
of Mrs. T., they were ideal even with the traumata of four childbirths.
Thus the physician must carefully measure all influences that may determine
health in each case and see that the ideal is maintained, both while the
Treatment is followed and after recovery occurs.
<p><b>SQUAMOUS CELL CANCER OF THE CERVIX UTERI</b>
<br>CASE No. 12
<br>* This case is included in the book, <i>The Birth of a Science</i>.
<p>In August, 1923, Mrs. T. was 31 years old. She could never carry a baby
to term and spontaneous abortion took place. For over a year before seeing
a physician she had irregular bleeding, mucopurulent discharge and increasing
pain with progressive reduction in the capacity of the urinary bladder.
She consulted Dr. T. who took a biopsy. A very responsible laboratory in
Detroit made the diagnosis of squamous cell cancer of the cervix as follows.
Several visiting Pathologists also confirmed this diagnosis as a high grade
of malignancy was observed.

<br>My examination was made two weeks later and the findings were those
typical of a far advanced widely invading squamous cell type of cancer.
It had invaded all the structures of the pelvis, but was more extensive
on the right side. All the normal contours were obliterated and the structures
hardened by the firm infiltrations. The bladder wall was extremely involved
and the mass could be easily palpated above the pubes half way to the umbilicus.
Her surgeon did not offer an operation, or recommend any treatment, but
watched her progress with interest and took care of her four pregnancies
later on.
<p>This case was not so far advanced as the case previously outlined. She
bled profusely, especially since the biopsy was made, and she gave a yellow
color that one would attribute to the prolonged excessive bleeding aside
from the natural cachectic effects of a neoplasm that had broken through
into the abdomen.
<p>She received two injections of 2 micro micrograms of the Synthetic Survival
Reagent (SSR) on August 7th and 21st, 1923. She had the typical reactions
of general achiness as
<br>&nbsp;
<center><img SRC="8022.jpg"></center>
 


<br>one observes in most viral infections. The bleeding soon stopped, the
pussy drainage soon stopped, and her color took a change for the better.
The pain steadily let up and the growth on examination became softer, more
elastic and movable, and the normal contours of the pelvic structures returned.
After the 36th week, no more evidence of the disease was observable, but
the right side of the cervix was a little deficient. This did not fill
in fully to make a symmetrical cervix until a few more months had passed.
<p>Her reactions came most vigorously on the twelfth and twenty-fourth
weeks. They exhibited chills, fever, achiness, pains in the back, and increased
urinary frequency. But after each reaction, her health gained very rapidly
and the bladder capacity normalized. She became pregnant and after a normal
term of gestation gave birth to a fine healthy boy, with a normal easy
delivery, managed by her surgeon, a man of exceeding expertness. Three
more children were subsequently born at two-year intervals. All are fine
physical specimens, and the births were easy and normal in every way. There
was never any return of a neoplastic condition or any other trouble, nor
even any serious sickness. She has been remarkably resistant to colds besides,
and is still alive in perfect health 36 years after being treated for a
terminal stage squamous cell cancer of the cervix that was widespread into
the abdomen.
<p>The important lesson from this case is the fact that she had plenty
of exercise, taking care of a big strong husband, and four vigorous children.
She did the family washing with tub and rubbing board and had plenty of
exercise of the abdominal muscles that massaged the intestinal wall, aiding
its movements and its circulation. Her diet was well chosen and well prepared,
and her life was happy and inspiring. In contrast to the previous case,
one sees that the environment was very favorable for the maintenance of
a good Survival chemistry.
<p>This case is also interesting in that her husband developed a cancer
of the prostate gland 33 years after his wife was cured. The hospital put
him through surgical and radiological procedures without offering a diagnosis.
Radioactive Cobalt was new then and used vigorously. He quickly suffered
widespread bone metastases and died in great agony. The infectious nature
of the provocation of neoplasia may be inferred from this history, as well
as its conjugal nature. It would have been a helpful observation to remove
the cause of the husband’s cancer with the same reagent that cured his
wife. But the hospital doctors had no guiding information.
<p>Trauma of four parturitions did not re-excite cancer in her and neither
did her exposure to the viral agent that infected her husband. Here is
food for thought.
