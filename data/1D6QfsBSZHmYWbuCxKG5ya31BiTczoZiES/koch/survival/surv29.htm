<p><b><i><font size=+3>SURVIVAL FACTOR IN NEOPLASTIC AND VIRAL DISEASES</font></i></b>
<p>&nbsp;By
<p><b>WILLIAM FREDERICK KOCH, Ph.D., M.D.</b>
<p>
<hr WIDTH="62%">
<p>&nbsp;<b><font size=+2>SUMMARY</font></b></center>

<p>This book has presented and substantiated several new scientific facts
worth noting by the medical and scientific professions:
<p><b>The oxidative separation of the host cell-pathogen integration is
achievable whether the pathogen is a virus, a carcinogen, a bacterial toxin,
or an incompletely burned tissue metabolite. The host cell is left reconstructed
in good functional status <i>in the first instance </i>by the return of
energy to the host cell as the virus is burned away in the reverse sequence
of its synthesis. In the other instances, any reconstruction is compensatory
and not hindered by the presence of scar tissue or toxins.</b>
<p>The Reagent initiates a basic cyclic recovery process, which follows
a reverse pattern from the evolution of the disease state. This recovery
process is a continuing progression, cleaning out the last manifestations
first and the first manifestations last.
<p>The important discovery that suppressed infections buried in old scars,
where hypoxia favors polymerization of germ toxins into toxins of increasing
molecular weight with differing pathogenic properties, cause the manifestation
of different disease states.
<p>The position of the activated amine group, the free radical, the double
bond and the Carbonyl group are significant in pathogenesis and in its
correction.
<p>The place of blockage in energy production and in its acceptance by
functional units, in the cause and the cure of disease.
<p>Proof that the Citric Acid Cycle is not the main process of sugar oxidation,
but that a high efficiency dehydrogenator system exists.
<p>Enhanced explanations for the Pasteur Effect, antimitotic action, and
other Biochemical Puzzles as explained by the functions of the activated
Carbonyl group.
<p>The reversibility of carcinogenesis through the action of the Carbonyl
group.
<p>Affirmation of the KOCH Postulate by evidence showing the conversion
of pathogenic germs into harmless and possibly useful members of the Great
Biological Economy, and the cure of antibiotic resistance germ diseases.
<p><b>Documentation that the</b> <b>identification and synthetic reproduction
of the Survival Factor with sufficient potency has at will and in accord
with the known laws of chemistry, produced cures of viral and neoplastic
diseases.</b>
<p><b>The incorporation of the foregoing principles in case management
provides for the best success in difficult clinical problems, such as far
advanced widely metastasized cancer of the vital organs. Numerous complete
and lasting cures of such cases have been documented through the use of
one or two doses of the SSR Reagent.</b></blockquote>
