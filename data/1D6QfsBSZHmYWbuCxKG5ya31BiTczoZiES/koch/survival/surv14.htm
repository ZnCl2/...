<p>The philosophy of the dominant therapy has been, up to now, to saturate
the patient with as much destructive agent as possible, so as to destroy
the enemy invader without too much injury to the patient. Quinine and Atabrine
in Malaria, and the present-day antibiotics, are examples. So safe concentration
is the logical procedure under this system. This is pharmacology. On the
other hand, the physiological approach has different aims. It is corrective,
restorative and induces the changes it wants. Then, the question becomes
what are the physiological ranges of concentration in which the Remedy
shows best action by actual measurements and careful observation. The question
not only is how dilute must the solution of the Reagent be, but also, how
concentrated dare it be and still retain physiological activity. A look
at the physiological natural reagents that carry activated Carbonyl groups
will show how high nature dilutes them for best action. As a starter, no
better guide could be chosen. Here again, we see that our Postulate, of
nearly half a century of application, is just recently receiving support
from the physiological processes of Nature herself.
<p>A dilution of one part of a Reagent to a trillion of water carries thousands
of billions of molecules in each cubic centimeter. Since only one molecule
is required to start a catalytic action that can grow with geometric progression,
nature is not stingy when she supplies vitamin B<sub>12 </sub>in quantities
so small that they can act normally in concentrations of 1 x 10-(9) or
one part to a billion. Only three micrograms is an effective therapeutic
dose. Only 0.01 millimicrograms gives definite growth response to bacteria.
(U.S. Pharmacopeia Vitamin B<sub>12 </sub>Study Panel). Echinochrome A,
is a naphthaquinone without one double bond carrying a free hydrogen atom.
Its O/R potential is only 0.080 v. This is because the molecule has five
hydroxyl substituents where hydrogen instead would have raised the potential
0.3 v. higher. Still, it is active in inducing motion in Sea Urchin eggs
in dilutions of l:2x10-(9) (Fieser, 1944 Edition, page 753). Crocin belongs
to the carotenoid family and presents two terminal Carbonyl groups conjugated
with ethylene linkages, a chain of seven, with four methyl substituents.
The Carbonyl groups are part of the terminal Carboxyl groups that have
each been esterified with gentiobiose. It is active in the highest dilutions
as demonstrated by Kuhn and Kuhn and Moewus — (1938-1940). Only one molecule
is required to determine sex activity in the C. augamentos F. simplex and
Chlarnydomonas genus of algae. Thus the dilutions may be higher than one
part to a trillion of water, and Prof. Gilbert Smith, in 1947, reported
the production of motility in certain plant sex cells by use of only one
part of this reagent to 250,000,000,000 parts of water. Heparin is active
in suspending blood coagulation in amounts so minute that there is no method
to detect its presence (Fieser — p. 487 — 1944 Edition), and acetyl choline
(Karrer — p. 239 — 1947 Edition), is able to renew suspended contractions
in the intestinal muscle of the surviving guinea pigs in a dilution of
one part to 1,000,000,000 parts of water. Since biological reactions are
so much more refined than laboratory manipulations, one cannot judge physiological
activity by chemical detection or measurements. Likewise, clinical results
are not to be predicted by the swing of a chemical balance. One thing must
be observed, however, and that is when high dilutions are used, freedom
from interfering reagents or measures are imperative, the work must be
more careful and scientific, than when crude work is being done on a mass-action
scale.

<br>The chemistry of the free radical and mesomeric electron displacements
will give biochemistry a different hue from the conceptions of the pharmacology
laboratory that have controlled up to this time. The dosage and dilution
are matters of expert decision, based on experience and enlightenment,
not upon prejudice or superstition.
<p>Following the 1955 and 1958 editions of this book, some eminent biochemists
such as Szent Gyorgyi, have expressed opinions supportive to our basic
philosophy with regard to the position of the free radical (lone electron)
in carcinogenesis and other biochemical fields. This is indeed a gratifying
advance over the dominant approach, and its correctness has already been
established for decades as our text demonstrates.
<p>See Appendix III, for further confirmation of the double bond and free
radical phenomena concerned in pathogenesis and its correction.
