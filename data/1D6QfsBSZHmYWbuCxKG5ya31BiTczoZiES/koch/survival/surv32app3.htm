<center><b><font size=+2>Appendix III</font></b></center>

<p>A variety of cases with fuller discussion than <b>Case I</b>, the exophthalmic
goitre case, showed how the basic pathology was the block in energy production
and utilization in the functional mechanism. The Carbonyl group of function
was combined with the pathogen or its activating double bonds; it could
neither dehydrogenate nor form an azomethine bridge for energy passage
in frank infection, allergy or neoplasia. Many conditions that were observed
to support our Thesis, were not touched upon. So to make the report more
complete we will show how the two obvious metabolic disturbances, epilepsy
and sugar diabetes, also conform to the same pattern.
<p><b>DIABETES</b>
<p>In this disorder, which is a symptom of a number of diseases, there
is the suppression of function of the islets of Langerhans, even though
microscopically the cells may appear normal in number and structure. They
may be diseases that destroy the islets and thus cause failure of insulin
production. But in the vast majority of cases the trouble is functional
and correctable in line with our Postulate. Enough clinical proofs were
given before the Federal Court and the Federal Trade Commission to establish
this fact. Two recent cases are presented here to illustrate two facts,
which explain two different forms of response. In one, the high blood sugar
was reduced to below normal indicating that new islets of Langerhans were
formed to compensate for the loss of insulin. But even these were blocked
by the inhibitor toxin, and when they were all liberated, there was an
excess of insulin poured into the blood. The other extreme is the reduction
of the high blood sugar slowly and gradually, showing that the islets were
deficient in number and had to be repaired or increased to accommodate
the demand for their product. In both, the general health was restored
and thus the basic or constitutional cause was removed. In both the high
protein diet was changed for an unrestricted carbohydrate diet of fruits,
vegetables, cereals, bread, fats, honey and molasses. No proteins of animal
origin were allowed and coffee, tea, alcohol and tobacco were forbidden.
No insulin or other anti-diabetic drugs are given; the patient is
left under the influence of a returning islet function as its cells are
liberated from the paralyzing toxin. The blood sugar then comes toward
normal as fast as the islet cells are relieved. Sometimes the blood sugar
goes below normal as the compensatory hyperplasia of islet cells are also
liberated from the toxin and go to work. Where the toxin has been integrated
with the islet cells longer than the life cycle period of any of these
cells, they naturally die off and are not replaced and so a deficit of
islet tissue is observed in the blood sugar level that is above normal
after all of the toxin is removed. To replace these islet cells takes time,
as we will show by cases examined at this particular period. One must remember
that the islet tissue produces insulin and hence no great deficit of this
material is ever present in normal islet cells to stimulate a compensatory
hyperplasia as occurs in muscle cells that are exhausted by work and call
for more tissue reconstruction.
<p>Therefore compensatory hyperplasia in islet tissue is comparatively
slow and the time to reach the usual normal level varies with the length
of time the diabetogenic poison had been active. The recovery of the islets
from the integrated toxin that had simply inhibited their function is rather
rapid, and is accompanied by systemic reaction in which the tissues are
generally cleared of toxic effects. The overweight and weakness is soon
overcome and other disturbances leave, — allergies, etc. The recovery of
the destroyed and deficient islets to a normal quota is slow as was just
explained. However, the whole picture of diabetes changes with this exposition.
These cases again show that the work of the SSR is to start an oxidation
progression in the toxin that is integrated with the tissue cell and blocking
its function. The difference between such a toxin integration and the viral
integration will be seen by comparing the recoveries of diabetics with
paralytic nerve infections in which paralytic dog distemper, Chapter 17,
serves as a good example.
<p>The cases submitted here are only to show that the SSR is not a substitute
for insulin in the oxidation of sugar but is given to remove the pathogen
that blocks the production of insulin.
<p><b>I. Case of Sr. L. S.</b>, 53 years old
<br>Dr. Jayme Treiger
<p>He had a rich venereal past, malaria at 21 years of age, and was operated
for varices in 1941. He complained of vertigo, edema of the lower extremities,
grade 2, small varicosities. Aorta palpable, Fundus oculi, — veins with
second grade manifestations (Wagner), Blood pressure *24/13, Pulse 96,
Glycemia 112 mgm %, was placed on hyposodic diet, did not tolerate CIK,
received Clortiazamide because of the edema. This reduced his blood
pressure to 20/10, 18.5/11, and 2 1/11 with vertigo.
<p>On January 19, 1960, there was dyspnoea and B.P. 20/11. On February
14, B.P. 22/12, pulse 84. Rauwolfia, Clortiazamide, Naturetin K, Mecanil,
were given, April 10. On May 16, vertigo, tachycardia, and dyspnoea, after
lying down, B.P. 25/13, pulse 90/m received more energetic hypertensive
drugs and Alcachofre tincture, B.P. 22/11, pulse 84. On August 18,
epistaxis, B.P. 26/12, dyspnoea, — Reserpine, Alcachofra, weight 85 kgms.
Constrictive feeling in the neck,
<i>Blood sugar 320 mgms. %</i>, Urea
normal.
<p>Treatment was given on September 24th, 1960, only a few drops intramuscularly
of the serial system of Carbonyl groups, one-tenth of a microgram. He had
a reaction on the next day; the edema and constrictive feeling in the neck
disappeared quickly and three weeks after the Treatment he felt very well.
Weight 82 kilos, blood pressure 17/10. <i>Blood sugar 75 mgms. </i>%. He
has remained in good health. The clearing up of the basic cause is evident
in the normalization of the other evidences of disease, to which the diabetes
was part and parcel. “All anti-diabetic drugs including insulin were stopped
before the SSR was given.”
<p><b>II. Case of Sra. M.P.</b> 51 years of age, was given the same dose
of the SSR within the same hour as the preceding case, so as to facilitate
comparisons chronologically in their recovery processes — the depth of
the pathogenesis with the recovery rate.
<p>She had been diabetic since 1955, but was first seen by Dr. Treiger
on August 24, 1959. The first complaints were articular pains, thirst and
excess weight, 95.6 kgms., height 1.58 meters, blood pressure 17.5/9, edema
grade 2 in both feet. Glycemia Aug. 1959, 240 mgms. %. Folin-Wu. Urine
S.G.1.036, glucose 4x. As she did not accept very well the new anti-glycemiant,
Diabenase, she started to receive insulin and Protamin during the whole
of 1959 and 1960. But the blood sugar stayed always at higher than normal
levels even though the insulin was taken always with 40 U PZI, running
generally around 220 and 240. In June 1960, the <i>blood sugar was 340
mgms. </i>%, while receiving 60 U PZI, and by September 15, it rose to
<i>398
mgms. </i>% while receiving 60 U PZI. Before being given the SSR, she was
taken off of insulin completely and all medication was stopped.
<p>Treatment --- On September 24th, 1960, her weight was 94.5 kilos. She
was given a few drops of the same solution as the other case. In five days
the sugar dropped to 210 mgms. %. In two months her weight dropped to 89.5
kilos even though she was taken off of proteins and given a liberal vegetable,
fruit, cereal diet. The edema of the legs was leaving within a week of
the Treatment, and she had a splendid reaction of a few days of fever
and aching in her legs and bones generally. Her whole health aspect changed
for the better. The blood sugar on November 30, 1960 was 160 mgms. %, and
she is taking no insulin or other drugs. Her appetite is good and she feels
the best she has ever felt. The blood sugar is not expected to reach normal
until islet tissue is reconstructed to normal. It is expected that this
will require from three to six months.
<p>One would ordinarily think that the rich carbohydrate diet after the
Treatment would precipitate a sugar crisis. However, the relief of
the islet cells was fast enough to prevent that as these cases show. Further
our diet regime that cuts out animal proteins also reduces the production
of the pathogen in the bowel.<i> It will be seen that the whole aspect
of diabetes comes up in a new light, as these and so many other cases show.
Reduction of the blood sugar as observed in these cases of diabetes while
on a non-protein, high carbohydrate, liberal diet, without taking insulin
has but one interpretation and that is the islets have again resumed their
function.</i> <i>In other words, the inhibitant has been removed</i>. How
rapidly injured islets can be restored depends upon the situation at hand,
and the management of the case is directed accordingly, including the withdrawal
of insulin. Epilepsy is definitely a metabolic disorder that may be subject
to the same corrective Therapy as the following case shows.
<p><i>It must be emphasized sufficiently that while severe diabetes can
recover after the SSR is given, this recovery is part and parcel to the
removal of the pathogen and its effects generally. </i>Moreover, while
in an early mild case the islet cells can be liberated from their integrated
toxin so as to fully restore islet function, in the long standing heavily
intoxicated cases, the islet cells that remain as functional structures
may be reduced in number and the blood sugar will not return to normal
until more islet cells are reconstructed. The amount of reconstruction
required in such cases will be proportionate to the length and severity
of the toxic period of injury. A few more cases should be scanned to observe
these points in their varying aspects.
<p>The toxic injury may be dominantly cardiovascular.
<p><b>III. J.M.</b>, age 61 years in June 1960. She complained of pains
in the limbs, dyspnoea after effort, constant cough, precordial pains intermittently,
edema of the right ankle, and cholecystectomatized because of lithiasis.
Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 170/90; pulse 90; systolic
murmur at A2; fundus oculi, hypertensive angiosclerotic retinopathy, grade
2; KWV, urine with traces of sugar. She was first given homeopathic remedies
with improvement in the blood pressure. On 8/16/60 her B.P. was 140/80,
but there was no improvement in the pains in the chest or limbs. Salicylates
were given. On 9/14/60, glycemia was 190 mgms %. She was given a dose of
the SSR and no other medication was given. She was given a rich carbohydrate
diet and all animal foods denied. On 11/14/60, glycemia was 145 mgms %.
On 12/2/60, glycemia 100 mgms % and she was entirely symptom free. Her
blood pressure was normal. All the conditions cleared up at the same time
on the unrestricted fruit, vegetable and cereal diet.
<p>The toxic injury may be dominantly those of an old focal infection with
allergic symptoms and lack of tolerance to anti-diabetic drugs and a failure
of large doses of insulin to reduce the blood sugar notably with loss of
resistance to infection.
<p>In these cases the disappearance of all toxic effects comes quickly
and the blood sugar drops to a level (without medication and on an unrestricted
carbohydrate diet without animal foods) to a point that indicates how much
of the islet tissue still remains undestroyed by the pathogen. Then the
reconstruction of islet tissue goes on slowly as was shown above,
and the rate will depend on the length of time the pathogen was active.
In this way one illustrates that the SSR is a liberator of the functional
mechanism, restoring it to normal action on a broad or maybe on all functional
planes and not simply an agent to oxidize sugar<i>. It demonstrates itself
to be an oxidizer of all integrated toxins, we have investigated so
far, with the widest possible symptomatology.</i> The following two
cases are selected to illustrate a variety of tissue injuries that a diabetes-producing
toxin can cause and the degree to which the islet tissue may be paralyzed
and also destroyed.
<p><b>IV. Mrs. P. S</b>., age 50, in August 1956, started with diabetic
symptoms after a hysterectomy. Her blood sugar was found to be 430 mgms
%<i>. </i>With insulin it came down to 173 mgms %. After August 1956, she
did fairly well, using Insulin 20 U, and Nadisan, 3 tablets daily. After
May 1958, she started taking Diabenase in varying amounts. On September
2, 1959, her blood sugar was 195 mgms %.<b> </b>In November 1959, it was
240 mgms %. In January 1960, the blood sugar was 300 mgms % with Rastonin,
2 daily. It stayed about the same until August when Rastonin had become
intolerable due to toxic effects and was stopped on September 29, 1960.
Her blood sugar was 325 mgms <b>%. </b>On October 4, 1960, she was given
the SSR. She had a strong reaction on the third day that lasted a week
with general achiness, fever, chills, etc. The reaction focalized as a
heavy inflammation about an old tooth root, which opened and cleaned out
with a good hemorrhage and then cleared up. Her weight dropped from 75
to 66 kilos by the middle of December, 1960, her blood sugar was 260 mgms
% and she felt very well without any anti-diabetic medication, and on a
diet of unlimited carbohydrates and fats and without animal proteins. This
improvement is expected to follow the pattern of other cases with decrease
in the blood sugar as fast as islet tissue is restored. At this stage the
case differentiates between inactivation and destruction of islet cells.
<p><b>V. Mrs. G. S</b>., age 38, in October, 1958, showed a different type
of toxicity in which she could not use insulin without toxic injury and
she was unable to heal any wound or furuncle. This all cleared up concomitant
with the correction of the injury to the pancreas. In this case as in the
former case a strong systemic reaction ushered in the improvement. The
insulin poisoning showed as an ecchymosis and general itchiness and rheumatic
symptoms.
<p>She was diagnosed as diabetic in 1957 since the wound from a Cholecystectomy
done 2 years earlier would not heal and the blood sugar was 248 mgms %<i>.</i>
She was given classical treatment and diet like the rest, first 40 U PZI,
then 60 U, then 70 U, and then 80 U on November 6, 1959, as the blood sugar
increased to 440 mgms %. On 80 U daily, it dropped to 300 mgms %, but ecchymosis
and itching resulted. Two months later she presented an eruption similar
to the leutic roseola, but the blood tests were all negative for syphilis.
The insulin was reduced to 50 U, PZI, and was fortified with Rastonin,
2 tablets daily. The blood sugar was 380 mgms % on August 18, 1960, and
she was put on Diabinese, 2 tablets and then 1 tablet per day when the
blood sugar rose to 394 mgms %, September 17, 1960. She was given the SSR
on October 19, 1960, with one Diabinese tablet and the blood sugar jumped
to 360 mgms %, as part of a strong reaction. The Diabinese was stopped
and a half dose of the SSR was given on November 18, 1960. On December
13, 1960, she was feeling very well, her furuncle healed without help,
and the blood sugar was 265 mgms % on an unrestricted carbohydrate diet
without any medication or animal proteins. The break in the Survival chemistry
showed in more than one direction in this case, and showed not only a paralysis
of the islet cells, but their actual destruction which is not yet fully
repaired. The job of repairing the islets is not a function of the SSR,
but is made possible by the removal of the toxin that was integrated with
the islet cells and destroyed them. With this toxin out of the way reconstruction
can take place as in other cases.
<p><i>That the pattern of integration of the inhibiting toxin with the
FCG is the same in islet cell block, as it is in the hindrance of other
cell functions, has been thoroughly demonstrated already. Moreover, no
matter how symptomatology of nerve</i> <i>cell hindrance may vary, the
architecture of the block is the same. The severity of the symptoms does
not determine the length of time required for recovery, but the length
of time the tissue has been occupied by the pathogen does determine the
time required for restoration to normal.</i>
<p>Another case must be sketched in brief to illustrate this point and
to show that sleep is an active function involving energy generation and
use. This case could not use the energy because of FCG block. There was
also an islet block of moderate degree, the blood sugar being only 161
mgms <b>%.</b>
<p><b>VI. Mrs. M. S</b>., age 42 years, came to Dr. Treiger in December
1960, in a highly nervous state. She was without thyroid symptoms, complained
of utter inability to sleep for over six months and had been placed on
the whole list of depressant drugs by different specialists. These drugs
did not help her in the least, but even as their dosage was increased to
the limit of her tolerance, she became steadily worse. She developed into
a melancholia with a compulsion that she wished to die becoming ever constant.
She was in terror and could stand it no longer. Dr. Treiger removed all
drugs and the condition remained the same, fat and all, presenting a perfect
homeopathic picture of treatment with Alum. He gave her Alum in carefully
selected potencies, but it had no effect. He then gave her 2 millimicrograms
of the SSR intramuscularly. At the time of Treatment, the blood sugar
was 161 mgms %.<b> </b>The change for the better was rapid so that her
whole physical status improved, the high excitement state left and she
calmed down so that in less than a month she was sleeping soundly three
nights a week, and the other nights were improving steadily. The desire
to die faded away and the melancholia changed to a habitual cheerfulness.
The blood sugar dropped to 100 mgms % within the month while on a meatless,
high carbohydrate, honey, molasses diet. Here the clinical facts teach
something that laboratory research has not fully settled about the physiology
of sleep and its functional mechanism, namely that energy production and
utilization are essential features and that the Carbonyl group is concerned
in mediating both features of the function just as in any other tissue
function, islet cells, thyroid cells and all the rest.
<p><b>VII. </b>It is pretty well demonstrated now that the SSR does not
do the work of the insulin, but removes the disease. This is seen in Varicella,
a viral disease with a natural collateral control. Two brothers are concerned.
M. M. P., age 11 years, had fever and Varicella. The SSR was given to him
on 12/3/60. The next day the fever increased to 39&deg;C. On 12/5/60, the
second day after Treatment, the pustules stopped coming and all of the
lesions started to improve. He was feeling well and in a few days was all
healed. His brother, age 6 years, refused the injection when he developed
Varicella on Dec. 15, 1960. Four days later, 12/19/60, the Varicella showed
the classical development with new pustules coming in waves. He ultimately
got well, but the involution did not start within 48 hours as in the SSR
treated case, but was still developing in the classical fashion as is usual
for days afterwards.
<p>To further define the position of the Functional Carbonyl Group and
its activating double bonds of the Koch Postulate a review of a case of
antibiotic resistant Gonococcus infection will help.
<p><b>VIII. Mr. J. V</b>., age 25 years, presented an annual venereal infection.
Finally the antibiotics were not effective and he did not do well on homeopathic
drugs either. On August 28, 1959, after an additional exposure, he presented
an acute Blennorrhagia confirmed by bacteriological examinations. He was
energetically treated with Penicillin, Terramycin and Tetracycline without
the least effect. On October 23, 1959, he was given a dose of Benzoquinone,
6X dilution, when the bacteriological examination showed the infection
was the same, a rich flow of intracellular and extracellular Gonococci
laden pus. Examination one week later showed no improvement so he was given
a dose of the SSR, 9X dilution on October 31, 1959. One week later, November
7th, he was feeling much better, including the prostate pain that had disturbed
the passage of feces through the rectum. On the 9th day he had a reaction
and on the 16th the urinary sediment still showed some intracellular diplococci.
He was given a dose of the SSR, lOX, one-tenth as much as the former dose,
on the 16th of December 1959. Three days later no more intracellular diplococci
were found in the urinary sediment, but some extracellular germs were still
present. Three weeks later he had a general systemic reaction of grippiness.
He felt well thereafter, but there were still extracellular diplococci
until the middle of March 1960, when the dose was again repeated. Ten days
later a systemic reaction occurred and no more secretion was to be found.
His health improved in every way. On May 30, 1960, the urinary sediment
still showed some extracellular pleomorphic germs.
<p>On June 7, 1960, he showed a gain of 10 kilos in weight, the best of
health, no longer any signs or symptoms of the old or lasting infections,
the prostate was normal and the urinary sediment entirely negative. He
has so remained.
<p>Here we see the hangover of the earlier Gonococci infection as extracellular
diplococci that required three injections of the SSR and six months to
be cleared away after the acute infection was gone. <i>This shows also
that the SSR is not an antibiotic affair at all, but works on an entirely
different principle. </i>This point must be emphasized here. <i>This final
review shows that viral infections, which do not respond to antibiotics,
are correctable immediately by the high potency dehydrogenations secured
by the SSR and the free radical and peroxide free radical carriers of the
oxidations that continue the separation of the pathogen from the host cell’s
functional mechanism.</i>
<p>In the proceeding diabetes cases, it was shown that the longer the pathogen
is integrated with the islet cells — not only is the inhibition of function
proportional, but the amount of destruction of islet cells is also proportional.
This is not a similar destruction to that which accompanies viral host
cell integration, but one that blocks the formation of new islet cells
after the integration is established a long time, longer than the life
of the islet cell would be. Then no reproduction would take place in such
cells and the amount of islet tissue would decrease. In viral integration
there is the active destruction of the host cell as its energy is drawn
off by the parasite and its structural material is also removed to support
the viral vegetation. However, we have demonstrated in paralytic viral
infections, that the toxin is destroyed when the virus undergoes a step-by-step
removal by the oxidation process leaving a fully restored tissue cell once
the virus is fully burned away. Reconstruction in diabetes recovery must
be carried forward by the liberated cells and, as there is no utilization
or depletion of insulin in the islet cells themselves, the shock for a
compensatory hypertrophy is very weak as compared with that taking place
in muscle when put under increased activity. Here the muscle fibrillae
that do the hypertrophying are directly stimulated by work, while the stimulus
to the islet cells is mostly a lowered partial pressure of the insulin
at the cell’s periphery and possibly some hormonal influence, if such exists.
Therefore the restoration of islet cells is a slow process that succeeds
only with time.
<center>
<p><img SRC="32002.jpg"></center>

<p>The contrast can be seen in the case of paralytic Distemper in a dog.
In such a case there is no chance to error by way of hysteria. In this
case within two weeks a full restoration of nerve function was re-established,
whereas in diabetes, the islet reconstruction goes on for months before
it is completed. Only the toxic inhibition of function is removed in weeks
or rather a few months.
<p><b>IX. Singo</b>, a 10-year-old pointer dog, one month before receiving
the SSR Treatment, became sad and trembling. He ran away and returned with
bowel and urinary bladder paralysis. He was lavaged and received Nujol
that helped the bowel movements. He also received Penicillin, Alcachofra,
Terramycin, etc., which was prescribed by the veterinarian who made the
diagnosis of distemper of the nervous system since there were chills, fever,
then a lowering of the temperature with paralysis of the muscles of the
left costal region, causing a curve of the spine and difficult breathing.
These muscles also showed atrophy. There was also a paralysis of the left
posterior quarter so that the leg would give no support and he could not
use the paw, raise or lower it. The photographs show his condition before
and after Treatment. Photographs 1-3 show this paralysis of the left posterior
quarter when the dog is supported by his upper half and the right foot
posterior is allowed to take some pressure for his support. The left posterior
quarter was useless. The muscles of this limb were also atrophied. As none
of the medication helped, he was given two ampoules of the Cinamose serum.
It did not help him either. The integration of the virus with the nerve
cells was thus established in a symbiotic way.
<p>The SSR was given October 14, 1960, to save the dog, as the veterinarian
decided he must be sacrificed. The recovery took two weeks to be completed.
The atrophied muscles soon became redeveloped and full normalcy was established.
<p><b>EPILEPSY</b>
<p><b>I.</b> Under the heading of “Allergies Of The Nervous System”, we
gave a case of Psychomotor Epilepsy. This patient had taken thousands of
dollars worth of suppressing drugs without suppression and steadily went
on toward fatality. At the time that the experts agreed he could not live
more than a few weeks, he was given two micrograms of Parabenzoquinone
in two milliliters of water intramuscularly and was sent home as cured
in five days. The experts who decided he was cured are the same men who
gave the fatal prognosis after months of unsuccessful drugging. This was
in 1941, at the famous government mental disease hospital of Rio de Janeiro.
The Reagent that freed the tissues of their energy-producing and energy-utilizing
impediment was a Carbonyl group activated by conjugation with the double
bonds of an ethylene linkage. In the case to be given here, the Reagent
carried a series of Carbonyl groups that contributed electrons to the Carbonyl
group that did the dehydrogenating and thus started the oxidative removal
of the pathogen. The following case also shows the constitutional nature
of the disease.
<p><b>II. E. A.</b>, 17 years old, first seen on August 13, 1958, had Diphtheria
in childhood. Started periods of petit mal with loss of consciousness
in crises of from 5 to 10 minutes, getting more frequent, once or twice
monthly, without convulsions. He suffered severe headaches since childhood.
Blood pressure 14/5 cms. of mercury, Systolic murmur, grade 3 at apex,
2 cms., outside of the left mid-clavicular line 5th interspace also a diastolic
murmur grade 1, at the same place. Pulse 86 per minute. There was a diagnosis
also of persistence of the Ductus Arteriosus.
<p>The Electro-encephalogram on August 22, 1958, showed:
<p>“The basic sequence is several times disturbed by the interference of
abrupt and irregular slow waves with 6-7, 5 c/s. of high voltage, diffuse
and bilateral, predominating in the frontal-temporal areas. The hyperphase
did not reveal any new fact.”
<p>“Conclusion: Abnormal electro-encephalogram, paroxistic cerebral Dysrythmia,
diffuse and bilateral, predominating in the frontal-temporal areas.”
<p>“Signed, Dr. A. A. G.”
<p>Thereafter the boy was kept from work because of the losses of consciousness
that occurred while under the regular treatment receiving constant doses
of Trilafen and Mezantoine. The blood pressure came to normal levels, but
recurred at times with the crises of loss of consciousness. Since December
1959, the epileptic attacks became more frequent in spite of regular doses
of Mezantoine, Equanil and Promazionon.
<p>In June 1960, this treatment was interrupted so that the SSR could be
given.
<p>Results --- After three weeks there were no more attacks, sleeps well,
eats well, is no longer tired and without headaches. The Electro-encephalogram
was repeated by the same expert. The report was dated, September 30, 1960:
<p>“Electro-encephalogram presents no evidence of abnormality.”
<p>The patient is ready to go back to work but this will be deferred until
the EEG is repeated after a couple more months. However, it is established
that normal function has returned, and the energy production and use is
not interfered with any more. In these cases two different means of activating
the dehydrogenator Carbonyl group were used. Hence the correction of the
pathology depends upon adequate dehydrogenation in the presence of molecular
oxygen. The correction is constitutional evidently here too.
<p><b>LATE REPORT ON MRS. M. H.</b>
<br>Case No. 49
<p>To demonstrate the permanency of the cure of Tuberculosis by restoring
the cell functional mechanism, we give Dr. Paul V. O’Rourke’s description
of the status of both lungs which was made on August 1, 1960 from the latest
X-Rays. This leading Roentgenologist states:
<p>“Mrs. M. H.---- was seen by me on July 1, 1960. Her chest X-Ray at that
time showed the bony thorax to be intact, with the heart in normal position
and contour. The left hemidiaphragm is normal in position and contour.
The right hemidiaphragm is elevated because of a Phrenic nerve paralysis
done some 30 years ago. The left lung showed some increased markings, most
of which are vascular, and a small amount of calcific deposits. The right
lung is greatly reduced in volume because of the extreme elevation of the
right hemidiaphragm to the level of the third anterior rib. At the
extreme apex, there are numerous small-calcified areas, which are the result,
undoubtedly, of her previous tuberculosis of some thirty years ago. No
active lesion of tuberculosis or rarefactions resembling cavities can be
seen.”
<p>Mrs. M. H. was treated in the terminal stage of this disease and at
a time when her state of exhaustion was so desperate that even taking a
radiograph would not be risked.
<p>This recovery was obtained while at work after the active attack was
subdued by the SSR and a few weeks of bed rest until the fever abated.
It speaks for the curing of the tuberculosis germ and the ability of her
metabolism to keep tuberculosis germs cured, and harmless, even perhaps
useful.
<p><b>EXERCISE AND REST</b>
<p>Enough exercise to fatigue the muscles a little each day is wise, but
the heart must not be pushed too hard during such diversion. Walking on
level ground serves well and there are plenty of games that stimulate the
spirits as well as the muscles that are helpful. Common sense is the guide.
As for quality sleeping, a neat bed with the patient laid out like a mummy
is an atrocity. There must be freedom so that relaxation is possible. Stupid
bed provisions call for narcotics, and narcotics defeat recovery. Such
care must be avoided with our patients.</blockquote>
