      <p><b><font size="+2">VIRUS AND CANCER CELLS</font></b></p>
    </center>
    <blockquote>Cancer cells and viruses are both parasites; that is
      they have to depend upon sources of energy and material that
      belong to other usages to conduct their characteristic activities.
      The virus cannot produce the energy it needs for its vital
      processes, so it gives signs of life only so long as it is
      integrated with a living source of energy and food which it
      diverts to its own ends. The cell it preys upon, the Host Cell, is
      killed thereby. The cancer cell is not able to perform the
      functions it was created to do for itself or any of the other
      cells of the body to which it belongs and is responsible. It has
      lost its capacity to conduct oxidations, and also the mechanisms
      that use the energy of oxidation for useful work. Instead a
      low-grade process, wasteful fermentation, is used to produce
      energy. This energy is transferred to the mitotic mechanism, where
      it forces cell division, as it has no functional mechanism to use
      it where its production is normally controlled by the demand for
      the function. The mitotic mechanism thus becomes parasitic upon
      the rest of the cell and the body as a whole<b>.</b>
      <p>Viruses may cause normal cells to go neoplastic; maybe all
        cancers require them. Several hundred synthetic substances are
        known to cause cancer. It has not yet been decided if or not
        viruses play a part here, too, but many cancerologists think so.
        It will be seen how the synthetic carcinogen may prepare the way
        for the virus to integrate with the mitotic mechanism and
        complete the neoplastic change. </p>
      <p>The institution of parasitism within a cell, be it viral or
        neoplastic, is a complex affair that depends upon a disposing
        cause besides the particular virtues of the pathogen to show its
        specific action. Of these anoxia or hypoxia is a leading factor.
        With plenty of oxygen available as normal structure determines,
        there would be no pathology if the oxidation catalysis were
        adequate, and logically enough, it happens that an adequate
        oxidation catalysis prevents oxygen deficiency in any tissue.
        This fact will become apparent as we go along. So the key to the
        correction will be seen to be the restoration or provision of an
        adequate oxidation catalysis. The initiating act in the
        oxidation process, namely, dehydrogenation is a main subject of
        this book. Then there is the subject of the environmental
        factors that have contributed to the block in the oxidation
        catalysis. These are discussed also in the hope that a good
        working picture of the matter is at hand. </p>
      <p><b>NATURE OF VIRUSES</b> </p>
      <p>The electronic microscope and bacteriophage studies have
        yielded rich information on this score. Their sizes vary from 8
        millimicra, the size of a protein molecule, to 175 millimicra,
        the size of the smallest bacteria. Each type has its own shape
        and these vary from rod to spherule in form. The essential
        structure is a protein capsule within which lies a nucleoprotein
        mass. </p>
      <p>They are specifically cytotropic obligative parasites and
        always pathogenic.The protein capsule has specific antigenic
        powers that yield specific immunological responses, and
        serological reactions. The latter, for example, serve the
        differential diagnosis of non-paralytic Polio from La Grippe and
        other viral infections. This is the part that is convertible
        into a vaccine used to excite immunological reactions in the
        patient. There is no immunological response to the nucleoprotein
        part though this is the part that causes the pathology. The
        protein capsule protects the inner part and carries it to the
        cell where it attaches to its outer surface and injects the
        nucleoprotein content into its victim. An acquired immunity
        inactivates the capsule and prevents the attachment to and hence
        the penetration of the host cell. As soon as the material is
        injected, it breaks up into a myriad of similar units of
        nucleoprotein as by a de-polymerization process, and each
        particle unites chemically with a nucleoprotein particle of the
        host cell, and thus integrates or becomes one with it as by a
        co-polymerization act. The host cell particles with which they
        integrate are the “grana” that perform the vital functions of
        the cell and produce the necessary energy thereto by oxidation.
        As the virus shunts this energy into itself and uses it with
        host cell material for its vegetation, the host cell grana break
        down and are used up to form the viral colony, which is soon a
        mass of provirus ready to mature and break forth from the dead
        host cell as infectious parasites. </p>
      <p>It is the consensus among experts that once the nucleoprotein
        of the virus has penetrated, integration with the host cell is
        complete within a minute and a half and no amount of vaccine,
        antitoxin, or other serological effort can separate the virus
        and rescue the host cell. It is doomed. <i>On the other hand,
          we will show how the bondings we Postulate as forming the
          integration actually invite oxidative cleavage in a way that
          leaves the host cell in good functional status while the virus
          is no longer to be found. In this process, the energy taken
          from the host cell to serve viral vegetation is returned to it
          to support its reconstruction, while the virus undergoes a
          stepwise oxidation. </i>This explanation is based on the
        repeatedly observed fact in the cure of rabies, that when the
        Reagent is given to promote the oxidative destruction of the
        virus, in an animal that has only maybe 12 to 24 hours to live,
        a period of 72 to 84 hours are required for the paralyzed victim
        to be free of paralysis and the affected nerves to be
        functioning normally. We have proved this restoration not only
        in terminal rabies, but also in paralytic dog distemper,
        paralytic hog cholera, and paralytic Anterior Poliomyelitis. <i>The
          same chemical corrective measure was used in all and fit the
          pathology in all. This is taken to mean that the state of
          integration of the host cell and the virus presents the same
          atomic bondings in all instances. The same corrective attack
          was employed in the sensory nerve atrophies with loss of
          function and in neoplastic disease with success, so it is
          concluded, that the state of integration of the host cell and
          the pathogen is of the same order in all, and a Least Common
          Denominator in pathogenesis and its correction has been
          established in a broad field.</i> </p>
      <p>Though the atomic bondings that constitute the integrations are
        of the same order, the states of integration vary. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Thus in “Polio” an acute lytic type causes the death of the
        host cell in hours or days as a rule, while a prolonged
        symbiotic type may cause extensive paralysis and atrophy that
        invalids the patient for many years or until death. And yet the
        host cell is not dead, but as its energy producing mechanism is
        paralyzed by the integration with the virus, it cannot function
        any more than a dead cell and the results appear the same. We
        have found by trial, however, that such cases can be freed of
        their offending virus and the host nerve cell returns to normal
        in function and so the atrophied muscles again get impulses to
        contract and rebuild themselves. Cases that were extensively
        paralyzed and atrophied for three years have required three
        months to be restored to 95% or more of normal in function and
        muscle reconstruction, while a case extensively paralyzed and
        atrophied for over twenty years has required two years to be
        restored to 95% of normal, functionally and structurally. Since
        nerve cells do not reproduce, the cleavage of the integration is
        proven by these tests. Since the lytic type of infection only
        takes days or only hours to kill the host cell, the quicker the
        patient is treated the better the chance to have living cells
        freed from their viruses, and get complete recoveries. The case
        records illustrate these situations. </p>

      </center>
      <p>In neoplasia the integration of the virus or synthetic pathogen
        or bacterial toxin with the host cell is originally with the
        functional grana energy producing mechanism, until the latter is
        destroyed in building up the virus and nuclear material
        integrated with it and undergoing mitosis. This is the only
        mechanism left to accept energy produced by an uncontrolled
        process of fermentation, and so neoplasia is the expected
        result. The details will be discussed later, where it will be
        seen that the Carbonyl groups that institute energy production
        and storage as ATP, and creatine phosphoric acid, are like those
        that mediate the transfer of this energy to the working
        mechanism and both are paralyzed by condensation with firmly
        binding amines, of virus or other carcinogens. The virus bound
        in the atrophic muscle of “Polio” we picture as similarly
        integrated. The integrations may exist long periods before
        actual destruction of the paralyzed functional mechanism is
        accomplished and, during this period, liberation of the cell
        from the pathogen can restore it to normal. For a period the
        pathogenesis is reversible therefore in viral infections and the
        same holds for cancer. This situation is exemplified in the
        microphotographs (A) and (B). </p>

      <p><b>VACCINE PROBLEMS</b> </p>
      <p>From what was stated so far it is seen that vaccines for a
        specific virus do not immunize against the nucleoprotein that is
        the actual pathogen, especially after it has penetrated and
        integrated with the host cell, so to talk about curing cancer
        with vaccines or immune sera is a waste of time. Even the
        prevention of viral infection by vaccines is meeting the
        strongest statistical opposition since large-scale smallpox and
        Salk vaccinations have been recorded. In line with what is known
        about vaccine structure, statistics appear logical when they
        show that paralytic “Polio” is increased both in incidence and
        fatality by use of the vaccine. One may compare various regions
        of different climatic conditions for the data. In all of these
        the Salk Vaccine was enthusiastically applied, in greater number
        each year, and the incidence increase was tremendous each year,
        whereas, if the vaccine were effective there should have been at
        least a little statistical improvement. In Montreal, generally
        cool, they reported on August 27, 1959, 521 cases with 27
        deaths, just while the “Polio” season was getting well under
        way, as compared with less than one hundred in 1958. In Ottawa,
        generally cool, 455 cases with 41 deaths were reported on August
        22, 1959, as compared with 64 cases with 7 deaths in 1958. In
        all of Canada, even before the epidemic started to decline,
        there were 7 times more paralytic cases in 1959 than in 1958,
        with a greater death rate. In Detroit, much warmer, where
        vaccination was thorough, the number of cases in 1958 was 697,
        against 226 in 1957. In the District of Columbia, still warmer,
        the Health Department reported 7 times as many cases in 1958 as
        in 1957. In New Jersey, in 1958, the Health Department reported
        twice as great an incidence as in 1957. The United States Public
        Health Service reported an increase of 15½% of paralytic cases
        in 1958 over those in 1957 (49% against 33.5%). In Hawaii
        (tropical) there were 65 victims including 32 paralytic cases in
        1958; half of these paralyzed cases (16) had received three Salk
        shots, in an island where 60% had been vaccinated. In 1957 only
        25 and 8/10ths % were paralytic instead of 49 and 9/l0ths% in
        1958. If the vaccine were effective there should have been a 60%
        decrease in the incidence in the whole island of the paralytic
        infections, instead of an increase of nearly 100%. </p>
      <p>Nationwide statistics issued January 4, 1960, by the United
        States Public Health Service, show that for the year 1959, up to
        December 26th (51 weeks), the increase in the incidence of Polio
        rose 85% over that of the same period of 1958. There were 8,531
        cases listed for 1959, of which 5,661 were paralytic, as
        compared to 5,987 in 1958, of which 3,090 were paralytic. We
        just showed the great increase in 1958 over the incidence of the
        total and the paralytic cases of 1957. Where compulsory
        vaccination was practiced as in North Carolina and Tennessee,
        Bealle’s investigations report a 400% increase in paralytic and
        non-paralytic Polio during 1959 over 1958. So it seems that the
        more vaccine that is used the more the actual infection that
        comes about. The statistical analysis teaches much about the
        nature of the virus. </p>
      <p>Of course, this is comprehensible when one considers that the
        virus breaks up into its component units on penetrating the host
        cell, as if by a de-polymerization process, and it grows by
        acquiring new units to add to each, as by a co-polymerization
        process. Some investigators compare the viral structure to a
        deck of cards. The complete deck or complete virus with all its
        units is the parent pathogenic killer type. The vaccines may be
        regarded as incomplete decks, with not all the units required to
        make up the full killer type. Now, if a person carried vaccine
        units of, let us say, half or less than the killer type requires
        and another vaccination or infection by a crippled non-fatal
        virus comes along that presents the units missing in the
        protective infection or vaccination of a previous period either
        one of which alone can not produce the disease, the units all
        added up could constitute the complete killer type, and it has
        been shown that they are “shuffled” in at random to make up the
        full virus, vaccination may add to the incidence of serious or
        fatal infection, and the more the vaccination the more the
        chance for building fatal viruses. </p>
      <p>This happened in the writer’s early practice (1920). Two cases
        were vaccinated against smallpox from the same vaccine lot. One
        had no effect. The other came down with a rapidly fatal
        smallpox. There was no epidemic at hand in Detroit at the time,
        so it was concluded that the fatal case’s inoculation carried
        units required by a previous silent infection to make it fatal.
      </p>
      <p><b>SMALLPOX</b> </p>
      <p>Statistics on vaccination against Smallpox in the Philippines
        when the United States took over are instructive. Reports run
        thus: In 1918, the Army forced the vaccination of 3,285,376
        natives when no epidemic was brewing, only the sporadic cases of
        the usual mild nature. Of the vaccinated persons, 47,369 came
        down with smallpox, and of these 16,477 died. In 1919 the
        experiment was doubled. 7,670,252 natives were vaccinated. Of
        these 65,180 cases came down with Smallpox, and 44,408 died. One
        sees here that the fatality rate increased in the
        twice-vaccinated cases. In the first experiment, one-third died,
        and in the second, two-thirds of the infected ones died. This
        speaks for the retention of viral units from the previous
        vaccinations, and indicates that, in the vaccine the shuffling
        in of units varies in different specimens of vaccine. It should
        be stated also that every epidemic of viral disease treated by
        the writer followed vaccination within a few months, when
        protection should have been had instead of an epidemic. This was
        so in Brazil, in Aftosa, Cinemosa, Hog Cholera and Rabies, and
        in Cuba in Hog Cholera. </p>
      <p>The question arises then as to how one accounts for the
        decrease in the incidence of Smallpox, since vaccination was
        instituted. The question is not easy to settle, since the
        hygienic improvements in sewage disposal has wiped out the means
        of spread of intestine carried viral infections. In the great
        Smallpox days, excreta were thrown out of the window into the
        streets, and then the outhouse was invented with its flies, etc.
        Today modern sewage is an obvious advantage, and soap and water
        are available even for washing the fingers of cooks and waiters
        in restaurants, and inspections by Public Health Officers help
        greatly in keeping down the spread of infection. It must be
        recalled that viruses integrate with bacteria and when these
        form spores, the integrated virus shares the protection of the
        spore against sterilization by chemicals and heat. They can thus
        survive for many months or years with full virulence. The
        intestinal tract is known to be a favorable habitat for such
        integrated viruses, so the hygienic measures of today would wipe
        out small-pox anyway without the benefit of vaccination, if
        there is any when carried on commercially. The present-day
        kitchen garbage disposal sink apparatus has cut down the
        incidence of the house fly so much that its universal adoption
        should become the greatest health booster of the century. In the
        writer’s experience, vaccination is a laboratory success when
        the technique is correct all the way through. Commercially the
        statistics do not look so favorable when other variables are
        encountered. </p>
