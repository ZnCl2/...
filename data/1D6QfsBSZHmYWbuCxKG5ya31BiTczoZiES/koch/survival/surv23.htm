<p><b>PITYRIASIS RUBRA UNIVERSALIS</b>
<br>CASE No. 59
<br>Dr. E. Klaveness
<p>This “incurable” disease recovered after two doses of the Carbonyl Catalysts.
In this case a 58-year-old man, who was treated on February 25 and again
in April 1950, had been suffering, since October 1948, from a skin disease
that answered the von Hebra description perfectly and was diagnosed as
Pityriasis Rubra by all available skin specialists along with Dr. Klaveness.
While at St. Joseph’s Hospital from December 16 to February 23, he lost
20 pounds, suffered daily from a terrific loss of scales and had a steady
deterioration in all respects. Normal weight was193 pounds; on Feb. 25
<i>,
</i>1950
was down to 172 pounds showing pronounced erythema of skin from the top
of his scalp to the soles of his feet, no papules, no blebs, no marked
infiltration of skin which was richly covered by small thin scales, curled
up from the periphery on itself, along with moderate itching. Inguinal
glands enormously enlarged, felt chilly even when heavily clothed. The
urine showed albumen 2.5 grains per liter.
<p>Recovery set in promptly after the SSR injection with no loss of weight.
The scaling stopped, first on the scalp and then on the trunk following
the first Treatment. Scaling stopped on the extremities after the second
injection, along with a change to normal color, a gain in strength, weight
and a clearing of the urine of albumen, so that by July 22 he was discharged
as cured. Found in good recovery also August 26, and September 9th. Examination
then showed the whole situation normalized with the inguinal glands very
much smaller, possibly normal.
<p><b>ACUTE FULMINATING PSORIASIS</b>
<br>CASE No. 60
<p>While psoriasis is generally slow to recover and the results are often
disappointing, some cases do recover rapidly and permanently. This is especially
true in acute cases. An example is Miss N., age 32 (Her brother also suffered
with chronic and severe psoriasis). The psoriasis came a month after an
attack of tonsillitis with an acute tachycardia on changing posture as
a sequel. She was much sicker than a case of psoriasis usually is. The
lesions first appeared on the left thigh and spread rapidly in spite of
the best attention of the experts until it covered the entire body affecting
the hair and nails in usual fashion. Some of the lesions were deeper than
we generally see and especially those between the head and ears. She was
given the Carbonyl Catalysts by the writer on April 2, 1926 and a reaction
followed on the fourth day with chills, fever, a general achiness along
with an inflammatory reaction localized in the tonsils. Thereafter, improvement
began to show in the usual cyclical sequence with the most recent lesions
responding first. This improvement continued with slight aggravations in
the congestions of the lesions during the third, sixth, and ninth weeks.
In between, the whole condition improved so rapidly that by the twelfth
week only a very few small spots were observed and these were absent at
the fourteenth week. She remained well, thereafter. The tachycardia recovered
right along with the psoriasis. The photographs were taken at the time
of Treatment and again at the fourteenth week. She remains well to last
report in 1946 when she offered to testify at the Court Trial.

<p>As in this case, we have offered numerous examples of toxin-host cell
integration where both structural and functional changes resulted
in different tissues. The psoriasis cellular defect and the neuromuscular
control of cardiac rhythm both responded to correction at the same time
with the withdrawal of the toxin through the agency of the same molecule.
Here again, is an indication that the type of toxin ligation with the host
cell in both instances is the same. And after all, the structural changes
in psoriasis may be considered as a functional matter for epithelial cells
of the dermis function by reproduction to afford protection. Both phenomena
present hyperfunction beyond physiological control and thus conform
to our definition of allergy. (Koch, <i>Cancer and Its Allied Diseases</i>,
1927) (Koch, <i>The Chemistry of Natural Immunity</i>, 1936)* <i>Neoplasia
falls into the same classification, so the clinical evidence in humans
on a wide front elucidates a simple pathogenic process to be met clinically,
simply and with complete success, in correctly managed cases.</i> If pathology
were always interpreted physiologically there would be very few serious
defeats for the clinician. We will see that this is true for animal diseases
as well.
<p><b>PSORIASIS UNIVERSALIS</b>
<br>CASE No. 61
<br>Dr. Chester Dove
<p>In this case of Mr. C., age 64, when treated in July 1934, showed universal
redness from the top of his head to the soles of his feet with terrific
amount of silvery scaling, both large and small, leaving a bleeding base
with loss of hair, eye lashes, and finger and toe nails. The soles of his
feet separated off as foul, gangrenous sloughs. He suffered day and night
without the least relief even with the best medical attention, available.
<p>The photos show the situation before and after Treatment.
<p>He received two injections, each containing two micro mgms of the SSR;
the first on July 17, 1934 and the second in October 1934. He made a complete
recovery. In February 1957, he told Dr. Dove that there had been no recurrence
of the psoriasis since his recovery in 1935.

<p><b>MULTIPLE ALLERGY</b>
<br>CASE No. 62
<p>Mrs. R., was 45 years old at the time of examination and Treatment in
May, 1934. For a year and a half she had continuous intensive hay fever
and asthma along with burning, watering eyes and a running nose. She was
found at the University of Michigan Hospital to be sensitive to 60 different
items including fur, feather, and most foods. These she was able to avoid
but still suffered as badly. Continuous nasal sinusitis for years.
<p>There was a continuous urticaria of the hemorrhagic type that added
to her misery. There was also a disturbance of the bowel that expanded
with gas after every eating along with an incontinence of urine. This was
seriously troublesome.
<p>We gave her two micro micrograms of the SSR serial arrangements of Carbonyl
groups with free radical terminals. Within three weeks, she was much improved
in all symptoms and was able to sleep on a feather pillow, keep a dog and
eat whatever she pleased. The recovery was complete in nine weeks and has
so remained. The sinus infection became well also but was not fully cured
until the twelfth week had passed. Here, too, the first condition to appear,
the sinus infection that supplied the allergenic toxin, was the last to
completely heal. However, the toxins produced there were in large part
immediately induced to undergo oxidation and were made harmless.
<p>While in this case, the allergy affected the secreting and involuntary
muscle contractile fibrillae, it often affects the nerve impulse generating
mechanism or the conductile fibrillae, in other cases. The following two
cases show that the toxemia may be expressed by a cerebral allergy, in
various ways. Psychic suggestion may have an instigating effect in nervous
cases like pollen has in the hay fever type, but we believe the fundamental
pathology in all is the block in the oxidation process which has to be
corrected.
<p><b>ALLERGY OF CEREBRAL CENTERS</b>
<br><b>On Infectious Basis</b>
<br>CASE No. 63
<p>This patient is representative of the most serious cases of the common
allergies. A less frequent type, which illustrates the response of the
psychic section of the nervous system, is, also submitted.
<p>The patient was the Rev. A., age 52. He came in December 1938, for a
serious sinusitis that involved the left maxillary sinus most severely.
He had this infection for over five years and nothing he used helped at
all. He reported that for the past few years he suffered from a compulsion
neurosis that did not yield to treatment of any kind. When hearing a train
whistle, he was forced to let out a yell at the top of his voice. We did
not go into psychoanalysis or ask whether or not he had a shock or fright
associated with the sounds of a train. No matter what such shock might
be, the toxin at the base of the trouble made the synapses hyperactive
so contact was extraordinarily easy and impulse transmission easier than
normal. Hence, removing the toxin should restore normalcy of function.
Or we may say, the nerve cell bodies were under higher energy evolvement
because of the energy poured into their mechanism, toxically. Thus only
a slight impulse received would set off a maximum response that could travel
a whole neuron system with a force much stronger than the inhibiting impulses
could manage. He was given but one dose of Benzoquinone, 2 cc. of the 6X
homeopathic solution and the sinus infection and the compulsory neurosis
both cleared up in three months. He has reported no trouble since.
<p>It is noteworthy that the nervous symptoms stopped immediately even
before the infection was all cleared away. Thus the toxic state was first
corrected and as in the other cases reported here, the bacteria can be
considered non-toxic after the Oxidation Catalysis has accomplished its
work.
<p><b>ALLERGY OF CEREBRAL CENTERS</b>
<br><b>On Neoplastic Basis -- Dual Personality</b>
<br>CASE No. 64
<p>Another case of cerebral allergy is that of a woman of sixty with a
massive carcinoma of the stomach. For two years she suffered a delusion
that the air was full of needles and pins that she was inhaling as she
breathed. Any drink brought her was full of the same sharp objects and
her husband put them there. She recovered both from the cancer of the stomach
and from the delusions. Even though the delusion of seeing the air full
of needles was excited by hearing a phonograph play in the neighborhood,
the delusions existed on a toxic basis as was demonstrated by the complete
cure of both conditions, at the same time, as the result of the use of
the oxidation Catalysts. One dose was given of the serial system of Carbonyl
Groups with free radical terminals on July 20th, 1924. She remained well
until 1943 when last seen. At this time, she explained that she knew the
“crazy notions” she had suffered form were not true, yet she could not
help but believe them. Indicating the existence of a dual personality in
a state of conflict. Thus the toxin affected one section of the brain,
while the other sections were not. Therefore the basis for Freud’s hypothesis
of abnormal psychic states falls flat, since he does not consider the oedematous
effects of toxins on the synapses that take part in any concept. Nor does
he consider the transfer of energy to the nerve impulse generating mechanisms
in the brain cells that result from fluorescent toxins, as we are dealing
with in this case and in the previous one. His whole system must be altered
to meet this newer information on the subject.
<p><b>ALLERGY OF MOTOR CENTERS</b>
<br>CASE No. 65
<p>This case demonstrates that an allergy may involve motor coordinating
centers and manifest itself by continuous repetition of the same motion
without ceasing, as a phase of a highly toxic insanity that failed to respond
to all known therapies, even with 1500 doses of metrozole and cardiozole,
the course progressed steadily towards death. Prof. Roxo, the renowned
professor of nervous diseases at the University of Brazil, gave such a
case to Prof. Renato Souza Lopes and the writer in 1941. This was to be
a test case because the prognosis was fatality within two weeks. Therefore,
if after taking the Benzoquinone injection the patient survived for at
least three weeks, it would be seen as an indicator of favorable action
obtained by the Treatment, according to Prof. Roxo.
<p>The patient was a young man of about 23 years of age. He had been ill
for months without significant remissions, but each forward step of the
disease was more severe than its preceding state. The man was raving, swinging
both arms in the same order of motion with constant repetition, just as
the secretory cells of the mucous membranes keep on acting in hay fever,
or the bronchial musculature keeps on contracting in asthma. We gave him
two cubic centimeters of the 6X homeopathic dilution of Benzoquinone. He
started to improve within twelve hours and was sent home on the fifth day
as cured.</blockquote>
