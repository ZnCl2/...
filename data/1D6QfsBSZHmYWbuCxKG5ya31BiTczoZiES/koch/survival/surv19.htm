<p>The etiological position of chronic infection in the causation of cancer
requires that any treatment that will cure cancer must very efficiently
cure infection. We will show by a few of the many cases cured how fulminating
Staphylococcus Septicemia of the most virulent kind, that failed to yield
to the other methods at hand, did reverse and become cured after a dose
of one of the Reagents reported here. Since these cases are decisive more
need not be given.
<p><b>ACUTE FULMINATING STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS PYEMIA</b>
<br><b>With Double Pneumonia and Pyelonephritis Complicating Osteomyelitis
in a Boy</b>
<br>CASE No. 52
<br>Dr. L. Andrews
<p>N. R., age 5 years, took sick with 105* fever and pain in the left tibia.
This was opened at the Victoria Hospital and yielded 300 cc. of pus, which
proved to be a pure culture of the Staphylococcus Aureus. In a few days
the symptoms pointed to infection of both kidneys and the urine showed
the same organism in large amounts. Lobar pneumonia in both lungs appeared
immediately and the blood culture showed a pure rich infection of the same
organism. He rapidly and steadily declined and soon it was difficult to
get him to take food and water. The fever remaining high, led to progressive
weakness and a sort of mummification in spite of all of the best hospital
care. His brother was immunized with a vaccine made from a pure culture
of the Staphylococcus Aureus. Then the brother’s blood serum was given
to the patient. He had nine blood transfusions while in the hospital between
July 13 and August 2, 1940. Neither this nor other measures as sulfathiazole
made any impression on the advance of the disease. The patient was given
up as hopeless and taken home on August 2, 1940, and present treatment
was continued for a few more days, but with no improvement. He refused
all food and even water.
<p>On August 9, 1940, he was given an injection of the serially arranged
Carbonyl groups. In twenty-four hours the patient was better. In forty-eight
hours, the patient was taking food. He was hungry and ate in quantity for
the first time of his own choice since he took sick. He made a rapid improvement
from that hour on. By September 10, 1940, the urine and blood were cleared
and the lungs had considerably improved. The X-Ray of the tibia bone showed
a “moth eaten” appearance. On September 12, 1940, Dr. Andrews operated
on the leg to clean out the dead bone and any infection that was present.
It was packed with iodoform gauze. A second injection was given after the
operation.
<p>By November 4, 1940, the effects of the pneumonia had practically disappeared.
The patient was discharged. The child is strong and vigorous. He made a
complete recovery.
<p><b>SUBACUTE STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS INFECTION OF THE PROSTATE GLAND</b>
<br><b>With Septicemia Following the Incision and Drainage of a Boil</b>
<br>CASE No. 53
<br>Dr. J. M. K----
<p>The boy, aged 18 years, while at camp in July 1940, developed symptoms
of appendicitis and was operated on because of the diagnosis but the appendix
was found to be normal. Soon afterward the pains concentrated in the kidney
region and the urine showed the infection to be the Staphylococcus Aureus
which was also found to be the cause of a superficial boil that was incised
a month previously and after which all his troubles began. The pain, however,
soon showed the major location of the infection to be the prostate gland.
Sulpha drugs were used with other of the best hospital care that was guided
by ample laboratory data. But they gave no help. The condition steadily
became worse with high fever, and steady loss of strength and nutrition.
Since incision for drainage of the prostate has uniformly turned out fatal,
this course was eliminated and when hope was abandoned, Dr. K---- phoned
the writer for an Ampoule. It arrived in Los Angeles, by airmail, and was
given without delay. Here again an infection that was steadily winning
for months quickly reversed after receiving the SSR injection, 2 millimicrograms.
<p>The change may be reported from Dr. K---’s testimony, which has been
paraphrased and reproduced here. It shows the intense interest of a father
finding favorable facts. “The Treatment was administered. The next day,
from my observation the boy was better. He was definitely improved. There
was a definite change. The change was one such as you see at a sick bed.
I watched him from the next day on. The boy improved. He had an appetite
then. He complained less, was less nervous and had less pain. His general
condition was definitely improving until the seventh day after Treatment
when the abscess broke (as Dr. Koch advised it would). The pus discharged
through the penis. The pus was cultured and it showed Staphylococcus Aureus.
On the day it broke he had quite some pain and after this he was, to all
appearances, well. I kept him in bed and kept him under close observation,
but he was perfectly all right. His temperature was normal. He commenced
to eat better. Of course, he showed the effects of the sickness, but he
had no more of the septic condition. The fever never came back. This was
followed, of course, by a definite and lasting and complete recovery.”
<p>In these cases, two things are to be recalled. The advancing infection
poisoned the nutrition, food could not be taken, nor even water, and the
fevers persisted and mounted until they became chronic when the protective
reactivity broke down and the mummifying process set in. The hopeless prognosis
was then evident, too, and the sulpha drugs gave no help, but seemed to
injure the patient as did the toxins of the infection, it should be recalled
that the activated amine groups plays a part in both poisons. The infection
steadily went forward also. Then after the Carbonyl Catalyst Treatment,
the change was for the better. The appearances changed. Appetite returned,
the fever stopped, the resistance showed up by sequestration of the infection
and its discharge as in the prostate case. Examination of the discharged
pus showed it to be the same Staphylococcus both before and after Treatment.
But after the Treatment the infection became suddenly harmless and was
quickly thrown out. This is the experience with cows with infectious mastitis,
as reported by the Ministry of Agriculture of British Columbia in five
years of observation in cattle infections. In a few days, the gangrenous
infections that laid the cows low subsides and the cows then are up and
about, even as the germ count increases, the wounds heal.
<p>This is an important observation as is also the<b> </b>disappearance
of the fibrosis of the chronic mastitis infections in the dairy cattle.
Evidently a change has taken place in the germ as well as in the patient.
The metabolisms of both have become normal and no toxins are produced.
Thus the physiological approach, which does not aim to injure or kill the
germ, makes it no longer pathogenic and the patient burns his accumulated
poisons out of the way so he is again hungry, even after weeks and months
of inability, to take food as he should.
<p>The metabolic fault in the tissues during chronic infection is well
represented in bronchiectasis, for here not only is there an excavation
of the lung substance starting in a bronchus, but the bronchial walls carry
the infection forward so that lobectomy is the only hopeful procedure,
from the orthodox standpoint. The following case, like the others in our
experience, shows the normalization of the tissues resulting in the cure
of the disease locally and systemically, for this patient showed a terrific
allergy to her bronchial infection through a most severe asthma. The correction
of the fault made it impossible for the infection and its sequel the asthma
to find soil, and the cure was therefore consequential to the restoration
of an efficient Oxidation Catalysis.
<p><b>ADVANCED BRONCHIECTASIS</b>
<br><b>With Asthma</b>
<br>CASE No. 54
<br>Dr. Wendell Hendricks
<p>On January 26, 1944, Mrs. P., a woman of 31 years of age, was helped
into Dr. Hendricks’ office. She weighed 82 pounds and was in a severe state
of asthma and coughing. The condition had persisted for many days and prevented
sleep and correct nutrition, and brought her to the point of collapse.
She raised enormous amounts of pus-laden sputum for many years, but the
asthma had persisted only for the past three years. A severe sinus infection
was probably the initiatory factor. Her pulse was 130 beats per minute
and temperature 100 degrees. The blood pressure was 100/80. It was necessary
to be propped up in bed to secure any sleep. The red blood count was 4,000,000,
the hemoglobin 80%.
<p><img SRC="image002.jpg">
<p>Radiograph No. I, taken at time of Treatment.
<p>One dose SSR was given on January 28, 1944. Three weeks later she exhibited
a reaction with chills and high fever. Following this reaction the asthma
ceased, the blood pressure rose to 112/80, she gained 10 pounds in weight,
and the fever dropped to 99.2&deg;. By the 12th week the temperature was
normal (98&deg;) pulse 72, and the blood pressure 110/80.
<center>
<p><img SRC="19004.jpg"></center>

<p>Radiograph No. II, taken August 4, 1944, showing recovery.
<p>In another month the blood pressure was 120/80, and she gained to 93
pounds, but real marked relief from the cough and the excessive sputum
did not come until the 24th week had passed. During the 27th week she was
given a second injection. She made a complete recovery. There were no more
symptoms of the disease, no more pus to be expelled and no more asthma.
She slept normally and lived normally again, tending to her card parties
and home duties as usual, and lived a brisk life thereafter. We believe
that only through the proper restoration of the oxidation mechanism and
its catalyst, can tissue vitality be restored and a permanent recovery
obtained. X-Ray films, taken before and after Treatment are submitted in
demonstration.
<p>Occasionally during the observation visits she was given a lavage of
the nasal sinuses to aid their elimination. Colon lavage was part of the
general care, together with vitamins and the vegetarian diet upon which
we insist in all of the cases under Treatment. No honest physician or expert
in this dire disease will claim that an occasional nasal lavage would cure
a deeply established bronchiectasis when indeed they admit the only cure
is removal of the lung or the lobe that is affected. Even such cases relapse,
it is found, as the fundamental tissue weakness still remains. Only the
proper restoration of the oxidation catalysis can restore the tissue vitality.
<p><b>ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANT GONORRHEA</b>
<p>The response of the antibiotic resistant gonococcus infection to the
Carbonyl Therapy depends partly on the general health of the patient, and
partly on the chronicity of the case when one is comparing the time required
to make a full recovery. One may compare the progress of the two young
men of nearly the same age each with about the same involvement, and both
antibiotic resistant. One had the infection two years and the other
four years. The former was in fair health giving a test of the red blood
cells of 100% no crenation. The other was very depleted and showed a very
poor crenation of his red cells in a one percent salt solution.
<p><b>Case 54 A</b>, was a boy of 22 years of age. He sustained his infection
two years earlier and had received all the antibiotics on the list without
stopping the specific infection. This germ had acquired immunity to antibiotics
before it infected him. The urethral discharge of gonococci continued.
The urine sediment was also positive to Gram-negative “coffee bean” intracellular
diplococci, on January 15, 1960, when he received two micrograms of Benzoquinone
(2 cc. of the 6x homeopathic solution) intramuscularly. His prostate was
seriously involved so that it interfered with the passage of urine and
feces. Two weeks later there was still the same secretion of pus and gonococci.
But the crenation test of the blood had improved to 90% crenation two weeks
later and only a few extra-cellular diplococci could be found in the urinary
sediment. Two weeks later the urinary sediment gave only a few gram-negative
diplococci. But they were pleomorphic and extracellular. No intracellular
“coffee-beans” were found. Ten days later and ever since until now, there
were no symptoms either prostatic or urethral, and the urinary sediment
was free of gram-negative diplococci. Only a few leukocytes could be found.
Thus he made a full recovery on one dose of 2 cc. of the 6x homeopathic
solution of Benzoquinone given intramuscularly, though the germ in this
case was persistently resistant to all the best known antibiotics right
from the very start.
<p><b>Case 54 B</b>, was 25 years old when he became infected in March
1956. Besides the urethral involvement there was a venereal papyloma and
a prepuce lesion, but the blood tested negative to the lues. He received
1,600,000 units of Penicillin. There was a slight improvement and then
an acute recurrence with prostatic involvement that interfered with both
the passage of feces and urine. On October 23, 1959<i>, </i>when he received
his dose of 2 micrograms of Benzoquinone the urethral discharge showed
the typical “coffee bean”. Gram-negative intracellular diplococci of gonorrhea.
There was a reaction with aggravation 84 hours later (this is typical of
the recovery process). There was some pain on passing urine, but the pus
discharge had become only slight, and in a few days he felt much better
in many ways. The feces passed easier with less prostatic interference.
But on February 19, 1960, there was abundant secretion, though he had gained
7 kilos in body weight as he was overcoming his great depletion of ill
health. This was the beginning of his 18th week after the Treatment and
is a usual reaction week in a chronic infection. But it was not a reaction
that won recovery. The Benzoquinone was not adequate. On March 16, the
dose of SSR was given. A reaction followed in two days with headache and
burning in the stomach. The secretion started to diminish the day following
the Treatment, and then disappeared. On May 30, he was free of every symptom
and of gonococci in the urinary sediment. He had gained 10 kilos, and the
urethra and prostate were normal. The urinary sediment showed only a few
extra-cellular pleomorphic diplococci. He was found cured again on June
15 <i>, </i>and has remained well ever since. It took six months for his
health to reach the good level where he could react with a full cure. The
SSR gave an immediate response while the Benzoquinone was helpful to his
general health and improved the infection considerably but did not produce
a cure. For this the more highly efficient Carbonyl groups of the SSR were
needed and then the response was immediate and complete.
<p>In both cases it is seen that the resistance gained by the germ to the
toxic amine group of the antibiotic did not influence the response to the
oxidation initiating Carbonyl group<b>.</b> Indeed, resistance to the injury
is along the same line as welcoming improvement in the vital chemistry.
Evidently the germ was made non-parasitic and non-pathogenic for surely
it was not injured by an agent that gave its oxidations a boost. And the
patient was improved in his whole vital chemistry at the same time. Thus
both patient and germ were not injured, but benefited. These observations,
like so many others, show that the physiological attack on infection has
a rational basis, while the pharmacological attack, which rests on a destructive
principle, may invite failure. The data at hand again emphasize the paradox
of trying to correct by way of destruction. Here success is had within
certain limitations or excluded entirely where nature has full sway. <i>The
constructive philosophy, on the other hand, is not hedged in by limitations
and nature aids the corrective process from every side and angle. It appears
here also that the sicker the patient, the sicker the germ and the longer
it takes to establish the correction. The correction of the fault in the
patient and in the germ run parallel—“hand in hand.” Both faults are of
the same order, as they respond to the same Reagent.</i></blockquote>
