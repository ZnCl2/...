<p><b><font size=+2>CLEAVAGE OF THE HOST-CELL PATHOGEN INTEGRATION</font></b></center>

<p>Let the host cell and its functional Carbonyl group — FCG — and the
activating ethylene linkage be represented by the above formulas:

<br>or by a chain of its polymers.
<p><i>Whether dehydrogenation takes place at the point of integration of
the pathogen and the FCG system, or at the farthest end to begin the destructive
oxidation of the pathogen, depends on its structure.</i> At any rate, the
most exposed and most active hydrogen atom would be attacked. In the virus
pathogen, this would be a terminal unit of the virus, since viruses are
built up as by a polymerization process, that is: by the addition of a
free radical of each unit to a pole of a double bond or free radical of
the other unit already laid down. Therefore, the last added unit would
be most exposed and dehydrogenation would take place at the carbon
atom alpha to a double bond in this outer unit as at (f) or (a). A free
radical so produced would add molecular oxygen to make a peroxide free
radical, and this would cleave the molecule into two parts, each of which
would carry a Carbonyl terminal. The double bonds of this Carbonyl group
would activate the hydrogen on the carbon atom alpha, thereto and dehydrogenation
would lead to another cleavage producing two more Carbonyl groups, etc.
Thus, step by step, the virus would be burned off until the ethylene linkage
to which it was added was reached, as at (c), and here a Carbonyl group
would be made, thus activating the FCG in place of the ethylene linkage.
This would prove an immunizing help as the Carbonyl group is a much better
electron donor than the ethylene linkage, and thus a higher O/R potential
would be gained by the FCG. Further, Carbonyl groups do not add free radicals
as readily as do ethylene linkages, and the chances for integration with
a pathogen during anoxia would be correspondingly reduced. <i>The long
lasting protection observed in our cured patients may thus be explained.
The energy liberated in this combustion of the virus would pass on to the
host cell and support its reconstruction.
</i>(See Appendix.)
<p>The virus attached via an azomethine double bond by condensation of
its amine group with the FCG could undergo the same stepwise oxidation
with restoration of the original Carbonyl group of the FCG System, and
leaving its ethylene linkage undisturbed as the donor of electrons to the
FCG. However, alpha to the azomethine double bond a hydrogen atom could
be removed and the oxidation at this point would burn off the amine group
and restore the FCG. The virus would thus lose its pathogenic amine group
and receive a Carbonyl group to change its whole attitude toward the world,
as it was separated off as a whole. Likewise, the virus attached at the
ethylene linkage could be burned off at the point of attachment and leave
a similarly restored FCG activated by electrons from a Carbonyl group.
The virus would also acquire a new Carbonyl group to change its behaviors.
It is even possible that the acquiring of an active Carbonyl group would
give it autonomous properties so it need no longer be parasitic to obtain
its energy, but may be able to produce it itself.
<p>Should the pathogen be a synthetic carcinogen or a polymerized toxin
produced by some germ trapped in a scar where oxygen supply is low, the
burning would start at the most active hydrogen atom exposed; that would
be one that is alpha to a double bond located in the “K region”, as is
now identified by cancerologists. At any rate, <i>the pathogen is no longer
to be found. It, therefore, is no longer a disturber of physiological processes.
Normalcy is thus established.</i>
<p>Toxins attached to fibroblastic tissue where healing is going on and
held in the scar as an integrate, no doubt, make the addition as a free
radical or via an amine group, as described above<i>. It is a clinical
fact that scars disappear after the Survival Factor dehydrogenator starts
to work on them. The toxin is thus burned out of the way and the fibrosis
has no more incentive to exist.</i> <i>It becomes obsolete, and is absorbed</i>.
Extreme arterial sclerosis in very old people has been observed to disappear
and senile dementia to clear up in a major way following one dose of the
Survival Reagent. Under such circumstances, one is justified in assuming
that the pathogen was burned out of the sclerotic tissue and the fibrosis
could then be absorbed, without any reason for hindrance.
<p>The ideal Therapeutic Reagent must possess an adequate O/R potential
in a molecule free from steric hindrance, and of the simplest possible
structure, so that one action and only one predominates. It is necessary
to gain as broad a field of steric advantage as possible, since the steric
qualities of the host cell’s functional mechanism- pathogen integrate changes,
some with each different pathogen. Simplicity in structure is therefore
an advantage. The Survival Reagent’s Carbonyl group, as so often stated,
is activated by conjugation with the double bonds of an ethylene linkage,
or of another Carbonyl group, or with the triple bonds of an acetylene
linkage. The greater the number of ethylenic groups that carry free hydrogen
atoms, the greater is the O/R potential of the Carbonyl group. Substitution
of these hydrogen atoms must not be permitted. This is seen in the following
quinone structures:
<p>Anthraquinone with no quinone double bonds carrying hydrogen atoms and
with two Carbonyl groups shows an O/R potential of 0.154<i> </i>v. Alpha-naphthaquinone
with one double bond carrying two hydrogen atoms and with two Carbonyls
has an O/R potential of 0.484 v. Beta-Naphtha-quinone with one double bond
carrying two hydrogen atoms, and the double bond of a Carbonyl group conjugated
directly with another Carbonyl group of the quinone structure has an O/R
potential of 0.576 v. Parabenzoquinone carries two ethylene linkages presenting
four hydrogen atoms and two Carbonyl groups. It has an O/R potential of
0.7 15 v. Orthobenzoquinone with two sets of double bonds carrying four
hydrogen atoms and two Carbonyl groups directly conjugated, offers an O/R
potential of 0.792 v. Diphenoquinone with its four ethylene linkages presenting
eight hydrogen atoms in two quinone groups united by a double bond, and
offering two Carbonyl groups, shows an O/R potential of 0.954 v. As the
dehydrogenating power increases with the O/R potential and likewise the
energy content of the molecule, one will see to it that no substitutions
are allowed unless the substituent offers a series of additional ethylene
linkages in conjugation. Yet that may interpose some steric disadvantage.
As the migration of electrons to the Carbonyl group make the ethylenic
linkages more electrophilic, they will tend to add free radicals of toxins
more readily and when hypoxia hinders peroxide free radical formation in
the dehydrogenated toxin, this property of the ethylenic linkage is an
advantage, as it will protect the Functional Carbonyl group’s activator
unsaturated bonds from paralyzing additions. On the other hand, the quinone
ethylenic linkages when present in excess, can add to and inactivate the
free radicals produced in the pathogen that is undergoing destructive oxidation,
and thus block further progress in its destruction, and also block the
liberation of the host cell’s FCG. Too large a dose of quinone, especially
of diphenoquinone, or its repetition when recovery is going on, competes
with molecular oxygen and can block the recovery process or even reverse
it. This is especially true when hypoxia reduces the opportunity to change
the free radicals formed in the toxin into peroxide free radicals. On the
other hand, some advantage may be had in protecting host cell unsaturated
bonds from adding free radicals of the pathogen. The structure of the Reagent,
therefore, must be understood for best use.
<p>Another valuable consequence of not allowing the quinone structure to
carry substituents of the hydrogen atoms, is that these substituents cut
down the activity and formation of the resonance hybrid free radicals that
have great value in starting oxidation chains, and continue the dehydrogenations
after the Carbonyl group has accepted a hydrogen atom.

<br>The disadvantages of even the best quinone structures called for molecular
set-up where crippling conditions were eliminated and so the chains of
Carbonyl groups had to be developed. Among them, the following structures
were compared with the straight chains of Carbonyl groups represented by
the Formula x,

<br>developed in various molecular weights. 


<br>The last mentioned structure offers great versatility because of different
molecular weights that can be produced for fairly specific<i> </i>selection.
