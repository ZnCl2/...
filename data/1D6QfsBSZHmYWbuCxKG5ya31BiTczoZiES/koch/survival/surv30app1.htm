<p><b><font size=+2>SUGAR OXIDATION</font></b></center>

<p>Although specific enzymes play a part in all metabolic reactions, it
is also possible that non-enzymatic reactions play an equally important
role in certain positions. There is no harm in visualizing a non-enzymatic
factor in sugar oxidation. Fructose is much more easily oxidized than glucose
so the enzymatic conversion of glucose to fructose is assumed. The non-enzymatic
condensation of the Carbonyl group of fructose with the amine group of
the cell’s oxidation mechanism to form an azomethine double bond offers
the advantage of holding the fuel and receiving the energy produced by
the first oxidative steps. The diagrams picture the process. When cleavage
takes place and the Amadori rearrangement is reversed, an acetyl free radical
is formed which adds to the phosphoric acid residue of the cell and further
oxidation steps pass their energy on to the cell via this union. This happens
so long as molecular oxygen is at hand. When it is not, the end products
are lactic acid under the reduction flux of the medium and the fermentation
system takes over. The free radical and peroxide free radical intermediaries,
in the presence of adequate oxygen, lead to such unstable oxidation-inviting
fragments, that they can never be trapped.
<p>It must also be recalled that though the carbon hydrogen bond strength
equals 58.6 Kg-calories per molecule and the 0-H bond- 110.2 Kg-calories,
the set-up in sugar gives the hydroxyl hydrogen great freedom, so that
when sugar is placed in heavy water, the deuterium replaces the hydrogen
atoms at random and here the bond strength is so greatly reduced that dehydrogenation
of the hydroxyl group virtually leaves an oxygen free radical. <i>The very
structure of fructose invites dehydrogenations of the carbon atoms and
the hydroxyl groups, which gives specific and non-specific dehydrogenators
the preference over any agencies involved in the Krebs’s Cycle.</i> If
the progress would follow the scheme outlined above, no free degradation
products would be at hand to be isolated. However, <i>if the above process
is crippled, the last steps would require known dehydrases and the latter
products would be identifiable. The removal of hydroxyl hydrogen would
take place very early, however, even before the carbon chain is broken
and thus the process requires more facts for clarification. One therefore
sees how futile it is to outline such mechanism as the Citric Acid Cycle
or any other mechanism, in view of the facts stated above, and in view
of the lack of further directive data.</i>
