<p><b><font size=+2>OBSERVATIONS IN ANIMAL DISEASES</font></b></center>

<p>We are indebted to Dr. David Arnott for development of the use of the
Carbonyl Catalysts in the diseases of dairy cattle. The enormous amount
of data meticulously built up by the scientists of the Ministry of Agriculture
and the University of British Columbia, Canada, showed the basic place
of this Therapy in the tissue oxidation processes that use sugar. Thus
some 95 to 100% of cases of acetonemia are quickly cured by a single injection
per animal in both the acute and the chronic cases. The hundreds of cases
treated for infectious mastitis show a rapid cure in the acute cases with
hemolytic streptococcus and staphylococcus cases approaching 90% while
the chronic cases, with much fibrosis, showed something like an 80% cure
rate with restoration of function and replacement of the fibrosis with
normal gland tissue. <i>This is the only Therapy that has ever demonstrated
this result. </i>In Brazil, we showed that the fibrosis that completely
invaded the udder and closed the teats after local treatments with various
antibiotics could be completely cured by this Therapy, too. The fibrosis
and the infection it contained were eliminated by replacement with normal
functioning gland tissue.
<p>However, the Reports of the Minister of Agriculture of British Columbia
to the Parliament in the Official Bulletins of years 1944 through 1949
inclusive not only verify our working Hypothesis, in general, but also
supplied bacteriological counts before and after Treatment, which indicated
the pathogenic germs of highest virulence before Treatment may rapidly
drop in numbers a few days after Treatment, while the udders are undergoing
healing. Also, where the injury was found to be most severe, the bacteria
at times increased in number during the healing process, during the time
the toxicity in the animal was rapidly disappearing. Our interpretation
of this often observed affair, especially in gangrenous mastitis, is that
the germ became no longer toxic, as we see in huge tuberculous cavitations
in man, and indeed appear to help in the clean-up process. As soon as the
tissue debris is eliminated, they rapidly disappear, even before the cavity
or lesion is healed by tissue reconstruction They thus appear to have shared
in the benefits from the Carbonyl Catalysts and become normal useful members
of the biological economy, and help clean up the mess they formerly caused.
<p><b>Brucellosis</b>
<p>It was the cure of dairy farmers suffering with Brucellosis that gave
start to the Treatment of this disease in cattle in Canada, by Dr. Arnott.
The cure percentage ran somewhat over 80% in dairy cows and this is what
was recorded in the Michigan experiments, as well as, those conducted in
a small number of cows in Brazil. In the latter cases which I treated for
the Ministry of Agriculture, the cases were far advanced and often the
broken down type. One had a severe infection of the udder with the diphtheria
bacillus that completely involved three quarters (3/4 of one udder) and
half of the other quarter (1/2 of the other udder). It was resistant to
all forms of treatment and pronounced entirely hopeless by the University
Pathologist who had supervised this case. They were all cachectic with
"moth-eaten” fur or with arthritis, ulceration, infertility or some other
complication. Of five* such cases, four gave birth to normal calves at
normal term, and the placenta in each case was found to be structurally
and bacteriologically normal and free from the Brucella germ. The
other case, aborted within three months of receiving the Treatment, but
no follow-up was had to determine if the cure came after the third month,
which is usually the case. The cow with both Brucellosis and Corynebacterium
mastitis was fully cured of both infections — a surprise to all observers.
She gave birth to a normal calf and the placenta was proven normal and
free from infection. No Brucella germs were found and the udder normalized
completely without fibrosis, with return of full lactation.
<p>Absorption of the fetus no longer occurred after the Treatment and thus
the normal reproductive physiology was restored whether the interference
was a matter of: dietary insufficiency, selenium in the plants, soil or
water, or a possible injury from the Brucellosis germ. High potency Oxidation
Catalysis removed the interference and restored tissue function energy
production so normal behavior could be resumed. Dr. Bruce Richardson treats
the subject of infertility in cattle in his graduation thesis from the
University of British Columbia and by Dr. Wood, the Professor of Pathology.
Their recovery percentages were about 72% while those in Michigan ran much
higher. Thus the environmental features deserve consideration and these
are vastly different in the two places.
<p>Infertility in cattle, as in man, may have a complex origin and many
factors may be determinative. Thus imperfections in food, toxins of various
origins, such as selenium coming from the soil are definite causes. Yet
the poison of Brucellosis is most important. Correction of the feeding
may be somewhat helpful but in the confirmed cases, a basic boost to the
metabolism able to burn the hindering toxin out of the way is needed.</blockquote>
