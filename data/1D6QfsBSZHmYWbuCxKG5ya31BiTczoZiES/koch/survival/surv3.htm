      <p>Glover showed in 1923 that the cancer virus existed in a
        pleomorphic
        germ that was bacillus in one phase and coccus in another, and
        virus in
        the third phase. He also showed it could exist in a fungus or
        mycelium
        phase. The latter form has been identified lately by Irene
        Diller, and
        some others, and the whole chain of forms was independently
        proved by von
        Brehmer, in the last few decades as well. The work was
        thoroughly repeated
        and proved by my friend Jacob Engel and George Clark, at the
        U.S. P.H.S.
        laboratories, but, for reasons we will not discuss, they were
        not allowed
        to publish their findings. The infectious nature of natural
        cancer was
        thus proven beyond any doubt by carefully following the four
        laws of Robert
        Koch. Doctor Clark was able to get a paper read on this
        confirmation in
        1953, at Rome, Italy, at the Sixth International Congress of
        Microbiology.
        So at last the facts are recorded in the archives of orthodox
        scientific
        literature. In the usual viral infections, the host cell
        material and energy
        are used to build the viral colony with terrific multiplication
        of new
        viruses. In cancer, both nutrition and energy go into the
        building of new
        cancer cells and perhaps only an equal number of integrated
        viruses. For
        this reason it has been difficult to demonstrate the virus in
        certain cancer
        growths. Synthetic carcinogens numbering over two hundred have
        been tried
        out. One sees that the same two atomic units required for viral
        integration
        with the host cell are to be found. These are:
      </p>
      <p><b>(a)
        </b>the activated amine group, and
      </p>
      <p><b>(b)
        </b>the highly mobile hydrogen atom alpha to a double bond in
        the most exposed area, the “K region”, as it is now named.
      </p>
      <p>When dehydrogenated during anoxia it adds to the FCG activating
        unit.
        Carcinogens carrying the amine group that integrates with the
        host cell
        FCG to start the pathogenesis, as in acetyl amino-fluorene, and
        in Butter
        Yellow, and its analogues, hold the amine group in a protected
        state until
        the agent enters the body and hydrolysis or oxidation frees it
        of its protection,
        so it can make the azomethine condensation. Some experts think
        that the
        synthetic carcinogen prepares the cell for the virus carcinogen,
        but give
        no explanation of how this is done. <i>Our Postulate, on the
          other hand,
          shows that the amine group of synthetic carcinogens or of the
          fungus always
          found in cancer can play a part by inactivating the cell’s
          FCG.</i> <i>The
          blocking of the oxidations that results brings about the
          colloidal gelling
          that causes the anoxia necessary for addition of the free
          radical (brought
          about in the virus by dehydrogenation) to the double bond that
          activates
          the FCG. Our Thesis also shows how the carcinogen can produce
          cancer without
          the aid of a virus by addition of either pathogenic atomic
          unit.<b> </b></i>Some
        animal experiments with neoplastic transplants, and some with
        carcinogenic
        agents are reported here for<i> </i>comparison to show that the
        same reagent
        gave protection and cured in high percentage in each set. <i>The
          parathyroidectomy
          experiments should be recalled in connection with the
          pathogenesis and
          the anoxia involved.</i> <i>This is a main pillar of our
          Thesis</i> as
        <i>based
          upon our earliest findings that, of course, took considerable
          thought to
          be appreciated. </i>They are not even appreciated today in
        the orthodox
        circles, although Warburg, the Nestor of the biochemical
        profession, has
        championed the fact that anoxia is the cause of cancer for
        decades. He
        is the pioneer who developed methods of study of the oxidations
        in tissues.
        However, Warburg has not yet appreciated the place of the free
        radical
        in the process. It will be seen that it is this position of
        orthodoxy that
        has limited progress in the explanation of the mechanism of
        anoxia in causing
        cancer, and the true nature of the carcinogenic change.
        Nevertheless, his
        contributions that won for him the Nobel Prize in Medicine on
        this subject
        are a monument of support to our Postulate. Hence we give some
        quotations
        from his most recent summary in “<i>Naturwissenschaften</i>,”
        Vol. 42 —
        p. 401, 1955:
      </p>
      <p>If one examines them in the light of the data we have presented
        in the
        preceding pages, it will be evident that they <i>confirm our
          own Thesison
          the pathogenesis of cancer and disease, in general. They point
          out the
          essential status of anoxia, which we have claimed is necessary
          for the
          pathogen to be changed by dehydrogenation (of the tissue
          metabolism) to
          a free radical which instead of being burned and disposed of
          as fuel in
          the presence of oxygen, is not burned in its absence but is
          able to add
          to the cell grana and do so at the very point where the
          activation of the
          oxidations is generated, namely the double bonds that activate
          the Carbonyl
          group, which we credit with initiating the tissue oxidations
          by serving
          as a dehydrogenator of fuels and pathogens. Thus anoxia is
          essential to
          the pathogenesis, as it disposes the pathogen, carcinogen,
          virus or what
          not, to be able to integrate with the host cell and block
          grana function.
        </i>The
        following quotations support our Thesis as far as they go.
      </p>
      <p>“One method for the destruction of the respiration of the body
        cells
        is removal of oxygen. If, for example embryonal tissue is
        exposed to an
        oxygen deficiency for some hours and then is placed in oxygen
        again, 50
        percent or more of the respiration is usually destroyed. The
        cause of this
        destruction of respiration is lack of energy. As a matter of
        fact, the
        cells need their respiration energy to preserve their structure,
        and if
        respiration is inhibited, both structure and respiration
        disappear.” If
        one estimates the amount of normal function, one sees how the
        pathogenesis
        we have described will accomplish what Warburg reports here.
        Again, “If
        an injury to respiration is to produce cancer, this injury must,
        as already
        mentioned, be irreversible. We understand by this not only that
        the inhibition
        of respiration remains after the removal of the respiratory
        poison but,
        even more, that the inhibition of respiration also continues
        through all
        the following cell divisions, for measurements of metabolism in
        transplanted
        tumors have shown that cancer cells can not regain normal
        respiration,
        even in the course of many decades, once they have lost it.”
      </p>
      <p>“But why are the body cells dedifferentiated when their
        respiration
        energy is replaced by fermentation energy? At first, one would
        think that
        it is immaterial to the cells whether they obtain their energy
        from respiration
        or from fermentation, since the energy of both reactions is
        transformed
        into the energy of adenosine triphosphate, and yet adenosine
        triphosphate
        <b>=
        </b>adenosine
        triphosphate. This equation is certainly correct chemically and
        energetically,
        but it is incorrect morphologically, because, although
        respiration takes
        place for the most part in the structure of the grana, the
        fermentation
        enzymes are found for a greater part in the fluid of the
        protoplasm. The
        adenosine triphosphate synthesized by respiration therefore
        involves more
        structure than the adenosine triphosphate synthesized by
        fermentation.”
        Since the enzymes and intermediaries of fermentation, which
        biochemists
        accept as playing a big part also in the cell respiration, bathe
        the grana
        and the grana do not use them, as the quotation shows, then the
        conventionally
        accepted process is not correct, and a different process and
        different
        set of enzymes and intermediaries are involved. This process
        must be one,
        which inactivates the grana when oxygen is missing; hence the
        logical deduction
        is that the free radical is an essential part of an early
        intermediary
        as we have hypothesized for so long.
      </p>
      <p>Further, “The first notable experimental induction of cancer by
        oxygen
        deficiency was described by Goldblatt and Cameron, who exposed
        heart fibroblasts
        in tissue culture to intermittent oxygen deficiency for long
        periods and
        finally obtained transplantable cancer cells, whereas in control
        cultures
        that were maintained without oxygen deficiency, no cancer cells
        resulted.
        Clinical experiences along these lines are innumerable.” Warburg
        emphasizes,
        “but there is only one common cause into which all other causes
        of cancer
        merge, the irreversible injuring of respiration.” He states, “In
        recent
        years it has been recognized that subnarcotic doses of urethane
        cause lung
        cancer in mice in 100 percent of treatments. Urethane is
        particularly suitable
        as a carcinogen, because, in contrast to alcohol, it is not
        itself burned
        up on the respiring surfaces and, unlike ether and chloroform,
        it does
        not cytolyze the cells. Any narcotic that has these properties
        may cause
        cancer upon chronic administration in small doses.” So Warburg
        recognizes
        that a carcinogen must be not<i> </i>destructible by the cell’s
        oxidative
        mechanism or otherwise. It can then become integrated with the
        cell and
        become a part of it, and can become accumulative as the
        disposing anoxia
        provides occasion. Warburg states in this connection, “Any
        respiratory
        injury due to lack of energy, however, whether it is produced by
        oxygen
        deficiency or by respiratory poisons, must be cumulative since
        it is irreversible.”
      </p>
      <p>The essential nature of the process of fermentation<i> </i>subjects
it
        only to control by the circumstances that control any enzyme
        action.
        These are temperature, the pH reaction of the medium, the
        concentration
        of the ferment and of the substrate. Besides such accessories as
        the magnesium
        ion or when needed, a co-enzyme will determine the speed and
        extent of
        the reaction. Fermentation progresses as well in a test tube as
        in a living
        cell.<b> </b><i>No physiological control of these qualities for
          the specific
          service of the cell economy are known, except one, and that is
          the presence
          of the oxidation process.</i> Normally this is the presence or
        absence
        of oxygen. Pasteur was first to observe this relationship, and
        the great
        Warburg named it after this supreme observer, — the Pasteur
        Effect. This
        phenomenon was first described by him when observed in yeast
        cultures,
        but it is a common property to all cells that are obligatively
        aerobic.
        He reported that if a culture of yeast is deprived of oxygen,
        fermentation
        comes to the aid of the cell to supply the energy for vital
        processes,
        and if oxygen is again admitted to the culture, the fermentation
        ceases
        and oxidation takes its place. Fermentation is very wasteful and
        less than
        one-fifteenth as efficient as oxidation in the use of fuel
        material.<i>
          The mechanism of the Pasteur Effect has never been explained
          by orthodox
          biochemistry. However, one will see that our Postulate
          incorporates its
          explanation as a function of the Functional Carbonyl Group.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Oxidation has several positions of control in its process in
          line
          with our Postulate.The first is the potency of the FCG, which
          must start
          the process by dehydrogenating the fuel. </i>When this
        Carbonyl group is
        not free, as when the hydrogen it removes from the fuel is not
        taken away
        by some electron acceptor system, then oxidation is blocked. And
        for this,
        oxygen is essential as the ultimate electron acceptor in aerobic
        organisms.
        So lack of oxygen has two steps in blocking oxidation or
        hindering it.
        <i>Another
          position of control is the inactivation of the FCG by
          additions to the
          double bonds that activate it.</i> This would happen as we
        explained when
        anoxia prevents the free radical formed by FCG action from
        becoming a peroxide
        free radical so it must add to some position as that of the
        activating
        double bond. When this happens the FCG is inactivated and the
        starting
        of another oxidation progression is blocked. Fuels so added, may
        easily
        be burned away by the process we outlined for removal of
        pathogens, but
        normally it is not accomplished by FCG action when oxygen is
        again admitted
        unless the FCG belongs to a different unhindered structure. If a
        pathogen
        has been added the SSR is needed to free it. * However, when
        oxygen is
        lacking the FCG as a rule will not be relieved of its hydrogen
        atom and
        can not form a free radical in the fuel until oxygen is
        admitted, and this
        is a protection to the mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>* The SSR is a synthetically produced Carbonyl compound of high
        Oxidative-Reduction
        potential, used as a therapeutic agent.
      </p>
      <p>Physiologically, however, the control that is designed to serve
        the
        economy of the tissue itself and the organism as a whole is
        regulated by
        the need for energy production. Oxidation is regulated so
        quantatively
        but fermentation is not. The need for energy is determined by
        the work
        to be done by a functional unit, and this is regulated by nerve
        or some
        hormone action, which releases the phosphate’s stored energy to
        become
        work energy. This creates a deficit of stored phosphate energy,
        and oxidation
        must get going to replenish the supply. We explained elsewhere
        how the
        FCG accomplishes this act. So physiologically, oxidation is
        controlled
        by the need of energy for work, and the substances concerned in
        the process
        in addition to oxygen and the fuel are the FCG, creatine, and
        phosphoric
        acid. Therefore free creatine and free phosphoric acid and
        possibly some
        calcium balancing factor will give the free FCG a chance to
        start oxidation
        progressions that will yield the energy to form energy carrying
        creatine-phosphoric
        acid, as we explained before. Dehydrogenation and FCG action are
        concerned
        in oxidation only, and not in fermentation. Therefore,
        fermentation is
        probably blocked by inactivating its initiating enzyme by the
        act of dehydrogenation
        to form an active free radical in it, so that it makes an
        inactivating
        addition that is split by phosphoric acid set free when it is
        liberated
        from an energy carrying ester. The ferment would then act
        through its restored
        hydroxyl group when energy fails, — a possibility only, as the
        need for
        energy production would be indicated by an accumulation of
        phosphoric acid,
        the first indicator for the need of fermentation, that is also
        able to
        liberate the ferment’s bound hydroxyl group, that was
        inactivated by oxidation
        (dehydrogenation) during anoxia. Aside from such automatic
        control, there
        is the nerve and hormone control of the FCG and its azomethine
        double bond
        with the amine group of creatine where the nerve impulse
        determines its
        rupture to form the phosphate energy carrier, or its formation
        to discharge
        the energy load into the working mechanism<b>. </b>The
        phosphate energy
        bonds of fermentation are not formed or split in that way. Their
        energy
        must enter the functional mechanism through a different door.
        Mass action
        and energy transferred by photosensitization may determine such
        activity.
        There is no data on which to base a decision.
      </p>
      <p>Fermentation need not be a general affair, but may be localized
        in some
        particular tissue where the FCG function is hindered. Function
        forced by
        fermentation energy beyond physiological control is the
        characteristic
        of all allergies including cancer. The type of allergy is
        determined by
        the functional unit involved, secreting fibrillae in hay fever,
        contractible
        fibrillae in asthma, conducting-synapse fibrillae in compulsion
        neuroses,
        mitotic fibrillae in cancer, etc. However, FCG block is
        necessary as described
        before. And the permanent block is done by a condensation with a
        firmly
        bonding amine as guanidine, or of some virus or an amine
        produced by decarboxylase
        action on some amino acid. When Victor C. Vaughan demonstrated
        in 1910
        that the alkaline hydrolysis of various proteins gave rise to a
        toxic fraction
        that caused anaphylaxis, the writer was privileged to work in
        this kindly
        scientist’s laboratory and isolated several toxic amines from
        his alkaline
        hydrolysate. They produced the allergic changes of fatal
        anaphylaxis. Later
        on it dawned on the writer that if his Postulated FCG were
        blocked by toxic
        amines produced in a tissue by their decarboxylases that operate
        best in
        an alkaline medium, fermentation would be the result that could
        force the
        allergic responses that occur in anaphylaxis, and the type of
        response
        would depend upon the functional unit acted upon, while the
        amount of amine
        could be very small.
      </p>
      <p>To check up on this a large number of allergy cases were
        treated with
        the SSR by the writer and several hundred collaborators. The
        results reported
        were about 85% recoveries obtained on one or two doses. These
        included
        the intractable asthmas and hay fever cases as well as the
        infantile eczemas
        that fail to respond to known methods. Some guinea pigs
        sensitized to egg
        white by the Vaughan method were also treated with success, but
        such experiments
        are not determinative unless all variables can be excluded, and
        they cannot.
        At any rate, one sees here the practical meaning of <i>the
          Pasteur Effect
        </i>as
        modified by a pathogen. Physiologically, fermentation stops in
        an anoxic
        tissue when oxygen is admitted, but here pathologically, the use
        of oxygen
        was blocked until the hindrance to the FCG was removed by use of
        a “super”
        Carbonyl group, the SSR. Though in orthodox biochemistry the
        explanation
        of the Pasteur Effect has not yet been made, we see that the
        Carbonyl group
        is the key to the situation both normally and in pathological
        processes.
        <i>Our
          Postulate is thus strengthened by its broad utility.</i>
      </p>
      <p>That the narcotic action promotes neoplastic behavior is only
        too well
        known to the clinician. Especially is this true of the oxides of
        nitrogen
        that present permanent free radicals that can block respiration
        and promote
        cancer growth most disastrously. Their essential action is to
        hinder cell
        respirations. Other confirmatory quotations in support of our
        Postulate
        could be given, but this is enough.
      </p>
      <p>While it was important to recognize the essential role of
        oxygen lack
        in carcinogenesis, the observation is of no practical use until
        one understands
        the mechanism whereby the anoxia disposes to neoplasia<i>. It is
          too bad
          that Warburg was not aware of our findings after
          parathyroidectomy, the
          action of high-energy amino groups in attacking the oxidation
          initiating
          Carbonyl group of the grana as we Postulated, and that thereby
          the oxidation
          mechanism was blocked. It is too bad he gave no thought to the
          position
          of the free radical formed by these dehydrogenations and the
          absolute need
          of molecular oxygen to carry the oxidation progression
          forward, and that
          when the substrate acted upon could find no oxygen to combine,
          it must
          combine an appropriate double bond, and thus integrate with
          the cell’s
          energy</i> <i>producing mechanism. It is too bad that he did
          not make these
          steps and then the third step to recognize that the very
          integration of
          the pathogen with the host cell invited the oxidative
          separation of both
          leaving the host cell in good functional status, while the
          pathogen was
          destroyed. He therefore missed the essence of the
          reversibility of carcinogenesis,
          and the means of bringing it about.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>We will give the details as we go along, and the
          substantiating proof
          for each step. However, what Warburg did establish was a great
          advance
          in cancerology and his prestige as a biochemist makes this
          support to our
          Thesis, a most valuable one.</i>
