      <p><i>When presenting a Thesis such as this, it is good policy to
          eliminate superstitions and misinterpretations.</i> For
        example, the idea that the cures we will report were secured by
        psychology or suggestion, or that after all the disease was not
        Cancer, Infantile Paralysis, Tuberculosis, or what it is
        represented as being. That the diagnoses were uncontradictable
        is established, and the pretreatment control period showing the
        downward course of the patient was also proven uncontradictable.
        The recoveries were established for many years, even several
        decades in some cases. It was also proven that no other remedy
        was used, and the sharp contrast between the pretreatment
        control period and the characteristic cyclic recovery that
        characterizes the recovery process after the Survival Factor
        Reagent was used settles the credit according to modern
        scientific procedures in drug testing. Because of the many
        shortcomings in the collateral control system when humans are
        under treatment, it has been discarded long ago, and the ACTH
        and Cortisone experiments show the clinical procedure of using
        an adequate pretreatment observation period to compare with the
        post-treatment period is the only reliable procedure known, and
        it is the procedure used by all highest rating clinicians for
        clinical tests. This is the system we use throughout, and each
        case should be studied with this in mind. </p>
      <p>However, to remove any doubts about etiological and psychic
        factors we offer a few animal experiments, in which
        transplantable C 57<i> </i>Breast Cancer was inoculated into
        mice, and also transplantable Sarcoma 37 was inoculated into
        mice, all at the Jackson Memorial Laboratory at Bar Harbor,
        Maine. The inoculated animals were then sent to Dr. Stanley
        Bandeen, of Louisville, Kentucky for Treatment and observation.
        The C 57 inoculations were made on May 7th and the Sarcoma 37 on
        June 30, 1950. The experiment was terminated by a frost on
        November 13, 1950, that killed most of the cured animals and
        those undergoing recovery. The details are given below. Since
        the etiological factors in these experiments are
        uncontradictable, the diagnoses of the conditions treated are
        also uncontradictable. Some mice were killed by fighting. They
        are excluded from the statistics, even though they appeared
        cured. The Treatment used was the 10-(12) concentration of the
        serial system of Carbonyl groups with free radical terminals,
        which we designate as the Synthetic Survival Reagent (SSR). We
        sometimes call it the Survival Factor Reagent or Remedy. The
        chemical formula is stated a little farther along. The dose is
        that equal to the smaller dosage of Vitamin B (12) proven
        clinically active. </p>
      <p><b>EXPERIMENT I</b> </p>
      <p>Twenty-five mice C 57 breast tumor transplantation, May 7,
        1950. Five were held as controls, and the rest were divided into
        two sections: (a) 8 mice each receiving 4 minims of the Reagent
        by injection, and (b) 12 mice each receiving 6 minims of the
        Reagent. Treatment was given three days after tumor
        transplantation. </p>
      <p><b>RESULTS</b> </p>
      <p>Controls: Five mice. All of the controls died of cancer from
        the 12th to the 24th day following tumor inoculation. Average
        length of life: 17 days after inoculation. </p>
      <p>Section (a): Eight mice, 4 minims each, the third day after
        inoculation. All tumors had ruptured through on the 11th day and
        started to heal on the 12th day. They were completely healed on
        the 15th day. One of the mice had recurrence which proved fatal
        on the 44th day. On the 64th day one mouse gave birth to 3 young
        which lived until killed by frost on the 126th day after birth.
        Three mice died on the 64th and 66th days tumor free. One was
        killed fighting on the 32nd day. Three lived cured until killed
        by frost on the 190th day. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer:&nbsp; 1 <br>
        Death from fighting: 1 <br>
        Recoveries: 6 <br>
        Average length of life of those which recovered: 127 days. </p>
      <p>Section (b): Twelve mice, 6 minims each, third day after
        inoculation. All tumors ruptured through from the 9th to the
        10th day. All tumors were healed between the 13th and 14th days.
        Three mice died fighting, one on the 4th day, one on the 32nd
        day, and one on the 36th day. One died of cancer on the 38th day
        via recurrence. (On the 62nd day one mouse gave birth to 4
        young. On the 112th day she gave birth to 3 young, her 2nd set).
        The rest, 8 cured mice lived to the 190th day when killed by
        frost, cancer free. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 1 <br>
        Death from fighting: 3 <br>
        Recoveries: 8 <br>
        Average length of life of those which recovered: 190 days. </p>
      <p><b>EXPERIMENT II</b> </p>
      <p>Twenty-five mice were inoculated with C 57 Breast Cancer by
        transplantation on May 26, 1950. Five were used as controls.
        Four were treated with 2 minims, 8 were treated with 4 minims
        and 8 were treated with 6 minims of Reagent. </p>
      <p><b>RESULTS</b> </p>
      <p>Controls: One died fighting the third day. The other four died
        from cancer between the 12th and 18th days. Average length of
        life: l5 1/2 days. </p>
      <p>Section (a): Four mice treated with 2 minims of Reagent. One
        died of cancer on the 24th day. Another died of cancer on the
        26th day. On the 30th day and the 32nd day the other two tumors
        healed. One died cancer free on the 104th day amid the other
        died cancer free on the 128th day. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 2 <br>
        Death from fighting: 0 <br>
        Recoveries: 2 <br>
        Average length of life of those which recovered: 116 days. </p>
      <p>Section (b): Eight mice were treated with 4 minims of Reagent.
        Three tumors healed on the 13th day, the others on the 11th,
        12th, and 16th days. Three mice with healed tumors were killed
        fighting. One died on the 44<sup>th</sup> day, one on the 135th
        day, one on the 139th day, and two were killed by frost on the
        177th day, cancer free. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 0 <br>
        Death from fighting: 3 <br>
        Recoveries: 5 <br>
        Average length of life of those that recovered: 135 2/5 days. </p>
      <p>Section (c): Eight mice treated with 6 minims of Reagent. On
        the 12th day 4 tumors were healed, and on<b> </b>the 15th day
        the other 4 tumors were healed. Two mice were killed fighting on
        the 16th day. One was killed on the 24th day, tumor recurrent.
        One died with cancer on the 34th day, tumor recurrent. One died
        on the 128th day and three were killed by frost on the 177th
        day, all four being cancer free. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 2 (including the one killed fighting on the
        24th day). <br>
        Death from fighting: 3 <br>
        Recoveries: 4 <br>
        Average length of life of those which recovered: 164 3/4 days. </p>
      <p><b>EXPERIMENT III</b> </p>
      <p>Sixteen mice received by transplantation Sarcoma 37<i> </i>on
        June 30, 1950. Four were used as controls, and the rest were
        divided into three sections: (a) 4 mice received 4 minims each
        of the Reagent, (b) 4 mice received 6 minims, and (c) 4 mice
        received 8 minims. </p>
      <p><b>RESULTS</b> </p>
      <p>Controls: Four mice. All of the controls died of cancer between
        the 12th and the 20th day. Average length of life: 16 1/2 days.
      </p>
      <p>Section (a): Four mice, 4 minims each. Two died fighting on the
        10th day and the 14th day before tumors were healed. The tumors
        healed on the other two on the 16th and 17th days; one died on
        the 110th day and the other on the 125th day, both cancer-free.
      </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 0 <br>
        Death from fighting: 2 <br>
        Recoveries: 2 <br>
        Average length of life of those which recovered: 117 1/2 days. </p>
      <p>Section (b): Four mice 6 minims each. One died from cancer on
        the 18th day. Three tumors healed on the 35th day. They lived
        cured until killed by frost on the 136th day. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 1 <br>
        Death from fighting: 0 <br>
        Recoveries: 3 <br>
        Average length of life of those that recovered: 136<i> </i>days.

      </p>
      <p>Section (c): Four mice, 8 minims each. All 4 tumors healed on
        the 30th day. On the 84th day one mouse died fighting, this
        animal being cured. The other 3 remained cured until killed by
        frost on the 136th day. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 0 <br>
        Death from fighting: 1 <br>
        Recoveries: 3 (4 if one includes the mouse killed fighting on
        the 84th day). <br>
        Average length of life of those which recovered: 136 days. </p>
      <p><b>EXPERIMENT IV</b> </p>
      <p>Twenty-four mice were inoculated with Sarcoma 37<i> </i>on
        July 28, 1950 and were treated with the Reagent 5 days later.
        Four mice were held for controls, and the rest were divided into
        three sections: (a) 8 mice receiving 4 minims each, (b) 8 mice
        receiving 6 minims each, and (c) 4 mice receiving 8 minims each.
      </p>
      <p><b>RESULTS</b> </p>
      <p>Controls: Four mice. Two mice died from cancer on the 31st day,
        and two died from cancer on the 36th day. Average length of
        life: 33 1/2 days. </p>
      <p>Section (a): Eight mice, 4 minims each. Two died fighting on
        the 11th day and on the 28th day after inoculation. Two died on
        the 84th day, cancer free. Two were killed by frost on the 108th
        day, cancer free. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 0 <br>
        Death from fighting: 4 <br>
        Recoveries: 4 <br>
        Average length of life of those that recovered: 96 days. </p>
      <p>Section (b): Eight mice, 6 minims each. All tumors healed from
        the 18th day to the 23rd day. Two mice died cancer-free, one on
        the 83rd day, the other on the 101st day. Five of the others
        lived until the 108th day and were killed from frost. One
        survived the frost and lived to the 411th day. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 0 <br>
        Death from fighting: 0 <br>
        Recoveries: 8 <br>
        Average length of life of those that recovered: 142 days. </p>
      <p>Section (c): Four mice, 8 minims each. Two tumors were healed
        on the 10th day, and two were healed on the 12th day. All
        continued in good health, cured, until the 108th day when 3<i> </i>were
        killed by frost. One survived the frost and lived to the 412th
        day. </p>
      <p>Death from cancer: 0 <br>
        Death from fighting: 0 <br>
        Recoveries: 4 <br>
        Average length of life of those that recovered: 184 days. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that the two mice that survived the frost,
        lived for an average of 411 1/2 days and died free of cancer.
        This is equivalent to 41 years after cure on the human scale.
        One of the mice received 6 minims of the Reagent and the other
        received 8 minims. </p>
      <p><b>DISCUSSION:</b> </p>
      <p>The average length of life of the untreated controls was 20½
        days, that of the treated animals that survived the frost was
        411½ days, and those that lived up to the frost and were killed
        by it was 190, 177, 136, and 108 days for the different groups.
        We see that the frost reduced the possible life of the
        recoveries on an average from 411½ days to 153 days. When
        considering the average of Groups II, III, and IV, it must be
        remembered that the animals killed by freezing were all killed
        by the same freeze that killed those in Group I, and that those
        mice in the last three groups were treated 21, 56, and 84 days
        after those in Group I were treated. Therefore, the average
        length of life, while it appears to be shortened in the last 3
        groups, actually was not shortened. </p>
      <p>However, the frost experience makes this experiment valuable in
        that it showed the effect of dosage, for the only frost
        survivors were those that received 6 and 8 minims, and those
        that lived to the frost were those that received the heavier
        dosage for the largest part. </p>
      <p>Two minims showed very poor results as compared with the 6 and
        8 minim dosages, but even the 2 minims gave cures, while the
        controls all died of cancer within three weeks. Hence a minim of
        a solution of one part to a trillion of water is a great deal of
        material when one considers the effects. It is just a few
        millions of molecules, that is all, and only one molecule should
        be able to start a chain reaction under ideal conditions. </p>
      <p>As a comparison of cure rate, with the controls showing 100%
        deaths from cancer and 0 cures, in spite of the frost, the
        experiment is decisive, if any such experiments mean anything
        and it shows the effect of higher oxidation catalysis from the
        heavier dosage in fighting the cold. </p>
      <p>In other experiments we took accounting on the 100th day or the
        200th day instead of letting the frost set the limit as in this
        experiment. The end result runs about the same as the others. </p>
      <p>A matter of interest here is the recurrences of the tumor after
        it healed pre-eminently in 3 cases that received more than 4
        minims each. There were two such that received 6 minims in one
        group, and one in another. The explanation can be found in the
        text. In these animal experiments the word “cure” is used to
        indicate the complete absorption of all tumors, visibly and
        palpably, the healing of the lesion, and the return of health to
        the animal.</p>
