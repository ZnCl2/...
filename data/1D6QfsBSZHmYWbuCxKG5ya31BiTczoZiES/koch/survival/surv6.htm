<p><b><font size=+2>ENERGY PRODUCTION</font></b></center>

<p>In order to explain the therapeutic procedure and reasons for certain
features controlling the care of the patient, a consideration of the energy
producing mechanism will be helpful.
<p>We do not know what energy is, but we can differentiate several forms,
and measure them in various ways. It is the consensus that all energy produced
in the cell, whether by oxidation — namely the Krebs tricarboxylic acid
process — or by fermentation, is the same and is stored as ATP (Adenosin
triphosphate) high-energy bonds, before it is transferred to the working
elements of the cell to be transformed into the energy of work. No other
mechanisms of energy production are recognized, simply because no intermediaries
identifiable with any other processes have been encountered<b>. </b>However,
there is plenty of room for the operation of a far more efficient process
than the Krebs Cycle, which indeed is a decarboxylation process nicely
adapted to the lower forms of life. <i>The clinical data show that the
Krebs system does not fulfill the requirements of the oxidations that maintain
health and that some other process of higher efficiency is present that
provides the Survival Factor we have identified and reproduced for four
decades for clinical use. </i>The intermediaries of this High Efficiency
Process are not to be trapped. <i>They constitute the “smokeless flame”
that supplies the energy as a preferred process. </i>This is our Postulate
that will be supported by practical proof later.
<p>Ochoa and others have calculated that the combustion of a gram mol.
of glucose in the tissues yields 450,000 calories of energy as the total
from the various steps of the Krebs Cycle. This gives 36 (38)<i> </i>high-energy
phosphate bonds with a P/O ratio of three. The free energy ^ F of glucose
is, however, — 691,000 calories, and the energy of combustion ^ H is —
673,000 calories. Thus, 18,100 calories are consumed in the process. The
energy calculated as — 450,000 calories from the Krebs process of oxidations
is therefore — 220,000 calories shy of the — 673,000 calories available
for work, and that are not accounted for in anyway. Therefore, some other
process of higher efficiency than the Krebs Cycle has plenty of room to
operate. Further, the highly inefficient Krebs process (65%) offers no
protection against pathogens as it provides no O/R potentials high enough
to start their combustions, but supports viral and neoplastic processes
instead. It thus does not account for the survival oxidations that are
clinically demonstrated. This process we identify with the FCG dehydrogenations
that start a chain of oxidations via the free radical formed and its addition
of oxygen to produce a peroxide free radical as carrier of the process.
In free circulating toxins the reaction may be pictured thus:

Where
TH is the toxin, and RCO the Survival Reagent Carbonyl Group.
<p>In combined or integrated toxins, the most mobile hydrogen atom is alpha
to a double bond in the most activated region which would be adjacent to
the position of integration with the FCG or its activating double bond.
Free radical production where this hydrogen is removed and addition of
molecular oxygen to form a peroxide free radical causes cleavage into two
parts with Carbonyl terminals. The azomethine double bond is broken, and
the nitrogen oxidized away. The double bond of the new Carbonyl groups
formed by the cleavage activate alpha positioned hydrogen atoms where further
dehydrogenations repeat the process forming more peroxide free radicals
that are the best dehydrogenators and carriers of the oxidation chains
to new molecules of fuel or toxin that enter the field. <i>All of the peroxide
free radicals serve destructively to toxins therefore and constitute what
we referred to as the antitoxic state of structure of the toxin after the
Synthetic Antitoxic Reagent worked on it. </i>Koch,<i> “Cancer Journal,”</i>
October 1924; Philadelphia; <i>“Koch, Investigations,” </i>1924<i>. </i>Here
the process was described as converting toxin into antitoxin.
<p><i>Our Postulate required that the FCG is activated by conjugation with
the double bonds of an ethylene linkage from which it receives electrons.These
two atomic groups are the center of romance in the maintenance of function
and in the protection against toxins that enter the field. They are also
the centers of attack of pathogens in viral, neoplastic and degenerative
diseases. </i>Whether or not a pathogenic response is to be had will depend
upon:
<p><b><i>(a)the presence or absence of a normal quota of molecular oxygen,
and</i></b>
<p><b><i>(b)
</i>upon the firmness of condensation of an amine with the
FCG, that guarantees or destroys its potency.</b>
<p>In case the normal range of energy production cannot cleave the bond,
<i>FCG
function is destroyed and disease results.</i> Then a superiorly efficient
dehydrogenator Carbonyl group must be supplied to burn off the pathogen
as previously stated. <i>This restores the FCG for normal function. This
super dehydrogenator is our Therapeutic Synthetic Survival Factor, (SSR).</i>
<p>The adequate oxygen supply plays two parts:
<p>(1) <i>it is the ultimate electron acceptor when the hydrogen atom removed
from fuel or toxins by FCG is transferred to some oxidase system so the
FCG is free to start new oxidations, and</i>
<p><b>(2)
<i>after the fuel or toxin is dehydrogenated to become a free
radical, molecular oxygen must be at hand to convert it into a peroxide
free radical to continue the oxidation process.</i></b>
<p>Otherwise the free radical would under hypoxia add to the closest reactive
group that would accept it, and this is the double bond of the ethylene
linkage that activates the FCG. The pathogen would thus integrate with
the host cell’s energy producing mechanism where it would draw off energy
for its own vegetation or to transfer ectopically, and produce disease,
and at the same time block the activation of the FCG and stop further FCG
dehydrogenations. Thus oxidation is blocked and the consequent colloidal
degenerations would follow to produce further anoxia. Thus anoxia is essential
to the integration of the pathogen with the grana when the FCG is still
operating. However, the moment the pathogen is added to its ethylenic activating
double bond, electrons are no longer contributed to it, so the FCG is no
longer able to dehydrogenate, and the grana appears to be out of commission,
destroyed and lost. <i>Ectopic uncontrolled transfer of energy to various
secreting and contractile or conducting functional systems referred to
above we hold to be the cause of allergy.</i>
<p>Since creatine did not interfere with FCG function as did guanidine,
and since it is the only amine possibly that forms high-energy phosphate
bonds, it was easy to assume that it played a role in the transfer of energy
produced from the oxidation of fuel to high-energy phosphate bonds as of
ATP. It would accommodate this transfer by condensing with the FCG to form
an azomethine bond until enough energy had been generated to admit phosphoric
acid into the bond and unite it with the amine group of creatine sending
the creatine phosphate off as a high-energy carrier. The FCG is thus free
to start further dehydrogenations physiologically. However, if the amine
condensed with the FCG forms a tight bond not separable under normal ranges
of energy production, as did guanidine in the parathyroid experiments,
the whole train of pathological events must follow. For this reason it
is well to inquire into the sources of such pathogenic amines. <i>One is
the production of toxic amines in the acid colon by various bacteria that
decarboxylate amino acids.</i> In many people, the intestinal flora is
firmly entrenched and converts the food into one’s poisons that serve as
the vanguard of disease. Animal proteins are the main sources of these
toxic amines, and sulfides, while vegetables, cereals, and fruits supply
plenty of protein and at the same time do not support decarboxylating
germs. The intestine must be kept at a range of pH above 7, since the decarboxylations
progress best at a pH of 3.5 to 6 when mediated by the Streptococcus fecalis
and so many others.
<p>The fungus found always in cancer is an amine producer that could initiate
the pathogenesis as explained above, with its whole train of symptoms.
And the modern antibiotic amine poisons, especially those that attack the
liver and cause suspensions of consciousness like the sulfa drugs, and
any in fact, are to be scrutinized with great suspicion as the cancer death
rate his increased so greatly since they have become so widely used. Sulfides
and sulfhydryl derived from food add to the double bonds that activate
the FCG and thus block its activation powers. The intestinal flora again
is to be considered with the diet if one is to maintain a normal function
of the FCG as an energy producer and protector against pathogens.<b> </b>Especially
during the Treatment period, when a dehydrogenator Carbonyl group of highest
efficiency has been administered, one must protect the oxidation progression
that follows from being blocked, as can take place through permanent free
radicals as the oxides of nitrogen. Gas anesthesia should never be used
in connection with this Therapy. Highly polar double bonds can also add
to and quench the free radicals of the recovery process and block it, so
certain terpenoids and even perfumes, and especially acrolein and polymerizing
acrylic aldehydes from frying pans, are to be avoided in this regime.<i>The
proofs of our Postulate are serious practical facts.</i>
<p>Some medications absorbed into the tissue colloids may alter the steric
set-up so that the remedial Carbonyl group which ordinarily could attack
the hydrogen atom to be removed perpendicularly to the plane of the conjugation
of its carrier carbon atom with the double bond that activates it, now
finds a distortion that hinders this line of attack. Opiates and coal tar
drugs, and especially aspirin, appear to interfere in this way.
<p>The atomic set-up of the Reagent itself that carries the Super-high-efficiency
Carbonyl group must offer a steric advantage in each disease where it is
applied. For example: in Hog Cholera, diphenoquinone proved 100% efficient
in several epidemics, while it proved 100% worthless in Rabies, and the
serial system of Carbonyl groups used in Hog Cholera proved 100% worthless,
while it was 86% efficient in Rabies in terminal cases. Both diseases kill
100%, within 3 to 5 days. Rabies is neurotropic always and Hog Cholera
rarely before the terminal hours. Our search has been for a molecule carrier
of the Survival Efficient Carbonyl group that is equally applicable in
all diseases where drug interference has not modified the steric set-up.
This will be discussed later on. It will be seen, however, that to identify
the high efficiency oxidation system, we consider normal to the cell, as
of the same order as the therapeutic substitute used to rescue the FCG
and restore normal function and structure, a few comparisons will have
to be made. For example: that they are of the same order is seen in being
blocked by the same agencies as anoxia, sulfhydryl, and that their processes
are blocked by permanent free radicals, highly polar double bonds, etc.
Likewise, the restitution program, that follows the freeing of the FCG
system of its pathogen by the Synthetic Reagent, is the normal process.
So <i>the Synthetic Reagent fits into the mechanism with equal grace, as
did the FCG before it was attacked by the pathogen.</i> Likewise, since
recoveries from viral and neoplastic diseases that could never be combated
successfully before are accomplished by the natural resources of the body
after the Synthetic Survival Reagent is used, they both fit the cell chemistry,
but each in its respective capacity for survival. Since the recovery mechanism
includes cyclic reactions at definite periods never seen in medicine before,
just as the cure of the pathologies involved were never seen before, a
deeper grasp on tissue physiology is made possible and a wider range of
expertness can be acquired. Any successful clinician will recognize that
expertness in this Therapy depends upon study and experience, and some
new viewpoints must be adopted. To illustrate let us review a few toxic
cases.
<p>These cases show the characteristics of the recovery process, which
itself gives evidence as to the nature of the etiological factor. Only
the most pertinent data is used. It will be seen that each case presents
a long pretreatment control period that definitely established the downward
trend of health with the steady and often rapid advance of the diseases.
Thus the best possible control for comparison of pretreatment and post-treatment
progress was followed, and no confusing variables were permitted, as for
example, other medications or treatment measures. Likewise factors that
interfere with recovery were eliminated, so that the contest lay plainly
between the Therapy, the patient’s cooperation, and physical advantage
on the one hand, and the disease forces on the other. <i>The Remedy is
named the Synthetic Survival Reagent (SSR). There are two forms, the Quinone
form which when used is so named, and the Carbonyl group chain form with
free radical terminals. This is simply called the Synthetic Survival Reagent
(SSR) or given a similar appellation.</i> The quinone dose is two micrograms,
and the SSR, two micrograms, millimicrograms and micro micrograms
in water, given intramuscularly or under the skin.
<p><i>With few exceptions, the case records are taken from Federal Court
and Federal Trade Commission Testimony, where they were proven factually
uncontradictable.
</i>Some of the exhibits have been reproduced for
use in this book. This policy was adopted to give the student full confidence
in the proofs of a Thesis as unusual as this one.
<p>A case of toxic nodular goiter illustrates some of the main features
of the oxidation mechanism of our Postulate.
