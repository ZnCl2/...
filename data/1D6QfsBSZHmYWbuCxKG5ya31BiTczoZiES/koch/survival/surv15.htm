<p><b><font size=+2>TERMINATION OF THE MALIGNANT PHASE RESTORATION OF THE
FUNCTIONAL CARBONYL GROUP</font></b></center>

<p><i>We have already explained the two activated Carbonyl groups of our
Postulate: One that initiates the oxidation progression and transfers the
energy produced to carrier phosphate bonds. The other receives the energy
from these bonds, and passes it on to the working mechanism of the cell,
the contractile, the conductile, the secreting, or the mitotic fibrilla
and units.</i> They can both be blocked in their functions, by inactivation
of their activating ethylenic linkages, or by a firm condensation with
an amine group of some pathogen. When this takes place energy does not
pass to the functional unit by the normal controlled route and only fermentation
or Krebs Cycle energy is produced to pass directly into the working unit.
Thus excessive contraction as the spasms of bronchial asthma, or excessive
secretion as the secretion of hay fever, or excessive synapse closure as
in some phase of insanity, a compulsion neurosis, etc., or impulse generation
as of ticdoulereau, or excessive uncontrolled mitosis as of neoplasia will
have to be the result in the tissue that is affected. The functional fault
is demonstrated in the uncontrolled nature of the act, and all may be classified
as allergies (Koch, <i>Natural Immunity</i>, 1934, and <i>Cancer and Its
Allied Diseases</i>, 1929, where we attributed the abnormal energy transfer
to a photosensitization process).
<p><i>The correction is, of course, the restoration of the normal FCG activity
in both capacities.</i> That this can be accomplished no matter what the
allergy happens to be is illustrated further in this section. Many more
cases could be given in all categories, especially in the common allergies
where the cure rate ran over 80% in the Court Testimony, but what is given
is enough to illustrate.
<p>The speed of the recovery is shown very well in the allergies of the
respiratory system, and in the cure of the compulsion neurosis case, but
it is also seen in the neoplastic category, too, as is illustrated immediately
by biopsy tests or in the long run by the surgical tests outlined farther
on. <i>It is to be emphasized that the cure or correction of the disease
in any instance is the restoration of the normal FCG function and the cleaning
out of the debris and restoration of the normal structure and function,
as the case requires.</i> Then the normal being established, it can be
broken down perhaps again when circumstances force this change. There may
be some immunity or increased resistance due to a Carbonyl substitution
for the ethylenic activation of the FCG, at any rate, though many cases
stay well after being cured of cancer for several decades, there is no
absolutely permanent and impregnable protection, and an understanding of
the pathogenesis and what food diet means, is the best assurance of maintaining
health after recovery.
<p>There are some forms of primary cancer of the liver that are grossly
pathognomonic. In such cases the expert surgeon can make a firm diagnosis
without the biopsy, and he does so to protect his patient from embolism
and hemorrhage incident thereto. This is not a matter of neglect, but of
good judgment, and usually practiced. The type of greatest interest is
that of diffuse distribution of myriads of small lesions over the surface
and between the somewhat larger nodules that press up from underneath.
The “feel” is also characteristic. In such cases there is deep jaundice
because the smaller bile ducts are compressed or blocked by tumor tissue.
The biopsy is characteristic also so that one can tell what the microscopic
picture is from the gross features. In the diffuse type, the small surface
nodules are much of the same size as if originating simultaneously, and
thus speaking for a multiple origin of the carcinosis, a generalized equal
distribution of the pathogen. As these nodules are smaller than many inside
the liver, it is evident that the inner ones had an earlier start. Likewise,
often, one lobe of the liver is more affected, especially the right lobe.
Thus, in the beginning of the disease, the amount of pathogen is not so
great that it makes an attack throughout all at one time. It is used up
in one locality. However, at the terminal stage the myriads of small nodules
equally and independently distributed speak for a swamping of the system
with the carcinogen as if there were more toxins present than liver cells
to combine with. Such a case will be described, and also a baby with a
massive primary cancer of the liver proven by biopsy. This case is well
described in the mother’s affidavit from which several points are reproduced.
The series of photographs are also instructive. This information was sent
us by Dr. M----, our collaborator, who had charge of the case, with his
notes. The writer did not see this patient.
<p><b>PRIMARY CANCER OF THE LIVER</b>
<br>CASE No. 14
<p>Judy McW., three months old. “After a normal birth, Judy, before the
age of six weeks, showed signs of illness. Her abdomen was enlarged, she
was restless, and her face did not show the repose of a healthy baby. Her
physician could not find anything wrong with her until his check-up and
examination at the end of her eighth week. At that time the doctor found
her abdomen hard and much distended. During the period from August 20,
1948, to August 27, 1948, a tentative diagnosis of cancer was made and
X-Rays were given although the X-Ray technician stated it was hopeless
to expect a recovery.”
<p>“By the time Judy was three months old the attending physician and another
surgeon made an exploratory operation on Judy’s abdomen at which time a
biopsy was taken. The physicians reported to us that the biopsy showed
a high degree of malignancy, which involved 85% of the child’s liver. They
told us that there was nothing that could be done to save Judy’s life;
that we should take her home and make her as comfortable as possible for
the few days she could live.”
<p>“Her life expectancy was placed at 21 days. We were told not to remove
the bandage from her abdomen lest the stitches burst out. It was the doctor’s
opinion that the incision in her abdomen would not heal.”
<p>“Dr. Koch’s Therapy was given by Dr. N. T. M., of Cisco, Texas. The
dose was injected into Judy’s hip on September 18, 1948. At this time and
during the course of Judy’s recovery, Mr. N took a series of color pictures
showing her progress. Previously he had taken two pictures at six weeks
of age and before the diagnosis of cancer. The series of pictures gives
a good idea of her case.
<p>“At the time the injection was given, Judy’s abdomen was so much enlarged
that she could hardly breathe due to upward pressure on her lungs. The
circulation on the surface had greatly increased and she had a bluish cast
from a diffusion of blood in and just under the skin. Veins under the skin
of the abdomen were plainly visible. The abdomen was very firm, even hard.
At the time the Koch Treatment was given, Dr. M. expressed no hope of securing
a recovery as he thought the case was too far advanced.
<p>“Within ten days after the Treatment Judy showed definite reactions
which raised our hopes. Shortly, she began to pass large quantities of
mucous with bowel movements. She also passed a large amount of water in
the normal manner, sometimes requiring as many as twenty diaper changes
per day. No medication was used after the injection of the Koch Treatment,
and only minor changes were made in the baby’s diet, Apple juice was substituted
for orange juice, and Judy liked it. After Treatment was given and until
recovery was practically complete, only one doctor saw Judy that was a
doctor residing at Azle, Texas, who removed the stitches from the healed
incision about the middle of October 1948.
<p>“Soon Judy began to gain weight and her abdomen rapidly reduced in size
and became more soft and pliant so that she could breathe better. The hard
growth receded toward the lower right side. By December 25, 1948, she had
a healthy and normal appearance as the pictures mentioned before show,
but some traces of the growth remained.
<p>“Later, about May 12, 1949, I had her examined by a doctor in Paris,
Texas. He could find nothing, after which he was told of the baby’s former
illness and he could still find no trouble.
<p>“On November 11, 1949, Judy and her mother appeared before a group of
physicians and surgeons especially interested in cancer who met at the
Blackstone Hotel in Fort Worth, Texas. While before this group, more than
one doctor examined Judy and nothing was found wrong with her.
<p>“On February 18, 1950, both parents and Judy attended a meeting of physicians
at Tampa, Florida. Here Judy was again shown to the group of doctors. These
were most friendly to the Koch Treatment. Judy is now past two years old.
She has shown a normal growth and development, normal mental development,
and absolutely no abnormalities that we are aware of. She is very active,
mischievous, and friendly. She has had practically no illness after taking
the Koch Treatment and recovering from cancer.” These statements by Judy’s
parents are signed and notarized.
<p>Dr. M---- sent a more technical account, which adds nothing to the facts
given by the mother. This mother’s report should be studied. The observations
are well made, and any physician who is experienced, can get a great deal
of information out of them. The steady progress of the pretreatment period
is plainly established. The manner of absorption of the neoplasm shows
it was not of the diffuse type as the next case demonstrates, but was a
massive cancer starting in the right lobe of the liver, and of very high
(grade IV) malignancy no doubt. The block in the portal circulation was
not due to destruction of the vein, but to simple pressure, and the quick
relief had, shows also in the better bowel and kidney action as the massive
growth underwent absorption. This case should be compared with <b>Case
No. 15</b>, “Diffuse Type Primary Cancer of the Liver.”

<p><b>DIFFUSE TYPE PRIMARY CANCER OF THE LIVER</b>
<br>CASE No. 15
<br>Prof. R. S. L.
<p>Mr. Geraldo A., early in March 1941, showed loss of appetite, progressive
loss in weight and weakness. Dr. O. A. L. examined him and found a large
tumor in the abdomen. The patient was conveyed to Rio de Janeiro and placed
in the hospital of the Beneficiencia Portuguese where he was operated by
Professors R. L. and J. M. G. and helped by the assistant physician. Laparotomy
disclosed an extensive neoplasm of the liver that had infiltrated the colon
extensively. So extensive were the infiltrations and so widely had it spread,
the operators decided it was impossible to give any surgical aid. Further,
the type of liver cancer was so definite it was not necessary to remove
a biopsy to add to the information already provided by the laparotomy findings.
<p>The writer examined the patient together with his surgeons and Prof.
R. S. L. seven days later. The patient could not turn in bed, was vomiting
black bile or blood continuously, could not eat, and was of a dark jaundice
color, very thin, in fact so emaciated that one could feel the diffuse
nodules over the whole liver surface as it bulged forward and extended
down into the pelvis. His doctors said he might live a week or two but
certainly not longer.
<p>We gave him an injection of a Parabenzoquinone solution, 2cc. containing
two micrograms in solution, on July 15, 1941. The patient, who up to that
time had been showing only a light fever, had a severe chill three days
later, and a fever of 39&deg;C. On July 25th, he belched much gas, and
had intense gastric pain for only a short time. The tumor steadily absorbed,
and concomitantly his weight and strength returned. The jaundice faded
and he gained 20 pounds in weight, was able to walk, and returned to his
home in Barbacena where his health gradually returned. On October 3rd,
he had another reaction with a chill and fever of 39&deg;C., and a general
oedema was shown. Everything yielded spontaneously, and the patient gaining
then over 40 pounds had completely recovered and was back to work. The
report in April 1953, and again in 1955 shows he is still in excellent
health and cured.
<p><b>CANCER OF THE STOMACH</b>
<br>CASE No. 16
<p>Mr. Wesley R. had a past history of severe gastric ulcer from 35 years
of age until he reached 50. When he was 69 he had a more serious stomach
trouble — pain and vomiting, with rapid emaciation, and loss of strength.
Pyloric obstruction became complete. Several physicians made examination
and found a tumor at the pyloric region. Dr. Demling operated him on June
28, 1926. A gastroenterostomy was done and a part of the tumor removed.
The pathological report follows:
<center>
<p><img SRC="15018.jpg"></center>

<p>It is evident from this pathological report that the whole neoplasm
was not removed and this is confirmed by the early recurrence of obstruction
by the neoplasm.
<p>Improvement was noted for only a few weeks and then the trouble recurred
with more pain than ever and constant vomiting, rapid emaciation and cachexia.
Dr. Harrison brought him to me on August 20, 1926. My examination revealed
a large fixed tumor mass filling the epigastrium and extending below the
level of the umbilicus. It was fixed to the liver, and bulged outward so
as to be plainly visible and caused practically complete obstruction of
the gastric outlet. The supraclavicular space on the left side showed a
fixed lymphatic tumor as large as a walnut. There was considerable hemolysis.
One dose of the serial systems of Carbonyl groups was given and recovery
set in so that its effects were observed in a few weeks. The obstruction
soon disappeared and he regained about twenty pounds to reach his normal
weight in five months. Examination after the twenty-fourth week revealed
no tumefaction. Radiographs show no tumefaction, but a stomach about one-third
normal size, motility good. Only at the third, twelfth and twenty-fourth
week periods were there reactions of note. Fever, tenderness in the stomach,
loss of appetite, and a general achiness lasted about three days and then
a much more pronounced improvement set in after each reaction. This improvement
continued until full recovery was established. He has not had any stomach
trouble since and enjoys vigorous health, works every day and walks to
town in all sorts of weather as well as he did at fifty years of age. We
heard from him last when he was 92 years of age and in good health, 23
years after Treatment. Certainly the restoration of the Survival chemistry
was satisfactory in this case.
<p><b>CANCER OF THE STOMACH</b>
<br>CASE No. 17
<br>Dr. W. Mantor
<p>This was a case of cancer of the stomach equally far advanced as the
former. His trouble started as indigestion in 1940. Radiographs revealed
no pathology then. It soon changed to a progressive stomach complaint with
constant pain and frequent vomiting, rapid loss of strength, and a weight
loss from 150 to 120 pounds in less than a year. Several well-reputed clinics
were tried in this year but the disease progressed. Radiographs made May
12, 1941, at the Tyler Clinic at Omaha gave a firm diagnosis of cancer
of the stomach. At least two-thirds of the stomach wall was involved as
the plates show. Exploratory operation at the Mayo Clinic within a week
revealed massive involvement of the stomach wall, the pancreas, the glands
about the aorta, and the liver. The supraclavicular glands of the
left side were also involved. They gave a diagnosis of far advanced cancer,
primary in the stomach, entirely inoperable, and hopeless, and sent him
home.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15020.jpg">
<p><img SRC="15022.jpg"></center>

<p>On June 16 he was carried into Dr. Mantor’s office for Treatment. Dr.
Mantor’s description includes the following, “extreme exhaustion, anemia,
hemolysis, cachexia. No crenation of red blood cells in a one percent NaCl
solution (all should crenate). Linear scar from exploratory operation,
massive induration of the epigastrium, readily palpable and bulging forward
so one could see it easily as he lay down. Since one year previously an
X-ray of the stomach showed no pathology whatsoever, this neoplasm was
very malignant and rapidly progressive and destructive.”
<p>One injection of 2 cc. of the 12X dilution of the serial system of Carbonyl
groups was given June 16, 1941. In a few days he started to feel better
and soon took up the farm he had to leave because of the sickness. Nine
weeks after the Treatment, examination could reveal no tumor mass whatever.
He had gained weight, color improved, and was more active. By the 12th
week, he could walk down the street rapidly without losing his breath and
reported he was eating well and was feeling fine. By that time he had been
working on his farm. There was no more cachexia. Dr. Mantor gave him a
second injection on September 8, 1941, during his 12th week. He continued
towards complete recovery. A third injection was given two years later,
September 1943.
<p>Radiograph III, taken on June 14, 1944, shows his stomach after complete
recovery. He was still well in 1947 when we last heard.

<p>Radiograph III. Taken June 14, 1944, after recovery. These radiographs
are court exhibits.
<p>The Survival Chemistry of course is concerned with the oxidation of
burnable substances for energy production. Fuels and disease producing
toxins, which come within its O/R potential ranges, are destroyed. The
energy is used for doing work in the performance of function, and for the
growth and repair. One can estimate the thoroughness with which the FCG
system is restored by the rate of tissue reconstruction after the most
devastating of cancers. The following two cases will illustrate.
<p><b>METASTATIC CANCER OF THE BOWEL</b>
<br>CASE No. 18
<br>Dr. F. Richards
<p>Mr. J. K. was 42 years old when X-Ray studies and exploratory operation
showed widely metastasizing cancer of the splenic flexure of the colon,
which caused complete obstruction. A colostomy was made at the Henry Ford
Hospital at Detroit. The neoplasm spread rapidly throughout the abdomen
and perforated the abdominal wall in several places as cauliflower
growths with central fistulous openings that discharged feces and foul
necrotic material. His general health deteriorated rapidly under the toxic
strain, and the neoplasms grew proportionately rapidly under the same impulse.
He had been a strong muscular man of 180 pounds swinging a heavy hammer
all day when he took sick, and after the surgical aid he lost to 135 pounds,
and kept on losing. The necrotic tissue in the abdominal wall had such
a terrible odor it was necessary to slice away the most gangrenous part,
and cauterize the borders to block the bleeding. The cauliflower fistulae
took on greater speed thereafter. He was sent home to die, his case being
entirely hopeless. On the way home he was examined at our clinic. Dr. Richards
gave him an injection of the SSR Reagent on April 3, 1942. At this time
the cauliflower growths were from 4 to 8 centimeters in diameter and equally
high. During the following three weeks he did not show much improvement.
Then he took a heavy reaction with such great congestion of the exposed
cancer masses that another injection had to be given. The second Treatment
was given at the beginning of the fourth week. Thereafter the bleeding
quickly stopped and his whole condition rapidly improved. The cauliflower
masses melted away and the abdomen was healed without leaving a visible
scar. Palpation could reveal no more tumor masses after four more months.
His bowels started to move normally through the rectum, and the colostomy
stopped functioning. He gained weight to 113 pounds in June, and to 180
pounds in September when we sent him back to the Ford Hospital for repair
of the colostomy, after he had returned to work a few weeks earlier.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15030.jpg"></center>

<p>This X-Ray was taken of Mr. J. K. on December 27, 1941 before Treatment.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15032.jpg"></center>

<p>His liver and other FCG’s that had been blocked by the carcinogen certainly
went back to work for him, for he not only could digest food efficiently
but was able to build up his tissue at the same time. His gain is shown
in part in the Ford Hospital records as noted by Dr. Bohr. For the month
of July, the record notes that he gained from 113 pounds at the first of
the month to 175 pounds at the end of the month, that is a gain of 62 pounds
in a month, or just two pounds or one kilo per day. This gain, we must
add, was made on our vegetable, fruits and cereal diet, without any meat
or animal proteins. The Ford Hospital documents, that were part of the
Official Court Record, are worth studying. Some are appended. This gain
in good solid flesh and blood on a vegetarian diet is not just an incident
in this case. It is our experience, and meat eaters who cannot curb their
appetites for animal food, should give these facts some consideration.
<p>The following significant statements are taken from the Henry Ford Hospital
record, the interval history taken by Dr. Bohr on August 28, 1942. “Patient
left hospital April 1 of this year with a diagnosis of fungating Cancer
of Colon and a terminal prognosis. On the way home that day, he received
one of Dr. Koch’s ‘Cancer Cure Shots.’ . . . On July 1 he weighed 113 pounds,
but from that time on he began feeling stronger and gained weight. By the
middle of July, his wound was completely healed. His weight was 175 pounds
at the end of July and he has maintained this weight ever since. He enters
the hospital now, after being back to work for three weeks, for the first
stage in a colostomy closure.”
<p>This patient was examined at the Ford Hospital every year for many years
and always found well. When last heard from he was still well. The radiographs
show the obstruction of the bowel during the first weeks of his illness.
The radiographs made after recovery are the same as any normal person’s.
No adhesions or other sequelae are found, showing that the disease that
existed formerly no longer exists.
<p><b>What the Case Teaches:</b>
<p>Firstly, the Ford Hospital “General Memo” tells that they could not
enter the abdomen to attempt a resection of the growth as it had infiltrated
throughout and invaded the abdominal wall throughout. When one considers
the position of the splenic flexure of the colon, back against the posterior
abdominal wall and diaphragm, the distance to the umbilicus is twelve or
more inches and as it had finally ruptured through the belly wall in three
different places as large cauliflower fistulous growths, the amount of
involvement was about total. It is important to realize this and also that
the amount of infection, throughout the whole neoplastic involvement, was
tremendous. Fecal fistulas always heal with a great amount of scarring
and distortion and epidermal change consequent thereto. But in this case
there was no scar left, nor epidermal change left to mark the areas of
neoplastic or infectious involvement. The abdomen wall healed right through
the skin without leaving a mark. The abdomen looked as clear as any normal
baby’s that had never been sick. Just as the bowel function was restored
so the colostomy became obsolete. So too, the only sequelae to the neoplasm
were completely restored structure and function.
<p>To the regular physician this fact is not comprehensible, and indeed
if the other patients to be demonstrated here did not do likewise, one
would scarcely have the courage to make this report. There is an explanation,
however, and the case is offered with others as a demonstration of this
explanatory observation. It is this.
<i>The recoveries in these cases after
the SSR is used are different from those that take place under the flux
of regular ordinary healing. This is due to the fact that after the SSR
does its work no toxin, either carcinogenic or from a disease’s germs,
is integrated with the protective fibrosis or the cancer cells.</i> Before
the SSR was used the toxin content was tremendous, if the odor, cachexia
and rapid tissue destruction mean anything. The state of integration as
we explain here, and in the Appendix, actually invited oxidative destruction
of the toxins of all types, so that the fibrosis and cancer cells became
obsolete and were absorbed by the ordinary autolytic procedures, so that
nothing was left to interfere with normal tissue reconstruction. So normal
reconstruction was not prevented and the normal rectifying tendency had
full sway<i>. It is such an observation, so often repeated, that makes
one think that the normal state of man was such that he did, at one time
in his perfect state, really possess an FCG of the order of the SSR or
even more efficient.</i>
<p><b>SARCOMA OF THE UTERUS</b>
<br>CASE No. 19
<p>Mrs. McA., aged 43, was first seen on July 29, 1929. She was bedfast,
emaciated, and exhausted. She had not rallied well from an abdominal exploration
done by a very good surgeon two weeks previously to ascertain the cause
of severe and frequent crises of vomiting and pain in the gall bladder
region. The abdomen was found widely involved with neoplastic development
from deep in the pelvis to the diaphragm, with the stomach, liver, and
intervening structures heavily invaded. This was identified as the cause
of the pain. A biopsy specimen was removed. The abdomen was closed as inoperable.
The surgeon, Dr. Trimby, gave a biopsy report to us personally when he
referred the patient. It showed a small round cell sarcoma of high-grade
malignancy.
<p>Our examination revealed a patient in bed, exhausted with weak pulse,
sighing respiration, vascular shock, cyanosis, and an abdomen bulging with
tumor masses, particularly on the lower left side. The liver and epigastric
involvement could be readily palpated besides. The incision was not healed
and appeared to be infiltrated with neoplastic extensions. This incision
was made over the largest tumefaction within and it seemed that the neoplastic
tissue underneath had invaded the abdominal wall. A photograph was taken
and 2 micro micrograms of the Synthetic Survival Reagent were given.
<p>She responded well up to the sixth week, gaining in strength and becoming
rapidly free of the pain and vomiting attacks. However, at the beginning
of the sixth week she started a reaction that continued to the middle of
the ninth week.
<p>It featured vomiting of a quite continuous nature whether she took food
or not. No food was held. The pain feature that was so severe before Treatment
was a minor matter, however. She lost weight and strength, and the dehydration
was difficult to overcome. However, with the closing of the reaction at
the middle of the ninth week she became very hungry and took on weight
rapidly. For a few weeks she gained at the rate of five pounds a week,
then at the rate of two pounds a week until she had reached 180 pounds.
A slow gain followed to 200 pounds and then a slow loss to 180 pounds.
Her health was fully established. All the tumefactions had disappeared
before the end of the twelfth week after the Treatment. She is still in
perfect health, according to our last report.

<p>Photograph II, Taken after neoplasms were absorbed.
<p>Another way to estimate the restoration of FCG activity is in the cure
of Leukemia. Here in the terminal phases, the exhaustion of the blood forming
organs can be so complete that leukopenia instead of the former leukocytosis
is observed. The FCG’s required for cell construction are blocked, no doubt,
by the carcinogen and both the red cell count and the white cell count
are not able to be restored until the FCG’s are liberated and can go back
to work again. The following cases are illustrative. Here the bad effects
of irradiation are to be observed as well as those of the natural carcinogen.
One might compare the response in a natural case of acute lymphatic leukemia
with other cases that have been irradiated, or have reached the point of
exhaustion and impending death. These latter states are about the same,
showing how irradiation works on the blood forming organs. It kills them,
as does the natural pathogen. Red and white blood cell restoration demonstrates
FCG restoration.
<p><b>ACUTE LYMPHATIC LEUKEMIA IN A BOY</b>
<br>CASE No. 20
<br>Dr. A. Guzman
<p>P. F., age 12 years, treated January 8, 1956, by Dr. Guzman. His family
history denied leukemia. The onset in the boy was rather rapid after a
period of ill health. The symptoms were classical with petechial hemorrhages
under the skin and in the mouth, cough, symptoms of anemia with great weakness.
The red cell count was 1,500,000, the white were 232,000, lymphocytes in
very great predominance, large mononoclonals and immature forms. The physical
examination showed a blanched out boy with hemorrhagic spots of various
sizes under the skin generally, especially the legs, arms and body. The
gums bled, and the breath was foul. The mediastinal dullness was increased
mostly to the right. The spleen and lymph glands were only moderately enlarged.
He had a cough, was very weak and showed fever.
<p>The injection of the Synthetic Survival Reagent was given, 2cc. of the
10-(12) solution. He was put on a supportive vegetarian diet. The recovery
was steady with periodic reactions of chills and fever, general achiness,
etc., as characterizes the recoveries under this Treatment.
<p>The results showed in an improvement after each reaction until in August
1956, he was completely well. There were no signs of the disease left.
The hemorrhagic spots had disappeared and the mouth was clear, the breath
clean. The spleen and lymph glands were no longer enlarged. The spleen
could not be palpated, and he was strong, had gained a normal weight and
nutrition, etc. His platelets count was then 350,000, the red cells 5,100,000,
white cells 7,200, polymorphs 76%. The coagulation time was normal. The
only reaction of a focal nature was a sore throat, and that in a boy is
difficult to interpret. However, it might mean that this was the site of
the pathogenic toxin or virus production. This is especially suspicious,
since the mediastinal glands were enlarged and the mediastinal dullness
returned to normal with the recovery.
<p><b>LYMPHATIC LEUKEMIA WITH TERMINAL EXHAUSTION</b>
<br>CASE No. 21
<br>Dr. Julian Baldor
<p>Teddy S., age 14 years, in February, 1949, when treated by Dr. Baldor.
He was referred by Dr. C with the report, “Chronic leukemia (proved by
bone marrow biopsy) with hemorrhagic diathesis.” The exhaustion of the
blood forming organs was seen in the fall in the blood count of whites
to only 15,000, while the hemoglobin was 40% and the red cell count 2,150,000.
His first diagnosis of leukemia was made six months previously from the
high lymphocyte count, the hemorrhages under the skin and the gums, the
weakness, enlarged spleen and lymph glands, the fever, pains in his legs
and arms and the anemia. He was given 57 blood transfusions. These pepped
him up a little at the start, but soon were found to be less effective
and finally to be of no help at all. In fact, they were wasted on him.
It was then he was sent to Dr. Baldor for the Koch Treatment.
<p>Dr. Baldor’s examination showed an exhausted bleached-out boy, suffering
with pain and fright, depressed, unable to walk, with an offensive odor
from the mouth, profuse gingival bleeding, and generalized hemorrhagic
spots under the skin. The mediastinal dullness was definitely enlarged
and so also were the lymph glands generally increased with tubular breathing
in the right lung base, and moist rales over the entire field. The liver
and spleen were enlarged and tender. He was put on fruit juices and intestinal
lavage for two days and then given 2 cc. of the SSR serial system of Carbonyl
groups. The fever at the time was 102&deg;F.
<p>In a week he was sent home with a normal temperature. The spleen and
liver were reduced in size, but not yet normal, the bloody patches had
changed from a dark purple to a greenish color, and no new ones had formed.
They then turned to yellow and finally disappeared. Nine weeks later he
returned to Dr. Baldor for a check-up. He was able to walk and had gained
12 pounds in weight. The blood picture was red cells, 3,350,000, hemoglobin
52%, and leukocytes 8,000. At the twelfth week, he gave a reaction showing
slight pains in the extremities for a few days, and a little epistaxis.
The blood count then showed 4,000,000 red cells, white cells 6,500, hemoglobin
72%. He had gained 25 pounds in weight, felt perfectly normal in all respects:
feeling, behavior, and in his physical findings.
<p>It was reported to Dr. Baldor in 1957 that Teddy S. at the age of 21
was examined for military service and classified 1-A. This was seven years
after being treated for what normally is a 100% fatal disease, in its terminal
stage. Upon knowledge of his full previous medical history, he was re-classified.
Dr. Baldor reported at that time that Teddy S. had held the best of health
since his recovery, is married and is the father of a robust healthy child.
<p>It is to be noted that after being seen by Dr. Baldor he did not receive
even one blood transfusion, but gained in all respects on a vegetarian
diet. It might appeal to one that the extreme exhaustion is not only a
matter of lack of nutritional elements to support cell function, but even
more a lack of energy to perform the functions of work and nutrition. The
impediment to the mechanisms concerned blocked all activities including
the burning of all sorts of toxins absorbed from the bowel, the mouth,
tonsils, etc. Then, with the liberation of the tissue’s FCG systems, every
impediment was burned out of the way and was kept out of the way thereafter.
<p><b>MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA WITH IRRADIATION LEUKOPENIA IN AN ADULT</b>
<br>CASE No. 22
<br>Dr. Julian Baldor
<p>Mrs. J. W. L., age 47 years, came on December 7th, 1948. She gives a
history of an acute process with chills, fever, nausea and perspiration,
six months previously following an influenza attack. Examination showed
enlarged liver, enlarged spleen and enlarged cervical glands. The breath
was offensive and the gums were bleeding. Some dental abscesses were present.
Her blood picture showed red cells, 3,160,000, hemoglobin 57% and white
count, 14,800, ploys, 88%, lymphocytes 10%, monocytes 2%. Both myelocytes
and premyelocytes were present.
<p>She had received two courses of X-Rays over the spleen and long bones,
each of 600 R at an interval of 6 weeks. This did not improve her condition.
The bleeding, weakness, fever and pains continued getting worse. Bone marrow
slides showed definite abnormalities suggestive of Myelogenous Leukemia.
<p>Because of the irradiation two doses of the SSR Reagent were given,
one on December 13, 1948, and the other five days later. The improvement
was prompt. The fever had left in five days. The enormous spleen that reached
to the left iliac region, and the enlarged liver showed improvement and
were less painful. The oral bleeding and infection likewise cleared up.
The blood count March 15, 1949, showed red cells 3,850,000, hemoglobin
69% and leukocytes 8,500. Up to August 5, 1949, she gained ten pounds in
weight. On June 16, 1949, the red cell count was 4,000,000, hemoglobin
72% and white cells 7,000. The chest signs improved slowly. By the end
of 1950 her enormous spleen had receded to its normal position under the
left ribs. The last blood count was taken May 1955 and showed red cells
4,150,000, hemoglobin 70% and leukocytes 3,500. She remains well.
<p>This patient, like the others, was not given one blood transfusion after
the SSR Treatment was started, and she improved on a strict vegetarian
diet. Here the destructive effect of the X-Rays on the blood forming organs
is easily seen, and the recovery of blood production could be better. The
hemoglobin was only 70% when it should have been 80% or better and the
white cell count could have been a thousand or two more. Thus the injury
to the blood forming organs is not entirely corrected, and never will be,
in line with our experience with the effects of irradiation. However, the
gains made under this handicap when the FCG function is restored are well
shown in this series of cases.
<p>One should contrast these cases with the recovery from a slowly developing
fatal form of bone sarcoma. Here it will appear that the rate of recovery
is a function of the rate of development of the disease. It will be seen
also that in the healing of the bone, the tissue is made much more dense
and stronger than before the disease attacked it. Blood reconstruction
is of this order, too.
<p><b>ENDOTHELIAL SARCOMA OF THE BONE</b>
<br>CASE No. 23
<p>Mr. Harold B. was age 41 in September 1934, when he appeared for Treatment.
He first noticed trouble with the right arm when he threw a ball some weeks
previously. His family physician took some X-Rays and noted the sarcomatous
status and sent him to the University of Michigan Hospital for thorough
attention. The pain in the arm was sufficient to prevent its use, and motion
was limited because of a hard swelling over the scapula. The X-Ray studies,
blood studies and biopsies of soft and bone tissues led to the final diagnosis
of Endothelial Cell Sarcoma of the bone. To reach this diagnosis, Paget’s
disease, all other bone tumors were definitely eliminated. They gave him
a hopeless prognosis since this type of sarcoma is always progressive and
fatal, no matter how it is treated, but they offered to remove the whole
shoulder girdle, if he wished. He refused and presented himself for our
attention instead.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15038.jpg"></center>

<p>Our examination, made September 17, 1934, showed a lame right arm, a
fist size mass over the spine of the scapula firmly fixed, and a walnut
size mass closer to the dorsal spine and of the same texture as the other
mass. Both were fixed to the underlying structures. There was some cachexia,
but no tumor could be found in the abdomen or anywhere else. The X-Rays
showed bone destruction extensively of the humerus and scapula, and neoplastic
development between the two. The progress of the disease was slow
and steady. The etiological factors as well as the tumor products were
poisoning him, following a downgraded course.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15040.jpg"></center>

<p>The Synthetic Survival Reagent (SSR) was given in a dose of 2 cc. of
the 10-(12) solution. There was no immediate sharp reaction, that is, in
the next few days. The major reactions were at the 24th and 36th weeks.
But he continued to improve slowly from the start. It took a few months
to be able to use the arm without pain. In a year the tumors were completely
absorbed, and an X-Ray showed nearly complete recovery in the bone, with
considerably more denseness in bone structure. He was able to return to
work and made a full recovery. Our next chance to make a radiograph was
when he appeared in Detroit to testify for us in the Federal Court. The
X-Ray made then showed full recovery and is reproduced here. He has remained
well. Our last report was received in 1950. Ewing’s estimate of this disease
is as follows, page 361, 1942 edition, <i>Text Book on Cancer:</i>
<p>“Angioendothelioma, multiple endothelioma, diffuse endothelioma, or
endothelial myeloma, the entire group, is characterized by predilection
for the bone shaft, a tendency to multiplicity, a cellular and vascular
structure, marked osteolytic properties, failure to produce tumor bone,
and a relatively slow but fatal course.”
<p>Radiograph I. showing condition before Treatment.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15042.jpg">
<p><img SRC="15044.jpg"></center>

<p>Radiograph II, showing condition after full recovery.
<p>This relatively slow course as seen both in the progress of the disease,
its cure and in the recovery process in the leukemia cases just given should
be contrasted with the cases of J. K. and Mrs. MacA.
<p>The University of Michigan records selected from the court records give
the details sufficiently for a working idea. This record, like those of
the other cases cited is voluminous. All other details are available to
anyone who desires them. The radiographs should be studied also. The fact
that the tumor is not confined to the bone but has grown between the bones
and out over the shoulder shows it is not Paget’s disease. One should note
this in the radiographs.
<p><b>RECURRENT METASTASIZED CANCER OF THE PALATE FOLLOWING SURGERY</b>
<br>CASE No. 24
<p>Mr. A. J., age 60 years, was first seen by us on December 1, 1932. He
gave a history of an attempt to remove one large and a few small growths
from the hard and soft palates, by excision and touch-up cautery at the
University of Michigan Hospital on October 15, 1931. The areas healed and
all was well for a few months. Then the same type of growth reappeared
over a wider area of the palate and enlargements formed in the neck and
under the jaw. These were deeply fixed. The palate was well covered at
the time of our examination. The large growth had returned with a dozen
smaller ones around about it. The biopsy was squamous cell cancer.
<p>We gave him the Survival Reagent injection and three days later he experienced
a typical reaction. Generally a highly malignant cancer will give a recovery
reaction twelve or twenty-four hours after the treatment is given and in
the less malignant types as this one, the actions come as late as 72 or
84 hours after Treatment. But the symptoms are the same, namely a general
achiness, chills and fever. All patients describe their reactions much
alike, so we will give Mr. J’s description as an example. His Testimony
stated, “About the third day I felt pretty badly. I became cold. I thought
I was going to freeze. My wife put me in bed. We had the hot water bottles
and about all the blankets we had to cover the bed with on me. It lasted
possibly an hour. About three weeks from that time I had another cold spell,
and for about six months, I believe, every three weeks, but they kept getting
lighter.” The physical examination and careful questioning did not reveal
any focus of infection, that contributed the toxin that excited the neoplastic
change, as is so common in other cases. This case was probably a general
viral infection.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15046.jpg"></center>

<p>After six months, no trace of any growth in the mouth, or in the neck,
or under the jaw could be palpated. He remained well until a few years
ago. It was reported he died of a stroke. He was then over 80 years old.
There was no examination of the body to get the facts, however, only rumor.
<p>In this case, as in so many that are biopsied or operated on, the recurrent
growths are of a higher grade malignancy than when first touched with a
knife, and that appears to be the case here, since the recurrence was rapid
and the reactions so intense, though they came three days after the Treatment.
<p><b>SARCOMA OF THE SPLEEN</b>
<br>CASE No. 25
<br>Dr. J. W. Kannel
<p>B. G. was 6 years old when she was attacked with pain in the stomach
and some fever. She had been experiencing an increasing difficulty in breathing
for some weeks previously. Examination by Dr. J. W. Kannel revealed an
enlarged spleen, enlarged axillary and inguinal lymph nodes, and a white
cell count of 7,200. A few days later, June 23, 1943, the white cell count
rose to 16,700, and on June 24th, it was 22,400. The aspect of the child
was that of one very seriously sick. He immediately did an exploratory
laparotomy, and found the spleen so greatly enlarged that it had compressed
two-thirds of the left lung and had grown out against the intercostal muscles
in ridges, so as to leave impressions of the ribs in between. The gross
pathology was pathognomonic sarcoma of the spleen. It would have served
as a good museum piece. It was besides, very hard and nodular, which is
the case with spleen sarcoma. If it were an infection, it would have been
soft and pliable. So the high white cell count was due to reticulo-endothelial
disease, comparable to the high lymphocyte count in leukemia. Moreover,
no abscess was found to account for the leukocytosis or the fever, which
after all are characteristic of acute forms of cancer. Dr. Kannel did not
do a biopsy, as he felt there was too much risk of causing uncontrollable
hemorrhage or embolism because of the vascular structure of the organ,
and because the gross findings were absolutely diagnostic without microscopic
aid. Thus, his knowledge saved the patient from possible death resulting
from embolism or hemorrhage.
<p>On July 2, 1943, she was given 2 micro micrograms of the SSR and her
recovery was gradual and steady until it was complete. The breathing became
normal and so did the breath sounds. The projection of the spleen down
into the abdomen 2 inches gradually subsided until it was of normal size.
Her health became normal and so remains so far as we know. The last report
was in 1956. One sees that the disease was corrected, and the straying
tissues were normalized. The cause was removed right at its point of attack
on the vital structure.
<p><b>LYMPHOSARCOMA CASES</b>
<p>The call for lymphocytes to fight the toxins of chronic infection is
standard experience. Though, the neoplastic hyperplasia no doubt had a
protective purpose to start with (the reticulo-endothelial system always
leads the combat against cancer) this type of hyperplasia does not accomplish
any protection. It injures the patient just like the excessive production
of poorly evolved thyroid secretion in <b>Case No. I </b>., the toxic nodular
goitre case. No doubt the interference with function was a matter of Carbonyl
group block, as it was in the goitre cases, and so if this is true, the
use of the Survival Synthetic Carbonyl Remedy should restore the normal
functional efficiency of protection and the normal mitotic process. A few
cases of different types of lymphocytic cell lymphosarcoma are given to
illustrate the disappearance of neoplastic mitosis and the restoration
of protection. This is seen in the return of the regular health and disappearance
of the pre-growth signs and symptoms similarly in lymphosarcoma, as in
the other forms of cancer.
<p>It is the consensus, that lymphosarcoma is a generalized disease and
indeed most cases, when seen first by us, showed generalized tumefaction
of all palpable lymph nodes, increased dullness of the mediastinum, and
great enlargement of the mesenteric glands. However, there is a type that
grows up rapidly in one region without showing great involvement of other
areas. This is the type that is most rapidly fatal and may indeed kill
in a few months, after the onset. Such a case is the following:
<p><b>LYMPHOSARCOMA</b>
<br>CASE No. 26
<br>Dr. J. W. Kannel
<p>Miss L. M., age 31, came under Dr. Kannel’s care in July 1925. Physical
examination showed a tumor as large as a large orange involving the upper
outer quadrant of the right breast and the axilla, which was completely
and deeply involved. He removed most of the breast portion, but found the
axillary development too deep to extirpate and left it in situs. The microscopic
examination showed it to be a malignant lymphosarcoma. This tissue
is not derived from the breast tissue itself, but seems to have its origin
in lymphoid tissue. Characteristic of this type of lymphosarcoma, cachexia
was developing rapidly, so Dr. Kannel prepared her for the Survival Reagent
Treatment, and gave the injection on July 16, 1925. The presence of cachexia
shows the extremely toxic status of the patient, both from the pathogenic
toxin and from the products of the neoplasm intended to be protective,
but which were toxic as the thyroid secretion in <b>Case I.</b>
<p>Following the Reagent, there was rapid absorption of the axillary and
other extensions of the neoplasm, with a simultaneously quick recovery
from the cachectic state. She remained well until 1931, when a lump appeared
in the left breast the size of one’s thumb. It grew rapidly also, as a
heavily infiltrating mass. It was removed by Dr. Kannel and diagnosed as
a lymphosarcoma from the gross pathological features. She was given another
dose of the same Reagent, recovered, and remained well thereafter, and
on last examination in April, 1946, twenty-one years after Treatment, was
still found well.
<p>This experience plus the one that follows, shows that the cause of the
neoplastic effort may return in the course of years, or maybe was removed
by the Treatment sufficiently to reverse the neoplastic effort, and still
a seed of the cause, — an old infection in an anoxic scar, might have still
escaped complete removal. Later on the cause grew to pathogenic proportions,
and started trouble again. This means that the Therapy should have been
repeated a year or so after, or even three years after the first neoplasm
was cured, to make sure the cause was fully removed. In this case, the
infected scar was not identified. If it were it could have been removed
and cultured, for further information. At any rate, the dose should have
been repeated before any further trouble could start. The case shows that
the second Treatment was just as effective as the first, and no resistance
is built up to it.
<p><b>LYMPHOSARCOMA, LYMPHOCYTE CELL TYPE</b>
<br>CASE No. 27
<p>Mrs. M. S., 38 years old, came under my observation on October 27, 1944.
She gave a history of a persistent crop of axillary boils that cleared
up on an autogenous vaccine, but no other remedy or antibiotics helped.
These appeared in April 1943, and persisted for nearly a year. During the
latter part of this period the right side of her neck became stiff and
painful. She could not stand a draft of air on it. Every diligent effort
at treatment failed. Instead, swelling and stiffness developed and advanced
deeply into the pharynx. In this bewildering condition, she stepped on
a nail and sustained a severe infection of the foot. The condition in the
neck became much worse then. A mass as big as an apple developed, involving
the neck structures on the right side. Biopsy done October 14, 1944, and
examined by several good pathologists confirmed the diagnosis of lymphocytic
cell type lymphosarcoma.
<p>Two weeks later my examination revealed a marked cachexia, and wide
involvement of the palpable lymphatic system, axillary, groin and a large
mass behind the umbilicus. It bulged, was hard and fixed, and could be
observed on inspection.
<center>
<p><img SRC="15048.jpg"></center>

<p>The mass in the neck that was biopsied was 5x7<i> </i>cms. in its diameters,
and had infiltrated the surrounding structures even into the inside of
the throat, and bulged greatly on the outside.
<p>She received 2 cc. of the Synthetic Survival Reagent at 11 p.m. that
night, and the recovery reactions started at 2 p.m. the next afternoon.
Chills, fever and a general achiness as from the grippe accompanied by
a relaxing of the stiffness in the neck were evident through the following
three weeks. Her cachexia disappeared and her well being was being re-established.
All of the neoplastic masses improved in the same way. By the end of the
third week, the stiffness and swallowing difficulty was fully overcome.
In three months, no more tumors could be palpated. However, her reactions
were repeated at the regular periods of three months, that is the 24th,
the 36th, the 72nd, the 84th, and 96th weeks and even later, and her health
improved after each, in spite of the fact that her health had become much
better than was normal for her, even as early as the twelfth week. Besides
taking care of a large house and her family, she was able to work in a
clothing shop, and carry on her social affairs. Following the absorption
of the growths, there was no sudden reaction in the old site of the boils
or the foot infection, as would be expected had they contributed the etiological
agent. Instead, she showed a reaction in the tonsil area that presented
the characteristics of a keloid. This came ten years after the cure of
the lymphosarcoma. She was given a different remedy at this time, diphenoquinone,
but its action was too slow. Within a year a pain in the dorsal spine developed
as she had had for many years off and on since an automobile accident,
some twenty years earlier. The radiographic studies by a well-respected
expert gave a diagnosis of an old lesion of maybe thirty years’ standing.
There was a history of suspected tuberculosis in early life, so, as a keloid
is a response to tubercular toxins, and the old bone lesion that resembled
a tubercular affair became evident as a reaction, our conclusion was that
the lymphosarcoma was caused by the toxins of an old tuberculosis that
had been suppressed.
<p>The writer’s services were not available to her at the time, and she
yielded to the persuasions of a radiologist, and took intensive X-Ray over
the spine and the neck. In August 1959 she died.
<p>In this case, a therapeutic fact was learned as in the former case of
lymphosarcoma. Since lymphomas are primary protective in their intentions,
one should give repeated doses every few years, a few times until there
is no vestige of the exciting cause left in the system. Had this been done,
this patient probably would have had no more trouble.
<p><b>LYMPHOSARCOMA, LYMPHOCYTIC CELL TYPE</b>
<br>CASE No. 28
<p>Mrs. G. G., age 40, at the time of Treatment with the Survival Reagent
on May 17, 1937, came for our Treatment for a rapidly developing mass on
the back of her neck, toward the right side. A biopsy had been made of
an enlarging gland in that location three weeks previously, when it started
to grow rapidly. The microscopic diagnosis was lymphocytic cell lymphosarcoma.
At the time of our examination, the scar region had become tumorous and
several smaller tumors had also developed in the area. The largest was
the size of the ball of one’s thumb, or an English walnut, but was deeply
infiltrated. She was ill and toxic, even in spite of the cleansing regime
she had followed for a week before the Treatment was given. Two cc. of
the 10-(12) concentration of the Survival Reagent was injected in the upper
arm. At her visit four weeks later, the whole area had normalized. No vestige
of any neoplasms could be found. Her normal health had also returned and
she remained well until she was killed in an automobile accident seven
years later. An autopsy established that there was no trace of any neoplasm
to be found, so we can assume that she was cured even without a repetition
of the dose. The exciting cause was not identified in this case and no
one knows if or not some interesting manifestation would have showed up
later, had she not had the accident.

<p><img SRC="15050.jpg"></center>

<p><b>CANCER OF THE BREAST</b>
<p>The resting breast is especially prone to take on malignant change.
It has plenty of FCG structures, but they are inactive and not carrying
on the oxidative functions of a working tissue. The circulation has no
aid as occurs in muscle containing organs where contractions pump the blood
along and move the lymph, thus aiding the metabolic exchanges and extending
the equilibrium point of enzymatic reactions. A blow on the breast therefore
produces a dangerous injury that can interrupt the circulation and create
an anoxic area much easier than in a tissue with an active circulation.
Blows need not be very hard to bring about the unfavorable change, and
indeed after the tumor has developed, the trauma incident to vigorous physical
examination by palpation may step up the malignancy of the lesion most
dangerously. For this reason America’s great diagnostician, Cullen, recommends
very clever means of inspection for demonstrating the malignant infiltrations,
and thus avoids the need of adverse amount of palpation. Great pressure
tugging on the growth, etc., are vigorously condemned. Cullen considers
even the needle biopsy dangerous. Great care, then, is used in making the
examination in breast cases. The various types are so characteristic that
in most cases inspection alone should settle the diagnosis, when the growth
is well established.
<p>To return the breast cancer cell to a normal functional status when
it is not at work because of the normal lactogenic stimuli seems a little
paradoxical. However, the restoration of the FCG does not necessarily mean
it has to produce milk, but only that its impediment that blocks its dehydrogenating
power is removed. When the energy producing and energy receiving Carbonyl
groups are freed and able to function normally, no energy is shunted vicariously
into the mitotic mechanisms to produce neoplasia.
<p>In breast cases, the great problem is early diagnosis to give the surgeon
a chance, but as the vast majority of cases are well metastasized before
the lump is discovered, its early total removal by simple resection is
the logical procedure to give the patient every possible chance, and then
correct the Survival chemistry and teach the victim how to live.
<p>When the breast case is under the Koch Treatment, the affected area
must be kept warm. Internal cancer has a better chance to recover because
of the natural normal temperature that is sustained. Breast cancer must
be well covered, and must also be protected from strong sunlight, perfumes
and powders women usually use. Then the examinations must be made with
care, as the fine blood vessels that grow up into the coagulated and digesting
mass are indeed very delicate and are easily injured. Hemorrhage at the
point of vascular rupture complicates the situation, as the circulation
is cut off and an excellent medium for infection is created. The continuance
of the digestive process is blocked also, and one has a bad situation that
may limit the recovery process at this point of injury, and indeed may
prove to be the starting point for a reversal of the recovery. The patient’s
responsibility for protecting the breast is a matter that must be emphasized.
Of course, the physicians of experience will know what type of patient
needs this advice most and will illustrate the need of care by his own
manner of examination with care.
<p><b>CARCINOMA SIMPLEX</b>
<br>CASE No. 29
<br>Prof. R. S. L.
<p>Miss C. F., age 50 years, Brazilian, referred by Prof. A. P. on November
17, 1941, was suffering with a painful tumor of the right breast for six
months. It was considered inoperable, and 12 applications of deep X-Ray
therapy were given. It continued to grow and become more painful. The nipple
was already retracted, and the skin hard and infiltrated, and the whole
mass was fixed to the chest wall, making it immovable to touch or by change
of position, as on stooping or leaning to the side. It had become the size
of a large fist. Two micrograms of Parabenzoquinone were given on November
17, 1941, intramuscularly. She recovered gradually. But six months later
the dose was repeated. One year after Treatment, no tumor could be found
and she was considered clinically cured.
<p><b>SCIRRHUS CANCER OF BREAST</b>
<br>CASE No. 30
<br>Prof. R. S. L
<p>Mrs. M. S. was 42 years of age and married. She found a lump in the
breast in 1938, when living in Lisbon, Portugal. It was removed surgically
and diagnosed cancer microscopically. Recurrence was well advanced in 1941,
as a large tumor in the same location had developed as early as April,
but she was not Treated until on October 14, 1941. She was given two micrograms
of Benzoquinone solution intramuscularly. Examination seven months later
showed that the tumor had entirely disappeared, leaving a scar isolated
and no larger than a grape. Her general condition was excellent.
<p>In the writer’s experience, the hard-calcified residues of digestion
of the tumor may be removed for microscopic study. They are found to be
composed of calcareous material and some dense fibrous connective tissue
without epithelial structure. Right after the malignant status is corrected
and calcification starts, they become subjects for removal as vascular
in-growth, which may be compared with a blood clot or the casein in milk,
undergoes calcification as the first step in its digestion. This is shown
in Plate No. I. Then after the digestion and absorption have become complete,
stones of the type described in this case may still remain. We have never
seen them go malignant again, but their absorption is very slow. Whether
they give any protection against cancer is not established, though we thought
for a long time that they did.
<p><b>METASTATIC CANCER OF THE BREAST</b>
<br>CASE No. 31
<p>Miss H. P., age 32, Canadian, was treated with the Serial System of
Carbonyl groups with free radical terminals in 1927. She had been operated
and the microscopic study showed a grade IV malignancy of the carcinoma
simplex type. It had infiltrated the axilla and quickly showed renewed
activity there and it had also metastasized to the lungs and over to the
right supraclavicular space as a good sized (half egg) fixed tumor. The
dyspnoea and chest signs showed heavy involvement of the mediastinum and
cough was incessant.
<p>Six months after the Treatment, there were no more symptoms or signs
of the disease left. The supraclavicular space was clear, and the chest
examination indicated the metastases had been absorbed. The photographs
made at the time of Treatment and after recovery. In 1955 we heard from
her again, that she is in perfect health and no signs of recurrence have
appeared.

<p><b>FIBROMA OF UTERUS</b>
<br>CASE No. 32
<p>Miss G., age 45 in December 1930, when first Treated. These are interesting
cases because they are exceedingly slow to recover and often requiring
a year or two to be free of the growth. The most intriguing feature in
such cases is that the toxin that causes cancer is fibrogenic, that is,
it stimulates fibrosis as we explain later on, and when the fibroblastic
response peters out, neoplasia is due to start. The protection offered
by fibrogenesis probably is due to the integration of the pathogen with
the fibroblastic tissue and its neutralization in that way, so that when
fibrogenesis fails, the toxin must add to some other cell structure and
this seems to be the mitotic mechanism. In this connection, it is significant
that neoplasms came later on in such cases. The photographs tell the story
in this case. The second picture was taken after the absorption was complete.
It is 30 years since her Treatment was given, and she has not developed
any cancer as yet. The photographs were part of the evidence in the U.
S. Federal Court.
