<p>As the work progressed it was deemed advisable to obtain data on the
curative action of molar peroxides and their unsaturated precursors. For
an investigation of this importance the best talent available was necessary.
The American research institutions were examined carefully and found wanting.
Europe was likewise scanned until Professor Joseph Maisin was selected
as the best prepared for a task of this type. Cancer was induced in many
hundreds of mice and rats by the usual carcinogens and tumor transplants
and treated with the peroxides of formaldehyde and formic acid and with
unsaturated substances prepared at the time of their use. These latter
substances were pre-peroxides by virtue of their high double bond content.
The tables appended show the results of their use. These observations were
made at Louvain in between 1934-35.
<p>The protective action was found on further investigation to be due to
the free radicals formed by the dehydrogenating action of the Carbonyl
groups present in the dehydrated unsaturated bodies and the free radicals
formed in the peroxides which gave rise to peroxide free radicals. A comparison
with the highly efficient curative action of the Reagent used in the Bandeen
Experiments, (pages 30-35) bears this conclusion out since in the latter
experiments the very highest Carbonyl ability to dehydrogenate was provided
whereas in the Louvain Experiments no attempt was made to boost any activity
at all. Nevertheless the latter experiments show that it is impossible
to prepare molar peroxides sufficiently clear of free radicals to serve
for pure biological tests. The speed with which free radicals are formed
by light and by simple rubbing of the dry crystals also shows this trend.
This is one of the basic provisions of nature for the continuance of life
on our planet.
<p><b>Protective Action of Diformaldehyde Peroxide</b>
<p>The mice received applications of Benzene solution; 1/200 Benzopyrene
three times each week. The peroxide was injected, 1 cc. solution 1/20,000,
on the 35th and 65th days.

<b>SPECIFIC
EFFECTS OF THE CARCINOGEN, VIRAL AND CHEMICAL</b> 

<p>To
account for the Pre-growth Symptoms and Changes would take much experimental
work. However, we have a few clinical facts that are so evident that there
need be no doubt. One is that the reticulo-endothelial system weakens and
atrophies just previous to the appearance of the tumor, and before it goes
truly malignant. This happens in natural and in chemically induced cancer
as well as in virus produced cancer. The fatigue and the final atrophy
of the protective cells of the liver, spleen and lymph glands must result
in abnormal products which are atrophy producing. The carcinogen, be it
chemical or viral, must be legated with these products as a chemically
integrated complex, and wherever such products are carried they must have
their effects. Embryos developing under such circumstances must be defective,
and adult tissues will undergo the changes that give the picture of cachexia
as an end result. But preliminary thereto, there must be functional injuries
such as were described in part in the text, — the bone marrow function,
the nervous system function, the skin function and what not. In fact every
tissue is subject to the action of such poison in varying degrees. Thus
a differential diagnosis may be based on the chemical status of the lymph
glands even before a tumor is recognized. 


<p><i>Our
Postulate provides for the polymerization of the carcinogenic toxin as
it develops to the cancer producing stage,</i> <i>and this provision is
based upon the chemical and clinical circumstances that stare one straight
in the face. Atrophy precedes neoplasia. </i>If one answers that the neoplasia
is a reaction to the atrophy stimulus as hay fever is to the pollen stimulus,
one must still offer a mechanism for the reaction. The simplest mechanism
that could be involved is that the toxin produces both changes, and this
mechanism we have already explained as due to a block in energy production
and transfer. Recovery from the states caused by the carcinogenic agent,
be it viral or chemical, is therefore a satisfactory support to our contention,
since this same agency accomplishes the corrections in all such states
as atrophy, pre-growth toxic state, cachexia, and tumefactions.

<p>The
best proof of the correctness or practicability of any postulate in medicine
is doubtless the curative value of its application. So to check up on the
correctness of our Thesis on the atomic bondings and electronic dispositions
responsible for the integration of the pathogen with the host cell’s functional
mechanism, we developed an additional step for demonstrating the presence
of the double bond that activates the production of the free radical in
the pathogen, which makes the pathogenic addition. Likewise the double
bond that activates the condensation of the pathogen’s amine group with
the Carbonyl of the host cell can be demonstrated. As we showed, these
additions depend upon anoxia.

<p><i>By
starting out with the contribution of an atom of hydrogen from the Reagent
to one pole of this double bond or of any other double bond in the pathogen
whose exposure and high polarity invites the addition, a free radical is
produced at the other pole of the bond which simultaneously adds to the
free radical formed in the Reagent when its hydrogen atom was lost to the
pathogen. By synthesis, the hydrogen atom concerned was made most
active by receiving electrons from the double bond system with which its
position was conjugated, and the free radical left in the Reagent that
adds to the other pole, brings to the pathogen a moiety that is a great
electron donor and hence invites ready oxidation (dehydrogenation) even
by the weaker of the tissues’ oxidation agents. Thus the integrated pathogen
is left at the mercy of the ordinary tissue reagents that can accomplish
its progressive oxidation away from the host cell’s functional mechanism
leaving its FCG activated by conjugation with a Carbonyl group, the advantage
of which we explained earlier.</i>

<p>The
first step then is a reduction, which opens the way for the burning of
the pathogen off from the host cell by ordinary cellular dehydrogenators.
The advantage of this means of attack is quite evident, and our next edition
will report the clinical results. These have been most gratifying so far.
In fact, hog cholera and dog distemper, which required different Reagents,
are both quickly cured in the highest percentage on the one Reagent discussed
here.</blockquote>
