<p><b><font size=+2>THE ANTIBIOTIC PROBLEM</font></b></center>

<p><br>
<p>There is no evidence that a high efficiency system of oxidation exists
in bacteria, especially in disease germs. However, they do depend upon
an unrecognized Carbonyl function that is activated by electrons received
from the double bonds of an ethylene linkage, even in the performance of
the Krebs Cycle. This is seen where it is necessary to keep the cycle going
by supplying the unsaturated dicarboxylic acids, whereas the saturated
dicarboxylic acids, as succinic, are of no help. Thus, even in the low
level Krebs Cycle, upon which bacteria depend, activated Carbonyl function
of this particular order is required. Here, antibiotic activated amine
groups have a position in which to produce their toxic effects, and either
kill, asphyxiate, or suppress vital activity. The modern antibiotics, in
medical use, all contain the toxic amine group and their toxic effects
are seen both on the germ and on the host, when used therapeutically. Suspensions
of consciousness, injured liver function, and other metabolic injuries
are frequently reported, and sometimes, instantaneous death.
<p>Further, the injurious effects on bacteria excite well-proven mutations
against the amine poisons. The survival factor in the germ has reached
enough success in this combat to excite scientific envy. When the writer
balanced up his observations on the reciprocal and antagonistic actions
of Carbonyl and amine groups and the reactions of the tissues to them,
one experiment that he published in the “<i>Journal of Laboratory and Clinical
Medicine</i>” in 1916, exposed the existence of a basis for the mutation
against toxic amines. The poison observed was trimethyl melamine. It is
probably one of the most toxic substances in existence, and produces <i>instantaneous
</i>death when injected in fatal amounts into the blood stream. When sub-fatal
doses are injected and the blood pressure recorded on the revolving drum,
it is seen that a rapid and sustained fall in blood pressure occurs, but
if more of the poison is injected during this period, in amounts that add
up to more than the lethal dose, there is no fatal event, but only a minimal
decrease in the blood pressure during this period of sustained depression.
After the pressure returns to normal for ten minutes, a fatal dose will
kill immediately. However, the occurrence of this refractory period indicated
to the writer, that a basis for building a resistance to amine toxins and
their derivatives existed, and to attack germs via toxic amine therapy
would ultimately turn out unsuccessful. <i>He, therefore, decided that
for the correction of the basic fault in the host, the boosting of its
Carbonyl function would be a preferable means of attack. </i>To the surprise
of all observers, it was found that after animals suffering with severe
mastitis were given the Synthetic Survival Reagents, the most deadly Staphylococcus
Aureus lost its toxic action, and its hemolysins were no longer formed.
<p>Later on, the same was found true for the Streptococcus causing dairy
cattle mastitis. It is seen, in the following table, that where gangrenous
conditions were caused by the infection after injury had taken place, the
bacteria actually <i>increased in numbers while the toxic symptoms disappeared,
and rapid healing was going on. </i>But, where no gangrenous condition
was present, the infection and its changes subsided together, with rapid
decrease in the number of bacteria. Thus, it is evident that the bacteria
lost their pathogenicity after the host was treated with Survival
Carbonyl groups, and became useful in clearing up the debris, they had
formerly caused. Evidently they gained also from the Survival Carbonyl
chemistry and were apparently enabled to serve constructively in the Great
Biological Economy again. There were special studies by the University
of British Columbia Veterinary Department on the loss of hemolytic properties
of bacteria after the host was Treated, as well as restoration of the calcium
balance showing that the tissue colloids were again in good dispersion,
in other words, the tissue oxidations were restored. The following table
of bacterial counts showings the reductions of bacterial counts and no
change or the increase in these counts while healing and constitutional
recovery is progressing is taken from the <i>Annual Report</i> (1944) of
the Minister of Agriculture to the Parliament of British Columbia. *

web site.

<p>(Note — These counts were verified by a second laboratory).
<p>It may be noted that cow No. 13 shown above is reported on as drying
up with mastitis and ely-4p is shown as improving in udder condition in
spite of the high bacterial content. The last-mentioned cow, Vera, had
a severe accident to the udder between Treatments which doubtless accounts
for the increase in bacteria. However, she was making satisfactory recovery
when last reported on.
<p>Other experiments with cultures of the bacteria that caused the lesions,
and their high toxicity in comparison to the loss of toxicity of cultures
of the same germs planted at different periods after Treatment was given
to the host, confirm the observation. This work needs further chemical
and clinical investigation, aside from what is reported here. This is useful
in showing how antibiotic resistant gonococci and pneumonococci became
nonpathogenic, after contact with the Synthetic Survival Reagent.
<p><i>In line with our Postulate, the toxic amine groups of intestinal
poisons, those present in antibiotics and those produced by fungi, tend
to diminish the oxygen supply to the tissues and thus hinder the combat
against viral diseases. The toxic amine group also inactivates the FCG
and blocks its function so it fails to oxidize pathogens destructively.
Altogether the toxic amine tends to favor the integration of the virus
with the host cell’s energy producing mechanism. </i>This can be observed
practically in the following case of measles.
<p><b>MEASLES</b> CASE No. 13 Dr. Jayme Treiger
<p>Baby R., 18 months of age, weight 11,500 grams, was first seen by Dr.
J. Treiger 12/3/59. She took sick November 17, 1959, with a terribly itchy
rash that was diagnosed an allergy, for which liver extract was given until
November 22, when it was seen that it did no good and the condition became
worse. Then until December 1, Aminophilin, Streptomycin, and Penicillin
were given because of the high fever and aggravation of the rash, acetyl
salicylic acid was also given because the pulmonary congestion was increasing.
There was no improvement. The rash became worse and so did the other symptoms
during these nine days. Further, the child refused all food and drink but
allowed sugar water to be put on the tongue. Prostration developed and
constipation also as no food was taken.
<p>At his examination the fever was 39.5&deg;C., the rash of measles fully
fulminated, there was a bad tonsillitis, pulmonary congestion, and great
prostration. It was not unconscious, but noticed nothing, and refused food
and drink. Homeopathic remedies were given that improved the chest and
throat symptoms but the rash, fever and prostration persisted with no improvement
in the mental state. The prognosis was very grave. Dr. Treiger gave one
microgram of one of the Survival Factor Remedies, Parabenzoquinone, in
one cc. of water, hypodermically, on December 5th to avoid Encephalitis
<p>Results:In a few hours there was improvement in the fever and rash.
In 12 hours, the temperature was a normal 36&deg;C. with the rash and itching
about gone. The child asked for food and ate with appetite. During the
rest of the day the recovery was completed, with good restoration of bowel
function as well. Measles regularly recover under this Treatment in 12
hours. So even here where every toxic amine group available assaulted the
body chemistry, the tissues were liberated by the oxidation potential and
advantage of Benzoquinone, the weakest of the Survival Factor Reagents.
One may contrast the therapeutic effects of toxic amines and constructive
Carbonyl in this typical case.
<p><b>ANTIMITOTIC AGENTS</b>
<p>The approach offered by antimitotic agents to hit the very center of
the cancer problem has been most illuminating. This work was started in
the past decade, and has been increasing world wide ever since. An excellent
review is given by Biesele, of the Sloan Kettering Institution, in “<i>Mitotic
Poisons and the Cancer Problem</i>,” Biesele — 1958 — Elsevier. Very interestingly,
it will be seen that the antimitotic agents present Carbonyl and amine
groups of the same order that we have been studying for the last 49 years.
Biesele, while paying no attention to these groups or their action individually,
classifies all antimitotics as poisons. It must also be noted that since
the antibiotic products of molds and soil bacteria have been studied, inspection
of their structural formulae reveals similar active amine and carbonyl
groups. <i>In view of our experience, the classification as poisons should
be reconsidered to group them as amine poisons and Carbonyl restorative
or Survival Agents.</i> Indeed the survival capacity is small because of
the structures of the molecules, but for the service of the mold that would
protect itself, these groups might have corrected the evil effects of the
germ’s toxins, or hindered them when being constantly produced by the mold
in fair amounts. Certainly the mold did not attempt to kill the germ by
the Carbonyl activity. It might even have tried to correct the germ’s fault
and thus showed some therapeutic discretion. Such agents could really be
mold hormones designed to serve within its own level of oxidations and
reductions — constructively. Representative of Carbonyl containing antibiotics
are the substituted quinones, Phoenicin, Citrinin, Clavicin, and Spinulosin.
They all offer Carbonyl activated by the double bonds of two ethylene linkages,
but this activation is reduced to a low ebb, by the substitutes for the
hydrogen atoms that would have allowed splendid antibiotic activity. The
representatives of antibiotics carrying highly toxic amine groups are the
Sulfa drugs, Streptomycin with its two guanidine groups, and all of the
other synthetic products. Some of these, like Terramycin and Penicillin,
carry Carbonyl activated by conjugation with an ethylene linkage, as well
as the toxic amine groups, and in some, such groups are protected by a
substituent as methyl, that can be readily removed leaving the nascent
amine group. The amine groups are likewise activated by conjugation with
double bonds.
<p>The same active groups are seen in the antimitotic agents, amine and
Carbonyl. Maleic acid and Benzoquinone carry the Carbonyl groups, and their
activity is measured accurately even in such infinitesimal concentrations
as one part to a million, and one part to a billion of water. <i>It would
be unreasonable to speak of such high dilutions as being toxic.</i> So,
from their own observations, these agents cannot be classified as poisons
to the mitotic mechanism.
<p><i>In 1943, before antimitotic agents were ever studied, we testified
in the Federal Court in Detroit on the corrective action of high dilutions
of both substances, which we had used therapeutically years earlier and
with corrective results.</i> Since no evidence could be found of their
injuring any of the participants or any of the processes concerned with
mitosis, Biesele gives them a pre-mitotic position, and loses the real
action which is to reduce the necessity for mitosis by their protective
action against injurious agents, and their rejuvenating vitality, or survival
boosts that lengthen the life span and thus reduce the need for reproduction
or mitosis to assure the cultured tissue cell’s survival. The tissue culture
effect is exactly what we demonstrated in animals and man even under the
most adverse circumstances. That the action is attributable to the Carbonyl
group as activated by double bonds in conjugation, one sees in the greater
activity of Maleic anhydride over that of fumarate which we proved. <i>This
is a steric virtue, since in the anhydride both Carbonyl groups are in
the same plane with the activating double bonds, whereas in the acid, only
one Carbonyl group has that position.</i> This action is, of course, curative
and reconstructive in any reasonable dilution up to one part to a billion
of water. <i>As to the Carbonyl group working on a physiological and corrective
basis that removes the functional and mitotic failure of survival, so well
illustrated by cancer, we may refer to the same Court Testimony, which
proves the complete permanent cure of far advanced terminal cancer of the
liver, accomplished by one dose of two cc. of a dilution of one part of
Benzoquinone to a million parts of water. </i>The diagnosis, which was
made by a half dozen leading surgeons by laparotomy, and the cure in 1941,
is still standing as perfect 18 years later.
<p>A few quotations from Biesele will be helpful, along with some explanatory
discussion that we must give. This whole book of Biesele supports our Thesis,
in spite of its coming from outside and non-cooperative interests that
see nothing in their findings, except cytolytic effects and destructive
action. Their observations are well made and accurately recorded, but they
lack the physiological viewpoint that gives these interpretations scientific
and therapeutic values.
<p>On page 31, it is reported, “The threshold of mitotic inhibition of
chick fibroblast cultures by Benzoquinone was 10-u (Meier and Schar, 1947),
or 0.001 ug/mi, the same as for Colchicine.” “The mitosis inhibition caused
by some quinones and by Maleic acid has paralleled their uptake of sulfhydryl.”
(P. 33). <i>This shows, in line with our Thesis, that the action depends
upon the activation of the Carbonyl group as recipient of electrons from
its conjugated double bonds and that a physiological rather than a toxic
action is to be expected, a dehydrogenating power that can initiate chain
oxidation.</i> Our diet has accordingly always eliminated sulfides and
sulfhydryl. Lettre’s suggestions, that “quinone blocked sulfhydryl compounds
to inhibit mitosis,” Biesele finds “inadequate, as other antimitotics are
effective without blocking sulphydryl action.” <i>However, all students
of the problem overlook the oxidation catalysis of activated Carbonyl.</i>
<p>On page 30, Meyerhof and Randall (1948) and Burrough (1955) are quoted
on the inhibition of epidermal mitosis by adrenaline and adrenochrome in
dilutions of one part to a million. They found that “this inhibition occurred
not only with glucose as an energy source, but with fructose, lactate and
pyruvate… Further experiments indicated that the critical influence on
metabolism imposed by epinephrine or adrenochrome was not on glycolysis,
the tricarboxylic acid cycle, or the cytochrome system.”
<i>Thus, in line
with our Thesis, the energy source that is cut off by toxic amines is the
unidentified system which we named the “preferred smokeless process” initiated
by activated Carbonyl groups, which burns all fuels and even the inhibitors
that may be present, but which can be inactivated by highly potent amine
groups as of phenylenediamine and epinephrine, which we point out, show
reduction potentials of E’o = + 0.38v. and Eo= +0.80v.</i> Other supportive
data deserve attention.
<p>Thus on page 50, Biesele reviews the contributions of Gellhorn, Hirschberg
and Kream (1952) demonstrating that “the differential susceptibility of
various tumors to inhibition by 8-azaguanine was inversely related to their
ability to deaminate 8-azaguanine to the non-inhibitory 8-azaxanthine.
In tissue culture inhibition by 8-azaguanine and the non-inhibitory effect
of 8-azaxanthine on Brown-Pearce tumor were confirmed by Flint, Hirschberg
and Murray (1953).
<i>Here, again, the inhibitory effect is due to an activated
amine group while the protection against the action is a matter of oxidation
that removes the amine group and substitutes a Carbonyl group in its place,
as we claim happens to viral and other amine poisons during the reversal
of carcinogenesis.
</i>A further example of this inactivation of toxic
amines is found in the observation of Woodside (1953) in “tissues of the
mouse in which 8-azaguanine restricted mitotic rates in carcinomas 755
and E0771 but not in tumors C954, C1300, S180 and S91, nor in ileum, jejunum
or testis.” It must be recalled that the ileum, jejunum and testis are
rich in diamine oxidase, and here a Carbonyl action is also involved in
removing the toxic amine group and replacing it with a Carbonyl group in
line with our Thesis. <i>Here is another indication that free radicals
and peroxide free radicals are involved.</i>
<p>On Page 50, Biesele suggests that the “inhibitory effect of 8-azaguanine
may be related to its incorporation into ribonucleic acid, as suggested
by Kidder, Dewey, Parks, and Woodside (1949) and demonstrated by Mitchell,
Skipper, and Bennett (1950). The latter authors found, however, that the
amount of 8-azaguanine incorporated into visceral RNA exceeded the amount
incorporated into tumor RNA. This posed a dilemma for which Parks (1955)
saw no solution.
<p>However, 8-azaquinine-2-<sup>14</sup>C was incorporated into RNA of
the susceptible mouse leukemia L1210 at a level 100 times that of its incorporation
into the derivative azaguanine-dependent leukemia (Bennett, Skipper and
Law, 1953). “The incorporation of 8-azaguanine into tumor RNA probably
produces defective RNA. It is at this polynucleotide stage that Mandel
(1955) envisioned the action of 8-azaguanine as an antimetabolite, rather
than as an antagonist of free purines.” Here we see in line with our thesis
that normal tissues are armed with many more active Carbonyl groups than
are the susceptible tumor tissues and these Carbonyl groups can condense
with the toxic amine structures and hold them in combination instead of
their oxidative destruction<i>. So our interpretation of the induced antimitotic
activities and their prevention is that the same survival factor dealt
with in this book is concerned and that the antimitotic data gathered so
far, gives further support to our Thesis with measurable proof of the efficacy
of high dilutions.</i> Though not recognized by the investigators, their
data again show one phase of the interaction of amine and Carbonyl groups
dealt with in this book. Their data prove the protective action is an oxidation,
though they failed to investigate the whole process.
<p><b>THE QUINONE STRUCTURE AS AN ELECTRON ACCEPTOR IN NORMAL TISSUE METABOLISM</b>
<p>Recently a fat soluble, moderately substituted for Benzoquinone, has
been identified and given intensive study. It is found in all animal and
some plant tissues in several modifications and has been named because
of its structure and function<b>, </b>Coenzyme Q10. It serves in the electron
transport during the oxidation of succinate, and precedes cytochrome C
as an obligatory electron carrier in the antimycin A sensitive oxidation
of succinate by heart mitochondria. (Ziegler,1959). Ordinarily about
one gamma is eliminated in the urine per hour. When a tissue on extraction
with acetone and other solvents is made inactive for want of this coenzyme
the addition of Coenzyme Q10 restores the oxidative activity. (Crane, 1959).
Its structure is, — where n is from 6 to 9. This isoprenoid residue gives
it fat-soluble properties, so it works in fatty fractions.
<center>
<p><img SRC="9006.jpg" height=168 width=503></center>

<p>The kinetics of Coenzyme Q have been worked out by Britton Chance, and
the mechanism of its reduction in mitochondria has been investigated by
Ziegler, while the specificity of Coenzyme Q homologues in electron transport
restorations has been studied by Crane<i>. Thus the physiological position
of the quinone structure in metabolism is amply assured, and measured during
the past year. This recent work confirms our Postulate, the chemistry of
which we put into practical action some decades ago.</i>
