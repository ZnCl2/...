<p>Very recently, in the last few years, some highly substituted Benzoquinones
have been introduced into medicine, as cytolytic agents in the treatment
of cancer. The high substitution defeats any action, inherent to the quinone
structure that might be curative. Such action depends upon high activation
of the Carbonyl group, and upon the wealth of resonance hybrids that would
be possible if the hydrogen atoms, held by the ethylene linkage were present,
instead of displaced by complex groups that not only prevent electron migrations
to the Carbonyl group, but prevent additions of free radicals to the carbon
atoms of the ethylene groups. In certain instances, the benefit of Benzoquinone
is due to its ability to absorb antagonistic free radicals, and the high
substitutions annul this effect. The following well recognized reactions
might be offered as a demonstration of this detoxicating quality, which
is lost in the admitted non-curative commercial drugs.

<br>(Well-established free radical absorbing power of Benzoquinone...)

<br>…yields the Quinhydrone, which is disproportionate to Hydroquinone
and Benzoquinone. Thus, Benzoquinone inactivates free radicals and the
therapeutic action is hindered, as clinical tests have proven. We therefore
conclude, that the therapeutic activity of these Reagents is partly, at
least, to be attributed to the free radicals they contained and which,
were responsible for the oxidation and polymerizations in progress in these
systems. There is nothing cytolytic about this structure. It is constructive
in action.
<p><b>Pharmaceutical Substituted Quinones</b>
<p>As examples of these cytolytic agents that are admittedly unable to
protect or to cure, the following of Schenley Laboratory may be taken as
an example:

-di-n propxy-3,6-bis-ethylenimine- 1 ,4 Benzoquinone. 


<br>And the following A-139 is of the same order:

<blockquote>
<p>Actinomycin
is a natural nitrogen free antibiotic that has had some trial but without
any curative results. Whatever they are, they might be a little better
than that of the preceding or Bayer’s E39, which is built on the same order
as Schenley’s and A-139<i>. </i>In Actinomycin, Carbonyl activity is limited
by the substituents, and by the failure to have even one hydrogen atom
attached to an ethylene linkage. This again is for the benefit of the organism
that produces it and not to serve as a therapeutic agent.
<p>Certainly the analytical and synthetic work of the antibiotic chemist
deserves the highest praise. The search for virtue in complexity of structure,
however, has no basis aside from the needs of the organism that produces
the antibiotic. These are not identical with the requirements of higher
animals in the situations we have discussed. Rather the greatest simplicity
possible wins the laurels here.</div>
