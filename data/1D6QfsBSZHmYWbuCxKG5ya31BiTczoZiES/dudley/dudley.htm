      </center>
      <p>During a lecture on nuclear theory, the professor explained the
        disintegration of uranium. At the end of the lecture, he stated,
        “This system of mathematical theory shows a definite probability
        that an airplane may pass through a rocky cliff and come out the
        other side unscathed”. </p>
      <p>It was here that the writer parted company with “modern”
        nuclear theory. My flying days began when I ran away from home
        about 1921 to sneak my first ride in a Jenny. Since then having
        experienced one air crash, and witnessed many others, no amount
        of calculations can convince me that which is impossible, can be
        possible. Out of this came a critical examination of all
        mathematical theory, which led to some theorizing on my own (1).
      </p>
      <p>The state of our theorizing has been well summed up (1953) by a
        Nobel prize winner, Louis de Broglie: “The history of science
        shows that the progress of science has constantly been hampered…
        by principles that we have come to assume without discussion”.
        Prof. J. C. Bailar, President of the American Chemical Society
        pointedly reminded scientists (1959) that the theories of today
        have superseded those of yesterday, and that they in turn will
        be superseded by those of tomorrow, even if today’s seem
        perfectly logical. </p>
      <p>As a starting point it is suggested that one examine several of
        the references which discuss atmospheric electricity (2, 3, 4).
        It will be found that the old concept of current flow (+) to (-)
        is often renamed in these writings. Here then is the indication
        tat our present concepts of charge, field, and current flow are
        in a chaotic state. If our electron and x-ray tubes function by
        reason of electron passage, then current flow must be electron
        flow, (-) to (+). And there is current flow, ionosphere to
        earth! </p>
      <p>Theoretical studies of charge, fields and gravity led to the
        prediction that the earth is a (+) charged “particle” spinning
        in a hue (-) charged field (1). But theorizing is one thing and
        experimentation is still another. So a series of privately
        financed experiments were begun, utilizing both laboratory
        apparatus, and small rocket. The procedures and results are
        outlined below. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Laboratory Experiments</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In October 1957, preliminary experiments were begun with a
        small Van de Graff generator producing a maximum electrostatic
        (+) charge of about 75,000 volts. This unit was used to study
        the action of various one-quarter to one-half inch spheres and
        various powders under the influence of a (+) charged field. </p>
      <p>These preliminary tests indicated that a large electrostatic
        generator would be useful. After several modifications, the
        final unit constructed was a van de Graff generator having a
        spherical collector head 12 inches in diameter, capable of
        producing a (+) charge of 425,000 volts. The capacity of he ES
        generator was increased by employing an electronic high-voltage
        generator, and applying a (+) potential of 25,000 volts on the
        groundside brush of the Van de Graff. </p>
      <p>These units were used to study the movement of (+) charged one-
        to four-inch diameter hollow spheres in various (+) and (-)
        charged electric fields. The spheres were made of glass,
        plastic, or aluminum. The inner and/or outer surface of the
        non-conductors were rendered conducting by spraying with lacquer
        containing aluminum powder. In the case of glass spheres, one of
        the best sources of supply was ordinary Christmas tree ornaments
        which contain inside a flashing of metallic silver. This can
        easily be removed with a few drops of nitric acid. A
        non-conducting body does not take a charge and therefore is not
        repelled. </p>
      <p>A sphere placed on top of the collector of the Van de Graff
        generator may take on the same charge, in this case 425 KV (+)
        with respect to ground. This charging of the small sphere will
        take place only if one surface is conducting. In the case of
        nonconductors, if the inner surface only is rendered conducting
        and is connected in some way with the collector head, then the
        charge is distributed over the inner conducting surface and the
        sphere is repulsed. In effect the charge “radiates” as if a
        point source at the center of the hollow sphere. </p>
      <p>Since the charges on the collector and the sphere are both (+),
        when the electrostatic repulsion of (+) charge for (+) charge is
        greater than the attraction of gravity for the sphere, then the
        sphere will move vertically t a point where the electrostatic
        force equals gravitational force: </p>
      <p>F<sub>e</sub> = k <sup>q</sup>1 <sup>q</sup>2 / d<sup>2</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Where Fe = electrostatic force, <br>
        D = distance between charges, <br>
        <sup>q</sup>1 = charge on collector, a constant under the
        condition of the experiment, <br>
        <sup>q</sup>2 = charge on sphere, a variable dependent on
        various factors, <br>
        k = a dielectric factor, a constant, but only under a definite
        set of conditions, i.e., barometric pressure, temperature and
        humidity. </p>
      <p>When the sphere rises from the collector, the electrostatic
        force of repulsion (Fe) is greater than the attraction of
        gravity (g); F<sub>e</sub> &gt; F<sub>g</sub>. As the sphere
        rises, a point is reached where F<sub>e</sub> = F<sub>g</sub>.
        The conditions of this equilibrium are determined by the
        following factors (assuming <i>q</i> constant): </p>
      <p>(a) Surface-area mass ratio of sphere; </p>
      <p>(b) Rate of loss of charge (q) of sphere by reason of leakage,
        a rate influenced by the value of k, which depends on barometric
        pressure, temperature, humidity, and surface imperfections; </p>
      <p>(c) Increase (q) by reason of the acceleration of the sphere as
        it begins its rise. </p>
      <p>The results of many preliminary series of experiments
        established the above conditions. In later more extended
        experiments it was found that the mass of material above the
        generator, the electrical conductivity of this material, the
        time of day and season of the year all influenced the height of
        rise of the sphere above collector head. </p>
      <p>These results show that by careful control of all conditions,
        it is possible to “titrate” the attraction of the (-) zone above
        the earth for the (+) charged sphere as it is repelled by the
        (+) charged collector head. </p>
      <p>These findings resulted from more than two years of
        experiments. To those who may wish to check or extend these
        findings, it is recommended that the experiments be carried on
        in an isolated lightly constructed building in which temperature
        and humidity can be rigidly controlled. Only the use of a
        high-speed movie camera to record height of rise of the spheres
        will provide refined data and permit accurate plots. </p>
      <p>For an explanation of the influence of season of the year and
        time of day on the (-) charge above the earth see discussion of
        rocket experiments which follow. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Rocket Experiments</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>As a result of the laboratory experiments outlined above, it
        was postulated tat a rocket may become a (+) charged body,
        repelled by the (+) charge of the earth and simultaneously
        attracted by the (-) charged zone above. This reduced to its
        simplest, is a macro reduction of R.A. Millikan’s oil drop
        experiment (1909), in which he, at will, augmented or
        counterbalanced the force of gravity on charged oil droplets, by
        means of electrostatically charged plates. For this Millikan
        received the Nobel prize for determining the nature of the unit
        charge on the electron. </p>
      <p>What is given here is the outline of results of 200 firings of
        small rockets, and details of a series of do-it-yourself
        experiments utilizing readily available and safe materials in
        order that others may repeat the experiments, and, it is hoped,
        confirm and extend the findings. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Rocket Construction</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>A --- Obtain at least three Aerobee-Hi rockets or others of
        similar design, which utilize Rock-A Chute motor. Assemble in
        the usual manner, but eliminating the parachute. Install a hard
        plastic guide tube in place of the paper straw as supplied (1/4”
        OD, 3/16” ID, 4” long, with 45 degree bevel at each end). Spray
        all parts and surfaces, inside and out, with a clear acrylic
        lacquer. Repeat spraying three times, allowing suitable drying
        time between coats. Allow to dry finally overnight in a warm
        room. One of these rockets is now sprayed only inside the rocket
        body with aluminum paint, or lacquer. Another rocket is sprayed
        so as to cover all surfaces, inside and out, with aluminum paint
        o lacquer. Beneath outer coating is now an electrically
        conducting surface. The third rocket is retained as a
        non-conducting body, completely impregnated with acrylic
        lacquer. </p>
      <p>B --- Secure at least three die-cast high dielectric plastic
        Alpha-I rocket bodies, complete with rubber nose tip. Cement the
        tip to the body, To each, cement a hard plastic guide tube
        midway between two fins (1/4" OD, 3/16" ID, 4" long). Pour a bit
        of aluminum paint or lacquer inside the body of one rocket.
        Rotate, drain and allow to dry. Spray all surfaces of the second
        Alpha-I, inside and out with the aluminum paint, allow to dry
        thoroughly. Retain the third rocket clean, with no coating. </p>
      <p>C --- The rocket motors utilized in all these tests are the
        standard Rock-A-Chute products, type A4 or B6, which are used as
        issued in the Aerobee-Hi models. For the Alpha-I, obtain garden
        hose washers, which are fitted and cemented around the base of
        the Rock-A-Chute motor, flush with the orifice end of the paper
        case. This rubber washer serves as a thrust collar and retaining
        ring. The size of standard hose washers causes the fit of the
        rocket motor to the Alpha-I to be surprisingly snug and
        shipshape. A bit of tape or paper wrapped around the motor helps
        to retain the motor in the body. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Firing Conditions</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>In warm, pleasant weather the amount of moisture, as grams
        cubic meter, is about eight times that found under cold, dry
        winter conditions. The optimum conditions for the study of the
        effect of the earth’s electric field on the height of rise of
        rockets are winter conditions, some distance from any large body
        of water and low humidity. </p>
      <p>Under warm, humid conditions, all rockets become conducting
        bodies because of absorption of moisture on the surface of any
        substance. To check this, heat a pyrex beaker in an oven to 125
        C. Cool in a dessicator. Rapidly bring to equilibrium on an
        analytical balance. Watch the progressive increase in weight.
        This is the water vapor being absorbed on the surface of the
        glass. </p>
      <p>Those fortunate to live in a semi-arid or desert region, have a
        definite advantage in conducting tests of this kind, since the
        crux of the whole problem is electrical conductivity of the air
        and the rocket’s surface. High altitudes, dry, cold conditions
        are those which favor the tests, since these are conditions of
        lowest conductivity. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Firing Schedule</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Fix the Aerobee-Hi rocket launching rod so that it is vertical
        and is in contact with the ground. In case of dry sand,
        concrete, or arid conditions, dig a hole near the launching
        site, drive a metal rod into the ground and electrically connect
        this ground pin to the launching rod. This insures that the
        rocket is at ground potential for the full length of the rod.
        Select an open area at least 300 yards away from habitation or
        roadway. Keep bystanders to a minimum (you will see why later).
      </p>
      <p>The best time to obtain the greatest potential gradient as
        volts/meter near the surface of the earth is 8-11 AM and 5-7 pm
        in winter. In summer the most advantageous times are 809 am and
        8-9 pm. The best season of the year is November through
        February. Thus the optimum time of firing to reduce to a minimum
        the leakage of the earth’s (+) charge of the rocket is precisely
        the time at which the attraction of the (-) field is greatest.
        Thus to study these phenomena seriously it necessary to endure
        soe discomfort. Select a clear day, December through January
        with low temperature and low humidity and fire between 8-11 AM
        (See refs 2 and 4 for details of earth’s potential). </p>
      <p>(1) Fire the lacquer impregnated non-conducting Aerobee-Hi
        wind. Repeat using the untreated plastic Alpha-I. Again be wary
        as the aerodynamic stability depends in part on conductivity.
        These two rockets represent uncharged bodies being propelled
        only by rocket power. </p>
      <p>(2) Fire the Aerobee-Hi rocket which has only a conducting
        inner surface. Note stability of flight, height of rise, effect
        of cross wind. Fire the Alpha-I which has only its inner surface
        rendered conducting. </p>
      <p>(3) Fire the Aerobee-Hi and Alpha-I rockets which have all
        surfaces coated with the conducting lacquer. Note height of
        rise, trajectory and effect s of cross wind. Those rockets have
        initially the same (+) charge as the earth. </p>
      <p>In order to get a good approximation of the heights of rise,
        station two observers at about 300 feet from the launching site,
        positioned such that they are at right angles to each other,
        with respect to the site. One should be facing directly away
        from the sun, i.e., between sun and site. </p>
      <p>Accurately measure each leg of your triangulation grid, and the
        distance from observer to observer. A very useful sighing
        quadrant may be prepared by nailing with one nail a lathe, slat
        or yardstick to a corner of a square board, about 12 x 12 x 1
        inch. Using a small protractor, lay off the angles from 0 to 90
        degrees with the 0 degree at the bottom edge of the sighting
        board. Always hold this board perpendicular to the ground, and
        with the 0 degree line parallel to the ground. </p>
      <p>We are now ready to measure the angle of rise by sighting along
        the top edge of the pivoted slat: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="dudl1.jpg" height="147" width="269"></p>
      </center>
      <p>If B = 300 ft <br>
        And Angle A --- Then height (h) <br>
        is --- Tangent --- is </p>
      <p>37 --- 0.754 --- 226 ft <br>
        50 --- 1.19 --- 357 ft <br>
        75 --- 3.73 --- 1119 ft. </p>
      <p>If one selects convenient and permanent base lines for the
        above, and calculating tangent values vs height, it is easy to
        prepare a table so as to read off directly the heights at the
        launching site, rather than wait to work up your results. The
        necessary tangent values can be found in any geometry text and
        scientific handbooks. </p>
      <p>Under optimum conditions of time, temperature and humidity, the
        conducting rockets will attain altitudes about 400% greater than
        non-conducting rockets. </p>
      <p>Should the rocket veer too far off the vertical path, it is
        easier to calculate it height when you have two observers. If
        you estimate the distance fro one observer to a point directly
        under the highest part of the trajectory, then using this value,
        and the observed angle, calculate the height by the Tangent
        method outlined above. </p>
      <p>From 200 firings carried out by the author, the following
        general facts emerge. </p>
      <p>(a) Both high humidity and high temperatures decrease the rise
        of a rocket so constructed as to be an accelerating, charged
        body. </p>
      <p>(b) Conversely, low temperature and low humidity greatly favor
        the rise of a rocket so constructed as to retain its charge
        during acceleration. </p>
      <p>(c) A completely non-conducting rocket shows erratic flight
        characteristics in cold, dry weather. </p>
      <p>(d) An accelerating, conducting rocket becomes a moving charge
        in an electric field and thus establishes concentric magnetic
        lines of force. These lines of force couple with the magnetic
        flux of the earth, stabilizing the flight of the rocket. This
        effect causes the rocket to resist changes in its vertical path,
        such as the force of crosswinds might induce. </p>
      <p>(e) Under optimum conditions the electrostatic field of the
        earth may be utilized to aid the thrust of a rocket motor. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>About 1750, Benjamin Franklin proposed the theory of a single
        electric “fluid”. He rubbed a glass rod with silk and guessed
        that some of the fluid was transferred to the glass. Therefore,
        he called the charge on the glass positive (+). When he rubbed a
        hard rubber rod with wool, some of the fluid seemed rubbed off
        the rubber, and the charge was labeled negative (-). Since the
        charges were different, the fluid flowed from glass positive to
        rubber negative. This is the origin of the direction of flow of
        electric current which appeared in practically all textbooks
        until about 1940. </p>
      <p>But with the development of the Bohr concept of the atom, and
        the clear evidence of the particulate nature of electricity,
        derived from electronics, the old terminology began to change,
        showing the flow of current, negative to positive. But in this
        good year of 1960, what is available in our textbooks and
        reference libraries, indicating the state of our concepts
        regarding the flow of electric current? </p>
      <p><i>Encyclopedia Americana, Ency. Britannica, World Book
          Encyclopedia, Scientific American</i>, etc… </p>
      <p>And so we may find whatever may suit our fancy. In fact, many
        widely used physics texts, while explaining current flow as
        electron flow, neg to pos, still retain the diagrams of earlier
        editions showing the flow, pos to neg. </p>
      <p>Science is in one of those transition periods where new
        knowledge conflicts with old terminology and there is just now a
        woeful lack of critical evaluation of what one scientist means
        by his writings and diagrams. Older references are cited and
        concepts which cannot stand up in the light of new data. In
        short, we have come so far so fast that our further progress is
        being hampered by outmoded concepts retained, references and
        still taught as valid. Faulty communications lose battles! </p>
      <p>In the Spring of 1958, as the result of laboratory studies with
        various charged spheres. A prediction --- call it an educated
        guess --- was hazarded: The Russians are firing their rockets
        from a high, dry, cold place. Subsequently published reports
        showed their major launching site to be northeast of the Caspian
        Sea (45 N) on a desert plateau, altitude about 500 feet. They
        fire their high thrust rockets largely during cold weather,
        after October 1. These are the conditions which the rocket
        firings reported herein show to be optimum for taking advantage
        of the earth’s electric field. Atmospheric conditions which
        exist at Cape Canaveral and Point Mugu are those which
        completely negate this effect. </p>

      <p>When Dr H.C. Dudley’s article on the Electric Field Rocket
        appeared in these pages in the November 1960 issue, his
        investigations aroused a great deal of interest among the model
        rocketeers of the National Association of Rocketry. There was
        only one way to settle the question once and for all: perform
        Dudley’s experiment with model rockets. If Dudley were right,
        the experiment would be a true predictable one and would
        duplicate his findings. This is in the finest tradition of
        science. No amount of discussion will settle the question; it
        must be settled by checking the theory with experiment. The
        results must then be published. </p>
      <p>The NAR was in a unique position to carry out the model
        rocketry experiments of Dudley. Since 1957, the NAR has
        developed in-flight optical tracking systems for model rockets
        that have reasonable accuracy. Model rocket engine manufacturers
        can supply propulsion systems of very close tolerance. Many NAR
        members are expert model makers capable of building very fine
        rockets. </p>
      <p>The Peak City Section of the NAR in Colorado Springs, CO was
        perfectly situated to carry out the tests. Their rocket range is
        the most extensive and well-equipped in the country, consisting
        of 40 acres of flat prairie at an elevation of 6380 feet. There
        are clear skies most of the year, and the climate meets the
        Dudley specifications beautifully --- high altitude, clear
        skies, low humidity. </p>
      <p>Supervised by Bill Roe, five teenage model racketeers undertook
        the task of running the tests. None of these people had any
        contact with Dr Dudley; they know him only from his Analog
        article. They used his article for instructions for building
        their models, following his directions exactly. </p>
      <p>Four different series of models were used. The design of the
        models varied from series to series, but the five rockets in
        each series were constructed as nearly alike as possible, with
        the exception of the presence or absence of the conductive
        layer. </p>
      <p>In each series, the five models differed as follows: </p>
      <p>Model 1: A control model. A standard model rocket built of
        paper and balsa wood with a clear layer of Krylon sprayed inside
        and out. This Model was the standard against which the
        performance of the others in the series would be compared. </p>
      <p>Model 2: Identical to Model 1 except with a layer of Krylon
        aluminum paint sprayed on the inside of the model over a clear
        Krylon spray base. The exterior of Model 2 was a spray coat of
        clear Krylon. </p>
      <p>Model 3: Identical to Model 1 except with a coat of Krylon
        aluminum paint sprayed over both the inside and the outside of
        the model over a coat of clear Krylon. </p>
      <p>Model 4: Identical to Model 1 except with a layer of aluminum
        foil on the inside of the model over a clear Krylon base.
        Exterior was sprayed with clear Krylon. </p>
      <p>Model 5: Identical to Model 1 except with a layer of aluminum
        foil on both the inside and outside of the model over a spray
        coat of clear Krylon. <br>
        The reason for using Models 4 and 5 was to insure a true
        electrically conductive layer by means of the foil. Peak City
        Section rolls its own paper tubes for model rocket bodies, and
        was, therefore, able to roll special tubes with inside and/or
        outside foil layers. This was an admitted departure from the
        Dudley instructions designed to double-check the premises. </p>
      <p>The model rocket engines used in the tests were NAR type A.8-4
        and B.8-4. The NAR has developed a method of classifying
        commercial rocket engines by total impulse --- thrust multiplied
        by duration --- and has created a coding system for describing
        the performance of such engines. The first letter indicates the
        total impulse range, the first number indicates the thrust in
        pounds with fractional pounds expressed as decimals, and the
        dash number indicates the number of seconds (to the nearest
        second) of time delay built into the engine. </p>
      <p>All of the engines used were commercially made by a model
        rocket engine manufacturer by means of a fully automatic
        machine. The engines used in the tests were selected from the
        same production lot. One from each batch of 100 engines had been
        static tested on a recording-type test stand. The accompanying
        thrust-time curve was obtained from the sample engines of the
        production batch used. Tolerance on these engines is very close…
      </p>
      <p>In flight, the models were all tracked by means of optical
        theodolites constructed by the boys. They consist of surplus
        8-power elbow telescopes with reticles and cross hairs. They are
        attached to alt-azimuth mountings with elevation and azimuth
        dials. Mounted person manning the theodolite is on sturdy
        tripods, they are accurate to at least 1/2 degree. During flight
        operations, the connected to the firing point by a telephone so
        that he hears the countdown and can read back his azimuth and
        elevation angles. He tracks the model from the instant of
        take-off to peak altitude, where he ceases tracking and locks
        his tracking mount. </p>
      <p>The standard NAR tracking system was used for the tests. It
        consists of two tracking stations on a measured baseline. If you
        will look at the tracking system geometry in the accompanying
        drawing, you will see that it does not matter where the tracking
        stations are with respect to the launch area, or where the model
        is in the air with respect to the ground. If the baseline
        between the stations is known, and if the tracking angles from
        each station are known, it is possible to determine by
        triangulation exactly how high the model is. Moored balloon
        calibrations of this system have shown it to be accurate to 2%
        for altitudes up to 1000 feet. If you want better accuracy or
        are flying higher than this, use a longer baseline. </p>
      <p>A three-station system is admittedly more accurate, but the
        data reduction gets messy and cannot easily be handled in the
        field with trig tables and a slipstick. </p>
      <p>The tracking angles from each station are reported in to the
        launch area where they are copied down. Simple trig reduces
        these angles to altitude data. </p>
      <p>The tests of series One took place on October 29, 1960. High
        winds made things difficult until January 7, 1961, when the
        remaining three series were flown. </p>
      <p>Special flight sheets were used for the electric field rocket
        tests, and one of these is reproduced with this article. All
        possible data was recorded for each flight --- time,
        temperature, humidity, winds, barometer, sky, model type, launch
        weight, motor type, conductive layer used, and general flight
        characteristics. The PC Section hoped to be able to measure the
        atmospheric charge in volts/cm as well, but they were unable to
        complete the equipment in time for the flight tests. </p>
      <p>In all, 20 flights were made. 19 of these were tracked, and
        track was lost on one flight. </p>
      <p>A summary of the flight test data, as compiled on the
        accompanying table, shows some interesting things that should
        settle the electric-field rocket question. The results are
        probably best summed up in Bill Roe’s comment, “I have been
        unable to detect any difference in the flight of the rockets.
        They were built as closely as possible to the Dudley specs.I
        suggest Captain Dudley be invited to bring his rockets to the
        range and try them”. </p>
      <p>The NAR has drawn the following conclusion of the Dudley
        Electric-Field Rocket: </p>
      <p>(1) There is very little apparent difference in the achieved
        altitude or light characteristics of model rockets when provided
        with an electrically-conductive surface. </p>
      <p>(2) Model rockets with and without conductive coatings flown on
        separate days with different weather factors show very little
        difference in performance. </p>
      <p>(3) The altitude spread of the results is that normally
        experienced with ordinary models of identical construction,
        probably due to small difference in engine performance, minute
        differences in models, variations in launching conditions, and
        tracking system errors. </p>
      <p>The testing crew decided to discontinue the project after 20
        flights because it seemed to them that there was nothing to be
        gained by further flying. The test flights told them that they
        weren’t getting the claimed altitude increase or the claimed
        stability performance. </p>
      <p>This essentially concludes the serious reporting aspects of
        these tests, but leads us to some interesting speculation
        regarding what might have caused Dr Dudley to draw his
        conclusions. I repeat that this is strictly speculation. The NAR
        did no get the expected results. Why? What did we do wrong, or
        what did Dr Dudley, in all scientific honesty, interpret
        incorrectly? None of us feel that we are competent to judge his
        overall theoretical work on the basis of the NAR tests; perhaps
        other tests in other areas may confirm all or part of it;
        perhaps it will have to be modified or even discarded. But that
        is up to the physicists; we are scientists on a busman’s
        holiday, amateur scientists, and model racketeers. Primarily,
        for this report and these tests, model rocketeers. </p>
      <p>Dr Dudley’s photos showing the acceleration of his models at
        take-off mean nothing to us. Single photos can’t. If the camera
        shutter had been tripped electronically by a microswitch at the
        precise instant of launch, they would be interesting. But I can
        get and have gotten photos of takeoffs which, if I laid them
        side by side, might indicate that one model had greater
        acceleration than the other. But there would be no way of
        knowing unless I had tripped the shutter at precisely the same
        instant of launch in each case. </p>
      <p>A single-station tracking system can give very erroneous
        altitude reading, as we discovered in 1957. The NAR initially
        used a single station system, began to question its accuracy,
        and went to a dual station system. I recall one particular
        design that consistently turned in 1,500 foot peak altitudes
        with the single-station system, but which began to give 500 foot
        altitudes once the two-station system was put into use. </p>
      <p>A model rocket simply does not go straight up over the launcher
        every time. It may veer several degrees either side of vertical
        on the way up. In doing so, it may approach the tracking station
        or fly away from it. In the first instance, the peak altitude
        appears to be higher; in the second case, lower. Model rockets
        all have a tendency to weathercock into the wind slightly
        because o the fact that they are fin-stabilized vehicles
        possessing arrow stability. </p>
      <p>If the tracking station is one three hundred feet away and, if
        it happens to be up-wind of the launcher on the day of the
        flights, the vehicles will appear to go higher. </p>
      <p>However, this does not answer the question of the higher
        altitudes that Dr Dudley claimed for his coated models. We must
        look further into the problem. What happens if we compute the
        altitude of the NAR test models using the one-station system? </p>
      <p>The data from Flight #8 shows us what can be expected. The NAR
        tracking stations were 1,000 feet from the launch pad. Using
        this as the baseline, and using the 40 degree elevation angle
        recorded from one station for that flight, we compute an
        altitude of 839 feet. However, using two stations, this comes
        down to a reduced altitude of 635 feet. </p>
      <p>This is still not enough to account for the altitude increases
        reported by Dr Dudley. </p>
      <p>At this time, we’ve checked everything we can think of with the
        thought that perhaps we did something wrong. The models were
        properly built according to the instructions given by Dr Dudley.
        The launchers were grounded by wire to a steel fence post driven
        more than two feet into the ground. The weather was clear, cold
        and dry, and the tests were made at high altitude. </p>
      <p>Instead of concluding an argument, we may have started a new
        one. Who is right? When an amateur scientist does not confirm
        the results of another amateur scientist, who is going to be
        believed? The professional people will probably pay no attention
        , or they would have run some tests themselves in the first
        palce. </p>
      <p>Since the NAR boys followed the instructions exactly, they
        certainly believe they are right. The essence of the question is
        the predictable experiment done from a cook book. Mystics use no
        cook books. Mysticism is based on faith. Did Dr Dudley neglect
        to mention some important point of procedure in his article? If
        so, it was not proper scientific reporting. </p>
      <p>Another interesting speculation raises its head: If the
        Electric Field Rocket Effect is real, why hasn’t it been noticed
        before? Certainly with all the experiments and flight tests made
        with rockets, some factor should have shown up. Not all rocket
        flights are made from damp, sea-level locations. I recall
        standing on a desert hummock in freezing temperatures during
        winter flight tests from White Sands at an elevation of nearly
        4,000 feet. No unexplained factors turned up at White Sands
        during the time I was there. And, good friends, a metal rocket
        resting on a steel launching table bolted to a concrete slab is
        most certainly at ground potential! </p>
      <p>And, perhaps the wrong question has been asked! Maybe the
        electric field rockets work best at low altitudes. If so, we
        will be finding this out about the time you are reading this,
        duplicating the experiment again on Long Island, NY in dry fall
        weather. If the eastern NAR groups confirm the Dudley
        experiments, you will most certainly hear about it. </p>
      <p>In any event, it was time to make a report. To date, members of
        the NAR have not confirmed the results of Dr Dudley’s rocket
        tests. We invite you to come to your own conclusions. </p>
