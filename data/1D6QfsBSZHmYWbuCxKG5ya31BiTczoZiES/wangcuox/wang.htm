      <br>
      Oct. 2, 2013 — In a completely unexpected finding, MIT researchers
      have discovered that tiny water droplets that form on a
      superhydrophobic surface, and then "jump" away from that surface,
      carry an electric charge. The finding could lead to more efficient
      power plants and a new way of drawing power from the atmosphere,
      they say.<br>
      <br>
      The finding is reported in a paper in the journal Nature
      Communications written by MIT postdoc Nenad Miljkovic, mechanical
      engineering professor Evelyn Wang, and two others.<br>
      <br>
      Miljkovic says this was an extension of previous work by the MIT
      team. That work showed that under certain conditions, rather than
      simply sliding down and separating from a surface due to gravity,
      droplets can actually leap away from it. This occurs when droplets
      of water condense onto a metal surface with a specific kind of
      superhydrophobic coating and at least two of the droplets
      coalesce: They can then spontaneously jump from the surface, as a
      result of a release of excess surface energy.<br>
      <br>
      In the new work, "We found that when these droplets jump, through
      analysis of high-speed video, we saw that they repel one another
      midflight," Miljkovic says. "Previous studies have shown no such
      effect. When we first saw that, we were intrigued."<br>
      <br>
      In order to understand the reason for the repulsion between
      jumping droplets after they leave the surface, the researchers
      performed a series of experiments using a charged electrode. Sure
      enough, when the electrode had a positive charge, droplets were
      repelled by it as well as by each other; when it had a negative
      charge, the droplets were drawn toward it. This established that
      the effect was caused by a net positive electrical charge forming
      on the droplets as they jumped away from the surface.<br>
      <br>
      The charging process takes place because as droplets form on a
      surface, Miljkovic says, they naturally form an electric double
      layer -- a layer of paired positive and negative charges -- on
      their surfaces. When neighboring drops coalesce, which leads to
      their jumping from the surface, that process happens "so fast that
      the charge separates," he says. "It leaves a bit of charge on the
      droplet, and the rest on the surface."<br>
      <br>
      The initial finding that droplets could jump from a condenser
      surface -- a component at the heart of most of the world's
      electricity-generating power plants -- provided a mechanism for
      enhancing the efficiency of heat transfer on those condensers, and
      thus improving power plants' overall efficiency. The new finding
      now provides a way of enhancing that efficiency even more: By
      applying the appropriate charge to a nearby metal plate, jumping
      droplets can be pulled away from the surface, reducing the
      likelihood of their being pushed back onto the condenser either by
      gravity or by the drag created by the flow of the surrounding
      vapor toward the surface, Miljkovic says.<br>
      <br>
      "Now we can use an external electric field to mitigate" any
      tendency of the droplets to return to the condenser, "and enhance
      the heat transfer," he says.<br>
      <br>
      But the finding also suggests another possible new application,
      Miljkovic says: By placing two parallel metal plates out in the
      open, with "one surface that has droplets jumping, and another
      that collects them … you could generate some power" just from
      condensation from the ambient air. All that would be needed is a
      way of keeping the condenser surface cool, such as water from a
      nearby lake or river. "You just need a cold surface in a moist
      environment," he says. "We're working on demonstrating this
      concept."<br>

      </b><br>
      With the broad interest in and development of superhydrophobic
      surfaces for self-cleaning, condensation heat transfer enhancement
      and anti-icing applications, more detailed insights on droplet
      interactions on these surfaces have emerged. Specifically, when
      two droplets coalesce, they can spontaneously jump away from a
      superhydrophobic surface due to the release of excess surface
      energy. Here we show that jumping droplets gain a net positive
      charge that causes them to repel each other mid-flight. We used
      electric fields to quantify the charge on the droplets and
      identified the mechanism for the charge accumulation, which is
      associated with the formation of the electric double layer at the
      droplet–surface interface. The observation of droplet charge
      accumulation provides insight into jumping droplet physics as well
      as processes involving charged liquid droplets. Furthermore, this
      work is a starting point for more advanced approaches for
      enhancing jumping droplet surface performance by using external
      electric fields to control droplet jumping.<br>

      </b><br>
      Condensation can he an important process in both emerging and
      traditional power generation and water desalination technologies.
      Superhydrophobic nanostructures can promise enhanced condensation
      heat transfer by reducing the characteristic size of departing
      droplets via a surface-tension-driven mechanism. A
      superhydrophobic surface can include nanostructures of a metal
      oxide having further surface modification.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to superhydrophobic surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0004] Superhydrophobic surfaces, with static contact angles
      greater than 150[deg.], droplet hystereses less than 10[deg.], and
      roll-off tilt angles typically less than 2[deg.], resist wetting
      and exhibit self-cleaning properties. Such properties are
      desirable for coatings on buildings, solar cells, and textiles, as
      well as drag reduction and increased heat transfer via drop-wise
      condensation. In nature, a wide array of wetland and aquatic plant
      leaves exhibit self-cleaning properties and resist wetting upon
      the impact of rainfall. Due to the abundance of water, these
      wetland plants do not rely on the intake of moisture through their
      leaves to hydrate. In fact, their superhydrophobic properties are
      a necessity for survival. Shedding water from the surface
      dramatically increases the uptake of CO2 for photosynthesis, and
      these self-cleaning abilities reduce the formation of bacteria and
      fungi that would otherwise thrive in such hot moist climates.
      Significant efforts have focused on mimicking the naturally
      occurring structures of the lotus leaf, which demonstrates
      superhydrophobic self-cleaning properties. However, existing
      fabrication methods have limited the ability to accurately mimic
      both the surface structures and resulting water-repellent behavior
      of the lotus under droplet impact.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] In general, a superhydrophobic surface can include
      nanostructures of a metal oxide having further surface
      modification. Superhydrophobic nanostructures can provide enhanced
      condensation heat transfer by reducing the characteristic size of
      departing droplets via a surface-tension-driven mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] In one aspect, a superhydrophobic surface can include a
      substrate including a metal and including a plurality of
      nanostructures on a surface of the substrate including a metal
      oxide of the metal, and a surface modifying layer on at least a
      portion of the nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In another aspect, a method of making a superhydrophobic
      surface can include forming a plurality of nanostructures of a
      metal oxide on a substrate of a metal from which the metal oxide
      is derived, and depositing a surface modifying layer on at least a
      portion of the nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In certain circumstances, metal oxide can be a copper
      oxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In certain other embodiments, the surface modifying layer
      can include a self-assembled monolayer. The self-assembled
      monolayer can be on a metal coating on the nanostructures. The
      surface modifying layer includes a thiol on a surface of the
      nanostructures. The thiol can be an alkyl thiol, for example, a
      fluorinated alkyl thiol. The metal coating can be deposited on the
      nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In certain other embodiments, the surface modifying layer
      can include a silane on a surface of the nanostructures. For
      example, the silane can be an alkyl silane, such as a fluorinated
      alkyl silane. The silane can be deposited on the nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In certain other embodiments, the surface modifying layer
      can include a fluorinated polymer. The fluorinated polymer can be
      deposited on the nanostructures.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Other features, objects, and advantages will be apparent
      from the description and drawings, and from the claims.<br>

      [0026] Condensation is an important process in both emerging and
      traditional power generation and water desalination technologies.
      Superhydrophobic nanostructures promise enhanced condensation heat
      transfer by reducing the characteristic size of departing droplets
      via a surface-tension-driven mechanism. See, for example, Boreyko.
      J. B. and C.-H. Chen, Self-Propelled Dropwise Condensate on
      Superhydrophobic Surfaces. Physical Review Letters, 2009. 103(18):
      p. 184501, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. In
      this work, a scalable synthesis technique was investigated to
      produce oxide nanostructures on copper surfaces capable of
      sustaining superhydrophobic condensation and characterized the
      growth and departure behavior of condensed droplets.
      Nanostructured copper oxide (CuO) films were formed via chemical
      oxidation in an alkaline solution. A dense array of sharp CuO
      nanostructures with characteristic heights and widths of 1 [mu]m
      and 300 nm, respectively, were formed. A gold film was deposited
      on the surface and functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer
      to make the surfaces hydrophobic. Condensation on these surfaces
      was then characterized using optical microscopy (OM) and
      environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) to quantify the
      distribution of nucleation sites and elucidate the growth behavior
      of individual droplets with a characteristic size of ~1 to 10
      [mu]m at low supersaturations. CuO surfaces can offer superior
      condensation behavior in terms of emergent droplet morphology and
      coalescence dynamics and a significant enhancement in heat
      transfer performance when compared to state-of-the-art condensing
      surfaces. Furthermore, the chemical-oxidation-based CuO
      fabrication process provides a simple and readily scalable method
      to create superhydrophobic condensation surfaces that can sustain
      droplet jumping behavior. Comparison of the observed behavior to a
      recently developed model for condensation on superhydrophobic
      surfaces (see, Miljkovic, N., R. Enright, and P. N. Wang, Growth
      Dynamics During Dropwise Condensation on Nanostructured
      Superhydrophohic Surfaces, in Proceedings of the 3rd
      Micro/Nanoscale Heat &amp; Mass Transfer International Conference.

      Wang, Dropwise condensation droplet growth dynamics on
      superhydrophobic surfaces. unpublished 2011, each of which is
      incorporated by reference in its entirety) suggests a restricted
      regime of heat transfer enhancement compared to a corresponding
      smooth hydrophobic surface due to the large apparent contact
      angles demonstrated by the CuO surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] Efficient condensation is required for a range of
      industrial processes. In particular the efficiency of steam power
      cycles, thermal-based desalination, and phase-change-based thermal
      management solutions for electronics cooling are functionally
      dependent on the condensation behavior of water on heat transfer
      surfaces. In the 1930's, Schmidt and co-workers identified
      dropwise condensation (DWC) as a superior mode of heat transfer in
      comparison to filmwise condensation (FWC) (see Schmidt, E.,
      Schurig, W. and Sellschopp, W. Tech. Mech. Thermodynamik, 1, 53-63
      (1930), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety).
      Subsequent investigations found that DWC heat transfer rates could
      be up to an order of magnitude larger than those associated with
      FWC. See, for example, Rose, J. W. Proc Instn Mech Engrs, Vol 216,
      Part A: J Power and Energy (2002), which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. To achieve efficient DWC, condensate
      droplets must be rapidly removed from the surface because the
      increasing droplet size acts as a thermal barrier. DWC is
      associated with the periodic departure of large,
      thermally-insulating droplets from the surface, typically under
      the influence of gravity, that allows for the re-growth of smaller
      droplets with reduced thermal resistance on the exposed areas.
      Rose and co-workers (id.) have argued that the self-similar
      distribution of drop sizes is a significant factor governing the
      overall rate of heat transfer. Under the influence of gravity, the
      requirement for droplet departure, to first order, is given by
      Bo=[rho]gd&lt;2&gt;/[gamma]&gt;=1 where [rho] is the condensate
      density, g is the local acceleration due to gravity, d is the
      droplet diameter, and [gamma] is the condensate surface tension.
      For water, this leads to a distribution of droplets ranging in
      size from the critical nucleus (~1 nm) up to the capillary length
      (~1 mm). However, recent investigations by Boreyko &amp; Chen
      (PRL, 2009) have demonstrated that the upper drop size can be
      restricted to less than 100 [mu]m (Bo&lt;10&lt;-3&gt;) via a
      surface-tension-driven departure mechanism that occurs on
      nanostructured superhydrophobic surfaces. When small droplets
      (e.g. ~10-100 [mu]m) merge on suitably designed superhydrophobic
      surfaces, they can undergo coalescence-induced droplet ejection or
      "jumping" independent of gravity due to the release of excess
      surface energy. The nanostructured surface beneath the coalescing
      droplets reduces the droplet adhesion to the substrate by
      minimizing the solid fraction and breaks the symmetry of the
      coalesced droplet. As a result, the droplet accelerates and
      departs perpendicular to the surface. Such droplet jumping offers
      an avenue to further enhance condensation heat transfer over
      conventional dropwise condensation by increasing the time-averaged
      density of small droplets, which transfer heat more efficiently
      from the vapor to the substrate. Accordingly, these surfaces are
      attractive for applications such as atmospheric water harvesting
      and dehumidification where the heat fluxes are relatively low and
      droplets can be maintained in a highly mobile state.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] In particular, a superhydrophobic surface can be formed
      from on a metal substrate by forming a plurality of nanostructures
      of a metal oxide on the substrate. The metal oxide can form a
      layer on a surface of the substrate. The layer can have a
      thickness sufficient to permit acceptable heat transfer through
      the layer. The layer can be thin. For example, the metal oxide
      layer can be less than 10 micrometers, less than 5 micrometers,
      less than 2 micrometers, less than 1 micrometer, less than 0.5
      micrometers, or less than 0.1 micrometers in thickness.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] The layer of metal oxide can be grown on the surface in a
      manner that produces a variety of surface features, some portion
      of which are nanostructures. The layer of metal oxide can be grown
      by chemical or electrochemical oxidation of a metal substrate. For
      example, a copper substrate can be treated to form a layer of
      nanostructured copper oxide on the surface. Alternatively, an
      aluminum substrate can be treated to form a layer of
      nanostructured aluminum oxide on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The nanostructure can have dimensions of approximately 3
      [mu]m or smaller, 2 [mu]m or smaller. 1 [mu]m or smaller, or 500
      nm or smaller. In certain dimensions, the nanostructure can in
      some cases extend to greater dimensions; for example, a
      line-shaped feature might be several cm or several mm in length,
      or less, e.g., several nm in width up to several urn in length.
      Despite the length extending beyond the nanoscale, this feature
      would nonetheless be considered a nanostructure, because of the nm
      dimension of the width or depth.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Once the nanostructures have been formed, the surface can
      be coated with one or more coating layers. The coating layer can
      be selected to impart desired properties on the surface, such as,
      for example, mechanical robustness or increased hydrophobicity, or
      both. For example, the superhydrophobic surface can include a
      surface modifying layer on at least a portion of the
      nanostructures. The surface modifying layer can be a single layer
      or a multilayer. For example, an initial coating layer, e.g., a
      metallic layer can be deposited by (for example) electroless
      plating, chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition. The
      initial coating layer can be a polymer or a metal. The surface
      modifying layer can be a hydrophobic material, such as a polymer
      or self-assembled monolayer, directly on the nanostructure or on
      the initial coating layer. For example, a silane or a thiol can be
      assembled on a surface. The hydrophobic material; e.g., a
      hydrophobic polymer, hydrophobic thiol, hydrophobic carboxylic
      acid or hydrophobic silane, can include hydrocarbon (e.g., a
      saturated hydrocarbon) groups, halohydrocarbon groups (e.g., a
      saturated fluorohydrocarbon), or halocarbon groups (e.g., a
      perfluorinated alkyl group). In certain examples, the hydrophobic
      material can be trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane,
      (tridecafluoro-1,1,2,2-tetrahydrooctyl)-1-trichlorosilane,
      (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate), a Teflon amorphous
      fluoropolymer resin, or an alkyl or fluoroalkyl thiol deposited by
      appropriate techniques. The hydrophobic material can have C2-C18
      groups that can be fluorinated to varying degrees. The
      trifluoromethyl or difluoromethyl groups on the surface can allow
      the surface properties to be tailored, for example, to have
      advancing wetting angles of 105, 110, 115 or 120 degrees,
      depending on the choice of fluorinated alkyl group and base
      structure.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] For example, the surface modifying layer can be formed on
      an oxide nanostructures by gold sputter followed be self-assembly
      of a thiol monolayer. However, other more practical techniques,
      can be used to make the oxide nanostructures hydrophobic including
      initiated chemical vapor deposition of the polymer
      poly(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl acrylate) (PFDA), chemical vapor
      deposition of a fluorinated silane film (TPFS), dip-coating of a
      fluorinated silane film (FDTS), and spin-coating of the polymer
      poly(tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (w/an adhesion promoter).<br>

      [0034] A Teflon amorphous fluoropolymer resin (&lt;0.5 wt. %, Du
      Pont Polymers, Inc.) can be first dissolved into a FC40 solvent
      (3M Inc.). A 1 wt. % fluoroalkyl monosilane solvent (Cvtonix Inc.)
      is mixed into the solution to strengthen adhesion between the
      hydrophobic layer and copper oxide. The use of fluoroalkyl solvent
      can be found to be critical to prevent degradation of
      superhydrophobicity. The solution can then be coated on a CuO
      nanostructured surface, baked at 180[deg.] C. for 10 min to dry
      out the solvent, and then annealed at 340[deg.] C. for &gt;1 hour
      to improve the surface uniformity and adhesion. Goniometric
      measurements on a smooth surface coated with the Teflon film

      [0036] A chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process can be used to
      attach a conformal self-assembled
      trichloro(1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyl)silane (TPFS) molecular film
      to the nanostructured surface. Following a 10 minute O2 plasma
      clean, the surface can be exposed to a vapor of PTFS at room
      temperature and a pressure of 17.5 kPa (absolute) for a period of
      time ranging from 15 minutes to several hours. A strong covalent
      bond is formed between the silane molecule and the oxygen group on
      the oxide surface via a condensation reaction that produces a HCl
      by-product. Following deposition, the sample can be rinsed with a
      solvent (such as ethanol) and dried. Following deposition an
      optional (not necessary) annealing step can be performed whereby
      the substrate is heated to &gt;100[deg.] C. in order to induce
      molecular rearrangement producing a more uniform film structure.
      Note that the process is not limited to the PTFS molecule, but may
      also be performed with silane molecules that contain a similar

      [0039] Contact angle hysteresis is defined as the difference
      between the advancing and receding contact angles, and the
      roll-off tilt angle is the angle of a tilted surface at which a
      droplet will roll off. These three values are inter-related and
      collectively used to determine a surface's ability to demonstrate
      self-cleaning behavior. The surface can be superhydrophobic, with
      static contact angles greater than 170[deg.], contact angle
      hysteresis of less than 2[deg.], and roll-off angles of less than
      0.25[deg.]. The surface can also exhibit advantageous condensation
      mass and heat-transfer properties.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The implementation of superhydrophobic surfaces is of
      particular interest as a means to improve the efficiency of
      thermal and mass transport processes dependent on the condensation
      of water. Superhydrophobic condensation can be obtained provided
      two criteria are satisfied See Enright, R., et al.,
      Superhydrophobic condensation: The role of energy barriers and
      size-scale. unpublished, 2011, which is incorporated by reference
      in its entirety. The first is an approximately scale-invariant
      wetting energy criterion, which determines whether the contact
      line remains pinned at the base of a partially wetting droplet,
      leading to a weakly-pinned Cassie-like state (see Cassie, A. B. D.
      and S. Baxter, Wettability of porous surfaces. Trans. Faraday
      Soc., 1944. 40: p. 546, which is incorporated by reference in its

      Wetting and Roughness. Annual Review of Materials Research, 2008.
      38(1): p. 71-99. which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety. The pinning energy barrier during growth is given by the
      non-equilibrium Wenzel equation, cos [theta]a&lt;W&gt;=r cos
      [theta]a, where [theta]a is the advancing contact angle. This
      pinning barrier is then compared to the pinning barrier associated
      with the droplet advancing over the discontinuous surface in the
      Cassie state, cos [theta]a&lt;CB&gt;=-1 (see Choi, W., et al., A
      modified Cassie-Baxter relationship to explain contact angle
      hysteresis and anisotropy on non-wetting textured surfaces. J.
      Colloid Interface Sci., 2009. 339: p. 208-216, which is
      incorporated by reference in its entirety), such that a criterion
      can be defined to delineate the expected droplet morphology given
      by<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0041] When E*&gt;1 the contact line near the base of the pillars
      can overcome the energy barrier to de-pin and a Wenzel drop is
      formed. If E*&lt;1 complete de-pinning is prevented and the
      droplet spreads over the top of the pillar array forming a Cassie
      droplet as the drop size becomes larger than a length scale
      characterizing the pinning barrier, R&gt;&gt;1.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The second criterion for superhydrophobic condensation
      introduces a scale requirement by linking a characteristic size of
      the roughness defining the pinning energy barrier to the mean
      separation distance between nucleation sites (L). For stable
      Cassie growth, (L)/l&gt;=2 is the minimum requirement to avoid
      by-passing the pinning barrier defined by Eq. 1 during droplet
      coalescence.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In order to apply these surfaces for application in
      large-scale heat transfer there is a requirement for scalable
      processes compatible with existing engineering heat transfer
      materials. Furthermore, the fabrication method should minimize
      parasitic resistances that could negate the advantage of this
      unique wetting behavior.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] Here a scalable synthesis method is demonstrated for
      modifying copper surfaces to create unique oxide nanostructures
      that, once functionalized, can maintain Cassie condensation
      behavior while minimizing parasitic resistances due to the
      self-limiting behavior of the oxidation process. A combination of
      imaging and modeling suggests that there is a critical nucleation
      density for the CuO surface that delineates heat transfer
      enhancement from degradation with respect to a smooth hydrophobic
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0045] Surface Synthesis &amp; Characterization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0046] To synthesize the surfaces, commercially available
      oxygen-free copper sheet (99.9% purity, 0.8 mm thickness) was cut
      into ~1-2 cm&lt;2 &gt;tabs as substrates. Each Cu tab was cleaned
      in an ultrasonic bath with acetone for 5 min and rinsed with
      de-ionized (DI) water. The substrate was then dipped into a 2.0 M
      hydrochloric acid solution for 30 seconds to remove the native
      oxide, then triple-rinsed with DI water, and dried with pure
      nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Nanostructured copper oxide films were formed by immersing
      the cleaned substrate into a hot (~95[deg.] C.) alkaline solution
      composed of NaClO2, NaOH, Na3PO4.12H2O, and de-ionized (DI) water
      (3,75:5:10:100 wt. %). During the oxidation process, a thin
      (&lt;200 nm) Cu2O layer is initially formed on the copper surface
      and then re-oxidized to form CuO. FIG. 1A shows that sharp CuO
      nanostructures start to grow on the Cu2O intermediate layer. The
      surface reaction can be described as (see, Brisard, G. M., et al.,

      [0048] The height of the oxide nanostructures was approximately 1
      [mu]m after 5 minutes of growth (FIG. 1B). After that, the oxide
      growth rate significantly slows down to an almost negligible level
      as the CuO layer passivates the copper surface. See, Drogowska,
      M., L. Brossard, and H. Menard, Influence of anions on the
      passivity behavior of copper in alkaline solutions. Surface and
      Coatings Technology. 34(4): p. 383-400, which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. The XRD result (FIG. 1C) shows a strong
      CuO peak originating from the sharp oxide nanostructures and a
      weak Cu2O peak from the underlying layer. The unique needle-like
      morphology of the CuO nanostructures and the self-limiting
      behavior of the oxidation process are key minimize parasitic
      conduction thermal resistance of the oxide layers (kCuO 0.2
      W/m.K).<br>
      <br>
      [0049] To characterize the total oxide thickness of the fabricated
      samples, we used focused ion beam milling (FIB) (NVision 40 Dual
      Beam Focused Ion Beam, Carl Zeiss GMBH) and SEM imaging. Milling
      was performed with normal incidence of the ion beam (sample tilt
      of54[deg.]), ion beam energy of 30 keV, and ion current of 300 pA.
      The structure cross-sections were obtained by milling 8 [mu]m
      deep*20 [mu]m wide trenches. Due to the good milling response of
      Cu, surface polishing was not required. All samples were imaged at
      36[deg.] tilt using the in lens detector with electron beam
      energies of 7 keV. FIG. 1D shows the cross-section images of a
      nanostructured sample. The underlying Cu2O oxide thickness was
      found to be [delta]Cu2O 300 nm. With the addition of the CuO
      nanostructures, the total copper oxide thickness was
      [delta]Cu2O+[delta]CuO 1.5 [mu]m. The morphology of the CuO
      nanostructures resemble thin, but broad blades converging to a
      sharp point with a typical thickness of &lt;=100 nm and average
      widths of 300 nm.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The unique blade-like morphology of the CuO nanostructures,
      with a tip dimension of &lt;=10 nm, ensure nucleation within the
      structure (as opposed to the tips of the structure) due to the
      increased energy barrier associated with nucleation on features
      similar in size to the critical nucleation radius (Rc&lt;=35 nm

      promotes the formation of partially-wetting droplet morphologies,
      which are essential to minimizing individual droplet thermal
      resistance, since Gibb's criterion can be satisfied. See,

      [0051] The CuO nanostructures were functionalized by first coating
      them with a 30 nm-thick coating of Au followed by the formation of
      a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of
      1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecanethiol by immersing the oxidized
      substrate in 1 mM ethanol solution for 1 hr. Goniometric
      measurements on a smooth thiolated Au surface showed advancing and
      receding contact angles of [theta]a=121.1[deg.]+-2.2[deg.] and
      [theta]r=106.3[deg.]+-2.4[deg.], respectively, to give a

      [0052] The effective solid fraction of the CuO surface was

      [theta]&lt;CB&gt;=169.7[deg.]+2[deg.] ([Delta][theta]&lt;=2[deg.])
      using the Cassie-Baxter equation, cos [theta]&lt;CB&gt;, yielding
      a value of [phi]eff=0.027+-0.011 (FIG. 2). In order to extract the
      effective roughness defining the pinning energy barrier in Eq. 1,
      contact angle measurements of formamide (Sigma, molecular biology
      grade) were performed on both the smooth and nanostructured
      surface. The advancing angle on the smooth surface was found to be
      [theta]a=95.3[deg.]+-1.4[deg.] ([theta]r=90.2[deg.]+-2.1[deg.]),
      while the advancing Wenzel angle on the CuO surface was found to
      be [theta]a&lt;W&gt;=160.6[deg.]+-3.2[deg.]
      ([theta]r&lt;w&gt;=145.9[deg.]+-2[deg.]. Note that the Wenzel
      state was inferred by the observation of significant contact angle
      hysteresis between the advancing and receding values,
      [Delta][theta] 15[deg.]. The measurements yielded reff=10.2+-2.8.
      The effective roughness value obtained should be viewed as an
      indication of the complex contact line pinning apparent on the
      nanostructured CuO rather than a measure of the absolute roughness
      defined by the physical area of the rough surface in comparison to
      a corresponding smooth surface. See, Blow, M. L., H. Kusumaatmaja,

      [0054] Global droplet nucleation and growth behavior was studied
      with optical microscopy using a custom built set-up shown
      diagrammatically in FIG. 3. A supply of water-saturated N2 was
      obtained by sparging a temperature-controlled water reservoir with
      dry N2. A reservoir by-pass valve was installed to provide for the
      delivery of dry N2 to the sample as it was being cooled to the
      test temperature at the beginning of each experiment. The sample
      temperature was set using a temperature-controlled stage (Instec,
      TS102-00). Good thermal contact between the sample and the
      temperature control stage was ensured by interposing a thin layer
      of thermal grease (Omegatherm, Omega) with a stated thermal
      conductivity of 2.2 W/m.K.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Once the stage temperature stabilized at the test
      temperature, Tw=283+-0.1 K, the by-pass valve was closed to
      initiate the flow of water-saturated N2 to the sample enclosure at
      a constant flow rate of Q=2.5 l/min, marking the start of the
      experiment. The chamber humidity (Hygroclip, Rotronic) was
      recorded throughout the experiment. The supersaturation, S=pvpw,
      was controlled by adjusting the water reservoir temperature
      through which the N2 was sparged. Droplet nucleation and growth
      was recorded at intervals of 0.1 seconds using a high-speed (CMOS)

      <b>[0056] ESEM Condensation Experiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0057] The details of the nucleation and growth of condensed
      droplets on the functionalized CuO surface were studied using an
      environmental scanning electron microscope (Zeiss EVO 55 ESEM).
      Back scatter detection mode was employed with a high gain. The
      water vapor pressure in the ESEM chamber was 1.55 kPa. Typical
      image capture was obtained with a beam potential of 20 kV and
      variable probe current depending on stage inclination angle. A 500
      [mu]m lower aperture was used in series with a 1000 [mu]m variable
      pressure upper aperture for greater detail. The sample temperature
      was initially set to 285+-0.1 K using a cold stage and allowed to
      equilibrate for 5 minutes. After equilibration, the surface
      temperature was decreased to 284+-0.1 K resulting in nucleation of
      water droplets on the sample surface due to condensation of the
      saturated water vapour.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Images and recordings were obtained at an inclination angle
      of 70[deg.] to 80[deg.] from the horizontal; at a working distance
      ranging from 3 to 5 mm. This was done to ensure good imaging of
      the droplet nucleation dynamics at the surface, not typically seen
      with an overhead nucleation image, and to minimize substrate
      heating due to the electron beam. Recordings were performed at a
      500 ms frame speed corresponding to two frames per second. To
      ensure good thermal contact between the sample and cold stage,
      copper tape was used for mounting.<br>

      <b>[0059] Geometric Evolution of Individual Droplets</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0060] The droplet growth behavior on the hydrophobic CuO surfaces
      (FIG. 4A) was characteristic of the Cassie wetting state emerging
      from a pinned wetted region on the surface consistent with an
      estimated E*(reff) 0.19. The ESEM images of water droplets showed
      strong topographic contrast such that reliable contact angle
      measurements could be made. See, Donald, A. M., et al.,
      Topographic contrast of partially wetting water droplets in
      environmental scanning electron microscopy. Journal of
      Microscopy-Oxford, 2001. 204: p. 172-183, which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety. Droplet contact angles were determined
      by fitting a circle to each individual droplet (spherical
      approximation) and determining the slope of the tangent where the
      droplet neck intersects the fitted circle. This was more difficult
      for larger droplets due to the difficulty in determining where the
      base of the droplet intersects the fitted circle, resulting in a
      larger error and fewer data points. Each contact angle measurement
      was recorded along with the droplet diameter (FIG. 4B). The error
      associated with the droplet diameter measurement was due to the
      image resolution. The CuO droplet morphology showed an initially
      varying contact angle (R&lt;=3 [mu]m) due to local pinning of the
      droplet contact line until the advancing angle is reached R 3
      [mu]m, whose value is consistent with the macroscopically measured
      value (FIG. 2). The effective diameter of the pinned region can be
      estimated to be ~1-2 [mu]m based on the early stage contact angle
      behavior, which is consistent with the characteristic spacing of
      the CuO nanostructures estimated as l~[square root of]{square root
      over ([pi])}d/2[square root of]{square root over
      ([sigma]eff)}=1.63 [mu]m. This pinning behavior is in agreement
      with previous studies of droplet growth on well-controlled
      nanopillars geometries and Cu(OH)2 nanowires. See, Rykaczewski, K.
      and J. H. J. Scott, Methodology for imaging nano-to-microscale

      <br>
      [0061] In FIG. 5A, the apparent contact angle behavior of
      condensed droplets growing on the hydrophobic CuO in surfaces at
      S=1.07+-0.1 during ESEM imaging is shown. The ESEM images of water
      droplets showed strong topographic contrast allowing reliable
      contact angle measurements to be made. See, Donald, A. M.,
      Stelmashenko, N. A., Craven, J. P., Terentjev, E. M., and Thiel,
      B. L., 2001, "Topographic contrast of partially wetting water
      droplets in environmental scanning electron microscopy." Journal
      of Microscopy-Oxford, 204(2), pp. 172-183, which is incorporated
      by reference in its entirety. Droplet contact angles were
      determined by fitting a circle to each individual droplet
      (spherical approximation) and determining the droplet radius R and
      the height of the spherical segment H. The contact angle was
      calculated from R and Has<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0062] This image processing was more difficult for lower viewing
      angles (i.e. larger droplets) due to the challenge in determining
      where the base of the droplet intersects the fitted circle,
      resulting in a larger error and fewer data points. The error
      associated with the droplet radius measurement was due to the
      limit of the image resolution (typically 200-500 nm). The CuO
      droplet morphology showed an initially varying contact angle
      (R&lt;=3-4 [mu]m) because of locally pinned contact lines at the
      droplet base. Radius-dependent contact angle behavior continued up
      to the point where the interface of the droplet made contact with
      surrounding nanostructures and began spreading over the surface in
      the Cassie state with an approximately constant advancing angle.
      The observed advancing angle compares reasonably well with the
      macroscopically measured value of [theta]a&lt;CB&gt; 165[deg.].
      The early stage variation in the apparent contact angle was
      modeled as<br>
      <br>
      [0000] [mathematical formula]<br>
      <br>
      [0000] assuming a fixed pinned base area of Ap [pi]rp&lt;2
      &gt;underneath the individual droplets before coalescence (FIG.
      5B). In FIG. 5A, the apparent contact angle of droplets as a
      function of the droplet diameter extracted from the ESEM data on
      the Au/thiol (red circles) and silane (blue squares)
      functionalized CuO surfaces (pv=1300+-75 Pa, Tw=283+-1.5 K,
      S=1.07+-0.1) was plotted. The solid curve is defined as
      [theta]app=cos&lt;-1&gt;(rp/R)+90[deg.] with rp=1.5 [mu]m. The
      dashed dot curves represent the bounds of Eq. 3 for rp=1.5+-0.5
      [mu]m. The horizontal dashed line represents the macroscopically
      measured apparent contact angle, [theta]app 165[deg.]. The inset
      shows a typical ESEM image captured during the droplet growth
      process on the silane functionalized CuO surface. FIG. 5B shows
      the evolution of the droplet shape predicted by Eq. 3 for
      90[deg.]&lt;=[theta]app&lt;=170[deg.] in steps of 20[deg.]
      (droplets bounded by solid curves). The model fit (dashed lines)
      is defined as [theta]CuO(R)=40[deg.]+43.32R[deg.] (R&lt;=3 [mu]m)
      and [theta]CuO=170[deg.] (R&gt;3 [mu]m). Fitting Eq. 3 to the
      extracted contact angle data, we estimated that the characteristic
      radius of the pinned region to be rp 1-2 [mu]m, which compares
      well with the characteristic spacing of the CuO nanostructures
      estimated as l=[square root of]{square root over
      ([pi])}d/(2[square root of]{square root over ([sigma]eff)})=1.2 82
      m with d=300 nm and [sigma]eff =0.05. This pinning behavior is in
      agreement with previous studies of droplet growth on
      well-controlled nanopillars geometries and Cu(OH)2 nanowires. See,

      <b>[0063] Emergent Droplet Morphology</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] The influence of the nucleation density on the emergent
      wetting state was explored using optical microscopy. Optical
      microscopy offers an advantage over ESEM since larger vapor
      pressures can be achieved without compromising image quality.
      Partially-wetting Cassie behavior with jumping droplets emerged on
      the Au/thiolated CuO surface where (L)=0.5N&lt;-0.5&gt; 8.1 [mu]m
      obtained by focusing at the surface (top, FIG. 6A) and confirmed
      by focusing through the droplets (below, FIG. 6B) to show the
      wetting state. In FIGS. 6A-6B, condensation on the Au/thiolated
      surface at S 1.5 resulted in a nucleation density of N=4*10&lt;9
      &gt;m&lt;-2&gt;. The red arrow in the inset of FIG. 6B points to a
      light-absorbing region surrounded by a light-reflecting region
      indicative of the partial-wetting morphology (Inset scale bar: 10
      [mu]m). The droplets were found to be weakly pinned to the surface
      as evidenced by the observation of droplet jumping (coalescing
      droplets disappeared from the field of view). Focusing through the
      droplets (FIG. 6B) revealed that, in most cases, a single dark
      light absorbing region surrounded by a bright reflective ring was
      located beneath each droplet indicative of a partially-wetting
      Cassie state. The approximate sizes of the pinned base of the
      droplets were found by fitting circles to the dark regions. The
      magnification factor due to focusing through the nominally
      spherical droplets was estimated from M=n/(2-n) 2 (see, Wang, Z.,
      Guo, W., Li, L., Luk'yanchuk, B., Khan, A., Liu, Z., Chen, Z., and
      Hong, M., 2010, "Optical virtual imaging at 50 nm lateral
      resolution with a white-light nanoscope," Nature Communications,
      2, 218, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety), where
      a refractive index of n=1.33 was used for water. Image processing
      of the measurements gave rp=1.09+-0.13 [mu]m consistent with the
      contact angle behavior observed in FIG. 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In contrast, condensation on the silanated surface at S 1.5
      (FIG. 6C-6D) resulted in a nucleation density of N&gt;5*10&lt;10
      &gt;m&lt;-2 &gt;despite the fact that both the thiol and silane
      molecules are CF3 terminated (i.e., same nominal surface energy).
      Mixed-mode wetting behavior with pinned droplets on the silanated
      CuO surface where (L)=0.5N&lt;-0.5&gt;&lt;2.2 [mu]m obtained by
      focusing at the surface (top, FIG. 6C) and confirmed by focusing
      through the droplets (below, FIG. 6D) to show the wetting state.
      This large nucleation density led to the formation of highly
      pinned droplets that developed irregular shapes following
      coalescence events (i.e., no coalescence-induced jumping
      observed). This behavior was in contrast to that observed at lower
      supersaturations in the ESEM where droplet jumping was observed on
      the silanated CuO surface, FIG. 6E shows time-lapse images of
      condensation on the silane-coated CuO surface during ESEM imaging.
      The dashed and solid circles indicate droplet groups before and
      after coalescence, respectively (ESEM conditions: pv=800+-75 Pa
      and Tw=276+-1.5 K (S=1.07+-0.1)). Focusing through the droplets
      (FIG. 5D) showed a number of light absorbing and reflecting
      regions under the larger droplets formed by coalescence events
      consistent with a mixed mode wetting state rather than complete
      wetting. See, Wier, K. A., and Mccarthy, T. J., 2006,

      <b>[0066] Distribution of Nucleation Sites</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0067] To understand emergent morphology on the functionalized CuO
      surfaces in the coalescence-dominated growth stage, we first
      investigated the distribution of nucleation sites on the
      Au/thiol-functionalized surface. FIG. 7A shows a coordinate map
      showing the position of the nucleation sites (blue dots) and
      arrows indicating their nearest neighbor captured using optical
      microscopy at 100* magnification on the Au/thiol functionalized
      CuO surface at t=10 s after the start of the experiment (S 1.5,
      N=3.83*109 m&lt;-2&gt;) (FIG. 6A-6B). FIG. 7B shows the cumulative
      probability distribution of the nucleated droplet nearest
      neighbors (red circles) compared to the predictions for a random
      distribution, P=1-e&lt;-N[pi]L&gt;&lt;&lt;2 &gt;&gt;(solid line).
      The mean separation distance between nucleation sites is given by
      2L[square root of]N=1. The horizontal bars represent the bin
      width. FIG. 7C shows an OM image capturing the distribution of
      droplet nucleation sites (S 1.5, N=4*10&lt;9 &gt;m&lt;-2&gt;) on
      the Au/thiol functionalized CuO surface at t=10 s after the start
      of the experiment. The distribution of nucleation sites from FIG.
      7C were analyzed and found to be in good agreement with the
      Poisson distribution indicating a spatially random nucleation
      process such that the mean nearest neighbor is given by:<br>

      which is incorporation by reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] However, the observation of nucleation at low
      supersaturations, S&lt;=1.5, is inconsistent with kinetic
      nucleation theory, which predicts a critical supersaturation
      Sc&gt;2.5 for water condensing on hydrophobic surfaces
      ([theta]&gt;90[deg.]). See, Kashchiev, D., Nucleation: Basic
      Theory with Applications. 1 ed. 2000, Oxford:
      Butterworth-Heinemann., which is incorporated by reference in its
      entirety. This seeming inconsistency has been linked to
      randomly-distributed defects in the molecular film coatings used
      to impart hydrophobicity, which expose the underlying
      (highly-wettable) substrate creating active nucleation sites. See,
      Enright, R., et al., Superhydrophobic condensation: The role of
      energy harriers and size-scale. unpublished, 2011, which is
      incorporated by reference in its entirety. Thus, we attribute the
      distinctly different condensation behavior observed in FIG. 6 to
      the defect density associated with the two functionalization
      methods and the resulting discrepancy in the number of active
      nucleation sites at S 1.5.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0070] Droplet Jumping to Pinning Transition</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0071] The transition to a non-jumping mixed-mode wetting state
      regime can be understood by considering that, as the spacing
      between nucleation sites L approaches the length scale of the
      partially-pinned region under a droplet rp, the excess surface
      energy released during coalescence due to a change in liquid/vapor
      interfacial area [Delta]A at constant volume V is unable to
      overcome the constant work of adhesion associated with the pinned
      region under the coalescing droplets. Assuming that complete
      de-wetting of the liquid from the structured region is
      energetically unfavorable compared to some portion of the liquid
      remaining pinned within the structures on the surface, the work of
      adhesion required to create new interfacial area is
      W1/[gamma]Ap=[(2-[sigma])+[sigma] cos [theta][gamma]] 2 (for
      [sigma]-&gt;0). To calculate the excess surface energy
      [Delta]E([sigma]app, R) available for droplet jumping we
      considered the situation shown in FIG. 8A. Two droplets of equal
      diameter coalesce resulting in the formation of a single jumping
      droplet. Considering only the volume of liquid not pinned within
      the structure, the energy balance between states 1 and 2 is given
      by<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      [Delta]E=E2-E1=[gamma][pi][4R&lt;2&gt;(cos
      [theta]app(R)-1)-4&lt;1/3&gt;&lt;2/3&gt;(R&lt;3&gt;(3+cos
      [theta]app(R))(cos [theta]app(R)-1)&lt;2&gt;)&lt;2/3&gt;], (5)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where cos [theta]app(R) is obtained from Eq. 3. The total
      work of adhesion W was estimated based on the partially-wetted
      area under each droplet Ap. Neglecting the functionalized CuO
      contribution to w1 since [sigma] 0, the work of adhesion for two
      droplets is then<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      w=2W1=4[gamma]Ap. (6)<br>
      <br>
      [0072] When the magnitudes of [Delta]E and W are comparable or
      when W dominates (¦[Delta]E/W¦&lt;=1), there is little or no
      energy available in the system of the two droplets to power
      jumping. Thus, upon coalescence the newly formed droplet remains
      on the surface with either one or two wetted regions in the
      apparent base area, while the remainder of the apparent base area
      resides in the Cassie state (mixed mode wetting state). However,
      when ¦[Delta]E/W¦&gt;&gt;1, sufficient excess surface energy is
      available for conversion into the kinetic energy for droplet
      jumping, provided that other dissipation mechanism do not play a
      significant role. See, Boreyko, J. B., and Chen, C.-H., 2009,
      "Self-propelled dropwise condensate on superhydrophobic surfaces,"
      Phys. Rev. Lett., 103(18), pp. 184501, which is incorporated by
      reference in its entirety.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In FIG. 8A, the excess liquid/vapor surface energy was
      estimated by considering the difference in energy between states
      E1 and E2. Energy is required to overcome the work of adhesion to
      form a liquid/vapor interface of area 2Ap for the two pinned necks
      of the coalescing droplets. In FIG. 8B, ¦[Delta]E/W¦ is plotted as
      a function of the droplet coalescence length, L=2R, scaled by the
      characteristic diameter of the pinned region beneath the droplet,
      2rp, according to to Eqs. 5 and 6. Three values of rp (=1 [mu]m,
      1.5 [mu]m and 2 [mu]m) are shown for each surface. Increasing rp
      results in smaller values of ¦[Delta]E/W¦. We observe that
      ¦[Delta]E/W¦~[L/(2rp)]&lt;2&gt;. For rp=1 [mu]m, the model
      predicts ¦[Delta]E/W¦=0.07 (no jumping) and ¦[Delta]E/W¦=6.27
      (jumping possible) for the silanated CuO ((L)/(2rp)=1.1, blue
      squares) and thiolated CuO (L/(2rp)=4.05, red circles),
      respectively, consistent with the observed behavior in FIG. 6. The
      shaded region ((L/(2rp)&lt;=1) marks the transition to the Wenzel
      state. The horizontal bars for each point show +-[square root
      of]{square root over ((L))}. The large spread in separation
      distances indicates the possibility of a mixed behavior of droplet
      jumping and pinning on the same surface. Increasing rp from 1
      [mu]m to 2 [mu]m reduces ¦[Delta]E/W¦ to 1.1 for the Au/thiol
      surface. For the silane surface, the same increase in rp results
      in (L)/(2rp)&lt;1. Based on the observed jumping behavior of the
      Au/thiol surface and the mixed modes observed on the silane
      surface, we conclude that the pinned radius is in the range of 1
      [mu]m&lt;=rp&lt;=1.5 [mu]m, which is consistent with our optical
      measurements of the pinned base region.<br>

      </b><br>
      [0075] To quantify the heat transfer behavior of individual
      droplets growing on the nanostructured CuO surface, we used a
      steady-state heat transfer model that captures the key thermal
      resistances from the saturated vapor atmosphere in the ESEM to the
      condensing structured surface for heat transferring through a
      single droplet. See. Miljkovic et al. (ACS Nano, 2012) and

      <b>[0087] Model Prediction of Individual Drop Growth Rates</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0088] In FIG. 10A, the measured droplet radii as a function of
      time for 12 individual droplets were compared to the predictions
      of the heat transfer model described above. The experimentally
      measured droplet diameters as a function of time (red circles) are
      compared to the individual droplet growth model (solid curve) with
      rp=1.5 [mu]m, [delta]CuO=1.5 [mu]m (ESEM conditions: pv=800+-75 Pa
      and Tw=276+-1.5 K (S=1.07+-0.1)). The inset shows the experimental
      data, the model predictions and a fitted R[proportional
      to]t&lt;1/3 &gt;scaling (dashed curve) in log coordinates. The
      error bars correspond to uncertainty in the measured droplet
      radius. The data was best fit by [Delta]T=0.034 K, which is within
      the uncertainty of the measurements of temperature and pressure in
      the ESEM chamber. This value was chosen based on the best fit
      between the model and experimental growth rate data. The results
      of the observed behavior compare well to the classic power law
      growth model for condensation. See, Fritter, D., Knobler, C. M.,
      and Beysens, D. A., 1991, "Experiments and simulations of the
      growth of droplets on a surface (breath figures)," Phys. Rev. A,

      <br>
      [0089] When droplet dimensions are larger than the pinned region
      (R&gt;2 [mu]m), we expect the droplet radius to follow a power law
      over time R=At&lt;b&gt;, where A is a constant, t is time and b,
      the power law exponent, ranges from 0 to 1 depending on the
      substrate dimensionality and growth limiting mechanism. During
      initial growth without coalescence (R&lt;4 [mu]m), the power law
      exponent of b=[3/4] could be reasonably fitted to the data. This
      value was within the range of 0 to 1, but differs from b=[1/3]
      expected for diffusion limited growth. This result indicates that
      a diffusion process was not the major limiting growth mechanism.
      However, at long times the b=[1/3] growth exponent was recovered,
      coinciding with diffusion limited growth due to conduction through
      the droplet bulk.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] FIG. 10B gives a breakdown of the component thermal
      resistances normalized to the total thermal resistance predicted
      by the model during droplet growth. The vertical line delineates
      the transition from radius-dependant apparent contact angle
      ([theta]app(R)) to a fixed contact angle equal to the
      macroscopically measured apparent advancing contact angle
      ([theta]a&lt;CB&gt;) at 2R=11 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The model predicts that at small droplet radii (R&lt;=3
      [mu]m), growth rates were limited by the combination of the
      conduction resistance of the droplet volume pinned within the
      nanostructures
      ((([psi]hc+[psi]CuO)&lt;-1&gt;+([psi]w+[psi]hc)&lt;-1&gt;)&lt;-1&gt;)
      and the interface curvature resistance ([psi]c) that effectively
      reduces the driving pressure difference for vapor molecules
      attaching to the liquid-vapor interface. The interfacial
      resistance (p) was found to contribute little to the total
      resistance, peaking at [psi]i/[psi]T=0.17 for R=0.95 [mu]m before
      dropping off to [psi]i/[psi]T&lt;0.01 at larger radii. Similarly,
      the Cu2O layer ([psi]Cu2O) beneath the CuO nanostructures also
      contributed negligibly to the total thermal resistance,
      [psi]Cu2O/[psi]T 0.02. Beyond R&gt;8 [mu]m, the heat transfer
      process was increasingly limited by the conduction resistance
      within the droplet bulk. See, Miljkovic et al. (ACS Nano, 2012).<br>

      <b>[0092] Droplet Number Density as a Function of Droplet Diameter</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0093] To discern the mean coalescence length for condensed
      droplets on the CuO nanostructure, the droplet size distribution
      was measured from the ESEM images. Droplet number density and size
      were measured from multiple images of the steady-state
      condensation process over several cycles of droplet growth,
      coalescence-induced jumping and re-growth for ESEM conditions:
      pv=800+-75 Pa, Tw=276+-1.5 K, S=1.07+-0.1 (ImageJ and Adobe
      Photoshop), accounting for inclination angle and total frame size
      (FIG. 11). The counting error associated with the droplet number
      density was estimated to be ~10% at each size range.<br>

      &gt;m&lt;-2&gt;, the mean center-to-center spacing of the droplets
      was 5 [mu]m and coalescence-induced jumping (see, Boreyko, J. B.

      <b>[0095] Heat Transfer Performance of the CuO Surface</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0096] To predict the heat transfer performance of the CuO
      surface, the observed growth behavior was incorporated into a
      recently developed model. The steady state condensation heat flux
      was first estimated by modeling the heat transfer rate through an
      individual drop. Heat is transferred from the saturated vapor to
      the liquid-vapor interface through resistances associated with
      droplet curvature (rc) and liquid-vapor interface (ri). The heat
      is conducted through the droplet and the nanostructures to the
      substrate through thermal resistances due to conduction through
      the droplet that incorporates the contact angle behavior as a
      function of droplet size (FIG. 4) (rd), the hydrophobic coating
      (rhc), the nanostructures and underlying oxide (rn) and the area
      of pinned liquid underneath the droplet (rg). The single drop
      behavior was then multiplied by the droplet size distribution and
      integrated over all radii given by:<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      q&lt;n&gt;=[integral]R*&lt;R&gt;&lt;eff
      &gt;q(R)n(R)dR+[integral]Reff&lt;R&gt;&lt;max &gt;q(R)N(R)dR. (15)<br>
      <br>
      [0097] Eq. 15 was used to compare the heat flux performance for
      the CuO surface to a corresponding smooth thiolated surface with a
      contact angle corresponding to the advancing angle
      ([theta]a=120[deg.]). The droplet coalescence length L was set
      equal to the effective radius Reff and varied by changing
      nucleation density according to Eq. 4. To make a conservative
      comparison of performance, the nucleation density for both
      surfaces was assumed to be equal. For the flat surface a fixed
      departure size, R=2 mm, was assumed. The departure size for the
      CuO surface was equated to L assuming ideal coalescence-induced
      jumping behavior, i.e., inviscid limit with no influence of
      variable contact angle. FIG. 12 demonstrates that, for L&gt;5
      [mu]m, the CuO surface degrades heat transfer performance in
      comparison to the smooth surface. A 2* peak is observed at L 2
      [mu]m, but performance drops for smaller L as the curvature
      resistance begins to play a significant role. However, for the CB
      state to arise it is necessary to remain above the critical L/l,
      which limits the maximum enhancement to ~1.6* at L 3 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The predicted behavior can be explained in terms of the key
      thermal resistances. During early stages of growth (R&lt;=6
      [mu]m), the conduction resistance (rd) through the droplet is
      negligible compared to the other thermal resistances. Therefore,
      for a droplet on the CuO surface, the nanostructure (rn+rhc) and
      liquid bridge (rg+rhc) resistances are dominant. However, for
      R&gt;=6 [mu]m the performance is limited by the large apparent
      contact angle of droplets on the CuO surface, which causes
      significant thermal resistance due to the limited droplet basal
      contact area. This can be seen in FIG. 12 where the effect of
      reducing the nanostructure height was explored while assuming
      identical contact angle behavior. The peak enhancement is observed
      to increase to ~3.5* (or ~2.75* to remain above the critical L/l
      ratio), but the maximum "break-even" coalescence length does not
      change to a great extent, increasing from ~5 [mu]m to ~7 [mu]m.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0099] Overall Heat Transfer Behavior</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0100] To estimate the overall heat transfer performance of the
      nanostructured CuO surface, the individual droplet growth behavior
      was incorporated into an expression for the droplet size
      distribution and integrating over all radii given by)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      Q''=[integral]Rc&lt;(L)/2
      &gt;q(R)n(R)dR+[integral](L)/2&lt;R&gt;&lt;maN&gt;q(R)N(R)dR. (16)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] where q'' is the overall steady-state condensation heat
      transfer rate per unit area of the condensing surface, (L)/2 is
      the mean droplet coalescence radius, q(R) is the individual
      droplet heat transfer (Eq. 14), n(R) is the non-interacting
      droplet size distribution, N(R) is the coalescence dominated
      droplet size distribution and Rmax is the droplet departure size.
      The first integral in Eq. 16 primarily captures the heat flux due
      to individual droplet growth before coalescence, but also accounts
      for the role of droplet sweeping via n(R). The second integral
      captures the additional heat flux due to droplet coalescence and
      sweeping.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In FIG. 13A, the heat flux ratio is plotted as a function
      of a unique coalescence length scaled by the pinned base diameter
      of the droplet for the cases where rp=1 [mu]m, 1.5 [mu]m and 2
      [mu]m. Thus, the minimum allowable L corresponds to L/2rp=1 for
      the three cases. FIG. 13 demonstrates that for rp=1 [mu]m, the CuO
      surface degrades heat transfer performance in comparison to the
      smooth surface over the entire range of allowable coalescence
      lengths. For rp=1.5-2 [mu]m, qCuO/qF=1.13-1.25 at L/(2rp)=1, but
      drops off steadily as L increases. This behavior is compared to a
      hypothetical surface with the CuO structure height reduced to
      [delta]CuO=100 nm. Here we see that the heat transfer behavior is
      enhanced at L/(2rp)=1 for the three values of rp modeled, ranging
      from 1.16&lt;=qCuO/qF&lt;=1.87. This result highlights the
      important role of the parasitic thermal resistance associated with
      the height of the structures. The inset of FIG. 13A shows the
      predicted behavior for the three pinned regions sizes for the
      average spacing identified in FIG. 11, (L)=4.42 [mu]m. The model
      predicts qCuO/qF=0.37, 0.7 and 1.11 for rp=1 [mu]m, 1.5 [mu]m and
      2 [mu]m, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] The predicted behavior in FIG. 13A is a direct result of
      the dominant thermal resistances as a function of droplet size for
      the CuO nanostructured surface ([delta]CuO=1.5 [mu]m) compared to
      a smooth hydrophobic surface for rp=1 [mu]m, 1.5 [mu]m and 2 [mu]m
      (solid curves). The CuO surface shows an enhancement for
      L/(2rp)-&gt;1 and rp&lt;=1.5 [mu]m. This behavior is compared to
      similar, hypothetical surface with the CuO height reduced to
      [delta]CuO=100 nm (dashed curves). The hypothetical surface
      demonstrates a wider range of enhancement (modeled conditions:
      [Delta]T=0.034 K. pv=800 Pa). FIG. 13A inset shows the predicted
      heat transfer behavior rp=1 [mu]m, 1.5 [mu]m and 2 [mu]m with
      (L)=4.42 [mu]m. During early stages of growth (R&lt;=6 [mu]m), the
      conduction resistance ([psi]d) through the droplet is relatively
      small compared to the conduction resistance through the pinned
      base region and the curvature resistance. This explains the
      significant effect of reducing the nanostructure height while
      assuming identical contact angle behavior. Therefore, droplet
      shedding at these radii isolates a regime of high growth rates (in
      comparison to the later diffusion limited growth), but can only be
      accessed in the jumping-droplet regime by reducing the
      characteristic length-scale of the surface structures. In the
      diffusion limited growth regime (R&gt;=6 [mu]m), the performance
      of the nanostructured CuO surface is penalized by the large
      apparent contact angle of the droplets, which causes significant
      thermal resistance due to the limited droplet basal contact area
      in comparison to a droplet on the smooth condensing surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In FIGS. 13B-13C, the heat flux ratio is plotted as a
      function of L/(2rp) for rp=1.5 [mu]m and [delta]CuO=1.5 [mu]m
      (FIG. 13B) and [delta]CuO=100 nm (FIG. 13C) with 0.01
      K&lt;=[Delta]T&lt;=5 0.05 K in steps of 0.01 K with constant
      pv=800 Pa. FIG. 13D summarizes the results shown in FIGS. 13B-13C.
      The values of qCuO/qp at L/(2rp)=1 (solid curves) and ¦qCuO/qF¦max
      (dashed curves) for [delta]CuO=1.5 [mu]m (blue squares) and
      [delta]CuO=100 nm (red circles) obtained from FIG. 13B and FIG.
      13C, respectively. We can see that the jumping surface is more
      strongly affected by the degree of subcooling in comparison to the
      smooth surface. The strong effect of subcooling can be explained
      by the fact that jumping droplets grow in size ranges from Rc up
      to (L)/2( 1-10 [mu]m) where the curvature resistance is
      appreciable during the majority of the droplet growth. However,
      shedding droplets obtain most of their growth and heat transfer at
      size ranges from Rc up to 1 mm) where the curvature resistance is
      a smaller contribution to the thermal resistance. The result is a
      heavier penalty paid by jumping droplets, especially at low
      supersaturations. We observe this behavior in the model by
      recalling that the heat transfer behavior of a jumping surface is
      dictated solely by the first integral in Eq. 16, whereas in
      conventional dropwise condensation the heat transfer behavior is
      more heavily weighted by the second integral in Eq. 16 and the
      important role of sweeping during droplet shedding. Thus, the
      [Delta]T-(2Tsat[gamma]/Rhlv[rho]l) term in Eq. 13 plays a more
      central role in the heat transfer behavior of jumping droplet
      condensation surfaces.<br>

      <b>CONCLUSIONS</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0104] A scalable synthesis method for creating unique oxide
      nanostructures capable of providing sustained superhydrophobic
      condensation was presented. Spatially random nucleation at low
      supersaturations (S&lt;=1.5) was observed using OM, suggesting the
      role of randomly distributed defects in the thiol SAM coating on
      the nucleation process. Observations of nucleation and growth
      behavior using ESEM, coupled with a recently developed model of
      the heat transfer process on superhydrophobic surfaces, suggests
      that these surfaces may only become advantageous over a smooth
      hydrophobic surface for coalescence-induced departure sizes below
      ~5 [mu]m (N&gt;=1*10&lt;10 &gt;m&lt;-2&gt;) and for nucleation
      densities corresponding to L/(2rp)-&gt;1 with rp&gt;=1.5 [mu]m,
      which is due predominantly to the increased resistance associated
      with the large apparent contact angles demonstrated by drops on
      the CuO surface and, to a lesser extent, the height of the
      nanostructures and the assumption of comparable nucleation
      densities for both the structured and smooth condensing surfaces.
      This last assumption may be overly conservative given the large
      roughness of the CuO surface. Indeed, we have recently
      demonstrated, via macroscopic heat transfer measurements, that
      these surfaces are capable of providing a 1.25* heat flux
      enhancement compared to a conventional dropwise condensing
      surface. See, Miljkovic, N., Enright, R., Nam, Y., Lopez, K., Dou,
      N., Sack, J., and Wang, E. N., 2012, "Jumping-droplet-enhanced
      condesation on scalable superhydrophobic nanostructured surfaces,"
      Nano Lett., 10.1021/n1303835c1, which is included by reference in
      its entirety. Good agreement between the data and the model was
      obtained by taking the nucleation density on the CuO surface to be
      three times larger than the corresponding smooth surface.
      Furthermore, we note that, presently, the overall heat transfer
      model does not account for the range of droplet separation
      distances characteristic of a random distribution. This point
      remains to be addressed in future studies.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] By bounding the maximum nucleation density by the critical
      L/l ratio, a maximum enhancement of ~1.6* has been predicted. In
      addition to demonstrating the benefits of increased nucleation
      density and smaller structure length scales, these results suggest
      that the coalescence-induced jumping mechanism for droplet
      departure should be studied in more detail to understand the
      trade-off between efficient shedding and L/(2rp) ratios as they
      approach unity, marking the transition to Wenzel behavior for the
      partial wetting state. This work highlights some of the challenges
      associated with realizing superhydrophobic surfaces that can
      enhance condensational heat transfer, but also emphasizes
      opportunities to engineer condensation behavior at nanometer
      length scales.<br>
