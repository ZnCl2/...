      <br>
      <br>
      Rene Nunez Suarez of San Salvador has spent years in a passionate,
      single-minded quest to provide the world's poor with a
      high-efficiency stove, in an effort to fight global warming and
      reduce deforestation. Now, the acclaimed inventor is left with
      praise, but no money and an estranged family, as reported by the
      Los Angeles Times. The device clearly has noble aims. <br>
      <br>
      It's a stainless-steel cooker that uses about 95% less fuel than
      conventional wood stoves, with minimal pollution. <br>
      <br>
      In El Salvador, millions still cook their daily meals with wood,
      and the countryside has long been denuded of so many of its
      invaluable trees. Worldwide, about half the planet cooks and heats
      with inefficient, polluting traditional fuels, according to the
      World Resources Institute. <br>
      <br>
      That means millions suffer from asthma, cancer and other problems
      associated with inhaling so much particle pollution. In fact,
      cooking fire pollution has been blamed for the deaths of an
      estimated 1.6 million people a year worldwide, mostly women and
      children. <br>
      <br>
      Plus, hours are often spent each day gathering and preparing
      firewood, dung and other fuels. That's time not spent in school or
      on other more economically productive activities. <br>
      <br>
      Nunez has secured a U.S. patent and a prestigious award from the
      Paris-based International Energy Agency for his Turbococina, or
      Turbostove. <br>
      <br>
      What Nunez has long sought is funding to get the stoves
      distributed to those who need them in the countryside. But so far
      he hasn't secured interest from investors he says he can trust or
      nonprofit organizations. <br>
      <br>
      Nunez's sad story isn't unfamiliar in a world fraught with
      inequality. Many observers have long complained that the
      technology may exist to provide better drugs for malaria,
      dysentery and possibly even AIDS, but that lack of the ability of
      those who need them most to pay means little incentive for
      capitalistic systems. <br>
      <br>
      Sometimes there seems like an orgy of R&amp;D and marketing
      spending on the latest gadgets, hair-loss remedies or shiny, sexy
      toys, while a brilliant inventor with a relatively simple device
      to help save the world can't get any notice.<br>

      Device for generating and transmitting heat capable of operating
      with fuel in any physical state that includes at least one
      cylindrical combustion chamber (9) divided into a lower section
      (11) and an upper section (12) of variable height, a pressurized
      air chamber (26) arranged below the lower section (11) of the
      combustion chamber, and a plurality of air injectors (14). The
      device is characterized in that the air injectors (14) are
      supported on a flat ring (43) and set in a second flat ring (52)
      and in that it also includes a set of replaceable parts (A)
      arranged in the free centre of both flat rings (43 and 52) and
      whose specific configuration depends on the physical state of the
      fuel being used. Furthermore said set of replaceable parts (A)
      includes at least one central air injector (16) located in the
      geometric centre of the unit.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0001] The present invention, as the present specification states
      in its title, is intended to provide a device for generating and
      transmitting heat capable of operating with fuel in any physical
      state, i.e. it can be fed with fuel in solid, liquid or gas state.
      In turn, it is an object of the invention to maximize the
      combustion efficiency, i.e. that the fuel consumption is intended
      to be optimized, which results in significant fuel savings and the
      reduction of the emissions of pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] Likewise, the present invention is Intended to describe a
      combustion flame generated inside the described device for
      generating and transmitting heat, flame whose properties are
      highly advantageous in terms of heat transfer and for preventing
      the production of pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The present invention falls within the methods for
      obtaining energy through combustion processes, within the heat
      transfer processes and their generator and transmitter devices. It
      has general application within the field of combustion and heat
      transfer, for both industrial applications and domestic use.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Among the concrete and practical applications of the
      present invention, its use in the field of steam generation for
      heating or electric power generation can be mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Also among non-industrial applications of the invention its
      use in heaters, stoves, ovens, kitchens and the like can be
      mentioned.<br>
      <br>
      <b>STATE OF THE ART PRIOR TO THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0006] Currently there are lots of devices for generating and
      transmitting heat, combustion chambers of which are intended to
      obtain combustion as "perfect" or "complete" as possible, in order
      to achieve savings in fuel consumption, while seeking to minimize
      the generation pollutants.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] As the background closer to the present invention, it is
      known the U.S. Patent 6,651,645 BI that describes a device for
      generating heat for solid fuel. Although said document explicitly
      states that the described apparatus can be used "for other types
      of fuels such as powder fuels, liquid fuels or gas fuels", the
      practice shows that it is not possible to use any of the solutions
      described in said patent with liquid or gas fuels. Among the
      solutions described in said document, none of them describes or
      suggests a device that can be used with liquid or gas fuel, and is
      not mentioned, nor suggested that the same apparatus admits fuels
      in any physical state (solid, liquid or gas).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Additionally, the device for generating heat described in
      US6,651,645-B1 has some drawbacks, such as the fact that due to
      the high temperatures reached inside the combustion chamber, the
      substantially parallel plates or discs wherein the air injectors
      are embedded, are bent; which can lead to their breakage.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Therefore, it was desirable to obtain a device for
      generating and transmitting heat that:<br>
      can be used with fuels in any physical state, whether solid,
      liquid or gas, while<br>
      manages to maximize the combustion efficiency so as to obtain
      significant fuel savings,<br>
      manages to transfer the maximum amount of produced heat to the
      place of its utilization, i.e. minimizing heat losses into the
      environment.<br>
      prevents the emission of pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx),
      and<br>
      be resistant to high temperatures generated inside the combustion
      chamber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0010] The present invention is intended to provide a device for
      generating and transmitting heat, capable of operating with fuel
      in any physical state, i.e. fuel in solid, liquid or gas state,
      which in turn allows to achieve the desired objectives and
      overcome the drawbacks of heat generators existing in the prior
      art.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Thus, the new device for generating and transmitting heat,
      object of the present invention comprises at least one combustion
      chamber preferably with a tubular shape, preferably constituted by
      a cylinder. Said cylinder is preferably divided into two sections,
      a lower section and an upper section of variable height. The
      height may be varied depending on the density of heat per volume
      unit of the combustion flame to be obtained in the combustion
      chamber. Furthermore, the apparatus of the present invention
      comprises a pressurized air chamber disposed below the lower
      section of the cylinder that forms the combustion chamber, and a
      plurality of air injectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The air injectors are supported on a first flat ring that
      forms the upper part of the pressurized air chamber and set in a
      second flat ring arranged in contact with the lower end of the
      cylinder that forms the combustion chamber. These air injectors
      are preferably arranged following the circular path of the flat
      rings, in a substantially radial direction from the center to the
      outside. The fact of providing the air injectors supported on the
      first flat ring instead of setting thereof in a disc or plate
      provides the following advantages:<br>
      the air injectors can slide on the first flat ring, so that when
      high temperatures generated inside the combustion chamber and the
      resulting expansion that said ring may suffer, the presence of the
      injectors does not cause its bent and possible breakage, and<br>
      inside the flat rings, i.e. in the central or free area, a set of
      replaceable parts can be provided, configuration of which is
      defined by the physical state of the fuel to be used, whether
      solid, liquid or gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The second flat ring is fastened by fixation means
      preferably of the type of a pin, bolt or screw arranged to be
      sandwiched between the air injectors.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The number of injectors is in principle not relevant and
      depends on the diameter of the cylinder that forms the combustion
      chamber. However, as the aim to achieve with this particular
      arrangement of air injectors is a rotational flow from the
      injection of the different air flows, thus the minimum number of
      injectors required to obtain said rotational flow is the one that,
      according to the diameter of the cylinder that forms the
      combustion chamber, and the arrangement described, resembles a
      circle. Thus, for example, it can be indicated that from 6 air
      injectors, i.e. forming a hexagon, the configuration starts
      resembling a circle. It is also preferable to have an even number
      of injectors in order to ensure that the flame resulting from the
      combustion remains equidistant from all points of the cylinder
      that forms the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] Thus, as noted above, the apparatus of the present
      invention comprises a set of replaceable parts, arranged in the
      free center of the flat rings, in the lower end of the lower
      section of the cylinder that forms the combustion chamber and
      attached to the second flat ring through an expansion joint, and
      configuration of which is defined by the physical state of the
      fuel to be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Finally, the apparatus of the present invention comprises
      at least one fan or set of fans arranged below the pressurized air
      chamber In order to provide air to the pressurized air chamber
      itself. A preferred embodiment of the fan or set of fans also
      provides the existence of a sliding sheet placed for closing or
      opening the space of air intake to the fan or set of fans in order
      to regulate the air intake.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0017] Additional description of the cylinder that forms the
        combustion chamber:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0018] In a preferred embodiment, the two sections of the cylinder
      that forms the combustion chamber are formed by the interposition
      of a third flat splitter ring. It will also be allowable
      embodiments in which the two sections of the cylinder are formed
      from, for example, a cave or narrowing in the walls of the
      cylinder itself, adopting for example a form similar to that of an
      "hourglass."<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In a preferred embodiment, on the walls of the upper
      section of the cylinder that forms the combustion chamber,
      pressure relief holes are provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In the preferred embodiment, in addition, the cylinder that
      forms the combustion chamber is complemented with a thermal
      insulation system consisting of a series of concentric cylinders,
      separated by spaces through which air circulates.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the pressurized air chamber:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0021] The pressurized air chamber comprises a second cylinder
      arranged concentrically and below the lower section of the
      combustion chamber and diameter of which will preferably be the
      same or higher than that of the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] In the preferred embodiment, the diameter of the second
      cylinder that forms the pressurized air chamber is higher than
      that of the cylinder that forms the combustion chamber, so as to
      coincide with a fourth concentric cylinder that is part of the
      thermal insulation system, as explained later herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The pressurized air chamber provides pressurized air to the
      plurality of air injectors supported on the first flat ring and to
      the central air injector, included within the set of replaceable
      parts.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The upper part of the pressurized air chamber makes up the
      first flat ring, on which the air injectors are supported.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The first flat ring comprises, in turn, a vertical skirt
      support, the top of which is preferably finished in a crown shape.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0026] Description of the air injectors:</b><b><br>
      </b>Each air injector has<br>
      a side aperture and<br>
      an upper aperture.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The side aperture allows injecting air flows in a
      substantially horizontal direction, i.e., air used for combustion.
      The upper aperture allows injecting air flows in a substantially
      vertical direction, i.e. air having dual functionality, combustion
      and cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Furthermore, the central air injector, included within the
      set of replaceable parts, has only one upper aperture that allows
      injecting air flow in a substantially vertical direction. This air
      flow in a substantially vertical direction feeds the center of the
      combustion chamber, i.e. injects the air directly used for
      combustion.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] In this way it is ensured that the combined action of
      different air flows into the combustion chamber produces a
      rotational air flow.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The inclusion of the central air injector makes the central
      air flow to have the strength required for feeding the center of
      the flame, since it is not just one hole through which air enters
      as may go in, but an injection of pressurized air.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In a preferred embodiment, each air injector has in its
      side aperture, a nozzle for the exit of air. The nozzles serve to
      improve the routing of air flows into the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the structure of the set of replaceable parts:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] The configuration of the set of replaceable parts depend on
      the physical state of the fuel to be used, whether solid, liquid
      or gas, but in any case includes a central air injector arranged
      in the geometric center of the unit and set between two flat and
      parallel discs that are part of said set.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] Thus, in all cases, in addition to comprise the central air
      injector, the set of replaceable parts comprise a flat disc
      attached to the second flat ring through an expansion joint, and a
      second flat disc supported on the first flat ring; such that the
      central air Injector is set between both discs, in its geometric
      center.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] Furthermore, in the geometric center of the second flat
      disc, around and concentric with the central air injector, a
      plurality of apertures through which pressurized air enters from
      the pressurized air chamber is provided, such that the air that
      enters through said apertures contributes, when impact against the
      first flat disk, to its cooling. Moreover, and due to the
      finishing in a crown shape of the top of the vertical skirt
      support, the incoming air follows a substantially horizontal path
      until exiting the outside through the recesses of the crown shape
      of the vertical skirt support. Thus, the function of this air flow
      in a substantially horizontal direction will be the one for
      cooling.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] For gas or liquid fuels, the set of replaceable parts
      further comprises:<br>
      a plurality of fuel injectors supported on the second flat disc
      and set in the first flat disc, distributed preferably following
      the circular path of the discs,<br>
      a fuel distributor, arranged bellow the fuel injectors and upper
      part of which forms the second flat disc, and<br>
      a fuel supply tube that feeds the fuel distributor.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The fuel injectors preferably have a side aperture so that
      the injection of gas or liquid fuel is performed following a
      substantially horizontal direction so as to contribute to the
      rotational direction of air flows.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In addition, the fuel injectors are preferably fed through
      their bottom because the fuel distributor is arranged below the
      same.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] When the fuel to be used is liquid, placing of a collector
      plate for retaining the liquid is further forecasted, and the
      configuration of the fuel distributor is modified, such that the
      fuel supply performs a substantially horizontal path and parallel
      to the first flat disc before the fuel reaches the fuel injector.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The use of the collector plate for retaining the liquid is
      not indispensable, but it is suitable for the case of using fuel
      in a liquid state.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In a preferred embodiment, the device for generating and
      transmitting heat, regardless the physical state of the fuel to be
      supplied carries a thermal insulation system. Said system consists
      of a series of cylinders concentric with the cylinder that forms
      the combustion chamber, and it will be explained in detail in the
      "embodiment of the invention" section.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Materials: The materials for the various component elements
      of the combustion chamber are preferably metals and among these
      the use of stainless steel is preferred. Also in the preferred
      embodiment the interior walls of the combustion chamber are
      preferably reflective and with a shiny silver color, so as to
      optimize the radiation return of the heat from the cylinder walls
      to inside. The more reflective it is, the greater will be the
      return and the lower will be the heat loss.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] It should be mentioned that, although the heat sink is not
      an integral part of the apparatus of the present invention, it is
      preferable that it be placed above the combustion chamber leaving
      an air space in the middle.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The air in the upper part of the combustion chamber will be
      used as heat insulation, when the air is in a horizontal
      direction, or as a heat transmitter, when the air is in the
      vertical direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] It is also noteworthy that the embodiments described for
      liquid or gas fuel could also be used for solid fuels, for example
      in cases of solid fuels with difficult ignition. Thus, the
      combustion with a gas or liquid fuel could be started, and then
      pass it to the solid fuel. In these cases, the fuel injectors (gas
      or liquid) will include, in addition, a cover. Or alternatively,
      the injectors of fuels in liquid or gas state are lowered until

      <b>Description of the combustion flame:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0045] Finally, within the device for generating and transmitting
      heat described by the present invention a combustion flame with
      geometrical shape and technical characteristics advantageous in
      terms of fuel efficiency and emission of pollutants is generated.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Thus, it is also an object of the present invention said
      combustion flame formed by a plurality of combustion discs formed,
      in turn, by combustion gases, with the combustion discs being
      separated from each other by means of air discs formed by the air
      flows supplied for oxidizing the fuel when the air supply is made
      such that the combined action of air flows produces a rotational
      air flow as the one described in the combustion chamber of the
      apparatus of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Said rotational air flow provides the flame the form of a
      pulsating vortex, and can have central air areas and sections of
      continuity between the combustion gas discs. Additionally,
      combustion discs acquire some upward vertical speed within the
      combustion chamber, and since as an increased speed of the
      combustion discs a less heat transfer to the medium is produced,
      thus depending on the upward vertical speed of the combustion
      discs and the thickness thereof, the heat transfer (or loss) to
      medium will be more or less. It will be less, as thinner the
      combustion discs are, and as higher upward vertical speed is
      imparted thereto.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Additionally, at the upper end of the combustion flame one
      or more terminations in a more or less elongated shape can be
      formed.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] Thus, this new geometrical shape of the combustion flame
      achieves considerably increasing the combustion flame surface,
      i.e. the oxidation surface, or area wherein the air oxygen comes
      in contact with the combustion flame. Furthermore, with this shape
      of combustion flame the air supplied for oxidizing the fuel is at
      very short distances from any area inside the combustion flame and
      therefore the fuel efficiency is maximized.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] It has also been demonstrated that the thinner the
      combustion discs that make up the combustion flame are, the
      greater is the oxidation surface of the combustion flame.<br>

      <b>EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0053] In order to obtain a better understanding of the object and
      functionality of this patent, and without being construed as
      restrictive solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Figure 2 shows a general scheme of a device for generating
      and transmitting heat capable of operating with fuel in any
      physical state that includes:<br>
      <br>
      one cylindrical combustion chamber (9) divided into two sections,
      one lower section (11) and one upper section (12), the height of
      the lower section being preferably lower than that of the upper
      section;<br>
      one pressurized air chamber (26) preferably constituted by a
      second cylinder (42), diameter of which is preferably equal to
      that of the cylinder that forms the combustion chamber (9) and
      arranged below the lower section (11) of the combustion chamber,<br>
      <br>
      a plurality of air injectors (14) that have a side aperture (14a)
      and an upper aperture (14b) and which are supported on a first
      flat ring (43) that forms the upper part of the pressurized air
      chamber (26) and set in a second flat ring (52), arranged in
      contact with the lower end of the first cylinder (9) that forms
      the combustion chamber,<br>
      <br>
      a set of replaceable parts (A) arranged on the free center of both
      rings (43 and 52), and<br>
      <br>
      at least one fan, not shown in Figure 2, since the bottom area of
      the pressurized air chamber (26) has been removed in order to
      allow greater detail for the rest of the apparatus.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1, as mentioned above, shows a complete scheme of the
      apparatus of the present invention, wherein the set of replaceable
      parts (A), for the case of using gas fuel or liquid fuel has been
      represented, but without the retaining plate. Thus, it shows an
      apparatus comprising:<br>
      <br>
      one cylindrical combustion chamber (9) divided into two sections,
      one lower (11) and one upper (12) section,<br>
      <br>
      one pressurized air chamber (26) constituted by a second cylinder
      (42), diameter of which is greater than the cylinder that forms
      the combustion chamber (9) and arranged below the lower section
      (11) of the combustion chamber,<br>
      <br>
      a plurality of air injectors (14) that have a side aperture (14a)
      and an upper aperture (14b), and which are supported on a first
      flat ring (43) that forms the upper part of the pressurized air
      chamber (26) and set in a second flat ring (52), arranged in
      contact with the lower end of the first cylinder (9) that forms
      the combustion chamber,<br>
      <br>
      a set of pieces, which happens to be the set of replaceable parts
      (A) of Figure 2 for the case of fuel in a gas or liquid state
      without retaining plate. Said set of pieces is arranged in the
      free center of both rings (43 and 52), at the lower end of the
      lower section (11) and consists of:<br>
      <br>
      a first flat disc (13),<br>
      <br>
      a second flat disc (44),<br>
      <br>
      a central air injector (16),<br>
      <br>
      a plurality of fuel injectors (19),<br>
      <br>
      a fuel distributor (30),<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      a fuel supply tube (29) of the fuel distributor (30), and<br>
      <br>
      a plurality of apertures (16'), around the central air injector
      (16)such that the first flat disc (13) is attached to the second
      flat ring (52) by an expansion joint (54): the second flat disc
      (44) forms the upper part of the fuel distributor (30) and is
      supported on the first flat ring (43) and parallel to the first
      flat disc (13); the fuel injectors (19) are arranged on the second
      flat disc (44) and passed through their corresponding holes in the
      first flat disc (13); the fuel distributor (30) is arranged below
      the fuel injectors (19); the central air injector is set between
      both flat discs (13 and 44), in the geometric center thereof; the
      plurality of apertures (16') is arranged in a circular
      distribution on the second flat disc (44) and around the central
      air injector (16). The fuel supply tube (29) although it is
      preferably located on a side of the fuel distributor (30) may
      admit any location that allows the entry of fuel in the fuel
      distributor (30). In addition, the holes in the first flat disc
      (13) through which the fuel injectors (19) pass have a diameter
      slightly larger than the diameter of the fuel Injectors (19) so as
      to allow the expansion of the flat disk (13) caused by high
      temperatures generated inside the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Furthermore, in Figure 1 at least one fan (63) located
      below the lower area of the pressurized air chamber (26) is
      represented.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Figure 1 also represents some arrows indicating the
      direction of the air flows. Thus, the pressurized air chamber (26)
      provides pressurized air (18) to the plurality of air injectors
      (14) and to the central air injector (16). Each air injector (14)
      has a side aperture (14a) and an upper aperture (14b), so that the
      side aperture (14a) allows injecting air flows in a substantially
      horizontal direction (2) into the lower section (11) of the
      combustion chamber. The upper aperture (14b) allows, in turn,
      injecting air flows in a substantially vertical direction (15)
      into the lower section (11) of the combustion chamber. And, the
      central air injector (16) injects an air flow in a substantially
      vertical direction (17) into the lower section (11) of the
      combustion chamber. In this way it ensures that the combined
      action of all air flows (2, 15 and 17) produces an upward
      rotational air flow In the lower section (11) of the cylinder (9)
      that forms the combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Being the scheme in Figure 1 a preferred embodiment, it
      also considers the presence of pressure relief holes (21) in the
      walls of the upper section (12) of the cylinder (9) that forms the
      combustion chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] Also, by being a preferred embodiment, the third flat ring
      (10), splitting the two sections (11 and 12) of the cylinder (9)
      that forms the combustion chamber, is represented.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In addition, and for being a preferred embodiment, the
      thermal insulation system is represented, which consists of:<br>
      a third cylinder (22), concentric with the first cylinder (9)
      making up the combustion chamber, said third cylinder being
      separate from the first cylinder by<br>
      a space (23), said space (23) ending at the upper end part of the
      upper section (12) of the cylinder (9) making up combustion
      chamber, in<br>
      an outlet (33) through which the flowing air (32) will exit
      through said space (23),<br>
      pressure relief holes (25) preferably provided in the walls of the
      third cylinder (22), aligned with the pressure relief holes (21)
      of the cylinder (9) making up the combustion chamber,<br>
      a fourth flat ring (37) preferably placed on the upper edge of the
      third cylinder (22),<br>
      a fourth cylinder (28), concentric with the previous cylinders (9
      and 22), which is separately arranged from the third cylinder (22)
      by<br>
      a space (34), said the space (34) ends, at the upper end part of
      the third cylinder (22), in<br>
      an outlet (36) through which the flowing air (35) will exit by
      through the space (34),<br>
      pressure relief holes (27), preferably provided in the walls of
      the fourth cylinder (28), aligned with the pressure relief holes
      (21 and 25) of the other cylinders (9, 22),<br>
      a fifth flat ring (38), which is placed in the upper edge of the
      fourth cylinder (28),<br>
      a ring (39) provided on the outer edge of the fourth cylinder (28)
      which, together with the outer edge of the fourth flat ring (37)
      of the upper edge of the third cylinder (22) defines the outlet
      (36) of the space (34).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] It is also noted in Figure 1 that the apparatus of the
      Invention preferably has a sixth flat ring (45) arranged on the
      upper end of the second cylinder (42) that forms the pressurized
      air chamber (26), On said sixth flat ring (45) the fourth cylinder
      (28) is supported. Thus, with this preferred configuration, the
      invention provides an additional advantage in order to achieve a
      reduction of heat losses to the medium, since the fourth cylinder
      (28) is shifted downward with respect to the area wherein the
      combustion occurs, and therefore receives less heat, It is a
      better insulation and less heat losses to the medium are produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Figures 3a, 3b and 3c respectively show a perspective view
      of the set of replaceable parts (A) for the case of solid fuel,
      gas or liquid fuel without the retaining plate (53) and liquid
      fuel with retaining plate (53). Thus, in Figure 3a the first flat
      disc (13), the central air injector (16), the expansion joint (54)
      and the second flat disk (44) are represented. Figure 3b
      additionally represents the fuel injectors (19), the fuel
      distributor (30) and the fuel supply tube (29). And in Figure 3c,
      the plate for retaining liquids (53) is represented, and it is
      seen how the configuration of the fuel distributor (30) is
      modified, so as to allow an additional path for the liquid, being
      said path (20') in a horizontal direction and parallel to the flat
      disk (13). Said path (20') is not represented in this Figure 3c,
      but it will be represented in Figure 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The fuel injectors (19) have a side aperture so that the
      injection of fuel in a gas or liquid state is carried along a
      substantially horizontal direction (5). In this way, the fuel
      injection contributes to the upward rotational direction produced
      by the air flows (2, 15, 17) mentioned above. The fuel injectors
      (19) are preferably fed by their bottom (20).<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Moreover, in these cases, in which there is a fuel
      distributor (30), Figures 3b and 3c, the flat disk (44) coincides
      with the upper part of the fuel distributor (30).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In Figure 4 the pressurized air chamber (26) is
      represented, and it is observed that it consists of:<br>
      a cylinder (42) that may have the same or greater diameter than
      the cylinder (9) that forms the combustion chamber,<br>
      an upper part that forms a flat ring (43), and<br>
      a vertical skirt support (51) upper finishing of which has a crown
      shape. Namely, in Figure 4, although the relationship with the
      cylinder that forms the combustion chamber (9) is not shown in the
      figure, it can be mentioned that it corresponds to that preferred
      embodiment having the thermal insulation system, and therefore the
      cylinder (42) that forms the pressurized air chamber (26) has a
      larger diameter than the cylinder that forms the combustion
      chamber (9). Thus, the first flat ring (43) that forms the upper
      part has, in its central part, holes (59) for allowing the air to
      flow towards the air injectors (14) and holes (60), of different
      sizes and sandwiched between the above, which allow fixing the
      second flat ring (52) and also, because the scheme includes the
      thermal insulation system, includes holes (61) for supplying air
      to the separation space (23) between the cylinder (9) making up
      the combustion chamber and the third concentric cylinder (22)
      within the thermal insulation system and holes (62) for supplying
      air to the separation space (34) between the cylinders (22 and 28)
      of the thermal insulation system. Being the holes (61 and 62)
      arranged in a circular distribution, following the curvature of
      the first flat ring (43) and in a radial outward direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Figure 8 additionally shows arrows corresponding to the air
      flows, thus, the air (18) coming from the pressurized air chamber
      (26) enters into the air injectors (14), and through its side
      aperture (14a) the air flowing in a substantially horizontal
      direction (2) exits, and through its upper aperture (14b) the air
      flowing in a substantially vertical direction (15) exits. Into the
      central air Injector (16) the air (18) coming from the pressurized
      air chamber (26) enters, and the air exits in a substantially
      vertical direction (17). Into the plurality of apertures (16')
      provided around the central air injector (16) the air (18) from
      the pressurized air chamber (26) enters, said air (31) vertically
      flows first until impacting against the first flat disc (13), and
      from there continues in a substantially horizontal path (31) and
      parallel to the flat disc (13), until exiting through the recesses
      of the crown shape in the vertical skirt support (51). The lower
      end of the defined space (23) corresponds to a separation between
      the vertical skirt support (51) that forms the pressurized air
      chamber (26) and the third cylinder (22) of thermal insulation
      system, and it is also fed by the air (18) coming from the
      pressurized air chamber (26) forming the air flow (24), this air
      flow (24) meets, in its upward vertically path, the air (31) that
      flows in a substantially horizontal direction described above, and
      together make up the air flow (32) that flows through the space
      (23) and which is directed towards the upper end of the cylinder
      (9 and 22), toward the outlet (33). Preferably, in the third
      cylinder (22) pressure relief holes (25), aligned with the
      pressure relief holes (21) of the cylinder (9) that forms the
      combustion chamber are provided.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Also in Figure 8 the fourth flat ring (37) on the upper
      edge of the cylinder (22) is represented.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Also, Figure 8 shows the separation space (34) between the
      cylinders (22 and 28) of the thermal insulation system, which is
      also fed by the air (18) coming from the pressurized air chamber
      (26), such that through said space (34) an air flow (35) directed
      towards the upper end of the cylinders (22 and 28) to an outlet
      (36) flows. Preferably, in the fourth cylinder (28) pressure
      relief holes (27) aligned with the pressure relief holes (21 and
      25) of the other cylinders (9 and 22) are also provided).<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Also, Figure 8 shows the fifth flat ring (38), which is
      placed in the upper edge of the fourth cylinder (28) and which
      has, at its outer edge, a ring (39) that, together with the outer
      edge of the fourth flat ring (37) of the upper edge of the third
      cylinder (22) defines the outlet (36).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Preferably, the apparatus of the invention has a sixth flat
      ring (45) arranged on the upper end of the cylinder (42) that
      forms the pressurized air chamber (26). In addition, on the sixth
      flat ring (45) the fourth cylinder (28) is supported, said flat
      ring (45) being supported on the fourth cylinder (28) by
      conventional fastening means. This configuration provides an
      additional advantage for reducing heat losses to the medium, since
      the fourth cylinder (28) is moved downward with respect to the
      lower section (11) of the cylinder (9) that forms the combustion
      chamber, i.e. the area wherein combustion occurs, and therefore
      receives less heat, whereby lower heat losses to the medium are
      obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] In Figure 11, wherein the preferred embodiment is also
      represented, each air injector (14) is shown with a nozzle (47)
      for directing the air exiting, at its side aperture (14a).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Preferably, and as shown in Figures 11, 14, 17, 18 and 19,
      the fastening means consists of fasteners (48) aided by pins (49),
      arranged in a substantially circular manner on the sixth flat ring
      (45). In addition, the preferred embodiment includes the use of,
      as an extra safety means, a bolt (50) for securing the connection
      clip (48) and pin (49). It should be noted that the fasteners (48)
      and pins (49) described above can be replaced by any conventional
      fastening means without altering the essence of the invention. In
      Figures 11, 14 and 20, there is also shown that the central air
      injector (16) is centered and, following a radial path from the
      center and outward, wherein the fuel injectors (19) are first
      placed, distributed in a substantially circular arrangement.
      Continuing with this radial direction, also in a substantially
      circular arrangement, are the air injectors (14), which are each
      represented including a nozzle (47) for the exit of air.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11 clearly show the expansion joint or
      slot (54).<br>
      <br>
      [0073] The expansion slot or joint (54), plus the fact that the
      air injectors (14) are supported on the first flat ring (43), make
      possible that both the second flat ring (52) and the first one
      (43) may undergo expansions due to high temperatures generated
      inside the combustion chamber, without bending. This will prevent
      these from breaking.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Figures 12, 14, 15 and 16 show specific embodiments for the
      case wherein the apparatus only accepts gas or liquid fuel without
      retaining plate. Thus, the figures show that there is no expansion
      joint (54). In addition, the second flat ring (52) and the first
      flat disc (13) of the embodiments admitting fuel in any physical
      state are replaced by a single flat disc (13').<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Figures 13, 17, 18 and 19 show specific embodiments for the
      case in which the apparatus only accepts solid fuel and here,
      these figures, show that there is no expansion joint (54). In
      addition, the second flat ring (52) and the first flat disc (13)
      of the embodiments that admitted fuel in any physical state is
      replaced by a single flat disc (13'), while the first flat ring
      (43) and second flat disc (44) are replaced by a single flat disc
      (43').<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Also in the above figures, the fourth flat ring (37) of the
      upper edge of the third cylinder (22) and ring (39) that has, at
      its outer edge, the fifth flat ring (38) that is placed on the
      upper edge of the fourth cylinder (28) are seen.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Figure 15 illustrates the movement of air flows (2) from
      the air injectors (14). This scheme, although it is drawn for the
      specific embodiment in which the device for generating and
      transmitting heat only accepts gas or liquid fuels without
      retaining plate, the representation of the air flows is applicable
      to any of the possible embodiments included in the present
      specification. Thus the various air injectors (14-1, 14-2, 14-3,
      14-4, 14-5, 14-6, 14-7, 14-8, 14-9 and 14-10) discharge the
      respective air flows in a substantially horizontal direction (2-1,
      2-2, 2-3, 2-4, 2-5, 2-6, 2-7, 2-8, 2-9 and 2-10), such that, for
      example, the air flow 2-1 from the air injector 14-1 is oriented
      toward an intermediate position between the air Injectors 14-5 and
      14-6. Similarly, the air flow 2-2 from the air injector 14-2 is
      oriented toward an intermediate position between the injectors
      14-6 and 14-7, and so on with each air flow of each injector. This
      orientation of the air flows is what causes the rotational air
      flow. Likewise, as it is a specific embodiment that includes only
      the possibility of using gas or liquid fuels, without retaining
      plate (53), the injection of gas or liquid fuel (5-1, 5-2 and 5 -
      3) has been drawn in a substantially horizontal direction and
      contributing to the rotational direction of air flows. Only the
      reference numbers of the fuel injection (5-1, 5-2 and 5-3) for
      three of the fuel injectors has been indicated, so that the figure
      does not lose clarity, but understanding that from each fuel
      injector the fuel injection is discharged in a substantially
      horizontal direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] Figure 22 shows the scheme of the air intake assembly to
      the pressurized air chamber (26). Said figure only shows one fan
      (63), however, as already mentioned, the invention allows a
      greater number of fans.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Figure 23 shows a sliding sheet (55) that is used for
      closing and/or opening the air Intake to the fan, so that a
      preferred way of regulating this intake is achieved.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Figure 21 shows a top view of the distribution of air flows
      at the top of the apparatus, i.e. at the outlet of the combustion
      chamber. The figure represents a preferred embodiment, i.e. that
      carrying the thermal insulation system consisting of two cylinders
      (22 and 28) concentric with the cylinder (9) that forms the
      combustion chamber, and said structure is applicable to fuels in
      any physical state. Thus, in this figure is seen how from the
      central air area (6) of the last combustion disc (3) of the
      combustion flame towards the outside five areas that will be at
      different temperatures can be seen. The different areas, from
      inside and outward, i.e. sorted by decreasing gradient of
      temperature are:<br>
      the central air area (6),<br>
      the area of the last combustion disc (3),<br>
      the flow area of the air in a substantially vertical direction
      (15), emerging from air injectors (14),<br>
      the air flow area (32) flowing through the separation space (23)
      between the cylinder that forms the combustion chamber (9) and the
      third cylinder (22), and<br>
      the air flow area (35) flowing through the separation space (34)
      between the third cylinder (22) and the fourth cylinder (28).<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The device for generating and transmitting heat described
      by the present invention, in any of its embodiments, forecasts the
      provision of a heat sink (41), thereon, at the outlet of the
      combustion chamber and separated by a space (40). In addition, it
      has been demonstrated that the bottom of the heat sink (41) should
      preferably be flat.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] A preferred embodiment, regardless of the physical state of
      the fuel to be used, includes the positioning of a knob (56) as
      that illustrated in Figure 17 between the various concentric
      cylinders, in order to ensure the concentricity of the cylinders
      (9, 22 and 28). Alternatively, the knob (56) can be replaced by a
      bent (57) of the cylinder walls (9, 22 and 28). Also in said
      preferred embodiment a support (58) for the heat sink (41) is
      placed.<br>
