          Explained</a><br>
        <br>
      </span>Potter Drilling’s technology drills boreholes using a
      process called spallation. The process starts by applying a
      high-intensity fluid stream to a rock surface to expand the
      crystalline grains within the rock. When the grains expand,
      micro-fractures occur in the rock and small particles called
      spalls are ejected. The process is accelerated by several factors
      including inherent stress in the rock formation.<br>
      <br>
      Potter Drilling is not the first company to develop spallation
      drilling technology. Air spallation drilling was used commercially
      from 1947 through 1961 for ore mining and was adapted to
      geothermal drilling by the Department of Energy in the 1970s. Air
      spallation demonstrated impressive drilling performance, producing
      8 inch to 12 inch boreholes to depths of 1,100 feet at rates
      faster than 50 feet per hour in solid granite.<br>
      <br>
      Potter Drilling’s technology differs from prior air based
      techniques in that it uses hot fluid rather than air to spall
      rock. Because spallation occurs in a water filled borehole, Potter
      Drilling’s technology can be used to drill to depths required for
      universal EGS (12,000 to 30,000 feet).<br>
      <br>
      Fluid-based hydrothermal spallation has the following advantages:<br>
      <br>
      Greater wellbore stability: Fluid-filled boreholes are more stable
      and require fewer casing intervals.<br>
      Increased buoyancy for spalls: Fluid can be used to carry spalls
      to the surface from extreme depths.<br>
      More heat flux and faster rates of penetration: Fluid heat
      transfer surpasses the impressive performance demonstrated in
      air-based spallation technologies.<br>
      Drilling rates up to 5X conventional rates<br>
      Non-contact technology virtually eliminates wear on the drill head<br>
      Fewer casing intervals are required, so smaller, less expensive
      casing is used to achieve equivalent bottom hole diameters<br>
      Potential to use neutrally buoyant, composite drill strings<br>
      Ideally suited for directional and extended-reach drilling<br>
      <br>
      Hydrothermal spallation was invented and patented by cofounder Bob
      Potter and Jefferson Tester of MIT. The patent is owned by MIT and
      licensed exclusively to Potter Drilling.<br>

            Geothermal Wells</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      A scientist named Jared Potter has created a couple of prototypes
      for deep drilling for geothermal energy. Right now, companies are
      using diamond drill bits for grinding through granite and other
      compact rocks in order to tap into geothermal energy far below the
      Earth’s surface.<br>
      <br>
      The first prototype is called a Flame Jet Drill and it works by
      using hydrogen heated to 3200 degrees F and drills through granite
      three times as fast as a traditional drill, with no breakage of
      drill bits. The superheated hydrogen does not melt the rock into
      magma as one would imagine but rather causes the granite to
      fragment and the outcome is a perfectly round hole.<br>
      <br>
      The second prototype that Potter is working on is for deep water
      drilling for geothermal energy. The Hydrothermal drill superheats
      hydrogen to 7200 degrees F, which in turns heats a jet of water
      that serves to drill through granite and other hard rock.<br>
      <br>
      Deep drilling for geothermal energy has long been a dream with
      many scientists with limited success. With Jared Potter’s
      prototypes soon to be commercialized the dream may turn into
      reality more quickly that previously imagined.<br>

      <br>
      [0002] In various embodiments, this disclosure relates to methods
      and apparatus for conducting processes capable of spalling or
      penetrating a material such as rock. For example, the disclosed
      methods may be used for preparing boreholes for geothermal energy
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Drilling very deep boreholes or enhancing existing wells in
      hard rock far below the earth's surface, e.g. 10,000 feet deep or
      more, is inherently incompatible with traditional mechanical or
      contact drilling or rock removal technologies. Low rates of
      penetration, extreme bit and drill string wear, and excessive time
      spent "tripping" to replace damaged or worn bits and drill string
      make conventional rotary and coiled tubing drilling economically
      non-viable for many deep, hard rock applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Several non-contact techniques have been developed for hard
      rock drilling but may be effective only in shallow and/or air
      filled boreholes. Most notably, air or flame jet spallation
      drilling uses a hot gas or flame directed against a rock surface
      to cause spalling and removal of the rock. This technique,
      however, is only feasible in shallow, air-filled boreholes. To
      drill deeper, a borehole must be filled with water or "mud" to
      provide mechanical stability. In this environment, flames are not
      viable in part because of the difficulty in generating or
      maintaining the required flame under the high pressure water
      column. For example, the high pressures at the bottom of deep,
      fluid-filled boreholes make behavior of the flames extremely
      unstable and difficult to maintain. Further, initiating combustion
      under these conditions is extremely challenging and typically
      requires an energy source to be provided at the bottom of the
      borehole. However, using an energy source such as a spark or glow
      plug would require, e.g., a power cable to be run from the
      surface, which is not feasible in deep applications. Other energy
      sources such as flame holders are inherently unstable, especially
      at such depths.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Further, most combustion reactions produce very high
      temperature flames, typically 1800-3000&lt;0&gt;C or more. Such
      temperatures can destroy drilling components and require careful
      addition of cooling water to maintain a temperature that can be
      withstood by downhole tools. In addition, such high temperatures
      can melt rock (e.g., into an amorphous glass) so that the rock is
      then unspallable. Even a momentary interruption in cooling water
      can transform rock so that it can no longer be spalled and/or
      destroy downhole components, even if a cooler temperature is
      recovered. Small changes in the stand-off distance, or distance
      from the combustion to the rock surface, can result in dramatic
      changes in the nature of the high temperature flame impingement,
      which may result in a temperature too low for spallation, or
      temperatures high enough to soften or melt the rock. Such tight
      tolerances for stand-off distances are difficult to control at the
      bottom of a deep borehole.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Further, flame-based combustion systems require multiple
      conduits for fuel, oxidant and cooling or circulating water. Other
      approaches to spallation drilling such as the use of electrical
      heating require sufficient power down hole. In deep drilling
      operations, multiple conduits or supply of sufficient power
      through cables from the surface or through transformation of
      energy by hydraulic flow may not be feasible, or may be simply
      impossible.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Combustion systems that require the use of gaseous
      oxidants, such as air or oxygen, are also unsuitable for deep
      fluid filled borehole conditions, in part because the pressures
      required to pump these gases against a hydrostatic column of a
      fluid filled borehole are sometimes impossible to achieve, and
      even if possible, have associated safety risks.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] While thermal spallation has promised to provide a solution
      to deep, hard-rock drilling, no methods have been able to
      adequately or feasibly provide the heat required for viable
      spallation drilling deep into a water filled borehole. If the
      challenge of drilling deep boreholes in hard rock is not solved,
      EGS may not become the much needed clean alternative to meeting
      our current and future global energy needs. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0009] The present disclosure relates, at least in part, to a
      method of reducing near wellbore impedance, or reducing the
      restriction to fluid flow in the immediate vicinity (e.g. 1 inch
      to about 3 feet) of an existing borehole wall) by providing a
      spallation system to e.g. increase the diameter of a section of an
      existing borehole or well, for example a geothermal well.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] For example, one aspect of the invention includes a method
      for spalling a geological rock formation. The method includes
      providing a housing comprising a reaction chamber and a catalyst
      element held within the reaction chamber, providing at least one
      jet nozzle, contacting one or more unreacted fluids or solids with
      the catalyst element, wherein the catalyst element facilitates the
      reaction of the unreacted fluid, thus generating a reacted fluid,
      and emitting the reacted fluid through the at least one nozzle.
      The at least one nozzle may be directed to an excavation site
      within or on the geological rock formation, thereby creating
      spalls and/or a reacted rock region.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In one embodiment, the unreacted fluid or solid is at a
      temperature of about 350 &lt;0&gt;C or less. In one embodiment,
      the reacted fluid is about 500 &lt;0&gt;C to about 1100 &lt;0&gt;C
      when formed. The contacting may occur at a pressure of about 1 to
      about 200 MPa. The unreacted fluid may be substantially a liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] One embodiment further includes introducing a flow of water
      or drilling mud into the excavation site. One embodiment further
      includes heating the unreacted fluid or solid. The reacted fluid
      may interact with a heat exchanger disposed in a position capable
      of heating the unreacted fluid or solid.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In one embodiment, the method is capable of producing an
      about 1 inch diameter borehole in said geological formation at
      about 0.5 inches per minute of reacted fluid flow. In one
      embodiment, the method is capable of producing an about 8 inch
      diameter borehole in said geological formation at a rate of
      penetration of about 20 feet per hour or more. The flow of water
      or drilling mud may at least partially form an ascending fluid
      stream. The ascending fluid stream may at least partially remove
      the spall.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] In one embodiment, the catalyst element may include a
      transition metal, such as a transition metal chosen from:
      platinum, lead, silver, palladium, nickel, cobalt, copper,
      chromium, manganese, <br>
      iridium, gold, ruthenium and rhodium, or mixtures or oxides or
      salts thereof. The transition metal may be disposed on a support.
      The catalyst element may be disposed on spheres, grains, pellets,
      or other appropriately configured elements comprising alumina. The
      catalyst element may have at least about 10 m&lt;2&gt;/g surface
      area of catalyst. The catalyst element may be heated.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] In one embodiment, the unreacted fluid includes an aqueous
      solution. The unreacted fluid may be a miscible fluid mixture or a
      non-miscible fluid mixture. The unreacted fluid or solid may
      include an oxidant. The unreacted solid may include an
      encapsulated oxidant.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] In one embodiment, the unreacted fluid or solid includes a
      fuel. The fuel may be a carbonaceous fuel. The fuel may include
      hydrocarbons. The fuel may be a liquid fuel at room temperature.
      The fuel may be a hydrocarbon gas, such as methane, ethane,
      propane, butane (e.g. natural gas (NG) and/or liquefied natural
      gas (LNG)) at room temperature. In one embodiment, the fuel is
      gasoline, diesel, kerosene, biodiesel, or alcohol. In one
      embodiment, the fuel includes an alcohol, an alkyl, alkenyl,
      alkynyl, an alkoxyalkyl, or combinations thereof. In one
      embodiment, the fuel is an alcohol fuel. In one embodiment, the
      unreacted fluid may include an alcohol fuel chosen from methanol,
      ethanol, propanol, or butanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In one embodiment, the oxidant may be chosen from oxygen,
      peroxide, permanganate and combinations thereof. In one
      embodiment, the oxidant may be hydrogen peroxide or metal
      peroxide. In one embodiment, the unreacted fluid may include
      hydrogen peroxide or metal peroxide. The unreacted fluid may
      include an aqueous solution comprising about 2% to about 35% by
      weight hydrogen peroxide. The unreacted fluid may include about
      10% to about 20% by weight methanol or ethanol. The unreacted
      fluid may include an aqueous solution including about 10% to about
      20% by weight hydrogen peroxide and about 10% to about 20% by
      weight methanol or ethanol. In one embodiment, the unreacted fluid
      may have a density similar to water.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The method may further include transporting the unreacted
      fluid to the housing through at least one conduit. The fuel and
      oxidant may be transported to the housing through separate
      conduits, or through the same conduit.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Another aspect of the invention includes a method for
      flamelessly penetrating or reacting rock. The methods includes
      contacting a composition comprising an oxidant with a catalyst to
      flamelessly form a reacted fluid, and directing said reacted fluid
      to said rock, thereby effecting penetration of the rock and/or
      forming a reacted rock region.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] In one embodiment, the contacting step occurs in the
      presence of a fuel. In one embodiment, the composition includes an
      alcohol fuel, such as ethanol or methanol. The oxidant may include
      oxygen or hydrogen peroxide.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In one embodiment, the method further includes drilling the
      reacted rock region with a drill bit. The contacting may occur at
      about 5,000 ft to about 40,000 ft below a surface of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Another aspect of the invention includes a method for
      producing a reacted fluid flow capable of spallation of rock. The
      method includes contacting an unreacted fluid with a catalyst
      element in the presence of an oxidant thereby generating a reacted
      fluid, and emitting the reacted fluid through a nozzle, thereby
      producing the reacted fluid flow capable of spalling rock.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] In one embodiment, the reacted fluid is at a temperature of
      about 500 &lt;0&gt;C to about 900 &lt;0&gt;C. In one embodiment,
      the reacted fluid produces a heat flux of about 0.1 to about 10
      MW/m&lt;2&gt; when said reacted fluid is in contact with the rock.
      The unreacted fluid may be substantially a liquid. The reacted
      fluid may be substantially a gas or a supercritical fluid. The
      unreacted fluid may include a fuel. The unreacted fluid may
      further include an aqueous solution. The unreacted fluid may be a
      miscible fluid mixture. The unreacted fluid may include an
      alcohol, such as an alcohol chosen from methanol, ethanol,
      propanol or butanol. In one embodiment, the oxidant may be oxygen.
      In one embodiment, the oxidant may be a peroxide. In one
      embodiment, the oxidant is hydrogen peroxide. In one embodiment,
      the unreacted fluid comprises the oxidant. In one embodiment, the

      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="fig21.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      [0059] The present disclosure relates, at least in part, to
      methods and systems for use in spallation, fracturing, loosening,
      or excavation of material such as rock, for example, methods of
      making or excavating boreholes, and/or enlarging existing
      boreholes. Such methods include using a disclosed working fluid or
      reacted fluid, e.g. a working fluid capable of producing a heat
      flux of about 0.1 to about 50 MW/m&lt;2&gt; when in contact with
      rock.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Methods</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0060] For example, provided herein are systems and methods that
      may be capable of creating 20 feet of an e.g., 8 inch borehole in
      about hour, or 20 feet of a 4 inch borehole in about an hour or
      less, or about a 0.2 inches of ~1 inch borehole in about 4
      minutes. Also provided herein are systems or methods for opening a
      length of existing borehole, e.g. with an original diameter of
      that may be as small as 4 inches, to a final diameter of about 36
      inches or more, which in some embodiments may be accomplished in
      12-24 hours, or days. Contemplated systems and methods may be used
      to create boreholes, shafts, caverns or tunnels in a target
      material such as crystalline rock material, silicate rock, basalt,
      granite, sandstone, limestone, peridotite, or any other rocky
      material. Disclosed systems and methods may also be used for
      producing multilaterals from an existing borehole, which in turn
      may be opened. In certain embodiments, disclosed systems and
      methods may be used, for example, to create vertical boreholes,
      horizontal boreholes, deviated boreholes, angled boreholes, larger
      diameter boreholes, curved boreholes, or any combination thereof.
      Also provided herein are systems and methods that may spall rock
      at a rate of about 100 ft&lt;3&gt;/hour or more, which may be
      useful for example for the creation of tunnels, caverns,
      mineshafts, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] For example, also provided herein are methods to reduce
      existing wellbore impedance and/or improve production of existing
      wells (e.g. EGS wells). Such methods may include, for example,
      increasing the diameter of at least portions (e.g. a working,
      producing, or production zone or portion - one or more sections
      that are typically significantly downhole, may be uncased, or
      cased with slotted or perforated casing, and where substantially
      most of the energy output or fluid production occurs, for example,
      in an EGS well) of an existing wellbore.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The systems and methods disclosed herein may include
      sensors such as gyroscopes, magnetometers, and/or inclinometers,
      for monitoring the orientation of the drilling systems. Systems
      and methods may also include at least one of temperature and/or
      pressure sensors, flow sensors, natural rock gamma ray sensors,
      resistivity/conductivity sensors and rock and/or pore space
      density sensors, to identify rock properties and hydrologic
      conditions that may influence the desired trajectory, for example,
      of the borehole/drill hole. For example, sensors may be provided
      to selectively monitor flow entry points and/or temperature
      changes of fluids that will influence the target which influences
      desired direction of drilling or hole opening. In one embodiment,
      the methods and systems described herein provide for deep borehole
      drilling, for example from approximately 1,000 feet to about
      50,000 feet, or 5,000 feet to about 50,000 feet, or about 10,000
      feet to approximately 50,000 feet below the surface, or more. In
      other embodiments, methods and systems described herein provide
      for hole openings in e.g. production zones of a wellbore. One or
      more wellbore diameters may be increased by about 0.1 to 10 feet
      or more. In other embodiments, for example, substantially
      perpendicular holes relative to a production zone of an existing
      well can be formed that may be about 1 to about 1,000 feet or more
      in length. Also contemplated herein are the formation of
      parallel/collinear slots, multilaterals (similar to branching of a
      tree) or horizontal deviations, which may be used to increase
      production from e.g. a single, substantially vertical wellbore.
      These multilaterals may be further hole opened.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] For example, provided herein are systems and/or methods
      that may be configured for drilling boreholes in hard rock for
      geothermal, enhanced or engineered geothermal systems (EGS),
      and/or oil and gas applications, natural gas production or
      enhanced oil recovery or unconventional oil production, using a
      disclosed working fluid to spall rock. However, the systems and
      methods described herein may also be used for other applications
      such as, but not limited to, exploratory boreholes, test
      boreholes, boreholes for scientific study or resource assessment,
      quarrying, ground source heat pumps, water wells, resource mining
      (conventional or solution mining), combined HDR (hot dry rock)
      solution mining, gas or liquefied natural gas (LNG) applications,
      CO2 sequestration capture or storage, storage of water or other
      resources, nuclear waste disposal, thermal or supercritical
      oxidations of wastes, downhole chemical processing and/or tunnel
      or cavern creation (new or in conjunction with an existing well).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] For example, methods are provided herein for increasing the
      diameter along a section of an existing geothermal well or
      borehole, for example, methods are provided for creating
      substantially axial (i.e. substantially parallel/collinear with
      the wellbore) slots along the length of a working portion or
      production zone of an existing borehole, methods of perforating an
      existing borehole (e.g. creating holes substantially perpendicular
      to the wellbore); methods for creating radial branches off of
      and/or stemming from an existing borehole (e.g. intersecting a
      production zone); and/or methods of creating one, two, or a
      plurality of substantially axial slots along a length of an
      existing borehole, wherein the methods include using a disclosed
      working fluid. The axial slots or radial branches may be oriented,
      in some embodiments, so as to intersect the greatest number of
      fractures or to be facing the injection well. Also contemplated
      herein are methods for substantially expanding the diameter of a
      wellbore along a given length, or for removing a portion of
      material by spallation, whereby the spallation induces further
      fracturing, collapse or break-out of the rock wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Methods contemplated herein also include hydrothermal
      reactions, explosions or detonations, which take place in the
      wellbore or fractures for only a finite period. For example, an
      unreacted fluid may be pumped into the wellbore and/or allowed to
      penetrate the fractures. A reaction may then be initiated by e.g.
      a catalyst "pill" sent down the drill string or by exposing a
      sample of catalyst in a downhole tool, initiating a hydrothermal
      reaction and causing spallation in fractures and macrofracturing
      in wellbore.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Alternatively, the wellbore may be cooled by traditional
      means of circulating fluids. An unreacted fluid which has a Self
      Accelerating Decomposition Temperature (SADT) - a temperature at
      which reaction runs away and propagates - that is below the
      formation temperature may then be injected into the wellbore and
      fractures. As the formation is allowed to recover from the cooling
      treatment, the reaction may initiate, with or without the use of a
      catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In some embodiments, two or more components of the
      unreacted fluid, e.g. fuel and oxidant may be delivered through
      the conduit in "slugs" so that there is no chance of a premature
      reaction in the conduit. Once the desired mixture of e.g. fuel and
      oxidant have been created in the wellbore, the reaction can be
      initiated by e.g. a catalyst pill, exposing a catalyst in the
      tool, auto-initiated, or by allowing the wellbore to warm. Since
      high concentrations of e.g. fuel and oxidant can be delivered by
      this "slug" flow, it may be possible to produce an unreacted fluid
      mixture e.g. above the detonation limits which allows for
      propagation of the reaction and Shockwave throughout the producing
      zone and/or fractures, creating spallation and fracturing. [0068]
      In general, as discussed herein, "spallation" refers to the
      breaking away of surface fragments of a material, e.g. rock
      "spall" refers to the fragments of material formed by a process of
      spallation. A thermal spallation process can refer to a spallation
      process that uses a working fluid other than air, such as working
      fluid that includes water (e.g., hydrothermal spallation resulting
      from the creation of high temperature water from hydrothermal
      oxidation reaction as disclosed herein), water or oil based
      drilling muds, supercritical fluids, and the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] Disclosed herein, in an embodiment, is a spallation method
      that may use a means, for example, a hydrothermal means, a
      flameless means and/or a self-energized means, e.g., a means that
      does not use a separate energy source to initiate or generate a
      chemical reaction to produce a heated, working fluid and/or a
      means that does not include a flame. For example, a flameless
      chemical means may include a reaction such as a hydrothermal
      oxidation reaction, or a reaction that includes a physical change
      in the reacting fluids, e.g., a phase change and/or solvation. An
      exemplary hydrothermal oxidation reaction is the catalyzed
      reaction of aqueous methanol and aqueous peroxide. It is
      understood by a person skilled in the art that a flameless
      hydrothermal reaction refers to an exothermic reaction that
      produces heat but does not produce a flame. A flameless reacted
      fluid is the product of a flameless hydrothermal reaction. For
      example, a contemplated hydrothermal oxidation reaction may
      produce visible light through diffuse ionization, but does not
      produce light from a flame, as does combustion. In some
      embodiments, contemplated reactions are aqueous and flameless.
      Such reactions are substantially stable in the presence of water
      or increased temperature or pressure. Contemplated reactions are
      distributed through water so the reacted temperature may be
      produced at a desired temperature (e.g., below the limits of tool
      construction or at a desired jet temperature) without e.g.
      requiring mixing of cooling water. In some embodiments,
      contemplated fuel and/or oxidant may be delivered to the drill
      head down a single conduit at e.g., near pressure balance with the
      fluid in the borehole.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Such means may allow the application of a working fluid to
      a surface zone of a target material such as a hard and/or
      crystalline rock with substantially high heat flux. Provided
      herein, for example, are means to form a working fluid for e.g.
      borehole creation or borehole enlargement which may produce a heat
      transfer capability of about 0.1 to about 20 MW/m&lt;2&gt;, or
      about 1.0 to about 30 MW/m&lt;2&gt;, about 0.5 MW/m&lt;2&gt; to
      about 8 MW/m&lt;2&gt;, about 0.1 MW/m&lt;2&gt; to about 8
      MW/m&lt;2&gt;, or about 2 MW/m&lt;2&gt; to about 7 MW/m&lt;2&gt;,
      when in contact with the material. For example, provided herein
      are means to form a working fluid may produce a heat flux of about
      0.1 to about 10 MW/m&lt;2&gt;, or about 1.0 to about 10
      MWVm&lt;2&gt;, about 0.5 MW/m&lt;2&gt; to about 8 MW/m&lt;2&gt;,
      or about 1 to about 8MW/m&lt;2&gt; or about 2 MW/m&lt;2&gt; to
      about 7 MW/m&lt;2&gt;, when in contact with the material.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] In an alternative embodiment, provided herein are means for
      producing a working fluid having a heat flux of about 0.01 to
      about 10 kW/m&lt;2&gt; when in contact with material. Such a heat
      flux may be used to form e.g., caverns, tunnels and mineshafts, or
      for enlarging the diameter of an existing borehole, for example,
      using a lower heat flux process.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In some embodiments, the disclosed methods, means, and
      apparatus are capable of achieving and/or maintaining ( in for
      example, a reaction chamber) or directing a reacted fluid towards
      e.g. a rock surface at a temperature that is not substantially
      higher than a certain desired temperature (for example not
      substantially higher that the desired working fluid or the limits
      of materials of construction of the system and/or apparatus), e.g.
      to achieve and/or maintain a reacted fluid temperature between
      about 500 &lt;0&gt;C (or about 500 &lt;0&gt;C above the ambient
      rock temperature), and about 900 &lt;0&gt;C, or about the
      temperature of rock fusion and/or brittle ductile transition. In
      some embodiments, maintaining such a reacted fluid temperature may
      be more advantageous as compared to known techniques such as air
      spallation and/or flame spallation, which can use high combustion
      temperatures that can induce melting or fusing of rock or can
      damage downhole hardware. For example, FIG. 8 depicts brittle
      ductile measurements on feldspar samples under no loading and with
      overburden pressure applied to the material. It will be
      appreciated that the temperature that induces melting or fusing of
      rock, or the brittle/ductile transition may vary with the type
      and/or nature of rock. For example, FIG. 9 depicts the
      relationship between differential stress and strain on natural
      quartz crystals for variations in temperatures and water content,
      while FIG. 10 shows how the melting curve for water saturated
      granite is affected by pressure. Furthermore, it can be
      appreciated that using a heat source which exceeds this
      temperature may lead to undesirable transformation of the rock,
      such as melting or softening. For example, if it occurred, such
      undesired melting or softening may impede further spallation.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In some embodiments, such a temperature and/or heat flux is
      necessary for the spallation of rock by e.g. creating enough heat
      flux to remove spalls while e.g. substantially maintaining a
      temperature that does not e.g. degrade materials of construction
      and/or fuse or soften rock, minerals or grain boundaries which may
      make rock substantially more difficult to spall. For example,
      applying a working fluid having substantially high heat flux when
      in contact with rock may cause grains within the rock to expand
      and thereby produce microfractures within the rock. The growth of
      such microfractures may result in a fractured region that spalls,
      buckles and/or separates from the surface of the rock or material.
      When such spall is ejected from the rock surface, it exposes fresh
      material below the spall, and the spall process may continue. An
      exemplary spallation process is shown in FIG.l. Such spallation
      processes may be easier when, for example, pre-existing stress in
      rock, e.g. lithostatic loading or deviatoric (non-uniform)
      loading, is present.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] In the thermal spallation process of FIG. 1, a rock 1 has
      an exposed surface 3 which contains, near the surface, a small
      flaw 2 in the mineral structure. Heat is applied to the rock
      surface 3 by a high temperature source, such as a supersonic flame
      jet or hydrothermal jet. The rock 1 may be subjected to the
      natural stress found in the ground which acts on the grain in all
      directions, but is typically lowest in a direction perpendicular
      to the exposed mineral surface. As the mineral starts to expand
      from the applied heat, stresses parallel to the exposed surface
      increase, so the flaw 2 starts to grow 5 to relieve the stress.
      The flaw may expand to a size 6 where the grain or portion of the
      grain 7 is separated from the rock 1, thereby leaving a void 8 and
      a fresh surface for further heat transfer and spallation.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In some embodiments, the heat flux and/or temperature of
      the working fluid may be adjusted to produce or facilitate rock
      removal processes such as macrofracturing, dissolution, partial
      melting, softening, change in crystalline phase,
      decrystallization, or the like. For example, removal of large
      volumes of rock such as in the creation of caverns, mine shafts or
      tunnels, or larger hole opening processes, such as reducing near
      wellbore impedance, may require lower heat fluxes.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] Substantially high heat fluxes may produce small spalls,
      which in turn may improve lift (and removal) from the borehole.
      For example, spalls produced by methods disclosed herein are, in
      some embodiments, approximately less than or about 0.1mm to about
      2.0 mm thick and may have diameters less than or about 1-20 times,
      or about 1 to about 5 times, their thickness. In some embodiments,
      spalls may be produced that are less than or about 0.1mm to about
      2.0mm in all dimensions. In some embodiments, spalls as large as
      10 mm may be formed; these spalls have significant thermal damage
      and microfracturing which may cause them to be broken down further
      in the flow streams or by mechanical forces in the wellbore during
      drilling.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] In some embodiments, such as hole opening using lower heat
      fluxes, created spalls may be on the order of inches to several
      feet; these spalls may be left in place, allowed to fall into an
      existing cavern or "rat hole"( existing below the production
      zone), or may be reduced and/or removed by a secondary process
      such as mechanical drilling. Non-removal of such formed spalls may
      be advantageous, e.g. smaller conduits may be needed to transport
      fluids to and from the bottom of the hole. Substantial non-removal
      of spalls may be particularly advantageous if larger spalls are
      generated by lower heat fluxes. In other embodiments, any rock
      that is removed may intentionally makes the hole less stable,
      resulting in break-out or cave-ins, further expanding the diameter
      without requiring the complete spallation of all of the loosened
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] In some embodiments, seismic or acoustic monitoring of the
      fracturing or the sound in the section of the borehole may provide
      information as to the size and extent of spalling and the size or
      shape of the resulting borehole. In other embodiments, the methods
      and apparatus disclosed herein also provide for an additional down
      hole fluid, which may improve buoyancy or lift of cuttings (for
      example, improved buoyancy in aerated foams, liquid water or
      drilling mud as compared to air used in flame jet spallation) and
      may, in some embodiments, assist in transport of particles to the
      surface of the wellbore where they can be separated from e.g.,
      water using standard oilfield (or geothermal) drilling
      technologies such as, but not limited to, shaker screens, mud
      pits, and hydro-cyclone de-sanders, and de-silters. In some
      embodiments, the methods of spallation disclosed herein produce
      substantially smaller cuttings or spall in comparison to
      conventional rotary drill cuttings. In another embodiment, the
      methods of spallation disclosed herein provide for substantial
      control over the size of spalls formed, by e.g. controlling heat
      flux and/or temperature e.g. of a heated or reacted fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] In another embodiment, application of a high heat flux
      (e.g. using a reacted or working fluid) on the surface of the
      target material may result in a thermally affected zone or reacted
      rock region. For example, a thermally- affected zone having
      reduced mechanical strength (due to e.g. microfracturing,
      macrofracturing, softening, and/or annealing), which may extend as
      much as about &lt;1&gt;A inch or more below the rock surface, may
      be created by a disclosed reacted or working fluid inducing e.g. a
      substantially high heat flux. Provided herein is a method for
      penetrating or reacting rock, e.g. a method for forming a reacted
      rock region, which may be suitable for penetration using
      conventional mechanical rock drills. (For example, such reacted
      rock region may be easier to drill using mechanical rock drills as
      compared to a rock region that has not been reacted). Such a
      method may therefore further include mechanically drilling,
      reaming, or otherwise removing the reacted rock, as described
      below. For example, removing the reacted rock may increase the
      diameter or improve the shape of the well.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] Near wellbore impedance may occur where fractures intersect
      a wellbore, as shown, e.g., in FIG. 19A. In one embodiment, a
      method of fracture enlargement is provided, e.g. to reduce
      wellbore impedance, by using a provided working fluid in a
      wellbore. Pressure in an existing well may be controlled, in some
      embodiments, by e.g., "shutting in the well", "zonal isolation" or
      by "packing off the length of the borehole being treated such that
      the working fluid is forced into or near fractures (e.g.
      identified fractures or fractures along an isolated zone),
      inducing spallation or geomechanical changes at the surface of the
      fracture, enlarging the fracture, and thereby resulting in an
      improvement in the flow of fluids through the fracture, as shown,
      e.g., in FIG. 19D. In other embodiments, the pressure in an
      existing well may be controlled to prevent flow of the fluid into
      the fractures, by either maintaining neutrally or "underbalanced"
      conditions. In other embodiments, the pressure may be varied or
      cycled; this may assist in blowing produced spalls or fractured
      rock out of the fractures or away from the borehole wall. Pressure
      or flow may also be cycled to allow for the measurement of flow
      and temperature from the borehole to determine how effective the
      treatment has been, or if additional treatment is necessary. In
      other embodiments, the wellbore may be expanded more globally, by
      removing the rock in and around the fracture, also leading to a
      reduction in wellbore impedance, as shown, e.g., in FIGS. 2OB and
      2OC. In other embodiments, the walls of the borehole can be
      spalled to create features such as slots or perforations that may
      be designed to better intersect the existing fractures or to
      weaken the walls of the wellbore in that location so as to induce
      further collapse and expansion of the wellbore, leading to a
      further reduction in impedance. In some embodiments, the reacted
      fluid may comprise other chemicals which may assist in the process
      of reducing wellbore impedance, e.g. chemicals which increase or
      decrease the solubility of certain minerals. Incorporation of
      these chemicals either from the unreacted fluid or from a separate
      stream, may be used to prevent minerals from being dissolved by
      the high temperature fluid jet and/or or being redeposited in the
      cooler fractures, or may be used to facilitate dissolution of the
      minerals in either the spalls or along the fracture walls. These
      chemicals may include alcohols e.g. methanol, or bases e.g.
      hydroxides, or combinations of the two, such as alcoxides.
      Alternatively, these chemicals may include acids, such as HCl, HF
      or the like.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The disclosed methods and apparatuses of e.g., spalling
      rock, can be applied to any formation of rock, for example, can be
      applied to a subterranean formation in which the hydrostatic head
      of fluid in the borehole produces a pressure at the bottom of the
      borehole that does not exceed the fracture pressure of the
      formation. In some embodiments, during operation of the disclosed
      methods, the pressure of a borehole may be maintained below the
      formation's fracture pressure or above the pressure of exposed
      permeable formations to prevent inflow. For example, a drilling
      mud may be used to vary the hydrostatic pressure in the borehole
      or to create partial isolation of the working zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The methods described herein may further include monitoring
      properties (e.g. size, shape, temperature and/or chemical
      composition) of the formed spalls and/or may include adjusting or
      monitoring e.g. a working fluid temperature and/or heat flux, to
      e.g., optimize rate of penetration or maintain a pre-determined or
      desired range of spall sizes. Such measurements may be performed
      by e.g., an optical measurement, seismic measurement, an acoustic
      measurement, a chemical measurement, and/or a mechanical
      measurement. For example, fluid flow and temperature sensors
      coupled with computational models may be used to determine heat
      flux at e.g. the bottom of the borehole. In some embodiments,
      chemistry of the returning fluid (e.g. fuel, oxidant or combustion
      products) may be monitored to e.g. adjust the downhole reaction
      conditions or as an indicator of system, e.g., combustion or
      oxidation catalyst efficiency. For example, CO, CO2, formaldehyde,
      formic acid, NOx , oxygen, fuel (e.g. alkanes, methanol or
      ethanol), or oxidant may be detected in returning fluids as e.g.
      indicators of condition of a catalyst used for oxidation
      reactions. In another embodiment, fluid chemistry (e.g. pH,
      dissolved minerals, suspended minerals, and agglomerates) may be
      monitored in the returning fluid, which may allow for adjusting
      additives in the working or cooling-lift fluid to reduce or
      enhance solid or mineral precipitation, agglomeration,
      dissolution. Downhole monitoring of temperature, heat flux,
      stand-off, and/or borehole geometry by e.g. temperature sensors,
      flow sensors, acoustic monitors, or calipers may allow for
      optimization of the drilling conditions. In other embodiments,
      standard oilfield and geothermal drilling methods and equipment
      for the measurement of the formation, orientation, and borehole
      conditions, e.g. measurement while drilling (MWD) or logging while
      drilling (LWD) systems may be used, as well as directional
      drilling and drilling with casing or casing while drilling
      technologies.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] For example, in a disclosed method for hole opening of
      existing wellbores, a drill string deploying the heating system
      (e.g. the catalyst or combustion chamber for producing the reacted
      fluid) may also contain instrumentation to help identify and
      locate the areas of the working portions to be treated. Once the
      instrumentation identifies the regions or fractures, a drill
      string can then be pulled up the wellbore to align the jets or
      nozzles with the areas to be treated. A packer or heat shield may
      be used to separate the instrumentation from the heat of the
      spallation process and to isolate the zone of the borehole to be
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Working Fluids and Apparatus</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0084] In some embodiments, the working fluid includes a
      substantially aqueous fluid, e.g. water. Other exemplary fluids
      include oil or water based drilling mud. The fluids may be
      selected for optimum heat capacity and/or heat transfer
      properties. In alternate embodiments, a working fluid may include
      a gas such as neon or nitrogen. Contemplated working fluids may
      include by appropriate additives, e.g. viscosifiers, thermal
      stabilizers, density modifying additives such as barite, and those
      common in oil, gas and/or geothermal drilling.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The working fluid may be directed through one or more
      nozzles, for example, a nozzle disposed in a drilling system. Such
      nozzles may be adapted to direct the fluid substantially along an
      elongate central axis, for example, in a pulsing (e.g. cyclically
      pulsing) flow or a substantially continuous flow. For example, in
      some embodiments, a single, centrally located, non-rotating
      thermal spallation system may have a reduced number of moving
      parts and reduced mechanical complexity that may result in a
      substantially simplified and/or cost effective system. Minimizing
      the moving parts within a thermal spallation system, may allow
      stronger and more robust materials to be used in construction of
      the system, and therefore the resulting structure may be better
      adapted to withstand the high pressures, temperatures, and
      mechanical wear and impact that is generated at the bottom of a
      borehole during operation. In another embodiment, a combination of
      centrally located and peripheral nozzles can be used to optimize
      heat flux across the surface of the rock, drilling rates, spall
      size or borehole geometry.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] For example, such as in hole opening applications provided
      herein, the shape of the openings may be controlled to make
      features in the walls of existing boreholes such as channels,
      perforations, slots, or multilaterals (multiple branches drilled
      out from the existing wellbore). For example, the shape of the
      openings may be controlled by controlling spall size, or may be
      controlled by the orientation of the nozzles. For example, an
      apparatus with at least one substantially perpendicular nozzle may
      be slowly run along the length of a production zone of an existing
      borehole, creating a slot. Alternatively, a single substantially
      perpendicular jet may sit on one position in the existing borehole
      creating a perforation. An apparatus with multiple perpendicular
      jets (within the same or different apparatus) or if the tool or
      apparatus is rotated, a series of holes or parallel slots can be
      created. The pressure from the surface pumps and/or reaction may
      be used to move the nozzle e.g., towards the rock face to maintain
      a small stand-off. A ring or peripheral gap nozzle can create
      disc-like openings if stationary (as shown, e.g., in FIG. 19B), or
      open the diameter along the length of the wellbore if translated.
      A less directed or more even heat flux may be applied to open the
      hole more evenly in all areas, or in the areas of greatest
      existing stress. In an embodiment, methods of reducing wellbore
      impedance are provided that include the use of less focused or
      directed jets, jets substantially axial with the wellbore or with
      greater stand-off distances or lower heat fluxes, to produce more
      global spalling of the area of a production zone. In some
      embodiments, "packers" or plugs (e.g., cement or ceramic plugs)
      may be used to isolate the areas of a production zone to be
      treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] Also provided herein are apparatuses for spalling rock,
      such as an apparatus that includes a fluid heating means adapted
      to heat a fluid to a temperature greater than about 500&lt;0&gt;C
      above the ambient temperature of a surrounding material and less
      than about the temperature of the brittle-ductile transition
      temperature of the material; and at least one nozzle adapted to
      direct the heated fluid onto a target location on the surface of
      the material, wherein the fluid produces a heat flux of about 0.1
      to about 20 MW/m&lt;2&gt; at an interface between the fluid and
      the target location, and thereby creating spalls of the material.
      The nozzles of the disclosed apparatuses and systems may include a
      high temperature resistant material, e.g. a ceramic or ceramic
      composites, metal-ceramic composites, stainless steels, austenitic
      steels and superalloys such as Hastelloy, Inconel, Waspaloy, Rene
      alloys (e.g. Rene 41, Rene 80, Rene 95), Haynes alloys, Incoloy,
      MP98T, TMS alloys, and CMSX single crystal alloys, metal carbides,
      metal nitrides, alumina, silicon nitride, and the like. The
      materials may also be coated to improve their performance,
      oxidative and chemical stabilities, and/or wear resistance.
      Chemical Heating<br>
      <br>
      [0088] For example, a disclosed spallation system or apparatus
      that is capable of producing a fluid for use in the disclosed
      methods and apparatuses may include at least one jet nozzle, and a
      housing including a reaction chamber and, optionally, a catalyst
      element held within the reaction chamber. In operation, unreacted
      fluids or solids can be contacted with the catalyst element within
      the housing, resulting in the unreacted fluid or solid reacting,
      with the catalyst element and generating a reacted fluid. This
      reacted fluid may then be emitted through the at least one jet
      nozzle and directed to an excavation site within the geological
      rock formation, thereby creating spalls and/or a reacted rock
      region. In some embodiments, contemplated unreacted fluid or
      solids react in the presence of a catalyst substantially
      self-energized, e.g., does not require an additional energy or
      heat source such as e.g., a spark, flame holder, flame, or glow
      plug to initiate or maintain the reaction and produce the reacted
      fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] For example, one or more unreacted fluids or solids (e.g.
      one or two unreacted fluids (e.g. liquids) (which may be the same
      or different), or one unreacted fluid and one unreacted solid, or
      one or two unreacted solids (which may be the same or different),
      may be contacted with the catalyst element, thereby forming or
      generating a reacted or working fluid. Such reacted fluid may be
      emitted through at least one nozzle (e.g. one center nozzle, a
      ring or peripheral gap nozzle, or a plurality of nozzles), where
      the at least one nozzle is directed to an excavation site (e.g.
      bottom hole or against the borehole wall) within or on the
      geological rock formation. The directed reacted fluid may create
      spalls which may or may not then be transported to the top of the
      hole and/or may create a reacted rock region e.g., down hole. It
      will be recognized by one skilled in the art that discrete spots
      on the catalyst may, at times, exceed the final temperature of the
      working fluid due to localized heating on the catalytic surface,
      but the reaction is self-energizing and does not require an
      additional heat source to be provided by e.g. a power cable from
      the surface or an unstable flame holder.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The unreacted fluid may, in one embodiment have a density
      similar to water. This may be advantageous, for example, in
      minimizing any pressure differences between the unreacted fluid
      and the fluids in the wellbore. For example, if the density of the
      unreacted fluid is slightly greater than the fluids in the
      wellbore, any required pumping pressures for the unreacted fluid
      may be reduced. [0091] Contacting unreacted fluids or solids with
      the catalyst may occur at a pressure of for example, about 1 to
      about 200 MPa or 1 to about 400 MPa. The unreacted fluid or solid
      may be at a temperature of about 20 &lt;0&gt;C to about 350
      &lt;0&gt;C. In some embodiments, at least one of the unreacted
      fluids is substantially liquid.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Contemplated catalysts include catalysts comprising
      transition metals and/or noble metals, e.g. lead, iron, silver,
      platinum, palladium, nickel, cobalt, copper, iridium, gold,
      samarium, cerium, vanadium, manganese, chromium, ruthenium, zinc,
      and/or rhodium, and or mixtures and/or alloys or salts thereof,
      and/or complexes, e.g. carbonyl complexes thereof. Contemplated
      catalysts include oxides and/or nitrides of e.g. metals. The
      catalyst may, in one embodiment, include lanthanum, zirconium,
      aluminum or cerium (e.g. lanthanum cerium manganese hexaaluminate,
      Zr-Al-oxides and Ce-oxides) or other mixed metal oxide catalysts.
      The catalyst may include promoters (e.g. cerium and/or palladium).<br>
      <br>
      [0093] In some embodiments, the catalyst may be provided on a
      non-reactive support, and/or on a substantially porous support, or
      a support with channels (eg. a honeycomb structure). Such supports
      may include alumina, sol-gels such as sol-gel derived alumina,
      aerogels, carbon supports, solid oxides, solid nitrides,
      oxidatively stable carbides, silica, magnesium and/or oxides
      thereof, titanium zirconium, and/or zeolites, metals, ceramics,
      intermetallics, corrosion resistant metals (e.g. iron chromium
      alloys), or alloy or composites thereof, or other materials
      commonly used in catalytic supports. The supports can be but are
      not limited to powdered, granular, or fixed bed. In some
      embodiments, the catalyst or catalytic bed may further include
      inhibitors that inhibit e.g. plating or poisoning on the surface
      of the catalyst or catalytic support. In other embodiments, the
      catalyst may include cation salts and/or promoters such as ionic
      promoters or tin, nickel, silver, gold, cerium, platinum,
      manganese oxides, or salts. A contemplated catalyst may include
      other components such as boron, phosphorus, silica, selenium or
      tellurium. Catalysts or their supports may be comprised of
      nanoparticles.<br>
      <br>
      [0094] In other embodiments, the catalyst may be configured as a
      bed over which (or through which) the unreacted fluid is flowed.
      In some embodiments, the catalyst bed may be sized and shaped to
      fit within an appropriate drill head housing, or the catalyst bed
      may be disposed in a different housing separate from the nozzle.
      In one embodiment, the catalyst bed may be substantially
      cylindrical, less than approximately three inches in diameter and
      two feet in length. In an alternative embodiment larger or smaller
      catalyst beds may be used. For example, in one alternative
      embodiment a catalyst bed of approximately 0.5 inches in diameter
      and 1-2 inches in length may be used. In other embodiments, axial
      or radial flow reactors may be used. In other embodiments,
      multiple catalyst beds may be used of the same or different
      designs. The catalyst bed may include a catalyst on a
      substantially non-reactive support and/or a porous support.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] A catalytic support may include for example, a zeolite
      molecular sieve of porous extrudate, piece, pellets, powder, or
      spheres, and/or porous alumina, silica, alumino- silicate
      extrudate, pieces, pellets, powder, or spheres. Catalytic supports
      may be chemically resistant to any unreacted or reacted fluid. In
      one example embodiment, the catalyst bed includes about 0.5%
      platinum on 1/16" alumina spheres having a surface area of at
      least approximately 10 m&lt;2&gt;/g, or at least 100 m&lt;2&gt;/g
      (e.g. a surface area of about 5 m&lt;2&gt;/g to about 15
      m&lt;2&gt;/g or more). In one embodiment, the catalyst bed may be
      about 5% platinum with a promoter on alumina grains e.g., with a
      high surface area. In some embodiments, the catalyst or catalyst
      bed may have plates or sheets. In an alternative embodiment, other
      forms of catalysis are contemplated (for example using a hot
      surface or a slug of hydrogen peroxide to initiate the reaction or
      bring the catalyst bed up to temperature that may produce a
      substantially self-sustaining reaction) may be used in place of,
      or in addition to, catalytic reactions. In one embodiment, the
      decomposition of a peroxide over a catalyst generates free oxygen
      and heat which raises the temperature of the unreacted fluid to
      initiate or help initiate the reaction; the pressure of the
      unreacted fluid may be increased to raise the boiling point of the
      decomposed fluid to initiate or assist initiation of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] In an alternative embodiment, a catalyst bed can be used in
      conjunction with a heat exchanger to initiate the reaction and
      raise the temperature of a down flowing unreacted fluid, wherein
      once the system has an appropriate temperature and/or the reaction
      is self-sustaining, the catalyst bed may be by-passed and/or
      isolated by e.g. a thermally- actuated mechanical valve, which may
      improve catalytic longevity. A higher activity catalyst bed may
      also be used to "light off the reaction, after which lower
      activity beds may be used to maintain its high activity. The use
      of higher pressures in the catalyst bed through e.g. choked flow
      across the nozzle, mud weight in the borehole, or back pressure at
      the wellhead, may increase the reaction rates per unit catalyst
      and decrease the pressure drops across the catalyst bed which may
      allow for smaller catalyst bed volumes and e.g. axial reactor
      beds.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] In some embodiments, the catalyst may be disposed on a
      moving rotating element, such as blades or screens on a
      hydraulically driven turbine, which may increase the contact
      between the catalyst and fluid. In another embodiment, the
      catalyst may be on a support that can be e.g., mechanically,
      thermally, or chemically removed, e.g. without having to pull a
      drill string out. For example, if the catalyst performance
      decreases or the catalyst is poisoned, the catalyst can be removed
      (e.g. by dissolution of alumina in hydrofluoric acid) and a fresh
      catalyst may be sent down in, e.g. in the form of a pill. The
      catalyst may be supported on carbon that is combusted once the
      reaction reaches full temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The catalyst may be regenerated, by for example, passing an
      oxidant, hydrogen or a hydrogen source over the catalyst at
      temperature, by acid or base washes, or any other technique
      commonly used in catalytic combustion systems. Hydrogen or
      additional oxidant may be added continuously to the unreacted
      fluid to prevent e.g. coking while also reducing the light-off
      temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] A catalyst chamber may be a water cooled reactor. In
      another embodiment, the catalyst chamber may be a transpiring wall
      reactor from a porous material tube that includes metal or
      ceramics.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] The catalyst chamber may have distinct zones. For example,
      different zones may be responsible for different chemical
      reactions, destruction or binding of catalyst poisons, or for
      different temperatures or to reduce the amount of the most
      expensive catalyst (e.g. noble metal) that is needed, or to
      provide zones of less expensive, sacrificial catalysts. The
      relative flow through different zones may be changed depending on
      the temperature of the catalyst chamber or over time. Different
      zones, for example, may have substantially the same catalyst and
      geometry or different catalyst and geometry. For example, sending
      the unreacted fluid over one bed at a time until the bed is no
      longer active can extend the working life of a tool before it
      needs to be pulled from the hole to replace the catalyst.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] In one embodiment, the unreacted fluid is an aqueous fluid.
      In other embodiments, an unreacted fluid may be liquid and may
      include water, oil, water or oil based drilling muds, aerated
      fluids, and/or supercritical CO2, or any other appropriate liquid
      for use as e.g. the working fluid. In one embodiment water can be
      separated downhole from the unreacted fluid by cyclone separators
      or other appropriate fluid separation systems and methods. For
      example, an unreacted fluid may be liquid, gaseous, or a
      supercritical fluid (e.g. H2O at temperatures above about
      375&lt;0&gt;C and 3200 PSI (approximately 7400' water column).<br>
      <br>
      [0102] For example, the unreacted fluid may include water and/or
      an oxidant and/or a fuel. In operation, the unreacted fluid may
      be, e.g., pumped to a drill head assembly of a disclosed
      spallation system. In the drill head, the unreacted fluid can be,
      for example, passed over a catalyst configured (or otherwise put
      in contact with the catalyst) to e.g., cause the flameless
      reaction with an oxidant and/or a fuel that may be present in e.g.
      the unreacted fluid. Such a reaction may produce a reacted fluid,
      e.g. a fluid at an elevated temperature, that may then be directed
      out of an e.g., distal jet nozzle of the spallation drill head
      assembly and impinge upon a target rock surface, creating
      thermally damaged rock and/or spalled rock. The reacted fluid, in
      some embodiments, may include water in gaseous (steam) or
      supercritical form, for example, may be a gas when in first
      contact with rock. After contacting the rock, the expelled water,
      gas or supercritical fluid can then, in some embodiments, flow up
      the borehole, carrying the spalled rock with it. In some
      embodiments, the reacted (hot) fluid is allowed to travel up the
      borehole to further spall the borehole walls and expand the
      diameter of the borehole. In other embodiments, the reacted fluid
      is cooled e.g. just above the drilling assembly by a heat
      exchanger and/or cooling-lift fluid, thereby substantially
      stopping the spallation reaction. In other embodiments, the
      reacted fluid is directed through a "shroud" which may reduce its
      interaction with the sides of the rock wall, and also
      substantially stopping the spallation reaction. In an alternative
      embodiment, some of the reacted fluid does not travel up the
      wellbore but rather enters the rock or formation through e.g.
      fractures. In some embodiments, the spalls or rock fragments are
      not carried up the wellbore but are allowed to fall further into
      the hole or remain on the borehole wall.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] In one embodiment, a non-reacted or unreacted fluid
      includes a fuel and/or oxidant. For example, the unreacted fluid
      may include two or more components that are miscible with each
      other. In another embodiment, an unreacted fluid and/or an
      unreacted solid is present, for example, an unreacted solid may
      include an oxidant (e.g. a solid encapsulated oxidant), or an
      unreacted substantially solid fuel, e.g. a wax. An unreacted solid
      may be dispersed, dissolved, undissolved or encapsulated within a
      solid. In one embodiment at least one of the fuel and/or oxidant
      may change state or dissolve, decompose, or otherwise react during
      its transport along the borehole to the drill head, or upon
      reaching a drill head. A catalyst or accelerant may be added to
      the unreacted fluid, wherein the catalyst can be activated at the
      bottom of the hole by heat or mechanical force, with or without
      the use of a secondary permanent catalyst. The working fluid may
      also contain an inhibitor to prevent the reaction from occurring
      along the length of a drill string.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] In certain embodiments, a nonreacted fluid is pumped down
      hole to a drill head at the distal end of the borehole at
      approximately 1- 50 or 5-50 gallons per minute, e.g. about 20
      gallons/minute. In one embodiment, an unreacted fluid may be
      pumped down one or more small diameter tubes that may be nested
      inside of a traditional steel coiled tubing system. Such small
      diameter tube or tubes may have one or more periodic check valves
      so as to prevent the unreacted fluid from back-flowing and to
      limit uncontrolled reactions from propagating up the nested tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] In an alternative embodiment, any appropriate tubing system
      for transporting the aqueous solution to the catalyst or drilling
      head assembly may be utilized. In some embodiments, the fuel and
      oxidant are transported to the catalyst or drilling head assembly
      through one conduit, or in separate conduits. For example,
      fuel/oxidant mixtures which are stable at desired concentrations
      can be transported together in one tube. This may, for example,
      have advantages over transporting the fuel and oxidant separately
      in that it would require one less conduit to pass material to the
      distal end of the borehole. It may also simplify storage, mixing,
      or handling procedures on the surface. Fuels or oxidants which may
      be carried in the bulk cooling-lift water (and separated at the
      bottom of the hole) to also reduce the number of conduits.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] In one embodiment, the fuel and oxidant may be combined in
      a number of different ways to allow for transportation of the fuel
      and oxidant down the same conduit. For example, fuel and oxidant
      may be transported down a single conduit through use of a single
      molecule ("single-source") or network/complex. The chemical heat
      source can be a monopropellant, such as hydrogen peroxide, nitrous
      oxide, or hydrazine. Alternatively, fuel and oxidant may be
      transported down a single conduit through use of methods
      including, but not limited to, slug flow (i.e. gases and/or
      liquids sent one after another), dissolved gases, or bubble flow
      (i.e. small bubbles suspended in a fluid and transported along
      with the fluid). In an alternative embodiment, the fuel and
      oxidant may be transported down the same conduit as two solid
      materials in one or more "pills". In a further alternative
      embodiment, one or more of the fuel and/or oxidant may be
      transported in an encapsulated form such as, but not limited to, a
      material, such as a peroxide, encapsulated by e.g., wax.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] In some embodiments, fuel and oxidant may be sent down one
      conduit in two separate fluid phases. For example, the fuel may be
      carried in an oil-based phase, and the oxidant in the water based
      phase. At the bottom of the hole, the two phases can be, for
      example, homogenated, or the fuel and/or oxidant can be separated
      from its respective phase by means of a hydrocylcone or other
      separation device and then combined with its reactant.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Contemplated fuels include carbonaceous fuel, such as a
      fossil fuel (e.g. coal, biomass), gasoline, natural gas (e.g.
      liquefied natural gas) diesel, biodiesel or kerosene. For example,
      fuels contemplated for use in the disclosed methods include
      alcohols, alkyls, cycloalkyls, alkenes, alkynyls, ethers,
      alkoxyalkyls, (e.g. CH3CH2O CH2CH3,), dioxanes, glycols, diols,
      ketones, acetone, aldehydes and/or aromatic organic compounds such
      as benzene or naphthalene, or combinations thereof. Hydrocarbons
      may be used as fuel, and include alkanes (e.g. C1-C2O alkanes)
      such as methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane,
      heptane, octane, and higher alkyl fuels such as naptha, kerosene,
      paraffin, hydrocarbon oligomers, and /or other waxes. Other
      contemplated fuels include ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), polyvinyl
      chloride (PVC), boranes (such as B2H6 or B5H9), carboranes,
      ammonia, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil, bio-based oils, such as
      biodiesel, starch, sugars, carbohydrates, or other
      oxyhydrocarbons. A fuel may be, or include, hydrogen, hydrogen
      generating compounds, or hydrogen containing polymers such as
      polyethylene, polypropylene, or paraffin polymers. A fuel may also
      be, or include, reactive metals such as aluminum, beryllium, and
      coated or encapsulated sodium.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] For example, contemplated fuels include alcohol fuels (e.g.
      C1-Cg alcohols) such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, and/or
      butanol, or mixtures thereof, which in some embodiments may be
      optionally substituted by one or more halogens. In certain
      embodiments, the fuel may be substantially miscible in water, e.g.
      methanol, ethanol or benzene.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] Contemplated oxidants include air, oxygen, peroxides,
      (e.g., hydrogen peroxide or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide)
      percarbonates, permanganates, permanganate salts, as well as
      combinations thereof. For example, contemplated oxidants include
      inorganic and/or organic peroxides such as peroxides of alkali
      metal peroxides, e.g. lithium, sodium, and/or potassium peroxides,
      e.g. sodium peroxide and/or barium peroxide. Alkyl peroxides such
      as t-butyl peroxide and benzoyl are contemplated. Oxidants
      contemplated herein may include hypochlorite and/or hypohalite
      compounds, halogens such as iodine, chlorite, chlorate or
      perchlorate compounds, hexavalent chromium compounds, sulfoxides,
      ozone, nitric acid, N2O, and/or persulfuric acid. Other possible
      oxidants include F2, OF2, O2/F2 mixtures, N2F4, CIF5, CIF3, NxOy,
      IRFNA Ilia: 83.4% HNO3, 14% NO2, 2% H2O, 0.6% HF: IRFNA IV HAD:
      54.3% HNO3, 44% NO2, 1% H2O, 0.7% HF, RP-I, C10Hi8, and CH3NHNH9.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] As disclosed herein the peroxide may be in e.g. aqueous
      form, or may be in a solid form e.g. pellets that may include
      urea. An unreacted fluid that includes an e.g. oxidant, e.g.
      hydrogen peroxide, may also include corrosion inhibitors and/or
      passivating agents and/or anti- foaming agents and/or surfactants
      and/or surface tension modifying agents. For example, an unreacted
      fluid may include stabilizers such as phosphoric or phosphonic
      acid or sodium pyrophosphate or tin compounds. In an embodiment,
      an oxidant, e.g. high pressure or liquid oxygen may be metered
      into a fuel stream (e.g. methane or methanol stream); mixing can
      take place either at the surface or in the drill head. The mixture
      may then travel into the drill head. In one embodiment the
      drilling head is configured to withstand bottom hole pressures of
      upwards of about 100 to 4000 PSI, 1000 to about 4000 PSI , or
      about 1000 to about 30000 PSI (e.g. about 1 to about 200 MPa),
      e.g. the pressures present at the bottom of a deep wellbore.<br>
      <br>
      [0112] In some embodiments, a provided unreacted fluid may include
      an aqueous solution comprising by weight of about 5% to about 52%
      oxidant, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, or about 30% to about 40%
      oxidant, or about 5% to about 50% oxidant, and may include about
      5% to about 20% fuel, e.g. methanol, or about 10% to about 20%
      fuel, e g. 10% to about 15% fuel, or even about 5% to about 50%
      fuel. For example, an unreacted fluid may include about 2% to
      about 40% by weight hydrogen peroxide. In another embodiment, the
      unreacted fluid may include about 10% to about 20% by weight
      methanol or ethanol. In an exemplary embodiment, the unreacted
      fluid includes about 15% methanol or ethanol and about a
      stoichiometric amount of air, oxygen, or peroxide (e.g. hydrogen
      peroxide). In another exemplary embodiment, the unreacted fluid
      includes 38% by weight hydrogen peroxide and about 12% by weight
      methanol, or e.g. about a 4:1 weight ratio of hydrogen
      peroxide/methanol, e.g. about a 5:1 to about a 1:1 weight ratio of
      hydrogen peroxide/methanol. [0113] In an exemplary embodiment, the
      unreacted fluid is slightly oxidant rich to assure complete
      combustion of the hydrocarbons to reduce the amount of by-products
      caused by incomplete combustion, such as carbon monoxide,
      formaldehyde, and/or formic acid. In other embodiments, the
      unreacted fluid may be T-Stoff (80% hydrogen peroxide, H2O2 as the
      oxidizer) and C-Stoff (methanol, CH3OH, and hydrazine hydrate,
      N2H4^wH2O) as the fuel); nitric acid (HNO3) and kerosene;
      inhibited red fuming nitric acid (IRFNA, HNO3 + N2O4) and
      unsymmetric dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH, (CH3)2N2H2), nitric acid 73%
      with dinitrogen tetroxide 27% (AK27), and kerosene/gasoline
      mixture, hydrogen peroxide and kerosene; hydrazine (N2H4) and red
      fuming nitric acid; Aerozine 50 and dinitrogen tetroxide,
      unsymmetric dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) and dinitrogen tetroxide; or
      monomethylhydrazine (MMH, (CH3)HN2H2) and dinitrogen tetroxide. In
      another embodiment, the unreacted fluid may include 50-98%
      hydrogen peroxide. The products from decomposing the 50-98%
      peroxide (e.g. H2O and/or O2) over a catalyst (e.g. platinum,
      silver, or palladium), may then be allowed to react with a fuel
      (e.g. methanol). The heat from the decomposition of the hydrogen
      peroxide, combined with downhole temperatures and pressures and/or
      the use of a heat exchanger, may auto-initiate or sustain the
      reaction of fuel and oxidant, such as peroxide and/or oxygen with
      methanol and/or ethanol.<br>
      <br>
      [0114] An unreacted fluid or solid, when contacted with the
      catalyst, may generate a reacted fluid, e.g. a fluid for use in
      the thermal systems disclosed herein. The reacted fluid may
      include water and may also include nitrogen, carbon dioxide and/or
      carbon monoxide, as well as smaller amounts of unreacted fuels
      and/or oxidants and/or side products. For example, an unreacted
      fluid that includes methanol and hydrogen peroxide, reacting with
      a catalyst, produces exothermically water and carbon dioxide. In
      some embodiments, little or no heat, and/or other initiator (e.g.
      spark, glow plug, or flame holder), is required to initiate the
      reaction. In some embodiments, contacting the unreacted fluid and
      catalyst produces substantially continuously reacted fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] In some embodiments, the reacted or working fluid, e.g.,
      hot water, is focused out of the jet nozzle of the drill head
      assembly and directed against the target rock surface. In one
      embodiment, the jet temperature (reacted fluid temperature) and/or
      heat flux may be controlled by adjusting the mixture of the
      aqueous solution (for example, by increasing the methanol and/or
      oxygen concentration to increase the jet temperature). In another
      embodiment, the jet temperature and/or heat flux may be controlled
      by increasing the flow rate of the unreacted and e.g., hence
      reacted fluid. In another embodiment, the jet temperature and/or
      heat flux may be controlled by adjusting the flow rate of the
      unreacted fluid to adjust for complete or incomplete reaction. The
      jet temperature and/or heat flux may also be controlled by, for
      example, adjusting the flow rate of the unreacted fluid to reduce
      the amount of heat exchange between the reacted and unreacted
      fluids.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] A drill assembly may include a drill head with a nozzle. An
      exemplary drill head may have a diameter of approximately
      &lt;3&gt;A inches with a 0.1 inch center nozzle through which the
      reacted fluid is expelled. In alternative embodiments, nozzles
      with different configurations and/or geometries may be utilized,
      such as a larger or smaller nozzle diameter. For example, the
      drill head may be about 5 to about 15, or 4 to about 29 times the
      diameter of the nozzle. In one embodiment, the drill head assembly
      may include a plurality of jet nozzles directed in either the same
      or different directions from a distal portion of the drill head
      assembly. In another embodiment, the drill head assembly includes
      one center jet nozzle. Rock "spalls" (e.g. grains or platelets of
      less than about 0.025 inch to about 0.1 inch) can be ejected and
      may be swept up the borehole by the reacted fluid (after the
      reacted fluid contacts the rock). In one embodiment, a larger flow
      of cooling-lift water (e.g., traveling in the annulus between the
      nested tube and coiled tubing), can be introduced after the heat
      exchanger (if used), to cool the fluid and help transport the
      spalls to the surface.<br>
      <br>
      [0117] In one embodiment, a heat exchanger is placed above the
      catalyst bed so that some of heat of the upflowing (e.g. reacted)
      fluid is transferred to the down flowing (e.g. unreacted) fluid,
      both conserving energy and preheating the solution prior to the
      e.g. the catalyst bed, heater, or drill head. In an exemplary
      embodiment, a nested drill string may act as a heat exchanger. In
      some embodiments, the catalyst may be preheated by sending some
      chemical, e.g. an oxidant (e.g. peroxide) in the down-flowing
      fluid, with or without fuel, which may in some embodiments,
      initiate a reaction, for example heating the catalyst. For
      example, heat provided by a heat exchanger to a down flowing fluid
      may provide enough heat to initiate the combustion reaction
      without the need for a catalyst, which may allow flow to be
      directed away from the catalyst bed (and thus may preserve or
      prolong the useful lifetime of the catalyst). In some embodiments,
      hot gas may be used to dry the catalyst bed prior to contact with
      the fuel and oxidant. [0118] In another embodiment, approximately
      0.12 gallons per minute of a 15-20% aqueous solution, such as, but
      not limited to an aqueous methanol solution, is pumped through a
      preheater to bring the temperature up to 290 &lt;0&gt;C. In an
      alternative embodiment, a greater or lesser volume of aqueous
      solution may be pumped. In further alternative embodiments the
      preheater may bring the temperature of the aqueous solution up to
      a greater or lesser temperature, as required. In a further
      alternative embodiment, no preheater is required<br>
      <br>
      [0119] In one embodiment spallation takes place with stand-off
      distances (i.e. the distance from the nozzle exit at which the
      target surface is placed) ranging from approximately 0.2-10.0
      inches. In an alternative embodiment, stand-off distances of less
      than 0.2 inches or greater than 10 inches may be achieved. This
      may, for example, allow a one inch diameter hole to be drilled at
      a rate of greater than 0.5 inches per minute. In one embodiment,
      the standoff distance is varied, either periodically or randomly,
      in a controlled or relatively uncontrolled manner, or in response
      to a downhole measurement or physical, mechanical, electrical
      thermal, or chemical condition. This variation in standoff may
      improve the tools ability to reliably under ream or to produce a
      borehole of consistent or desired geometry. Standoff distance, for
      example, may be controlled by acoustic monitoring, e.g. analysis
      of the sound of the jet can be used to determine the shape of the
      bottom of the hole and distance between the nozzle and the bottom.
      Parameters of the jet, (e.g., nozzle geometry, flow, temperature,
      stand-off) can be adjusted to optimize drilling, either through
      communications to the surface or by downhole processors or
      actuators. The backpressure of the flow through the nozzle may
      also be used for feedback to adjust e.g., the geometry of the
      nozzle, the flow rate, the stand-off, and/or the rate of drill
      string displacement.<br>
      <br>
      [0120] An example drill head assembly, a small scale axial flow
      reactor, for a spallation system is shown in FIGS. 3 A to 3C. In
      this embodiment, a catalytic heater drilling spallation system 31
      may be used to create high temperature high pressure fluids in a
      reaction chamber or cell 26, initiated by a stream of hot water
      mixed with 20% methanol to which gaseous oxygen is added. In
      alternative embodiments, a higher or lower percentage methanol may
      be used. This stream of fluid flows into the cell 26 through an
      inlet fitting 18. In one embodiment, the cell body 26 is
      constructed with an insulating gap 24 filled with an insulating
      material, such as, but not limited to, nitrogen gas at the same,
      or substantially the same, pressure as the fluid flowing into the
      cell 26. This gap 24 may assist in preventing heat loss from the
      reaction chamber within the cell 26 into the cooling water
      surrounding the cell 26, and also helps maintain the cell
      integrity at the high temperatures of the reaction occurs. The
      nitrogen enters the gap through a tube fitting 19 and into a
      collar 20. A replaceable o-ring seal 21 allows the inner region to
      thermally expand without loss of the nitrogen pressure blanket. A
      threaded nut 22 secures the o-ring in place. In alternative
      embodiments, alternative insulating materials and systems may be
      utilized in place of, or in addition to, the nitrogen gas layer.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] The reaction chamber within the central region of the cell
      26 is filled with a catalyst, such as, but not limited to,
      platinum coated alumina spheres 25, that are held in place by two
      stainless steel filter screens 23. In an alternative embodiment,
      other appropriate materials and/or means of positioning and
      holding the catalyst may be used. In operation, the reacted fluid
      passes out of the reaction chamber, after reacting with the
      catalyst 25, at an elevated temperature. A nozzle body 27, such as
      a threaded nozzle body, focuses the high temperature jet 28 of
      reacted fluid out of a nozzle exit 29 onto a target location on a
      rock surface. The nozzle body 27 may be, for example, screwed into
      place on the distal end of the system 31 using the two drilled
      holes 30 and a spanner wrench.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] FIGS. 3D and 3E show the system 31 in operation. Prior to
      starting the system 31, a granite block 39 is predrilled with a
      small borehole 40. A seal-interface block 36 isolates the nozzle
      27 from the coolant fluid, and provides a means for venting spalls
      and oxidation fluids/gases from the borehole. The interface block
      36 may, for example, have a cap 33 which is held in place using a
      number of screws 34. The cap retains in place a thin metal washer
      and ceramic felt pad 35 which makes a sliding seal for the system
      31, thereby preventing inflow of coolant. The interface block 36
      may be sealed to the outside using, for example, an o-ring 38. A
      jet 37 of hot reacted fluid exits the nozzle exit 29 and enters
      the predrilled borehole 40, where it spalls the rock at the distal
      end of the borehole and flows upward and out of the interface
      block through the chimney tube 32.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Another example, as depicted in FIG. 11, is a convergent
      radial flow reactor housed within a 2 7/8" OD drill head for
      producing 4" holes in granite using the laboratory test system or
      deployed on a coiled tubing unit. This system is comprised of a
      steam generation assembly 132 containing a catalyst bed 135, a
      drill head 136, and a connector 134 that couples the unit to other
      downhole subassemblies and the drill string. Unreacted fluid is
      pumped down a single capillary in the drill string, through 133,
      and into the steam generation assembly 132 where it flows through
      a catalyst bed and reacts producing reacted that exits out a
      nozzle 136. Pressures and temperatures inside the steam generation
      assembly 132 are measured at specific locations 137, 138 which can
      be used to monitor the performance of the system. Flow schematics
      of this steam generation assembly 140, 144 for a thermal
      spallation drilling system are shown in FIG. 12A and FIG. 12B. A
      converging flow design is shown in FIG. 12A. Fuel and oxidant
      enter the cell 141 and flow across a catalyst bed 142 where they
      react producing the working fluid which exits down a tube 143 to
      the drill nozzle (not shown). A diverging flow design is shown in
      FIG. 12B. Fuel and oxidant enter the cell 145 and flow across a
      catalyst bed 146 where they react producing working fluid which
      exits down and annulus which converges to a tube 147 that leads to
      a drill nozzle (not shown). For surface demonstrations of the
      drill head shown in FIG. 11, an example of a spallation drilling
      test system rock core confinement apparatus 148 is shown in FIG.
      13A, FIG. 13B, and FIG. 13C. The system can be used to simulate
      spallation drilling at the surface where there is low stress on
      the rock. The system is comprised of a steel concrete mold 149
      that encases a rock sample 156 which is surrounded by concrete
      157. A wellhead 151 is secured to the rock sample prior to the
      sample being encased in concrete. The entire system rests on a
      pallet 150 for ease of transportation. Bolts 153 on the side on
      the concrete mold 149 can be tightened after the concrete has
      hardened in order to induce a compressive stress on the rock
      sample. A drill 158 enters as shown. Cooling water or drilling mud
      is pumped through injection tubes 152 and enters the wellbore at
      injection points 154. A flow barrier 155 prevents the cooling
      water from entering the hot thermal spallation region downhole
      while the drill is in operation. Unreacted fluid is pumped into
      the drill through a tube 159 and reacted fluid exits the drill
      nozzle 160.<br>

      [0124] In an alternative embodiment, a working fluid including an
      aqueous fluid comprising water and hydroxides of Group I elements
      of The Periodic Table of Elements, and mixtures thereof, may be
      used. For example, an aqueous fluid may include a hydroxyl ion
      concentration of the hydroxides of Group I elements of The
      Periodic Table of Elements and mixtures thereof at ambient
      conditions is in the range of about 0.025 to 30 moles of hydroxyl
      ion per kilogram of water. In some embodiments, an upper limit of
      the range can be determined by the solubility of the Group I
      hydroxide. For example, a fluid may include about 0.1 to about 52
      grams sodium hydroxide per 100 grams of solution at room
      temperature (but may include more at higher temperatures). In some
      embodiments, the fluid may comprise alcohols such as methanol or
      ethanol with hydroxides, which produce alkoxides. Such alkoxides
      may help solubilize minerals in rock.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] In some embodiments, concentrated aqueous or alcohol
      solutions of hydroxides of alkali metals can react with subsurface
      rock formations and may be capable of forming one or more water
      soluble complexes with at least one of Si or Al. For
      aluminosilicate rocks, the high alkoxide or hydroxyl ion
      concentration in the fluid may provides the dual benefit of (i)
      enhancing the dissolution rate by fully ionizing the chemical
      surface groups on the formation rock, thus maximizing the density
      of surface sites vulnerable to hydrolysis, and (ii) enhancing
      solubility of reaction products by forming thermally stable
      soluble complexes. Such fluids may dissolve rock and consume
      hydroxide stochiometrically until e.g., the hydroxyl ion
      concentration drops to near 0.01 moles of hydroxyl ion per
      kilogram of water or alcohol. Materials to achieve hydroxyl ion
      concentration above 0.01 moles of hydroxyl ion per kilogram of
      water include, but are not limited to alkali metal and alkaline
      earth metal components such as hydroxides, silicates, carbonates,
      bicarbonates, mixtures thereof and the like. In example material
      is sodium hydroxide. Other solutes may be added in any desired
      quantity to achieve other objectives, as long as the hydroxyl ion
      concentration is maintained<br>

      <br>
      [0126] One aspect of the present invention relates, at least in
      part, to drilling systems, and associated methods of use, that
      includes a heat source to thermally affect a target material and a
      mechanical drilling system. The drilling systems may be used to
      create boreholes or increase the diameter of existing boreholes in
      any of the target materials described herein including, but not
      limited to, crystalline rock material, silicate rock, basalt,
      granite, sandstone, limestone, or any other rocky material. The
      drilling systems may be used to create vertical boreholes,
      horizontal boreholes, angled boreholes, curved boreholes, as well
      as slots, perforations, fracture enlargement, or other forms of
      hole opening, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, the
      methods and systems described herein provide for improved deep
      borehole drilling, for example from approximately 10,000 feet to
      approximately 50,000 feet below the surface, or more. [0127] A
      borehole may be created, for example, through the combined use of
      a heated fluid and a mechanical drilling and/or reaming or milling
      system. Combining a mechanical drilling system with e.g. a thermal
      drilling system such as those described above may overcome certain
      limitations of thermal systems alone, by, for example, the
      combination may provide for controlling stand-off and/or rate of
      penetration or bit advancement, penetrating unspallable or
      thermally-insensitive or unspallable zones, comminuting larger
      pieces of rock that may be produced or fall from the borehole
      wall, penetrating fractures which have inflowing or potential for
      outflowing fluids. Combining the use of a heat source to thermally
      affect a target material with a mechanical drilling system may
      overcome certain limitations of conventional mechanical drilling
      systems alone by, for example, preventing the wear and fatigue to
      the drill bit that is produced through traditional mechanical
      drilling technologies. More particularly, by utilizing one or more
      heat sources to thermally affect a rock portion in advance of one
      or more conventional drilling and/or milling systems, the
      mechanical and physical strength of the rock to be drilled and/or
      milled can be reduced forward of, and/or simultaneously with, the
      mechanical drilling process. This may allow for increased
      penetration rates with reduced bit wear, vibration and drill
      string fatigue, and uncontrolled trajectory deviations compared to
      conventional drilling processes. For example, new cutter materials
      such as TSP can operate at temperatures above 1000 &lt;0&gt;C, as
      shown, e.g., in FIG. 15, where hard rocks such as granites are
      significantly softened, as shown, e.g., in FIGS. 8, 9, 10, and 16.
      Therefore, a thermal jet which reduces the rock strength by, e.g.
      partially spalling and/or microfracturing and/or softening
      combined with a mechanical drilling process using a high
      temperature bit material, has the possibility of a corresponding
      ROP exceeding that of either process along. As a result, the
      efficiency of conventional mechanical drilling methods may be
      significantly increased by the use of a heat source to modify the
      properties of the rock in advance of the mechanical drilling
      system.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In one embodiment, the mechanical drilling and/or reaming
      system may, for example, include a traditional mechanical,
      chemical, or other appropriate drilling and/or reaming mechanism.
      Embodiments of the invention may, for example, incorporate any
      appropriate mechanical bit design, including, but not limited to,
      roller cone bits, tricone bits, polycrystalline diamond compact
      (PDC), reaming bits, milling bits, hammer drill bits or coring
      bits, or other appropriate drilling bits. The design of these
      bits, including cutting and rock reduction surfaces, can be
      optimized so that the depth-of-cut and rate-of-penetration can be
      maximized while keeping the wear, vibration, and trajectory
      deviations within acceptable limits. Materials and novel designs,
      including high temperature metals and alternative methods for
      inclusion of cutting surfaces, may be optimized for use under
      these relatively high temperature conditions. The use of high
      temperatures may also allow for the use of ultra-hard materials
      that tend to be brittle at lower temperatures. In an alternative
      embodiment, the drilling system may include other physical or
      chemical processes such as, but not limited to, sonication, sonic
      drilling, laser drilling, arc/plasma, particle assisted drilling,
      chemical dissolution, or other appropriate physical or chemical
      processes of use in drilling applications in addition to, or in
      place of, a mechanical drilling system.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] In order to thermally affect the rock to be drilled and/or
      reamed or milled by the mechanical drilling system, one or more
      heat sources may additionally be incorporated into the system.
      This heat source may include any appropriate heat source adapted
      to thermally affect a rock through spallation, microfracturing,
      macrofracturing, dissolution, partial melting, softening,
      modification of grain boundaries, change in crystalline phase,
      decrystallization, erosion, or the like. For example, certain
      materials such as shales and clays may be modified (e.g.,
      dehydrated at high temperatures) to reduce or eliminate bit
      baling.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] In one embodiment of the invention, a combined thermal and
      mechanical borehole creation system may include a spallation
      drilling mechanism, such as, but not limited to, any of the
      thermal spallation systems described herein, with mechanical
      drilling mechanism such as, but not limited to, a drilling,
      reaming, milling, and/or hole opening process. A downhole chemical
      reaction (e.g. hydrothermal oxidation of methanol and peroxide
      over a catalyst) may provide both thermal energy as well as the
      mechanical energy (e.g. expansion of the hot fluid to e.g. drive a
      hammer).<br>
      <br>
      [0131] In one embodiment, a small pilot borehole may be formed,
      e.g. with the thermally produced pilot borehole being
      substantially smaller than the target diameter of the final
      borehole. The pilot borehole may thereafter be milled, drilled, or
      otherwise enlarged, by a mechanical system such as a reaming
      system, or other appropriate hole opening system, to form the
      final borehole of the required diameter. This method may, for
      example, allow for more precise control of borehole geometry, and
      provide substantial cost and time benefits for producing the final
      reamed borehole. The pilot hole may serve as a guide, stay, or
      centralizer for the reaming bit. In addition, removal of rock from
      the circumference of a lead borehole (that has been created by
      spallation system) through a reaming process may be, for example,
      faster, easier, and/or produce less bit wear than traditional
      drilling of the entire borehole. The spallation drilling mechanism
      and reaming mechanism may be part of a single device, or be
      separate devices. The pilot borehole may be used, for example, as
      an exploratory, test, monitoring, or scientific borehole to e.g.
      determine the quality of the resource and evaluate if a larger
      borehole should be created.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] The use of a working fluid for e.g., creation of a lead
      borehole, may affect one or more properties (e.g. a thermal,
      mechanical, chemical or physical property) of the material at the
      surface of the pilot borehole wall. This may, in turn, make it
      easier for the reaming system to ream the surface of the lead
      borehole to create the final borehole. In one embodiment, the
      reaming operation may also remove rock that is not structurally
      stable. Such rock could, if not removed, fall into the hole,
      bridge the hole, or form ledges that prevent the advance of casing
      or stick the casing before it is on-depth. Bridges that form in
      the casing annulus can e.g. divert or disrupt the placement of
      cement which may jeopardize the success of well completion. The
      reduced mechanical strength of the thermally affected zone, if not
      removed, may also reduce the overall integrity of a completed
      well.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] In each of the embodiments described above, a working
      fluid, such as those described herein, may be used to weaken
      and/or remove the rock at a distal end of a borehole prior to, or
      simultaneously with, the drilling, reaming, and/or milling action
      of a mechanical bit coupled to the thermal spallation system. In
      different embodiments of the invention, a working fluid can be
      configured to spall or thermally affect the entire bottom surface
      of the distal end of the borehole. In an alternative embodiment,
      the thermally- affected zone produced by a working fluid does not
      cover the entire surface under the drill bit. Rather, the fluid
      stream can be directed so as to target certain regions under the
      bit to be weakened. Damage to or removal of these regions can
      cause structural weakening of the remainder of the surface so that
      it may be easily removed by a separate feature on the drill bit.
      In another embodiment, a working fluid may be focused toward the
      sides of the borehole, with or without additional working fluid
      being focused toward the bottom of the borehole.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] In various embodiments of the invention, the mechanical
      drilling and/or milling or reaming operation may be carried out
      concurrently with a thermal drilling operation, e.g. use of a
      working fluid. For example, a mechanical drilling/reaming element
      may be located either substantially close to the thermal treatment
      operation and/or substantially offset along the drilling assembly,
      thereby allowing the mechanical drilling process to be carried out
      concurrently, or substantially concurrently, with a thermal
      drilling operation. The mechanical drilling elements, (e.g. drill
      bits or reaming bits) may therefore remove the thermally modified
      portion of the geological formation and/or thermally unmodified
      rock surrounding the thermally modified rock, thereby creating the
      borehole and, in some embodiments, improving the geometry or
      integrity of a wall of the borehole created by the spallation
      system or other thermal treatment system.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] The system may be adapted to remove both spalled or
      thermally affected rock and non-spallable rock. In addition, the
      system may be adapted to reduce the size of rock pieces that are
      too large to be removed from the borehole in a circulating fluid.
      As a result, the mechanical drilling system, in combination with
      the thermal treatment system, may be used to create boreholes in a
      number of different geological formations including a number of
      different properties. For example, a coiled tubing deployed
      thermal spallation drill head can be combined with a coiled tubing
      deployed mud-motor drill; in formations where the thermal
      spallation process is not effective, the mud motor may be used to
      turn a conventional coiled tubing drill bit. Likewise, a drill
      pipe deployed hydraulically driven turbo-generator can be used to
      produce electricity for resistance heating elements used to
      initiate thermal spallation or treatment of the rock. A
      thermally-stable rotary drill bit serves to maintain proper
      stand-off of the jet during pure spallation drilling, assist in
      some sections via thermomechanical drilling, and be the sole
      mechanism for drilling in others. This is particularly
      advantageous over prior, uncoupled, systems, wherein, for example,
      a thermal treatment or thermal drilling system may need to be
      removed from the borehole if unspallable rock is found at the
      bottom of the borehole, or created by over-heating the rock, and
      temporarily replaced by a mechanical drilling system. This removal
      of a drilling system, and insertion of another type of drilling
      system, whenever materials with different properties are met may
      be extremely costly and time consuming. By coupling a thermal
      system with a mechanical system within a single drilling system,
      the need to replace the system when different materials are met
      may be avoided.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] In an alternative embodiment, the mechanical drilling
      process may be performed as a secondary operation while some
      tubing or pipe remains in the hole. In a further embodiment, the
      mechanical drilling process may be performed as a secondary
      operation after the thermal drilling assembly has been removed. In
      one embodiment, different processes, such as a thermal drilling
      process and a mechanical drilling and/or reaming process, may be
      performed concurrently along different portions of a single casing
      interval or wellbore.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] In one embodiment, one or more thermal treatment nozzles
      can be distributed throughout the front of a mechanical drill bit,
      or through slots radially extending from an outlet port. The
      nozzles can also be shrouded with a protective gas or fluid stream
      to reduce cooling and mixing with the drilling fluid and/or
      increase the potential for thermally damaging the rock surface.
      Gas shrouds, fluid streams, solid insulation such as a ceramic or
      syntactic ceramic, vacuum gaps, or gas or fluid filled gaps can
      also be used to protect the materials of construction or
      mechanical drilling equipment from high temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] In one embodiment, the drilling process includes rotary or
      coiled tubing drilling. As a result, a thermal jet, or a portion
      thereof, may be configured to rotate. In an alternative
      embodiment, one or more thermal jets, or a portion thereof, may be
      fixed, for example, through either a center or peripheral ring
      jet.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] In some of the embodiments described herein, a thermal
      system including a single nozzle may be incorporated into a
      mechanical drilling system. The single nozzle may be located
      centrally along a central elongate axis of the system. As a
      result, the thermal system may include a fixed, non-rotating,
      structure. A mechanical drilling and/or reaming or milling
      mechanism may then by positioned over or in the thermal system,
      and rotate around or in the thermal system, to mechanically drill
      and/or ream the borehole being created in conjunction with the
      thermal system. Providing a single, centrally located,
      non-rotating thermal system may be advantageous, for example, in
      simplifying the structure of the system by reducing the number of
      necessary moving parts and reducing the mechanical complexity of
      the overall system. This may, for example, reduce the cost of the
      system while also allowing for a more structurally sound and
      sturdy borehole creating tool. In one embodiment, by minimizing
      the moving parts within the thermal system, stronger and more
      robust materials may be used in the construction of the thermal
      system, and the resulting structure may therefore be better
      adapted to withstand the high pressures, temperatures, impact, and
      mechanical wear that are generated at the bottom of a borehole
      during drilling operations. [0140] In one embodiment, a heat
      source may be incorporated into a mechanical drilling system such
      that the distal end of the mechanical drilling system extends a
      specified distance from the distal end of the heat source. As a
      result, the impingement of the distal end of the mechanical
      drilling system against the target portion of the rock results in
      the substantially constant stand-off distance between the rock
      surface and the heat source. This may be advantageous, for
      example, in applications where a set distance is required between
      the target surface and the distal end of the heat source to ensure
      that the temperature, flow, and heat flux produced at the surface
      of the target portion of the rock is within the required limits
      for efficient spallation. Also provided herein are methods that
      may achieve e.g., softening of rock at a radius proportional to
      the wear rate of e.g. mechanical cutters such that the life of the
      cutters is more uniform.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] An example drilling system is shown in FIG. 3A and FIG. 3B.
      In this embodiment, the drilling system 400 includes a pilot hole
      thermal spalling system 54 and borehole reamer 55 in conjunction
      with coiled tube drill rig system 410. The pilot hole thermal
      spalling system 54 is powered by a fuel and oxidant fed through a
      nested tube 42 contained in a motor driven shaft 41. The reactants
      move through the assembly to a pilot drill reaction chamber 47.
      The reaction chamber 47 is filled with a catalyst to initiate a
      thermal reaction with the fluid passing therethrough to change at
      least one property of the fluid such as, but not limited to, a
      temperature, a pressure, or a state of the fluid. In one example,
      the reaction between the fluid and the catalyst increases the
      temperature and decreases the density of the fluid. As a result of
      the thermal reaction, a jet 50 of hot gases/liquids is directed
      out of a nozzle 49 at the distal end of the chamber 47. The
      reaction chamber 47 may, in one embodiment, be thermally insulated
      from the main body by, e.g. a gas filled cavity 48. The exit jet
      50 spalls the rock at the distal end of the borehole, thereby
      drilling a hole in the rock 52 and creating a damaged zone 51
      around the bore.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] The spalled rock can then be carried away from the target
      location at the end of the borehole by the recirculating fluid or
      drilling mud within the borehole. The nozzle portion 49 may, in
      one embodiment, be constructed from a high temperature resistant
      material such as, but not limited to, at least one of a ceramic,
      ceramic composite, high temperature steel alloy, or the like.
      [0143] The pilot spallation sub assembly 54 is attached to a
      rotating reamer sub-assembly 55 which carves away the damaged
      rock. The reamer 55 has multiple blades 43 having attached carbide
      or diamond compacts 44 to cut away at the damaged rock zone 51.
      Coolant, such as, but not limited to, a water or drilling mud, may
      be introduced just below the reamer blades 43 with imbedded
      compacts 44 through one or more outlets 45 to help cool the
      assembly and remove cuttings.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] In one embodiment, where the system is attached to a coiled
      tube drill rig 410, the downhole assembly, or a portion thereof,
      may need to be rotated through the use of a downhole motor 56
      attached, for example, to a connector 57 and then to the nested
      coiled tube 66 and powered by high pressure fluid supplied by
      surface pumps 70.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] The hard rock 58 found at depth can be effectively drilled
      by this system. In one embodiment, shallow depth rock 59 can be
      drilled, cased 61, and cemented 60 to prevent loss or introduction
      of fluid during drilling. Drilling fluids including drilling mud
      water and spalls are removed from the borehole through a flow line
      62 to be separated and possibly recirculated. A rubber packoff in
      a stripper head 63 diverts the returns into the flow line away
      from the drill rig 410. On the surface, the coiled tube rig 400
      contains a coiled tubing injector 64a which is used to drive the
      coiled tube within the borehole, a tube straightener 64b and a
      gooseneck 65 which is used to guide the tubing from the injector
      64 into or off of the reel 67. Fluid, including e.g. reactants,
      can be fed in from a source 69 through a rotating coupling 68 into
      the reel assembly 67.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] One example drilling system may include a drill string
      based thermally assisted tricone drilling system. An example
      thermally assisted tricone drilling system 500 is shown in FIGS.
      5A-5C. In this embodiment, heat to power a downhole spallation
      system such as, for example, a hydrothermal spallation drill
      system, can be provided by electrical resistance heating. A
      tricone bit 510 is incorporated into a distal end of the drilling
      system 500. In one embodiment, the tricone bit 510 has multiple
      rotating rollers 80a which incorporate hard segments, constructed,
      for example, from carbide, steel or ceramic segments, that are
      used to grind and wear away at the rock and are held in place by
      sleeve or roller bearings 80b. <br>
      <br>
      [0147] In one embodiment, electrical power may be generated using
      a downhole turbine 83 in conjunction with an electrical generator
      82. Power from the generator 82 is carried to a heater 75 through
      one or more power cables 71. Water 72 is pumped into the heater
      and boiled producing superheated fluid at high pressure that is
      ejected through one or more nozzles 79 in the drill bit. The
      heater 75 may include an insulating gap 74, as described above.
      Drilling mud and/or coolant is pumped down through an annular
      region 73 and into the borehole through one or more conduits 78. A
      surface assembly 90 may be attached to the tricone bit 510. The
      surface assembly 90 may include a conductor pipe and conductor
      casing 87 cemented in place 86 in a surface rock portion 85 to
      protect the potable water zones and provide a high pressure seal
      to the earth. A segmented drill string 88 is driven into the
      ground and rotated by the drill rig 90 and connected to a drilling
      fluid circulating pump 91.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] In alternative embodiments of the invention, a drilling
      system may include a spallation system, such as any of the
      spallation systems described herein, coupled to other types of
      mechanical drill bit, such as a PDC drill bit, diamond-
      impregnated coring bit, or hammer drill bit. Example drilling
      systems including a thermal spallation system coupled to various
      drill bits are shown in FIGS. 6-8B.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] For example, FIG. 5 shows a PDC bit 600 incorporating a
      spallation system such as a hydrothermal spallation system. In
      this embodiment, fluid, including water, fuel, and oxidant, is
      introduced through an inlet tube 92 into a reaction chamber 95.
      The reaction chamber 95 may be insulated by, e.g. a pressurized
      air gap 96. Upon passing into the chamber 95, the reactants within
      the fluid contact a catalyst located within the chamber 95 and
      react, producing high temperature reacted fluid. The reacted fluid
      exits through one or more openings 100 as jets directed against a
      target rock face. The spallation system is contained in the drill
      body 94 of the PDC bit 600 and connected to a drill string at a
      threaded tool joint or threaded connection 93. Drilling mud or
      coolant is pumped down through an annular gap 97 and down to one
      or more outlet feeders 101 and vents 102 close to the bottom of
      the drill bit 600. Rotation of the bit engages flutes 98 mounted
      on which the compacts 99, such as, but not limited to carbide or
      PDC compacts, cut away at the thermally affected target rock
      surface. The compacts 99 are cutting elements set in the matrix of
      the bit body on ridges, sometimes called blades, with flutes
      between the blades for mud flow and cuttings passage to the
      annulus. <br>
      <br>
      [0150] In an exemplary embodiment, nozzles 100 leading a PDC drill
      bit 600 may be sized to soften the rock just ahead of each cutter
      element (compacts) 99. Drilling through the presoftened rock will
      reduce the wear on the tool 600, especially the compacts 99.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] FIGS. 7 A and 7B show a drilling system 700 including an
      abrasive/grinding bit incorporating a hydrothermal spallation
      system. In this embodiment, water is pumped downhole through an
      opening 103 in a segmented drill string 104 into a downhole
      turbine or motor 105 located within a subassembly 106. The motor
      105 is connected by a shaft to a water cooled rotating magnet
      assembly 107 contained within a housing 108. The magnet assembly
      107 surrounds a non-rotating metal core 109 having a series of
      holes to allow a fluid to flow therethrough to remove heat
      generated by induction from the rotating magnets 107. This
      resulting super-heated fluid exits into a chamber 110 which may be
      insulated by an air gap 111 from a coolant fluid channel 112. The
      heated fluid exits through one or more nozzles 113 to interact
      with a target rock surface. Coolant is directed from coolant exit
      ports 114. An abrasive material, such as, but not limited to
      diamond, are surface set into or impregnated in a plurality of
      cutter segments (pads) 115. In operation, the super-heated fluid
      exiting the nozzles 113 and impinges upon the target rock surface,
      thereby damaging the rock and assisting the cutting of the rock by
      the cutter segments (pads) 115.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] FIGS. 8 A and 8B show a drilling system 800 including a
      thermal spallation system coupled to a hammer drill bit. In
      general, a hammer drill is a drill with a hammering action. The
      hammering action provides a short, rapid hammer thrust to
      pulverize relatively brittle material and provide quicker drilling
      with less effort. In one embodiment, the hammer drill may
      additionally include a rotating motion that may be used separately
      or in combination with the hammering motion. When used in the
      hammer mode, the tool provides a drilling function similar to a
      jackhammer.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] In the embodiment of FIGS. 8 A and 8B, coolant and/or
      drilling fluid is introduced into a bit 800 through a drill string
      connector 116 (e.g. a connection to a drilling assembly that
      includes drill collars to provide a hammer with a large and stiff
      inertial load to push off of.) The drill string connector 116
      connects to the drill assembly. An upper valve plunger 118 and
      return spring 119 is integrated into the hammer bit 800 to rapidly
      press a driver 121 into an anvil 124, thereby driving the distal
      end of the anvil 124 from a distal end 128 of the bit 800 to
      transmit a blow to a target rock surface. The driver 121 may
      include seals 120, 122, and a return spring 123. The anvil 124 is
      attached to the body of the bit 800 through a guide nut 125, which
      also prevents rotation of the bit. Integral to the anvil 124 is a
      thermal combustion chamber 127 which is fed a fluid including a
      fuel, water, and an oxidant from the surface through a separate
      tube 117. The combustion chamber 127 may be thermally insulated
      through, for example, a pressurized air gap 126. Hot fluid/gas
      exits the chamber 127 through one or more jets 131 distributed
      across the drill face. The distal end of the drill bit 128 is
      cooled by water or drilling mud exiting through exit ports 129.
      Stress to the thermally altered rock is created by the hammering
      action combined with drill string rotation through the carbide
      buttons 130.<br>
      <br>
      [0154] In other embodiments, improved well control may also be
      achieved through the use of a hydrostatic column of a fluid such
      as, but not limited to, water or geothermal drilling mud, to
      increase hydrostatic pressure e.g. to balance formation pressure
      in exposed formation using, e.g., deep surface or intermediate
      casing and high pressure blowout prevention equipment installed on
      a wellhead. Thermal spallation, coupled with high velocity liquid
      flow through nozzles, may produce high pressure jets, pulsating
      jets or abrasive jets to produce a dual spallation/jet drilling
      system. Such dual systems may include a combination of hot and
      cold jets or include operating spallation jets at higher flow
      rates than needed to produce spallation (and thus have a jet
      drilling process substantially directly ahead of the nozzle and a
      spallation process in the wall jet that forms beyond the radius of
      the jet produced hole.). For example, the use of high temperature
      fluids may greatly reduce the pressure required to achieve jet
      drilling in high strength rock. Additionally, the use of fluids
      with temperatures below the brittle-ductile transition of the rock
      may prevent the rock from being overheated and becoming
      unspallable. Alternatively, the rock may be heated above the
      ductile-brittle transition far enough to soften the rock enough
      that it can be swept away or drilled like soft to medium
      sediments. This may be advantageous, for example, for materials,
      such as basalts, which are typically less prone to spallation and
      not significantly damaged by heating to a temperature below the
      ductile-brittle transition.<br>
      <br>
      [0155] A thermal degradation process or spallation formation may
      not be used continuously. Rather, certain embodiments of the
      invention may include pulsed heat treatment, such as a cyclically
      pulsed heat treatment. In a further alternative embodiment, the
      heat treatment may be alternated with a cooling treatment. Such
      alternation may increase the damage to the rock or may help
      moderate the temperature of the drilling mechanism and materials
      of construction while still imparting high temperature, at times,
      against the rock surface. In one embodiment, the thermal
      spallation jet(s), or other appropriate heat source, may be
      activated and turned off as required, thereby allowing the use of
      the spallation system to assist in the penetration through certain
      sections of a target rock, while allowing the thermal spallation
      process to be turned off when penetrating other sections or target
      rock, for example where thermal spallation is either not required
      or advantageous.<br>
      <br>
      [0156] One embodiment of the invention includes a drill bit design
      for use with a thermally assisted mechanical drilling method. In
      one embodiment, for example in very deep/hot formations, the
      thermal treatment can be a cooling process, where a very low
      temperature jet causes microfracture of the surface through a
      reduction in temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] In one embodiment, the bulk of the fluid flow through the
      drilling assembly - e.g. the portion used for cooling and cuttings
      lift - may be relatively cool, while only a small portion - e.g.
      that used for thermal degradation - is hot. As a result, some, or
      all, of the cold fluid can be used to provide cooling to at least
      a portion of the drilling device. For example, cold fluid may be
      sent through or around the mechanical drilling structure to reduce
      its temperature and improve survivability. In one embodiment, cold
      water may be sent through flow channels in a traditional PDC or
      tricone bit, while the hot portion of the fluid is insulated
      directed substantially down against the rock. The channels
      transporting the hot water may be isolated from the bit by a layer
      of insulation, such as, but not limited to, a substantially solid,
      liquid, gas, or vacuum insulation layer, or a combination of the
      different insulation layers. In one embodiment, the relative ratio
      of hot/cold can be adjusted to balance the performance of the two
      drilling mechanisms.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] One embodiment of the invention includes a spallation
      system including control systems, and associated methods, adapted,
      for example, to control the diameter of the wellbore produced by a
      e.g., hydro thermal jet, maintain the desired well hole
      trajectory, control the distance between the nozzle and the bottom
      of the hole (i.e. the "stand-off), and/or ensure a sufficient
      temperature differential so as to induce spallation. These control
      systems may include software and/or hardware based control
      elements designed to ensure optimum performance of the thermal
      drilling system. [0159] Disclosed methods may include introducing
      a flow of water into the borehole. This flow of water may be used,
      for example, to at least partially form an ascending fluid stream
      to carry loose material such as, but not limited to, the spalled,
      drilled, or otherwise loose rock from the bottom of the borehole.
      The returning fluid may also travel up the borehole in reverse
      circulation, e.g., where the fluid can be directed upward through
      a separate tube or annulus in the main drill string. The water
      flow may also be used to provide cooling for one or more parts of
      the system and/or surrounding rock. The provided cooling may be
      produced by at least one of temperature cycling, thermal
      protection, and a circulated cooling fluid.<br>
      <br>
      [0160] In one embodiment, a heat exchanger may be coupled to a
      portion of the system above the nozzle of the thermal spallation
      system. This heat exchanger may be used, for example, to exchange
      heat between a working or heating fluid (e.g. a reacted fluid),
      spallation fluid, and loose material ascending through the
      borehole and the fluid being pumped to the thermal spallation
      system, e.g. an unreacted fluid, within a conduit extending from
      the surface to the thermal spallation system.<br>
      <br>
      [0161] In one embodiment, one or more of properties of working
      fluid and jet may be selected to ensure that that the required
      conditions are met for optimum spallation. These jet properties
      may include, but are not limited to, a temperature, a heat flux,
      an exciting jet velocity, a heat capacity, a heat transfer
      coefficient, a Reynolds number, a Nusselt number, a density, a
      viscosity, and/or e.g., a mass flow rate. For example, these
      properties may be obtained through selection of the specific
      fluids used, by mixing of multiple fluids, and/or by treatment of
      the fluid through heating, cooling, pressurizing, chemically
      treating, or otherwise adjusting the composition of the working
      fluid. Exemplary ranges, without being limiting, for a thermal
      system for borehole creation from 1,000-30,000 feet, using a
      working fluid, may include those provided in Table 1 below. Such
      parameters may be determined by using a disclosed working fluid in
      several different or similar rock formations, as exemplified
      below, and assessing preferable ranges.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 1: Example property ranges
        for Hydrothermal Spallation drilling of boreholes.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="table1.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      [0162] For example, a temperature at least that of the onset of
      rapid thermal spallation but below the, e.g. brittle ductile
      transition of the rock may be maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] The total heat output - the thermal power of the drill
      divided by the cross sectional area of the borehole to be drilled
      - may be kept, for example, between 0.1 and 100 MW/m2. The heat
      flux - a product of the heat transfer coefficient and the
      temperature difference between the wall jet and the rock surface -
      may be kept, for example, between 0.1 and 100 MW/m . In certain
      embodiments, if too low a value of heat flux is used, a thermal
      gradient may propagate and build in the rock, reducing the
      relative strain of the surface rock to the underlying layer,
      thereby reducing or preventing spallation. In one embodiment, it
      is possible to increase the heat flux by increasing the Reynolds
      number - a dimensionless number that gives a measure of the ratio
      of inertial forces to viscous forces - in the nozzle exit. In
      certain embodiments, the heat flux of a thermal jet for spallation
      drilling may be increased without having the jet exceed the
      temperature e.g. brittle-ductile transition of the rock, by
      increasing the mass flow, and/or reducing the nozzle diameter (to
      increase the exiting jet velocity). Increasing the velocity or
      mass flow of the jet may also provide a mechanical or erosive
      means of removing material or spalls from the rock surface,
      clearing and providing a freshly exposed surface for further
      spallation, and/or help with spall and cuttings lift.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] The Nusselt number - a dimensionless ratio of convective to
      conductive heat transfer across (normal to) the rock-fluid
      boundary - may, in a non-limiting example, for a working fluid in
      one or more of the disclosed systems, be between about 30 and
      1040, depending on hole size. In one embodiment, working fluid
      properties can be optimized so as to produce an induced strain
      within the grains of the rock of between about 0-30%, thereby
      generating enough stress to cause structural failure, which may
      make use of existing flaws, discontinuities, or grain boundaries
      in the rock and/or in-situ stresses<br>
      <br>
      [0165] Spall sizes may, in one embodiment, be optimized so that
      80% of the transported spalls maintain a range of 0.001-3 mm. If
      the produced spalls are too large, they may not be lifted by the
      drilling fluid and may plug small openings in heat exchangers and
      internal returns tubes used in reverse circulation. If the
      produced spalls are too small, it may be an indication that the
      heat flux is too high, causing excessive microfracturing beyond
      what is needed for drilling and cuttings lift, thereby wasting
      energy and sacrificing efficiency, as well as increasing mineral
      dissolution. Spall size may also be controlled to help plug
      fractures leading to lost circulation or intrusion of fluids
      during drilling, or to attempt not to plug fractures in producing
      zones during e.g. hole opening for enhanced wellbore impedance.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] In one embodiment, at least one property of the spalls
      and/or working fluid (e.g. reacted fluid) may be monitored to
      provide information relating to the spallation process. For
      example, the spall size, shape, chemical composition, and/or
      number of created spalls may be monitored to provide information
      on the efficiency of a spallation process. In addition, or in the
      alternative, one or more properties of the reacted fluid may be
      monitored to provide information on the efficiency of the
      catalytic reaction between the unreacted fluid and the catalyst.
      By monitoring one or more of these properties, information on the
      spallation process, such as, but not limited to, the efficiency of
      the heating reaction, the rate of spallation, the composition of
      the spalled rock, the temperature of the fluid leaving the nozzle,
      and/or the heat flux at the target surface may be deduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0167] In an embodiment, the properties of the fluids may be used
      to inform the adjustment or addition of any additives into the
      unreacted or cooling-lift water streams. Such additives may
      include cleaning agents (e.g. to remove deposits from a catalyst,
      nozzle or heat exchanger), and additives that increase or decrease
      tendencies for materials in returning fluids to crystallize,
      precipitate, or agglomerate. Contemplated cleaning agents may
      include solids that are significantly abrasive to unwanted
      deposits but not to the ceramic or metal of the nozzle. A cleaning
      agent may be added continuously to a flow, or sent down
      periodically. Additives may also assist in the opening of existing
      fractures in production zones, or by preventing the produced
      spalls and minerals from plugging the existing fractures by e.g.
      mineral redeposition.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] The monitoring may be carried out using at least one of a
      thermal measurement, an optical measurement, an acoustic
      measurement, a chemical measurement, and a mechanical measurement
      (e.g. a flow meter). For example, a laser-based optical system may
      be used to measure one or more properties of the spalls exiting
      the borehole. In alternative embodiment, any appropriate
      measurement device may be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] If a change in one or more properties is observed, a
      property of the fluid and/or spallation system may be adjusted to
      compensate for the observed change and ensure optimum spallation.
      This adjustment may be made, for example, by adjusting one or more
      properties of the unreacted fluid being sent down the borehole to
      adjust the fluid temperature and/or heat flux created by the
      spallation process to maintain e.g., a pre-determined spall size.
      The unreacted fluid may be adjusted by changing a parameter such
      as, but not limited to, a chemical composition, a fluid mixture, a
      pressure, and/or a temperature. [0170] In one embodiment, control
      of the Reynolds number of the fluid jet at the exit of the nozzle
      by, e.g. controlling the mass flow exiting the nozzle, controlling
      the nozzle size, and/or controlling the viscosity of the fluid,
      may assist in controlling the heat flux at the surface of the rock
      at the target location.<br>
      <br>
      [0171] The spalls and/or reacted fluid may be monitored at the
      surface (i.e. after traveling from the distal end of the borehole
      to the surface in the ascending fluid stream). In an alternative
      embodiment, the spalls and/or reacted fluid may be monitored at a
      location part way down the borehole and/or at the distal end of
      the borehole. In one embodiment the spalls and/or reacted fluid
      are monitored at a single location. In an alternative embodiment,
      the spalls and/or reacted fluid are monitored at multiple
      locations.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] One embodiment disclosed herein includes a method for
      excavation of a borehole in a geological formation by using a heat
      source, such as, but not limited to, a thermal drilling system to
      create a pilot borehole in a geological formation, measuring at
      least one property of the geology of the pilot borehole,
      evaluating the at least one measured property to determine whether
      to enlarge the pilot borehole, and enlarging the pilot borehole if
      the at least one measured property meets a set requirement. The
      pilot borehole may be enlarged by inserting at least one of a
      spallation drilling system and a mechanical drilling system into
      the pilot borehole.<br>
      <br>
      [0173] This method may be advantageous in situations where a pilot
      borehole is to be formed in order to test the properties of the
      geology to determine whether further drilling and completion is
      warranted. The smaller pilot borehole is cheaper to drill than a
      larger diameter borehole, but may still allow access to the
      subterranean geology for testing. The pilot borehole may also be
      used as a guide hole for the larger borehole drilling, and may
      weaken the structure of the rock surrounding the pilot borehole to
      facilitate easier drilling of the larger borehole.<br>
      <br>
      [0174] The evaluating step may include evaluating whether the
      geological formation is suitable for use as, for example, an
      injection or production borehole for at least one of a geothermal
      system, oil and gas, mining, excavation, or CO2 or nuclear
      sequestration or storage. As discussed above, one or more
      properties of the geology of the pilot borehole may be evaluated
      by evaluating at least one property of spalls and/or the fluid
      (e.g. the reacted spallation fluid, a cooling fluid, and a
      drilling mud) exiting the borehole. In various embodiment, any of
      the drilling systems described herein may be used to create the
      pilot borehole and/or larger borehole.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Self-Casing</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0175] The fluids used in the systems described herein, and/or the
      loose materials created by the process described herein, can, in
      one embodiment, strengthen and seal the walls against structural
      collapse and wellbore fluid loss, thereby greatly extending time
      interval between casing of the borehole. This may happen through
      processes such as, but not limited to, precipitation of materials
      on the surface walls of the borehole and/or depositing of loose
      materials within cracks and other cavities on the walls of the
      borehole.<br>
      <br>
      [0176] In some applications, however, it may be desirable to
      install casing in addition to any self-casing processes produced
      by the systems and methods described herein. For larger diameter
      borehole, for example, casing may be accomplished employing
      conventional telescoping casing strings using methods familiar to
      those skilled in the art. For small diameter boreholes, the slim
      borehole can be cased, for example, using an expandable casing
      string that is inserted into the borehole and then radially
      expanded. The casing may be made of a malleable material, and when
      it is placed in the borehole, it can be radially expanded against
      the borehole wall upon application of an internal radial load.<br>
      <br>
      [0177] The examples which follow are intended in no way to limit
      the scope of this invention but are provided to illustrate the
      methods and apparatus of the present invention. Many other
      embodiments of this invention will be apparent to one skilled in
      the art.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 1</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0178] An example method of testing the efficiency of a thermal
      spallation system is described below. This method may be used to
      test any appropriate spallation system on a material.<br>
      <br>
      [0179] In the embodiment of Example 1, a Sierra White granite rock
      core measuring 4" in diameter and 6" long was prepared by
      pre-drilling a 0.75" diameter hole 0.5" deep on the top surface.
      The core was then loaded into a stainless steel pressure vessel. A
      preheater was assembled by winding a 20' long section of 0.125" ID
      stainless steel tubing in a machined groove around a 4" brass
      block in which contained a series of rod heaters. <br>
      <br>
      [0180] The thermal spallation system included a 0.5" ID x 3" long
      catalyst chamber which exits through a single, 0.09" diameter
      non-rotating nozzle located along the central axis. The catalyst
      chamber is filled to a height of roughly 1.5" with 0.5% platinum
      on 1/16" spheres having a surface area of 100 m&lt;2&gt;/g. A
      series of stainless steel screens, spacers, and diffusers allow
      fluid to pass through while holding the catalyst bed in place. The
      drill head is insulated from surrounding cooling water by a 0.040"
      gap pressurized with nitrogen.<br>
      <br>
      [0181] Before the start of a test, the drill head is driven to the
      bottom of the predrilled hole and a depth is read off of a dial
      indicator. The drill head is then retracted approximately 1.5"
      from the bottom of the hole into a large cooling water chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0182] The hydrostatic pressure in the vessel is then raised to
      1600 PSI by means of a backpressure dome regulator. An axial load
      of 6000 PSI and confining pressure of 3000 PSI are applied by
      separate pumps acting upon the core to simulate deep geological
      formation conditions. An air actuated pump is used to deliver 3
      g/s of a 20% by volume methanol in deionized water through the
      preheater which raises the temperature of the unreacted fluid to
      250-300 &lt;0&gt;C. A high pressure oxygen flow is metered into
      the preheated aqueous methanol solution at sub-stoichiometric
      ratios.<br>
      <br>
      [0183] The thermal spallation system may use a methyl alcohol
      fuel, and an O2 oxidant. The aqueous methanol/02 solution travels
      through the spacers, screens, and diffuser and over or through the
      catalyst bed. The catalyst is not preheated and does not need an
      additional heat source such as a glow plug, spark, or flame for
      the reaction to initiated or maintained. The substantially
      flameless catalytic oxidation of the methanol produces heat within
      the water which raises the temperature of the fluid to 800-900
      &lt;0&gt;C.<br>
      <br>
      [0184] The high temperature fluid exiting the nozzle into the
      cooling chamber is initially diverted and cooled by a 4 GPM water
      flow. The flow of aqueous methanol is increased to 9 g/s over 2
      minutes while simultaneously adjusting the oxygen flow. The drill
      head is then driven by a high pressure fluid pump at a rate of
      1.0'Vmin through a stainless steel seal, isolating it from the
      cooling water, and into the predrilled hole to a standoff of 0.25"
      from the rock surface, as measured by the dial indicator. The
      displacement of the drill head is then reduced to 0.5"/min. The
      drill head penetrates into the rock until it reaches the full
      stroke of the equipment, roughly 1.5" below the predrilled rock
      surface. In one embodiment, the drill head is then held at this
      position to demonstrate the ability of the center jet nozzle to
      drill in advance of the drill head and under ream. In an
      alternative embodiment, the drill head need not be held
      consistently at the bottom. Fluid and spalls exit the borehole
      into the cooling water above the rock via a 0.189" tube
      approximately 1.5" in length. The bulk fluid then passes through a
      series of screens which remove the bulk of the spalls before the
      bulk fluid passes the back pressure dome regulator and then
      through a low pressure hydrocyclone to remove very small size
      spalls. The spalls from may be separated from the bulk fluid by
      filtering through a 200 mesh screen which retained approximately
      88% of mass of the excavated rock. Size analysis may be performed
      by laser light scattering.<br>
      <br>
      [0185] After being held for 10 minutes at this depth, the drill
      head is rapidly retracted through the borehole seal, allowing
      cooling water to fill the hole and the jet to be diverted,
      quenching the spallation process. Aqueous methanol and oxygen flow
      rates are gradually reduced and the preheater is turned off.<br>
      <br>
      [0186] The sample may then be removed from the cell. The volume of
      excavated rock may thereafter be determined from the mass of water
      required to fill the volume of the new borehole, less the volume
      of the predrilled hole. The rock core may then be dried and
      weighed. A image of a rock core sectioned axially following the
      test with the drill head that produced the borehole is shown in
      FIG. 17. A graph showing spalled particle size distribution for
      the system of Example 1 can be seen in FIG. 21.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 2 Repeatability and Other
        Rock Types</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0187] An experiment as in Example 1 was been repeated on Sierra
      White Granite, as shown in Table 2:<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table 2: Additional hydrothermal

      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="table2.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      [0188] The process was conducted on other rock types including
      Sioux Quartzite, Wausau Granite, Berea Sandstone, and
      granodiorites, as shown in Table 3, as well as Barre, and Westerly
      granites:<br>

      </div>
      [0189] Other tests were conducted on Sierra White Granite while
      independently varying a number of parameters including
      temperature, mass flow, axial stress, confining stress, nozzle
      diameter, jet velocity, heat flux, rate of drill head
      displacement. Table 1, above, indicates determined parameters used
      to enable hydrothermal spallation in one embodiment of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0190] Other tests following Example 1 were conducted with
      hydrostatic pressures including near ambient, 1500 PSI
      (subcritical), and 3500 PSI (supercritical), to demonstrate the
      viability of this system from shallow to deep wellbores. Example 3
      Borehole Drilling- 4" diameter in hard rock<br>
      <br>
      [0191] A 4" diameter hole is pre-drilled to a depth of 5" in
      Sierra White granite rock block measuring 24x24" square and 36"
      tall. A drill head interface is placed in the pre-drilled hole and
      sealed in place with high temperature cement. The block is
      centered in cylindrical steel mold 38" diameter, 44" in length,
      with a 0.375" wall. This mold had been split down the side and
      support railings were welded onto the outside edge. Bolts are used
      to clamp the two halves of the mold together. Concrete is poured
      to fill the empty volume between the rock block and mold. The
      concrete is allowed to cure for 10 days, after which time the
      bolts are tightened to provide 150 psi clamping pressure on the
      sample. A diagram of the apparatus is shown in FIGS. 14A-C.<br>
      <br>
      [0192] Approximately 450 g of Instant Steam catalyst obtained from
      Oxford Catalyst PLC is loaded into a converging radial flow
      reactor and placed inside a 2 7/8" OD drill head, as shown in FIG.
      11. The drill head is slid into the drill head interface. Before
      the start of a test, the drill head is driven to the bottom of the
      predrilled hole and a depth is read off of the computer controls.
      The drill head is then retracted approximately 10" from the bottom
      of the hole to allow cooling water from the drill head interface
      to enter the bottom of the hole. A mixture of 38% hydrogen
      peroxide and 12% methanol by weight is pumped into the catalyst
      bed at 3200mL/min. Neither the catalyst nor the fuel/oxidant fluid
      is preheated, and no additional heat source such as a glow plug,
      spark, or flame for the reaction is used. The mixture "lights off
      over the catalyst bed producing a 800 &lt;0&gt;C jet of steam
      which exits a single, 0.189" diameter non rotating nozzle located
      along the central axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0193] The drill head interface is advanced quickly through a
      stainless steel seal in the drill head interface, isolating it
      from the cooling water, and into the predrilled hole a to a
      distance of 5" off the bottom of the hole; the advance rate is
      then reduced to a setpoint drilling rate of 10'/h by a stepper
      motor, gear reducer, drive screw, ball nut, and static and sliding
      support members. A load cell is included to measure the drive
      force transmitted to the drill assembly. The drill is advanced to
      its full stroke, roughly 13" below the depth of the predrilled
      hole.<br>
      <br>
      [0194] The reaction is immediately quenched by stopping the flow
      of the reactants, and the drill is removed to reveal a hole that
      extends 5" past the final depth of nozzle exit. The sample is
      removed from the concrete and sectioned to display the hole that
      is created, as shown in FIG.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">14. Example 4 Field Drilling</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0195] A thermal spallation system can be deployed on a customized
      AmKin 800 V track mounted coiled tubing unit. A 20' long 2 7/8-3
      &lt;[iota]&gt;[Delta]" OD bottom hole assembly is prepared from
      instrumentation and controls subassembly (or "sub"), a release
      sub, a dynamic barrier sub, stabilizers and centralizers, and an
      iteration of the steam generation sub described in Example 4. The
      steam generation sub houses an axial catalyst bed 2 &lt;1&gt;A" in
      diameter and 12" long filled with Oxford Catalysts Instant Steam
      catalyst. The bottom hole assembly is attached to a Tenaris HS-90
      2.00" steel coiled tubing with a 0.134" wall through a connector
      sub. Inside of the coiled tubing, a 3/8" OD nitric-acid passivated
      stainless steel capillary is housed to transport the unreacted
      fluid to the steam generation sub, and a 5/16" 7-conductor
      wireline cable is used for communication in the instrumentation
      controls sub.<br>
      <br>
      [0196] A starter well is drilled into competent rock and lined
      with 4" ID casing. At the top of the casing is mounted a wellhead
      diverter with stripper rubber. The bottom hole assembly and coiled
      tubing is run through a wellhead diverter seal to the bottom of a
      water-filled 300' hole.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] The unreacted fluid is prepared at the surface by
      continuously metering 52% high test peroxide, reagent grade
      methanol, and deionized water into a mix tank to produce 38%
      peroxide and 12% methanol. The mixture is pumped through the
      capillary at 1 gallon per minute to the catalyst bed where it
      self-energizes and reacts with the catalyst element without the
      need for an external energy source (such as a spark, glow plug or
      flame holder) thus generating a 800 C reacted fluid, without an
      inherently unstable flame or the need for cooling water to protect
      the materials of construction or overheating of the rock. This
      reacted fluid is then emitting through a 0.189" nozzle and
      directed at the bottom of the hole, causing rapid spallation of
      the rock. The coiled tubing is fed into the hole at a rate of
      2O'/h by means of the coiled tubing injector on the AmKin 800 V
      continuously drilling a 4" borehole in the solid granite. Spalls
      are swept through the dynamic seal assembly where they meet a 50
      gallon per minute flow of water flow, which has travelled down
      inside the 2" coiled tubing and exited a series of upward pointing
      jets, to cool the reacted fluid and carry the spalls to the
      surface. At the surface, the spalls are removed by a series of
      "shakers", cyclones, and filters, the water is cooled by a 200 kW
      mud cooler, and continuously recirculated. Example 5 Multilaterals
      with hole opening<br>
      <br>
      [0198] A system as described in Example 4 can be used to create
      multilaterals. At the desired depth, the bottom hole assembly is
      deviated, the spallation jet is directed at the wall of the
      borehole causing the drill to create a hole off-axis from the
      existing borehole. The bottom hole assembly is advanced using the
      coiled tubing injector and intersects additional fracture networks
      which can provide flow to the main wellbore. When the final target
      depth ("TD") is reached, the unreacted fluid is directed through a
      second catalyst bed that is in fluid communication with 6 jets
      oriented normal to the axis of the bottom hole assembly and spaced
      60 degrees apart around the circumference of the tool. The
      unreacted fluid is pumped again and reacted fluid exits the
      circumferential jets, expanding the diameter of the wellbore as
      the bottom of the hole assembly is withdrawn on the coiled tubing.
      Periodically, this hole opening process is paused and the well is
      allowed to produce fluid, blowing produced spalls and loose rock
      from the fractures. Flow sensors including "spinners", and
      thermocouples are used to infer the flow rate from a given
      fracture. If additional hole opening is required, the hole opening
      is restarted. In certain sections of the well where larger/global
      hole opening is desired, the bottom hole assembly can be held in
      place, causing extensive spallation, macrofracturing, breakout and
      collapse of sections in the producing zone.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 6 Hole opening of a 0.75"
        borehole</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0199] Using the procedure of Example 1, a Sierra White granite
      rock core measuring 4" in diameter and 6" long was prepared by
      pre-drilling a 0.75" diameter hole 4" deep on the top surface. The
      core was then loaded into a stainless steel pressure vessel
      described in Example 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0200] The thermal spallation system includes a 0.5" ID x 3" long
      catalyst chamber which exits through a single, 0.04" diameter
      non-rotating nozzle oriented perpendicular to the existing
      predrilled hole. The catalyst chamber is filled to a height of
      roughly 1.5" with 0.5% platinum on 1/16" spheres having a surface
      area of 100 m&lt;2&gt;/g. A series of stainless steel screens,
      spacers, and diffusers allow fluid to pass through while holding
      the catalyst bed in place. The drill head is insulated from
      surrounding cooling water by a 0.040" gap pressurized with
      nitrogen. The drill head is held in a large cooling water chamber
      during start up.<br>
      <br>
      [0201] The hydrostatic pressure in the vessel is then raised to
      1600 PSI by means of a backpressure dome regulator. An axial load
      of 4500 PSI and confining pressure of 3000 PSI are applied by
      separate pumps acting upon the core to simulate deep geological
      formation conditions. An air actuated pump is used to deliver 3
      g/s of a 20% by volume methanol in deionized water through the
      preheater which raises the temperature of the unreacted fluid to
      250-300 &lt;0&gt;C. A high pressure oxygen flow is metered into
      the preheated aqueous methanol solution at sub-stoichiometric
      ratios.<br>
      <br>
      [0202] The thermal spallation system uses methyl alcohol fuel, and
      an O2 oxidant. The aqueous methanol/02 solution travels through
      the spacers, screens, and diffuser and over or through the
      catalyst bed. The catalyst is not preheated and no additional heat
      source is used. The catalytic oxidation of the methanol produces
      heat within the water which raises the temperature of the fluid to
      800-900&lt;0&gt;C.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] The high temperature fluid exiting the nozzle into the
      cooling chamber is initially diverted and cooled by a 4 GPM water
      flow. The flow of aqueous methanol is increased to 9 g/s over 2
      minutes while simultaneously adjusting the oxygen flow. The drill
      head is then driven by a high pressure fluid pump at a rate of 7.5
      cm/min through a stainless steel seal, isolating it from the
      cooling water, and into the predrilled hole. The reacted fluid
      spalls the wall of the borehole until it reaches the full stroke
      of the equipment, roughly 1.5" below the predrilled rock surface.
      Fluid and spalls exit the borehole into the cooling water above
      the rock via a 0.189" tube approximately 1.5" in length. The bulk
      fluid then passes through a series of screens which remove the
      bulk of the spalls before the bulk fluid passes the back pressure
      dome regulator and into a large collection tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0204] The drill head is rapidly retracted through the borehole
      seal, allowing cooling water to fill the hole and the jet to be
      diverted, quenching the spallation process. Aqueous methanol and
      oxygen flow rates are gradually reduced and the preheater is
      turned off.<br>
      <br>
      [0205] The sample is then removed from the cell. A large slot is
      formed along the length of the predrilled hole in the same
      orientation as the jet, increasing the diameter by roughly 2x.<br>
      <br>
      [0206] Effective experiments, following Example 5, holding the jet
      stationary to open the hole globally; using axial jets, multiple
      jets, and diffuse heating; and where rock is intentionally
      fractured either or parallel or normal to either the existing
      borehole or the jets have also been conducted. In one embodiment,
      as shown in FIG. 18, using a vertical spallation jet in a
      predrilled 7/8" hole 1" deep (shown as dashed lines) into a 4"
      diameter rock core increased the diameter by roughly 2x and
      created a thermally affected zone (shown by arrow) of highly
      altered materials with reduced strength, as determined by
      SEM-EDAX, thin sections, microscopy, punch and modified Chercar
      testing.<br>

        Drilling</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0207] Spalls and/or a reacted rock region can be formed as
      described above. A reamer element, including one or more reamer
      elements mounted to the housing and located back from the distal
      portion of the thermal spallation system, can then be used to ream
      the thermally effected rock at the outer sides of the borehole
      created by the thermal spallation system to enlarge and/or shape
      the borehole, as required.<br>

        Drag bit</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0208] Spalls and/or a reacted rock region can be formed as
      described above. A drag bit with TSP cutters is then used to
      remove the thermally effected rock from the borehole more easily
      than if the rock was not heated.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 9 Rock sample tests</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0209] Thin sections: samples extracted from rocks in Examples 1-4
      were cut into small sections using diamond blades and sent to a
      thin section preparation laboratory. The samples were evacuated
      and saturated with a blue epoxy to identify pores and fractures.
      The samples were polished and then mounted to a glass slide and
      the section ground down to a thickness required using a
      transmission microscope with polarizing lens to determine mineral
      structure alteration and other microscopic features.<br>
      <br>
      [0210] Microscopic observations on the regions near the borehole
      suggest thermal fracturing of grains especially quartz and
      feldspars but little or no alteration of these minerals is
      apparent in the micrographs.<br>
      <br>
      [0211] Binocular microscope: samples were inspected with a
      binocular microscope looking for evidence of alteration fractures
      and other feature associated with changes in the physical or
      chemical properties due to the rapid heating accompanying
      hydrothermal spallation. Radial crack were identified in many of
      the samples that have the appearance of being filled with small
      quartz remnants (spalls). A general bleaching of the thermally
      altered surface suggests removal of iron and other color
      generating compounds. [0212] Punch tests: a small spring loaded
      punch (pointed tool steel) was used to remove small amounts of
      rock. The spring force on each punch when triggered is
      approximately 15 pounds total. The removed rock was collected and
      the total amount weighed. A series of punches tests (20 ea) were
      used on each sample on the thermally affected zone and on virgin
      rock, and results shown below:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="results.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      Dye penetrant: a visual dye penetrant was applied to the surface
      of the thermally altered rocks to see the extent and depth of the
      fracturing/alteration. After application the rocks were visually
      inspected with the binocular microscope. FIG. 20 shows an image of
      an example diorite sample indicating the depth of penetration of
      the dye into the altered zone and the flow of dye into two smaller
      fracture zone perpendicular to the altered region. In various
      embodiments of the invention, dye penetration from about 0.7 cm,
      at the regions closest to where the jet is impacting the rock, to
      approximately 1.5 cm further up the annulus, where the rock has
      been exposed to the superheated fluid longer, may be achieved. <br>
