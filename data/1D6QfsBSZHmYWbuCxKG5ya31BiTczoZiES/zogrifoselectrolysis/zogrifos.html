          (Palmolysis) for Pure Hydrogen Production and direct energy
          conversion.</b><br>

      <br>
      ENERGY ANALYSIS AND DOCUMENTATION OF PALMOLYSEOS of Petros
      Zografos Invention.<br>
      <br>
      The core of the invention is the production of hydrogen and oxygen
      (hydroxy) from plain refreshing water from the tap or sea using
      high frequency electromagnetic pulse (in Terahertz Scale). These
      pulses have a frequency that "coordinate" the molecule of water,
      resulting in its decay. Petros Zografos as an excellent electronic
      Engineer invented a new way to multiply pulses @ 3 phases to
      achieve a high frequency result and thus discovered a new method
      of decomposition of molecules of water and hydrogen production:
      the PALMOLYSIS<br>
      <br>
      For the operation of the device it is required the use of a metal
      alloy board which is consumed gradually and act as electromagnetic
      torch. By preliminary estimates the device seen need a Kgr of
      alloy for producing 1600 normal cubic meters of hydrogen. With
      energy content of hydrogen equal to 3,5 kWh / Nm ^ 3, the output
      1600 Nm ^ 3 cubic meters of hydrogen corresponding to 3,5 x 1600 =
      5600 kWh chemical-thermal energy. By using a single generator with
      a degree of efficiency of 30% with this production we can now
      produce 1680 kWh of electricity at a cost of metal of around 50
      euros that is equal to 50/1680 = 0,03 € / kWh compared to 0,19 € /
      kWh&nbsp; currently charged by Hellenic Public Power Company (
      PPC)!<br>
      <br>
      Assuming that the energy content of the metal is approximately 22
      kWh of thermal energy per kg, this implies that any produced
      hydrogen cubic need 0,014 kWh heat / Nm ^ 3 for the production of
      the metal. The modern technology to produce hydrogen by
      electrolysis takes about 5 to 6 kWh electricity per Nm ^ 3 of
      hydrogen. Therefore Petros Zografos invented a technology that has
      virtually eliminate energy consumption, electricity or heat for
      the hydrogen production. Also transportation of Hydrogen, a major
      issue, has just found its solution since in a water form is easily
      transportable everywhere. <br>

      DIMITRIOU<br>
      <br>
      Novelty: There are disclosed a method and a device destined for
      water electrolysis and production of hydrogen to be used as
      combustible by combination of high frequencies produced by
      semitonic oscillators; when mixed, reinforced and combined, said
      frequencies contrive to break water into its elements (hydrogen
      and oxygen) upon influence of the coordination effect. Secondary
      frequencies configurating the structure of the primary frequencies
      for obtaining adequately-combined frequencies by means of the
      respective electronic circuit composed of an isolator, a mixer, a
      directional coupler, a multiplier, configurators, digital
      frequency controllers, and linear amplifiers can be introduced
      with the assistance of adequate main and auxiliary treatment
      equipments into the primary frequencies produced by the semitonic
      oscillators. The vibration of water molecules and the breaking
      thereof into hydrogen and oxygen are obtained by
      suitably-coordinated frequencies. The gases are, thereafter,
      separated by special sorting guides while the produced hydrogen is
      conducted through the respective specific connection to the energy
      generation mechanism for being used as fuel.<br>

      </b><b>[ Excerpt ]</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      "I found a bunch of nonsense claims in the internet, about the
      resonance frequency of water helping to split bonds.<br>
      <br>
      The first thing to realize here is that there is no one resonance
      frequency of water. With suitable energy, you can excite
      rotational, vibrational and electronic states (I left out
      translation - there transition energies minute). At room
      temperature you can say as a rule of thumb that most molecules
      will be in some excited rotational state, but in the vibrational
      and electronic ground states. Excitation energies for rotation are
      in the far infrared or microwave energy/frequency region. Widely
      used e.g. in the microwave oven at 2.45 GHz (≈ 12 cm). Actually,
      the whole region is full of bands where water absorbs. Note that
      microwave heating of water does not cause electrolysis.
      Vibrational transitions are around 2.9 μm = 105 THz = 3500 cm⁻¹
      and 6μm = 50 THz = 1635 cm⁻¹ with lots of combinations and
      overtones throughout the near infrared region. Quite
      exceptionally, the visible region is basically free of water
      absorption. Electronic transitions (breaking of bonds) need
      energies in the UV, and here we meet bands that lead to
      photodissociation, e.g. at 166nm (taken from Wikipedia). That
      corresponds to 1.8 PHz = 1.8⋅1015 Hz. Compare this to the kHz and
      MHz where your link claims dissociation.<br>
      <br>
      This doesn't mean that the pulsed DC cannot help, nor that
      impedance spectoscopy won't give important information. But
      resonance frequencies in the kHz range are electrical LC-circuit
      resonances depending on cell and electrode geometries and
      electrical double layers etc. But neiter on vibrations nor
      breaking of the bonds of the water molecule. <br>
      <br>
      To give the "method" you ask about some real world numbers,<br>
      <br>
      at the very end of the Wiki page the energy efficiency for
      industrial water electrolysis is cited as usually between 50 and
      80 %.<br>
      <br>
      The paper then proposes to burn the gas in an internal combustion
      machine. As such a stationary process could be adjusted so that
      the engine is at its maximum efficiency, we may assume 1/3 or 35%
      efficiency here.<br>
      <br>
      we then need a generator to convert the mechanical energy into
      electric energy. Fortunately, that step is rather efficient. Say,
      95 %.<br>
      <br>
      A fuel cell would be more efficient than the combustion -
      generator combination: ca. 40 - 60 % according to Wikipedia.<br>
      <br>
      Unfortunately, also battery charging is not 100% efficient. Let's
      assume 80–90% (taken from Wikipedia on Li-ion batteries) For
      batteries that are charged with higher current (or current
      density) efficiency is less. Example would be lead-acid batteries
      as used in cars. Wiki quotes efficiencies between 50 and 80 %.<br>
      <br>
      Taking these numbers together, I conclude that after going once
      through the cycle of the proposed "perpetuum mobile", 8 - 24 % of
      the energy are retained in a "useful state" while 76 - 92 % became
      heat. With fuel cell, we may be able to "boost" the energy
      efficiency to 43%... <br>
