        The Bellocq Wave Pump was the first new mechanical principle to
        be discovered in the 20th century (Wilkes' Rolamite was the
        second). It defies Toricelli's Law by utilizing pressure waves
        rather than suction to pull water higher than 30 feet (the pump
        is located at the surface, not at the bottom of the well). The
        technology is very efficient and requires little power.&nbsp; In
        practice, it is possible to expel during each stroke of the
        piston a volume of liquid about 17 times as large as the volume
        displaced by the piston (about 5,000 liters/hour in the
        preferrred embodiment described in the patent).

        <center><b><font size="+1">"New Pump Beats Natural Laws in
              Raising Water"</font></b></center>
        <p>Following the example of the United States Patent Office, 18
          countries have issued patents to an Argentinian inventor upon
          an amazing pump that seems to violate natural laws. By
          creating waves in a pipeful of water, it makes the liquid run
          uphill. </p>
        <p>When the inventor, Toribio Bellocq, applied for a US patent
          on a pump to be mounted on top of a well and to draw water up
          from almost unlimited depths, officials pointed out that his
          device apparently would have to defy the law of gravitation.
          Every high school student knows that by no effort can a pump
          suck water higher than approximately 33 feet. This is the
          limit at which the weight of an imprisoned column of water
          balances the atmospheric pressure outside. To force water
          higher from its source, authorities have always agreed that it
          must be pushed from below. Therefore Bellocq's "wave pump"
          seemed in a class with perpetual motion machines, which are
          not patentable because they are impossible. </p>
        <p>Bellocq built one of his pumps, installed it atop a
          Washington DC office building, and invited officials to
          inspect it. They saw it draw a steady stream of water up a
          pipe 80 feet high. Not until they dropped weights down the
          pipe and found no unseen machinery did they believe their own
          eyes. Then they acknowledged that Bellocq had chanced upon an
          entirely new mechanical principle and issued his patent. </p>
        <p>So extraordinary is the operation of the new wave pump that
          even Bellocq admits that he is not certain of its principle ,
          and leaves to scientists the verification of his own
          explanation. </p>
        <p>In Bellocq's pump a piston vibrates rapidly with an extremely
          short stroke. It deals hammerlike blows to a column of water
          in a pipe. His theory is that when the frequency of the blows
          is properly timed for the length of the pipe, a series of
          "stationary waves" is set up. </p>
        <p>Suppose the pipe's bottom to be closed, then layers are
          formed where the water is alternately rarefied and compressed
          without moving. Midway between these and at the bottom are
          regions where water rushes alternately up and down because of
          the waves. </p>
        <p>When a one-way ball valve is added at the bottom, water
          enters from outside at one point in each wave cycle, to
          replace water moving upward from the bottom of the pipe. Once
          inside, it cannot back out. Every influx of water "inches" the
          whole column upward, without interfering with the waves that
          travel through it. A valve at the outlet, while not essential,
          improves the efficiency. </p>

        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">My
          invention relates to moving or transporting liquids and
          especially to extracting or pumping liquids from deep wells or
          other sources of water in a new manner, its main purpose being
          directed towards a pumping scheme of very simple and
          economical construction by which the mechanism at the bottom
          of the well is reduced to a minimum and the extraction of
          fluid effected from the ground level substantially
          irrespective of the depth of the well, and thus when used for
          water it is not limited to the 25 or 30 foot limit of the
          usual suction pump for water, and similarly the limits for
          pumps for other liquids do not persist. In order that my
          invention may be clearly understood and easily carried into
          practice, a preferred embodiment thereof has been shown in the
          appended diagrammatic drawings wherein <a href="#usp1fig1">Figure















            1</a> is a vertical section of a well and apparatus and <a
            href="#usp1fig2">Figure 2</a> is a diagram of the curve of
          the pressure wave to which reference will be made hereinafter.
          <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">In the
          embodiment shown the device consists of a pipe A through which
          the liquid is withdrawn. The pipe reaches to the bottom of the
          well, or to the liquid level therein, and is of a suitable
          length as will be explained. At the bottom of the pipe is a
          check or retention valve V. The upper end of the pipe A is
          connected at or about the ground level with a pump or
          compressor C preferably making rapid reciprocations with a
          short stroke. The compressor is a valveless pump and is
          provided with an outlet controlled by an adjustable cock or
          the like R, through which the pumped liquid may pass from the
          system. The cock may be opened at the beginning f the
          operation but may be adjusted to a desirable point during the
          operation. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">Before
          starting the operation of the compressor care must be taken to
          completely fill the pipe A and the cylinder of the compressor
          with liquid, carefully excluding substantially all free air
          and being sure that the piston of the compressor is in the
          outermost position. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">It is
          well known that energy may be conducted through a column of
          liquid by setting up a wave motion therein. The waves so set
          up are comparable to sound waves or waves of electric energy.
          In order to set up such waves it is necessary to cause
          alternate areas of high and low pressure in the medium and
          this may be effected by any suitable known means. I find it
          convenient to use for this purpose a reciprocating piston. The
          piston of the compressor C when rapidly reciprocating sets up
          waves in the liquid in the pipe A by alternately compressing
          the liquid in the pipe and releasing the pressure especially
          when the piston has a short stroke. These waves have a length
          L equal to <i>v/n</i> in which <i>n</i> is the number of
          strokes per second of the piston of the compressor C and <i>v</i>
          is the speed of the wave per second. When operating in water
          the speed of the wave may be substantially the speed of sound
          in water under the operating conditions. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">As may
          be seen form the diagram in <a href="#usp1fig2">Figure 2</a>
          the wave form includes bulges B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>3</sub>…
          which are associated with corresponding nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>,
          N<sub>3</sub>… When the closed end if the pipe is at a
          distance from the reciprocating piston equal to any number of
          half waves, that is at O<sub>1</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>…
          or when the pipe is cut off at a distance equal to any odd
          number of quarter waves, that is at N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>,
          N<sub>3</sub>…, a stationary wave may be set up in the pipe.
          For the purpose of the present invention it is preferred to
          arrange the valve V at the end of the pipe and adjust the
          apparatus in such a way that the valve will be at an odd
          quarter wave length such as N<sub>1</sub>, or N<sub>2</sub>,
          etc., but the purpose can be accomplished possibly less
          efficiently, by other adjustments. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">The
          maximum variation of pressure accompanied by no variation in
          flow of the liquid occurs at the points O<sub>1</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>,
          O<sub>3</sub>… whereas at nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>,
          N<sub>3</sub>… the variation in pressure is zero with the
          maximum variation in flow of the liquid. By the preferred
          arrangement of placing the valve V at the point N<sub>1</sub>
          or N<sub>2</sub>, etc., the liquid may enter continuously. The
          valve V tends to remain always open but it may open and close
          from time to time during the operation. On the other hand the
          liquid will flow more or less intermittently from the cock R
          when it is adjusted to the proper opening. The required
          pressure in the apparatus may be regulated by choosing the
          appropriate diameter of pipe and by employing a piston of the
          proper cross-section, stroke and speed. If required or thought
          desirable or necessary there may be installed a liquid filled
          bottle or chamber to act as a capacity or condenser in the
          manner well known in connection with the transmission of
          energy by means of waves traveling in liquid. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">I have
          found that one specific appropriate apparatus which will
          illustrate in a concrete way the present invention may consist
          of a fluid pipe having an internal diameter of one inch. Such
          a pipe placed in a well having water at a depth of 20 meters
          may have arranged at its lower end a valve opening 30
          millimeters in diameter in which is a ball of approximately 38
          millimeters in diameter and held I place by the usual cage
          which may be adjusted so that the ball can rise from its seat
          about 20 millimeters. On the surface of the earth the pipe may
          be led into the cylinder of a compressor of 50 millimeter
          diameter in which is a piston having a stroke of about 36
          millimeters. The piston may be reciprocated at a speed of
          about 360 rpm by an electric motor. Leading out from the
          cylinder of the compressor may be a pipe of one-half inch
          diameter in which is placed an adjustable cock or valve. The
          cock will not be closed but is used merely for adjusting the
          outflow. The piston will be moved to its outermost position
          and the cylinder and pipe entirely filled with water, the cock
          being left open. On starting the electric motor the ball valve
          will lift from its seat and may remain open throughout the
          operation when the cock is properly adjusted, but it may
          vibrate from its seat, opening and closing during the
          operation. Water will begin to flow from the outlet and by an
          appropriate adjustment of the cock a continuous operation may
          be effected and an output of 1,000 liters per hour procured. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">While
          the fundamental theory on which the operation is based may be
          somewhat in doubt, I believe that the rapid reciprocation of
          the piston working upon the water in the apparatus produces a
          series of periodic pressure variations with periodic changes
          of pressure and volume throughout the liquid column due to the
          elasticity and compressibility of the liquid. The energy waves
          so set up travel to the valve V at which point they may be
          reflected and the transmitted energy is sufficient to open the
          valve V and lift the column of liquid, at the same time
          drawing in liquid from the well itself. In some systems of
          energy transmission through liquid there is no substantial
          flow of the main body of liquid for carrying the energy. I
          have discovered, however, that apparently the transmission of
          energy may go through a flowing column of liquid and the
          transmitted energy may be relied upon to keep the liquid in
          more or less constant flow. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">According
to















          the present invention liquids may be extracted from
          substantially any depth without using any complicated
          machinery or mechanism in the well and simply by lowering a
          pipe of the required length and dimensions duly connected to a
          simple compressor, the latter being at or about the ground
          level. The valve at the lower end of the pipe will be subject
          to substantially no wear if the valve is substantially always
          in its open position during the operation of the compressor.
          On starting this valve is closed and great care must be taken
          when filling the pipe and cylinder with liquid to see that
          substantially no free air remains in the system. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">The
          piston may work wither with the cylinder horizontal or with
          the cylinder vertical or inclined. The pipe through which the
          liquid flows may be either horizontal or vertical or inclined
          and it may be curved or straight. All of these arrangements
          may be referred to as pumps and I use the term pumping as
          including the moving, transporting or conveying in vertical or
          horizontal or inclined direction. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">The
          term liquids is used to include not only simple liquids but
          also mixtures of liquids and such mixtures with gases or
          solids as are capable of being transported through pipes or
          pumped. <br>
          &nbsp; </p>
        <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0.5in 0.0001pt;">It is
          obvious that the device has been shown only as a preferred
          embodiment and that any other may serve for the same purpose.
          Apparatus for carrying out the invention may be constructed
          from mechanisms or devices already known and used for other
          purposes and the invention is not confined to any specific
          form of valves or compressors or means of operating them. <br>

        the piston has moved a proper part of its stroke the valve VS is
        opened and liquid issues therefrom. The valve VI also opens and
        liquid enters the bottom of the pipe from the well and the
        continued operation of the device lifts liquid from the well
        bottom and delivers it through the valve VS which is closed at
        the proper part of each stroke of the piston at which time the
        outflow of liquid will be temporarily stopped. </p>
      <p>I have described the physical operation of the apparatus, while
        the underlying theory of its operation and the theoretical
        application of the physical forces involved may not be entirely
        clear; there will now be set forth a full and clear statement of
        what is believed to be the explanation of the operation and how
        the physical forces interact with the apparatus to produce the
        desired effect. </p>
      <p>The apparatus employed involves three parts, namely (1) the
        apparatus for producing the impulses or waves of force and for
        producing the opening and closing extra waves or impulses, (2)
        the transmission line or pipe, and (3) a valve in the lower end
        of the pipe which may produce in its turn opening and closing
        extra waves or impulses. </p>
      <p>(1) The first portion of the apparatus may consist of any
        approved design having a single valve VS diagrammatically
        illustrated in <a href="#1730337a">Figure 1</a>.&nbsp; The
        piston of the compressor is rapidly reciprocated preferably
        through a short stroke so as to produce waves of energy in the
        liquid column. Initially the piston is moved to its outermost
        position and the pipe and compressor cylinder filled with
        liquid. When the movement of the piston has produced the desired
        pressure, which may be before or at the end of its stroke, the
        valve VS is suddenly opened. The cooperation and relative timing
        of the piston and valve may be accomplished in any appropriate
        way but I prefer to have them mechanically interlocked so that
        the valve will open at the appropriate moment in the piston
        stroke. When this valve opens it suddenly, by the variation in
        pressure, transforms the piston wave into an opening extra
        impulse or wave in the liquid column. Advantage may be taken
        also of the extra wave caused by the closure of the valve but
        the closure extra waves are of lesser effect than the opening
        extra waves. Valve VS being closed when the piston enters the
        cylinder, a certain pressure is produced to set up a wave in the
        liquid column. When the valve VS opens the opening sets up an
        extra or supplemental wave impulse which like the piston wave
        will travel through the whole length of the pipe to the lower
        valve VI. This extra or auxiliary wave or impulse may be similar
        also to that produced in water rams. The water ram, however,
        takes advantage of the closing extra wave rather than the extra
        wave produced by opening. In my system this extra wave when
        working with the valve VS open to the air is probably one of
        much volume and slight pressure. This wave and extra wave cause
        the liquid to proceed from the well by valve VI and carry it
        through the pipe and drive it through valve VS, which is open.
        It is necessary to calculate the necessary pressure and velocity
        of the wave for the length and diameter of the pipe employed as
        a guide in altering or adjusting, in each case, the diameter,
        stroke, and frequency of the piston. As is well known in systems
        transmitting energy by wave through columns or pipes of liquid
        the pressure produced in a tube or pipe of a given diameter may
        be varied or controlled by providing in communication with the
        pipe a further container filled with the same liquid which is
        being pumped to act as a capacity or condenser. In order to set
        up such waves it is necessary to cause alternate areas of high
        and low pressure in the medium and this may be effected by any
        suitable known means. I find it convenient to use for this
        purpose a reciprocating piston and valve as indicated. </p>
      <p>(2) The second portion of the apparatus consists merely of a
        suitable pipe which brings up the liquid and, through the
        flowing stream, transmits the energy or waves from the piston
        and the upper valve VS to the lower valve VI, it being necessary
        to calculate the section of the pipe in accordance with the
        pressure and volume of the liquid to be obtained or extracted
        from the well. Since energy-bearing wave-currents in liquid have
        a certain velocity, the frequency of the piston must be
        calculated in order that the wave produced should conform with
        the length of the pipe, it being possible to work likewise with
        the harmonics of the wave and also to work when the pipe length
        corresponds with odd or even fourths of such wave length. This
        is preferred but the purpose can be accomplished, possibly with
        less efficiency, with other adjustments. </p>
      <p>(3) The third portion of the apparatus consists of the lower
        valve VI, which may serve three purposes: (a) it serves as a
        non-return valve so as to permit the pipe being filled up before
        starting, (b) it causes the liquid to move in one direction only
        avoiding the return thereof into the well, and (c) it may be
        that it also serves as a wave or impulse transformer like that
        of upper valve VS, producing by its movement an extra wave or
        impulse. Thus the pipe will draw in a great quantity of liquid
        under low pressure being the inverse of the piston which
        produces a wave of high pressure and little volume. </p>
      <p>At first sight it might seem that if the piston is caused to
        enter the cylinder when the valve VS is closed the apparatus
        would burst. This is not the case, however, since the capacity
        for compression and the elasticity of the liquid being pumped,
        when known, serve to allow the stroke of the piston and the
        pressure obtained to be calculated and the apparatus operated in
        such a way as not to exceed the limit of resistance of the
        apparatus before opening the valve. It will be remembered that
        the impulses and extra impulses of energy in the wave form are
        possible solely because the liquids worked upon are compressible
        and elastic, which permits of their working in a resilient
        manner. </p>
      <p>The operation of the apparatus is as follows. The piston is
        withdrawn from the cylinder to the maximum extent possible and
        the cylinder and pipe are filled up, taking care that
        substantially no free air be left inside. The valve VS is closed
        and the piston is pushed inwardly, vigorously causing a
        compression of the fluid and initiating an energy-carrying wave
        which will travel through the whole length of the pipe. The
        waves produced by the piston and by the valve VS both carry
        energy to the valve VI which will be opened. The system is more
        economical and more efficient than one which employs for the
        pumping and lifting of the liquid only the energy transmitted by
        the waves set up by the piston action. If the opening of the
        valve VI is abrupt, it may transform the extra wave into a wave
        of small pressure but great volume. Since the valve VI does not
        permit the liquid to flow downwards an upward flow will occur,
        that is to say, the energy transmitted by the two waves will not
        only open the valve VI but will lift the liquid in the pipe and
        will draw from the liquid in the well past valve VI and upwards
        through the pipe from which it will discharge through the open
        valve VS. Operation may then become substantially continuous,
        the piston being rapidly reciprocated and the valve VS operated
        in harmony therewith, always being closed at the proper part of
        the piston stroke. It might be best to arrange the shaft moving
        the piston so that it would also serve to govern valve VS. Thus
        the work might be done in a completely automatic manner. Thus a
        cam C may be mounted on the drive shaft and engage mechanism D
        to operate the valve VS at the proper predetermined point in the
        stroke of the piston. Any other suitable means for associating
        the operation of the piston and the valve may be employed. The
        time of opening and closing the valve VS and its size may be
        adjusted to give the maximum output of liquid with the minimum
        expense of energy to operate the piston. The apparatus expels
        during each stroke of the piston a volume of liquid several
        times great than the volume displaced by the piston. In practice
        it is possible to expel during each stroke of the piston a
        volume of liquid about 17 times as large as the volume displaced
        by the piston, and for this reason the stroke of the piston may
        be very short, or the volume displaced at each stroke of the
        piston may be small. </p>
      <p>I have found that one specific appropriate apparatus which will
        illustrate in a concrete way the present invention may consist
        of a fluid pipe having an internal diameter of one inch. Such a
        pipe placed in a well having water at a depth of 20 meters may
        have arranged at its lower end a valve opening 30 millimeters in
        diameter seated in which is a ball of approximately 38
        millimeters in diameter, held in place by the usual cage which
        may be adjusted to that the ball can rise from its seat about 20
        millimeters. On the surface of the earth the pipe may be led
        into the cylinder of a compressor of 50 millimeters diameter in
        which is a piston having a stroke of about 30 millimeters. The
        piston may be reciprocated at a speed of about 180 rpm by a
        suitable electric motor. In the cylinder of the compressor may
        be a valve having a diameter of about 30 millimeters and
        adjusted so as to have a stroke of from 5 to 7 millimeters. The
        piston will be moved to its outermost position and the cylinder
        and pipe entirely filled with water. The ball valve rests by
        gravity in its closed position and the valve in the cylinder is
        closed. The electric motor will be started and at the proper
        time in the stroke of the piston the valve in the cylinder will
        be opened. The ball valve will open and water will begin to flow
        from the piston valve with an output of about 4,000 or 5,000
        liters per hour. </p>
      <p>While the fundamental theory on which the operation is based
        may be somewhat in doubt, I have endeavored to set out herein
        what I believe to be the true principle, but my invention is not
        so limited. In order to set up such waves as are here involved
        it is necessary to produce variations in a compression in the
        liquid and although a compressor is illustrated for such
        purpose, it will be understood that the invention is not so
        limited but extends to any suitable or known means for producing
        such effect. </p>
      <p>This system permits of working at any desired depth without
        being compelled to arrange the machinery within the well,
        provide the necessary pressure has been well calculated. It is
        possible that advantageously, the work is done under a
        considerable pressure in order to use, same as in electricity,
        the transmission of high voltages over long distances with
        favorable output. This system also permits of working with a
        piston of reduced dimensions as, taking advantage of the
        transforming effect of the wave or impulse, a piston of a given
        displacement, under a given pressure, would be able to elevate
        at each stroke a liquid volume several times greater than the
        same displacement but under a pressure several times lower. </p>
      <p>This system would seem contrary to the laws of gravity, which
        does not permit of liquid being elevated or drawn up from a
        depth greater than the length of a column of the same liquid
        counter-balancing the atmospheric pressure; however, in fact
        there is employed a force which travels throughout the pipe and
        arrives at the lower valve VI. This force operates at this valve
        in the same manner as if there were a piston at this point. </p>
      <p>The present system would also seem to be contrary to the law
        which does not permit a piston of a given displacement to obtain
        at each stroke a volume of liquid greater than such
        displacement; but it will be apparent that a piston of a given
        displacement, under a given pressure, may obtain at each stroke
        a liquid volume several times greater than the volume of
        displacement of such piston, but under a pressure several times
        less. </p>
      <p>The piston may work either with the cylinder horizontal or with
        the cylinder vertical or inclined. The pipe through which the
        liquid flows may be either horizontal or vertical or inclined,
        and it may be cured or straight. All of these arrangements may
        be referred to as pumps and I use the term pumping as including
        moving, transporting or conveying in vertical or horizontal or
        inclined direction. </p>
      <p>The terms liquids is used to include not only simple liquids
        but also mixtures of liquids and such mixtures of liquids with
        gases or solids as are capable of being transported through
        pipes or pumped. </p>
      <p>It is obvious that the device has been shown only as a
        preferred embodiment and that any other may be used for the same
        purpose. Apparatus for carrying out the invention may be
        constructed from mechanism or devices already known and used for
        other purposes, and the invention is not confined to any
        specific form of valves or compressors or means of operating
        them. </p>

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The invention
        relates to pumping liquids, especially by that method by which
        the energy for moving the liquid is transmitted through the
        liquid itself by means of compression waves or variations of
        compression and volume moving through the liquid whereby liquids
        may be extracted from substantially any depth without
        complicated mechanism in the well. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Pumps of this
        kind are described in Patent # 1,730,336 and # 3,730,337 issued
        October 1, 1929, the applications for which were pending when
        the present application was filed. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The present
        invention involves the discovery that an improved pumping effect
        may be accomplished by modifying the relative size and
        arrangement of the various elements of the pumping system and by
        adding to or inserting certain auxiliary devices. These are
        referred to herein as filters and may be made up of inertias,
        capacities, resistances, leakages, or any of them and may be
        arranged in series, in shunt, or in derivation to the main
        liquid conveying pipe of the pumping system. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Compression
        waves moving in liquid are to a very considerable extent
        controlled by or operate in accordance with substantially the
        same laws as those governing alternating current electricity.
        The curves of pressure and flow of such waves are analogous to
        the voltage and amperage curves of electric current in that the
        difference in phase may determine the value of the wave.
        Inertia, capacity, resistance or friction and leakage in a
        liquid system correspond more or less to induction, capacity,
        resistance, and losses respectively in electricity. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Variations in
        capacity or in leakage or in resistance or in inertia in the
        system effect changes therein including varying phase
        differences between pressure and flow of the impulses in the
        liquid. In an ordinary line which has its capacity, inertia,
        resistance and leakage more or les uniformly distributed
        throughout the length of the apparatus, the efficiency of the
        line and the quantity of liquid that is to be pumped with such
        efficiency may be determined. Often, however, it may be desired
        to change the conditions of such a line to adapt it to a given
        speed, given efficiency or a given volume of pumped liquid.
        There may be produced an artificial line whose capacity,
        inertia, resistance and leakage will be the combination of the
        natural capacity, inertia, resistance and leakage with added
        capacity, inertia, resistance and leakage. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Inertia, as
        employed herein, refers to an element in or inserted in the
        system for reducing the passageway at one or more points and/or
        decreasing the elasticity of the liquid. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Capacity, as
        employed herein, refers to an element in or inserted in the
        system for increasing the passageway at one or more points
        and/or increasing the elasticity of the liquid. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Leakage, as
        employed herein, refers to liquid leaving the system whether at
        a main outlet for the pumped liquid or at other points in the
        system, some of which may be accidental, unavoidable and
        incalculable. The entrance of liquid into the system may be
        considered as negative leakage. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Resistance, as
        employed herein, is the retarding effect of the system on the
        wave movement. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Friction, as
        employed herein, is the resistance caused by the contact of the
        liquid with the pipe or within the liquid. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Filter, as
        employed herein, refers to assemblage of inertias, capacities,
        resistances and leakages, or one or more of them, and this is
        referred to by the term "wave filter" used in the claims. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">A filter may
        be said to be arranged in series when it is in such a portion of
        the system that a wave goes directly through the filter and
        passes on to another portion of the system. A filter may be said
        to be in shunt when the wave takes a divided path going through
        a plurality of elements of the filter. A filter may be said to
        be in derivation when the wave enters it from the main path of
        the wave and returns again to that path. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In the
        accompanying drawings Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of
        one form the pumping apparatus may take. Figure 2 is a

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Figure 18 is a
        diagrammatic illustration of a pumping apparatus such as shown
        in Figure 1 to which is applied the devices illustrated in
        Figures 3-8. Figure 19 is a diagrammatic illustration of a
        pumping apparatus such as shown in Figure 2, to which is applied
        the apparatus illustrated in Figure 11a. Figure 20 is a pumping
        apparatus such as is illustrated in Figure 1, to which is
        applied the device illustrated in Figure 13a. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The pumping
        system in general is illustrated as including a pipe 50 provided
        with a check valve 51 at its lower end intended to be inserted
        in the well or other source of supply of liquid to be pumped. At
        the other end of the pipe s shown a compression chamber or
        cylinder 52, in which moves a piston 53 controlled by a cam 54
        on a suitably operated shaft 55. There is an outlet cock or
        valve 56 of any suitable type through which the liquid is
        pumped, here shown in an outlet pipe 57. In Figure 1 the outlet
        is shown leading directly from the compression chamber or
        cylinder 52 while in Figure 2 it is shown as directly connected
        to the pipe 50 so that the outgoing liquid will not pass through
        the compression chamber or cylinder. The cock or valve 56 may be
        open and closed at all appropriate times during the operation
        either manually or automatically. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In Figure 3 a
        pipe 58 is shown provide with a narrow annular obstruction 59
        which acts as an inertia for the current of waves passing though
        the liquid in the pipe. In Figure 4 there is shown at 58 a
        similar inertia 60 which takes the form of an elongated sleeve
        and so has a different value from the inertia shown in Figure 3.
        In Figure 5 is show a pipe 58 provided with rigid protuberances
        61 which act as a capacitance in series with the pipe. In Figure
        6 is shown a pipe 58 which is connected with a chamber 63 closed
        at its outer end by a diaphragm 64. When the chamber 63 is
        filled with liquid it acts as a capacity in derivation. In
        Figure 8 is shown a pipe 58 from which leads a pipe 65 in which
        is snugly fitting piston 66 moveable against springs 67 and 68.
        The resiliency of the springs takes the place of liquid
        resiliency and acts as a capacity in derivation to the pipe 58.
        These are illustrative only and other forms of inertia and
        capacity may be employed. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The pipe
        through which liquid is to be pumped may be horizontal, vertical
        or inclined or bent. If there is a bend in the pipe the relation
        between the parts on each side of the bend tends to produce a
        harmonic of the principal wave and in order to work most
        efficiently this harmonic should preferably have a node in the
        elbow at the bend. The elbow thus acts as an inertia. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The entrance
        or the exit of the liquid pumped may also tend to produce an
        harmonic four times as long as the length of the liquid which
        passes through the pipe at each stroke of the compressing
        device. It is desirable to have this harmonic the same as the
        harmonic produced by the proportion between the portions of a
        bent line, or at least an harmonic thereof. The flowing of the
        liquid through the inlet or the outlet has somewhat the effect
        of an inertia. The change in size between the pipe carrying the
        liquid and the cylinder of the compressor at their point of
        connection has somewhat the same effect as an inertia. The small
        chamber generally employed at the outlet cock or valve between
        the compressor and the pipeline and likewise the cylinder itself
        each have somewhat the same effect as a capacity. This chamber
        may be omitted and the cylinder alone be referred to as the
        compression chamber. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">There are
        several elements of the apparatus which may be adjusted to
        change or vary the efficiency of operation including: (1) the
        size of the compression chamber may be varied; (2) the relative
        size of the connection between the compression chamber and the
        pipe may be varied; (3) the cross-section of the pipe through
        which the liquid is pumped may be varied; (4) the speed or
        timing of the piston may be varied; (5) the size or
        cross-section of the piston or its length of stroke may be
        varied; (6) the size or opening of the check valve through which
        the liquid enters the system may be varied; or (7) the size and
        suddenness of the opening of the outlet may be varied. In order
        to procure proper and appropriate adjustments or regulations of
        the system, any or all of the various elements may be
        appropriately and correspondingly varied. The quantitative
        effect of variations in the different elements of the apparatus
        is not the same. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">A difference
        in operation is produced when the outlet is in the compression
        chamber from that produced when the outlet is on the pipe. In
        the first arrangement increasing the pipe size or opening of the
        check valve or in the second arrangement decreasing the size or
        the opening of the check valve effects a variation in the same
        direction as (1) increasing the size of the compression chamber,
        (2) decreasing the relative size of the connection between the
        cross-section of the pipe, (3) decreasing the cross-section of
        the pipe of the pipe through which the liquid is pumped, (4)
        increasing the speed or decreasing the timing of the piston, (5)
        increasing the size or cross-section of the piston or its length
        of stroke, (6) increasing the size of the opening of the outlet.
        This indicates the direction of change to be made to compensate
        for any change in the apparatus. If the outlet on the pipe is
        removed farther from the connection between the pipe and the
        compression chamber or if inertia associated with the outlet is
        moved farther from the connection between the pipe and the
        compression chamber, the effect is of the same character as
        would be an enlargement of the compression chamber. It is
        generally desirable, however, to put the outlet, the inertia,
        and the connection between the pipe and the compression chamber
        as close together as possible because when they are separated
        one from another there is no longer merely the effect of a
        chamber assembled at once place but the effect of a chamber like
        a piece of pipe with different inductions in each extremity.
        With such an arrangement it is more difficult to calculate the
        exact value of such a chamber. Sometimes, however, it is found
        desirable to use such an extended chamber despite the difficulty
        in calculating its characteristics. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It may happen
        that when the pipe is very long the wave will be deformed as it
        proceeds through the liquid. I may then be desirable to put
        additional or new capacities, inertias, resistance or leakage in
        one or several parts of the apparatus to prevent this
        deformation of the current. Somewhat similarly in telegraphic
        and telephonic lines traveling great distances, means are
        provided to prevent deformation of the current waves such as are
        provided by the system of Puppini or others. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">It may be
        desirable to choose a vibration or wave of such a character that
        the liquid will vibrate with the natural vibration produced by
        gravity. For example, a compressor may be so operated as to
        cause an artificial acceleration produced by gravity on the
        liquid freely falling in the system. When this natural vibration
        is not convenient for the quantity of liquid it is desired to
        pump, the constants of the line may be appropriately changed to
        produce the desired effect. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">When the pipe
        is large enough or the capacity of the liquid pumped is small in
        relation to the size of the pipe, the resistance will be small
        and for practical purposes may be neglected. It is desirable
        that the leakage in the system be reduced to a minimum so that
        the only value of leakage to be considered may be that produced
        by the liquid pumped through the outlet. Entrance of liquid into
        the system may be considered as negative leakage. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The
        compression waves in the liquid of the pumping system are
        somewhat analogous to sound waves. Therefore, elements which
        modify the waves in the liquid of the pump may for convenience
        be referred to as acoustic elements and it is to be understood
        that when the term acoustic or hydraulic is employed herein it
        relates to an element modifying the compression waves in the
        liquid more or less in accordance with the laws of sound waves
        in the liquid. This may be a convenient form of expression and
        it may aid in understanding the present invention to bear in
        mind the analogy between the compression waves in the liquid in
        the pumping system and sound waves. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Acoustic
        inertia or self-induction may be an apparatus having only
        inertia which may be formed for instance by a reduction of a
        section of the pipe. Likewise, acoustic capacity may be a
        chamber communicating with the pipe and filled with the liquid.
        Acoustic inertias, capacities, resistances and leakages may be
        combined to form acoustic filters analogous to electric filters
        and their effect on the compression waves in the pumping system
        may be referred to as low pass filters, high pass filters, and
        band pass filters. The low pass filters may let pass or produce
        vibrations of a frequency lower than a certain speed or may so
        convert other vibrations received. The high pass filters may let
        pass or may produce vibrations of a frequency higher tan a
        certain speed or may so convert other frequencies received. The
        band pass filters may let pass or may produce vibrations of a
        frequency between two certain speeds, or may so convert other
        frequencies received. All of these filters may stop or not let
        pass other vibrations. Acoustic filters may be arranged in
        accordance with the same laws as electric filters. It may be
        easier to make filters occupying a very short space in relation
        to the wavelength. It is possible, however, to employ other
        longer filters but the exact determination of their effect may
        be more difficult. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The analogies
        between electric filters and acoustic filters exist not only
        words but they are true physical analogies. The phenomena of the
        propagation of an electric current and of sound waves and of
        compression waves in liquid are controlled by the same laws. In
        dealing with these waves the combination of acoustic inertia,
        capacities, resistance and leakages accomplish similar results
        as are accomplished by combinations of similar elements in
        electric circuits. In order to facilitate determining the effect
        of a filter, it is desirable that the two extremities of the
        filter be of the same value. It is possible, however, to employ
        filters having extremities of different values. In such an
        arrangement the difference in the two extremities may produce an
        effect of itself. The ideal filter is one which without
        substantial loss of energy will let pass the frequency which it
        is desired to employ in the apparatus and at the same time stop
        other frequencies. Generally filters of this character cannot be
        completely realized in practice, but it is desirable to employ
        filters approaching this ideal as nearly as possible. A general
        filter may be employed or several filters may be employed in a
        single system being associated or combined with similar or
        different filters. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Generally
        electric circuits employ two wires or lines and the induction,
        capacity, resistance and leakage may be installed in one or both
        or between them in series, derivation, or in shunt. In liquid
        systems, especially pumping systems, usually there is but a
        single line or pipe but the inertia, capacity, resistance and
        leakage may be placed in series or in shunt on the line or in
        derivation on the line, in which case the effect is as if the
        element in derivation communicated at one side with the line and
        at the other side with a ground, analogous to the grounding of
        an electrical device. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The effect of
        filters put in derivation may be varied, for example by putting
        a capacity in derivation made not of a closed chamber filled
        with the same liquid but of a closed chamber filled with another
        liquid of entirely different density or elasticity, separated by
        a membrane from the other liquid, or by a chamber filled by the
        same liquid but closed by a membrane which separates the liquid
        from the air. The capacity thus is to be considered as not
        between the line and the ground but between the line and another
        artificial ground. The natural vibration of the liquid will be
        different in the different cases. This chamber filled with the
        different liquid or provide with a membrane may be replaced by a
        cylinder having a floating piston maintained by springs which
        make the piston work like a membrane. The introduction of any of
        these different apparatus having vibration characteristics
        different from the natural vibrations of the line has the effect
        of changing the constants of the line and may be employed in a
        manner similar to the more usual type of filters. Any other
        suitable form of capacity, inertia, resistance or leakage may be
        employed. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">For
        installations operated under substantially constant conditions a
        filter of exact characteristics may be employed, but for other
        installations less exact filters may be employed. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In Figures 9,
        10, and 11 are shown example of characteristic electrical low
        pass filters. In Figures 9a, 10a, and 11a are shown similar low
        pass acoustic filters applied to liquid systems. The arrangement
        in Figure 9a corresponds to that in Figure 9; the arrangement in
        Figure 10a corresponds to that in Figure 10, while that in
        Figure 11a corresponds to that in Figure 11. In each instance
        the electrical inertias are replaced by acoustic inertias 70
        while the electrical capacities 71 are replaced by acoustic
        capacities 72. Figures 12, 13 and 14 illustrate types of
        electric high pass filters, and Figures 12a, 13a, and 14a
        illustrate types of acoustic high pass filters corresponding
        respectively to the electric filters illustrated in Figures 12,
        13, and 14. Figures 15, 16, and 17 illustrate diagrammatically
        electric band pass filters and Figures 15a, 16a, and 17a
        illustrate characteristic acoustic band pass filters applied to
        liquid systems corresponding respectively to the filters
        illustrated in Figures 15, 16 and 17. In all of these figures
        the electrical inertias 69 correspond to the acoustic inertias
        70 and the electrical capacities 71 correspond to the acoustic
        capacities 72. The filter arrangements here illustrated are
        selected as types only. These and other appropriate filters may
        be followed with like effect and the corresponding acoustic
        filters inserted at appropriate points in liquid systems with
        corresponding results, and the term filter is used to include
        all such devices as rectify, transform, alter, or modulate the
        currents of the compression waves set up in the liquid in the
        pumping system. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In Figure 18
        is shown a simple pumping system such as shown in Figure 1 but
        modified by being associated with the filters or wave modifying
        devices illustrated in Figures 3 to 8 inclusive. The capacities
        61, 62, 64, and that having the piston 66 are associated with
        inertias 59 and 60. As illustrated, the inertia 59 and the
        capacity 61 are shown relatively near to the pump cylinder 52
        and the other wave-modifying devices are distributed throughout
        the line 66 being very near the inlet valve 51. 59, 60, and 61
        are in series while 62, 64 and 66 are in derivation. This
        specific arrangement is not essential, nor is it essential that
        all of these devices be incorporated in a single system. In
        general a single device may be sufficient. For instance, the
        inertia 59 might be employed and the devices 60, 61, 62, 64 and
        66 omitted or any two or more of them might be omitted.
        Likewise, the particular position of these various devices in
        the system is not essential. For instance, the inertia 59 might
        be employed and the devices 60, 61, 62, 64 and 66 omitted or any
        two or more of them might be omitted. Likewise, the particular
        position of these various devices in the system is not
        essential. For instance, the device 66 which is shown as near
        the check valve 51 might be installed where the device 61 is
        illustrated near the pump cylinder 52 or any other desired
        arrangement and location of any or all of these devices may be
        made. Instead of assembling in a single system a plurality of
        different wave-modifying devices as illustrated in Figure 18, a
        plurality of similar devices might be employed when one or more
        is desired and the location of all the devices is
        interchangeable. When apparatus such as is illustrated in Figure
        1 is operated, the wave produced in the liquid will have certain
        characteristics and for the conditions of operation it may be
        that that wave is satisfactory and efficient. It may be,
        however, that for the conditions under which the apparatus is
        operating the wave produced by apparatus such as illustrated in
        Figure 1 will not have the desired characteristics and may not
        be effectively efficient to produce the desired pumping effect.
        By adding to the apparatus shown in Figure 1 any one or more of
        the devices illustrated in Figures 3 to 17, the characteristic
        of the wave may be modified so as to produce the desired
        effective efficient result. Thus the wave set up in such an
        apparatus as Figure 18 will have characteristics different from
        the wave set up in such an apparatus as Figure 1 and the
        addition or removal of any one of the impedance or capacity
        devices illustrated in Figure 18 will correspondingly modify the
        wave. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In Figure 19
        is shown assembled in such a pump as is shown in Figure 2 a
        filter such as illustrated in Figure 11a and in Figure 20 such a
        filter as illustrated in Figure 13a is illustrated in connection
        with such a pump as shown in Figure 1. As indicated, when the
        arrangement is applied to a pumping system, there may be present
        only the pipe line, the other pipe being omitted and replaced by
        an artificial ground similarly to the arrangement by which a
        two-wire electric system may be employed with only one wire and
        a ground. In the pumping system the effect of a ground may be
        procured by closing the connection to the omitted pipe.
        Likewise, the filters illustrated in Figures 9a, 10a, 12a, 14a,
        16a and 17a or any grouping or combinations of them or other
        filters may be assembled into a single apparatus. The
        arrangement illustrated in Figure 19 is in part a shunt
        arrangement and, incorporating a low-shunt arrangement, will
        modify the waves in the pumping system and allow only those
        waves having frequencies lower than a certain desired speed or
        it may convert to such speed other vibrations in the system.
        Similarly, the filter associated with the pumping system in
        Figure 20, being a high-pass filter, will modify the waves in
        the pumping system and allow only those waves having frequencies
        higher than a certain desired speed, or it may convert to such
        speed other vibrations in the system. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The devices
        shown are only preferred embodiments of the invention, but any
        other suitable devices may be used for the same purposes. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The weight of
        the check valve or the strength of springs sometimes controlling
        it which change the character of its opening change the value of
        the inertia produced by the opening. The check valve being
        inertia and so a filter element may be omitted and the other
        elements of the apparatus adjusted accordingly. When more than
        one pump is in the line each pump may act as a check valve or
        inlet for the succeeding pump. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Variations in
        the speed of the piston during a stroke are of importance. When
        the piston is moved by a crankshaft the speed increases from
        zero to maximum speed during the first half of the time of the
        entrance of the piston (that is, the first quarter of a complete
        cycle) and produces an acceleration in the lifting of the
        liquid. In the second half of the time of entrance of the piston
        (that is, the second quarter of a complete cycle) the speed of
        the piston decelerates going from its high speed to zero speed.
        Thus the liquid tends to be lifted with more strength when the
        piston is entering during the first half of its forward stroke
        and tends, because of the deceleration, to be lifted with less
        strength in each unit of time when the piston is entering during
        the second half of its forward stroke. In general, under these
        conditions it is better to open the outlet valve when or before
        the piston reaches the half point of the inward stroke.
        Sometimes it may be better to open the valve at the end of the
        entrance stroke of the piston or somewhat before. When a proper
        cam is employed to operate the piston, the piston speed
        increases throughout the entire advance movement so the same
        effect may sometimes be produced by a cam which gives only
        one-half the length of movement to the piston as would be given
        by a corresponding crank. When such a cam is used only one-half
        as much liquid may be forced out of the piston cylinder as with
        a crank and hence at each stroke less liquid need go into the
        cylinder to keep it full in order to get as much liquid output
        from the apparatus. With the most efficient adjustment of the
        apparatus, during the acceleration of the piston liquid is
        lifted, that is to say, the liquid may be moving from the check
        valve to the compressor. If the valve is opened at this moment,
        the liquid which is already moving upward will tend to be lifted
        with more efficiency since it is not obliged to change its
        direction. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The suddenness
        of opening the outlet being the principal element in the
        transformation of the compression waves should be especially
        considered and arranged to cooperate with the rest of the
        system. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">In certain
        cases it may be desired to produce a certain pressure in the
        apparatus at the time the outlet is opened as in this connection
        it seems that the liquid pumped going out with a certain
        pressure will carry with it enough energy to lift the liquid
        higher than the apparatus. The apparatus working in this form
        may work somewhat like a combination of the system employing the
        open cock at the outlet and the system opening and closing the
        valve, retaining thus the advantages of both systems. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The conditions
        involved in the use and application of filters indicate the
        important effect which may be produced by small defects in the
        apparatus such as leakage, holes or couplings or connections
        which allow liquid to pass out, these defects being analogous to
        the bad effect produced in electrical circuits by bad contacts
        or by other defects in different parts of the apparatus, etc.
        The piston may work either with the cylinder horizontal or
        vertical or inclined, or any other suitable means may be
        employed to produce variations in compression in the liquid to
        set up the compression waves. The pipe through which liquid
        flows may be either horizontal or vertical or inclined, and it
        may be curved, bent or straight. All of these arrangements may
        be referred to as pumps, and the term pumping is sued as
        including moving, transporting or conveying in vertical or
        horizontal or inclined directions or a combination of any of
        them, and the liquids so pumped may be simple liquids or may
        carry more or less solid matter or gases.</p>

      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;"><i>Tucson, AZ
        </i>~ Juan Pasco is a retired United nations development
        specialist who not only has found a solution to water problems
        of the world's poor rural areas, but has helped put together a
        Tucson corporation to make a lot of money in the process. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Pascoe's black
        eyes blaze with excitement when he talks about a new pump that
        will push water out of the ground at the rate of two gallons a
        minute, using a one-fifth horsepower that derives its energy
        from four solar panels. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"It's a
        godsend", he says. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Pascoe is the
        president of a Tucson company that will manufacture and market
        the new pump. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The pump is
        the invention of a senior genius who lives in Crossroads. Arthur
        Perry Bentley is the grandson of the man who created the car
        bearing his name. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Bentley's pump
        uses a motor that would barely drive a sewing machine. But its
        work is very limited. All it needs to do is send sonic waves
        down the well pipe to a valved pumping unit at the well's
        bottom. The unit picks up the waves and drives its piston up and
        down. This gushes a whole column of water up the pipe. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">None of this
        takes much energy, Pascoe points out. Only enough to make some
        noise down a pipe. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Bentley has
        also invented a second type of pump, one that slides an electric
        charge down a black well pipe. The entire pipe becomes like a
        capacitor of a discharge system of an electronic ignition. It
        employs its valve system to push the column of water or oil to
        the surface. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Pascoe
        discovered Bentley in the mountains near Ruidoso, NM, where he
        was living a quiet existence, despite the 34 patents in his
        name. With Allyn Spence, an anthropologist with the Office of
        Arid Land Studies at the University of Arizona, Pascoe put
        together a company called <b>Appropriate Technology Development
          Inc</b>. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">No long after
        forming the company, Pascoe and Spence took a prototype pump to
        the Navajo reservation. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"We put it in
        an abandoned well, connected it to four solar panels, and it
        started to bring up water", says Pascoe. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"The Navajo
        came around. The women especially were enchanted. They said,
        'The sun is bringing out the water from the ground? Impossible."
      </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">For Pascoe,
        the experience on the Navajo reservation was confirmation of his
        hope that the pump might have worldwide uses. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">"Knowing what
        I know about the needs of the developing world rural people
        without water or with very little water, I know one of the
        reasons they cannot use traditional pumping gear is because they
        don't have electricity or it is too expensive. Now here is a
        pump that the deeper you go the more efficient it is. You can go
        4,000 feet and bring water up with a little motor that draws
        practically no electricity." </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The Bentley
        pumps are also much less expensive to purchase and maintain than
        other water-pumping technologies. The smaller pumps will replace
        $20,000 windmills on the Navajo reservation at an initial per
        pump cost of $7,000. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">The impact of
        such savings could be profound. The USDA has concluded that the
        biggest expense for farmers who experienced serious drought in
        the last two years is the cost of pumping water. That cost has
        driven more farmers into bankruptcy than any other single
        factor. </p>
      <p style="margin-right: 0.5in; margin-left: 0.5in;">Appropriate
        Technology Development will work with China to have a
        joint-venture manufacturing operation in Shanghai. And it also
        will start making pumps in Tucson sometime soon.</p>

      <p><b>Description ~</b> <br>
        <b>Background of the Invention:</b> <br>
        <b>1. Field of the Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to pumps and more particularly to an
        improved sonic pressure wave surface operated pump. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art ~</b> </p>
      <p>It is well known to provide a pumping mechanism at an
        underground level to pump liquid from that level to the surface,
        with such a down hole pump being operated by a surface located
        mechanism which reciprocally impacts a column of liquid
        contained within a tube that communicates between the surface
        located mechanism and the down hole pump. The surface located
        mechanism, in addition to impacting the column of liquid, is
        reciprocally operated to alternately open and close a liquid
        delivery port. The impaction of the standing column of liquid
        produces hydraulic pressure waves that are transmitted by the
        liquid to the down hold pump to impart a reciprocal movement
        thereto. The down hole pump includes a plunger, or similar
        mechanism, which is biased upwardly by suitable springs, and has
        a central passage formed axially therethrough with a one-way
        check valve located in the lowermost end of the passage. When
        the hydraulic pressure waves move the plunger down against the
        spring bias, the check valve opens to admit the liquid being
        pumped into the passage, and the subsequent upstroke of the
        plunger closes the check valve and causes a general upward
        movement of the standing column of liquid with the uppermost
        portion thereof exiting through the fluid delivery port formed
        in the surface located mechanism. </p>
      <p>Examples of the above described pumping mechanisms, and others
        which operate on that same basic principle, are fully disclosed
        in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,379,539, 2,355,618, 2,572,977, 2,751,848,
        and 3,277,831. </p>
      <p>These prior art pumps critically depend upon ideal adjustment
        of the input frequency relative to the length of the tube in
        which the standing column of liquid is contained, that is,
        resonant timing. Further, such prior art pumps are seriously
        limited in their pumping capacities due to such factors as
        inertia of the liquid, and the like. </p>
      <p><b>Summary of the Invention ~</b> </p>
      <p>In accordance with the present invention, a sonic pressure wave
        surface operated signal tube pump is disclosed as including a
        surface located sonic pressure wave generator from which a
        metallic tube depends so as to communicate with an underground,
        or down hole pumping mechanism that is located at the level of
        the liquid to be pumped. </p>
      <p>The sonic pressure wave generator includes a vertically
        disposed cylinder having a lateral liquid delivery port formed
        therein which is coupled to a remotely located liquid receiving
        reservoir. A piston of special configuration is mounted in the
        cylinder and is reciprocally operated therein by suitable drive
        means, with that reciprocal movement alternately opening and
        closing the liquid delivery port. Additionally, the reciprocal
        movement of the piston will cause it to impact a standing column
        of liquid disposed in the metallic tube to produce sonic
        pressure waves of special character. The liquid impacting face
        of the piston is formed with a centrally located truncated
        conical recess or cavity which extends upwardly into the piston
        with the upper end of that recess communicating with a blind
        cylindrical bore formed axially in the piston. Thus, the lower
        surface or liquid impacting face of the piston is of ring-like
        configuration. </p>
      <p>Impacting of the standing column of liquid contained within the
        metallic tube by a piston configured as described above produces
        sonic pressure waves which pass through a sonic nozzle and move
        downwardly along the inner walls of the metallic tube in a
        spiral-like motion. </p>
      <p>The underground, or down hole pumping mechanism which is
        coupled to the lowermost end of the metallic tube is of
        generally cylindrical configuration having an axial bore formed
        therein. The uppermost end of the axial bore is especially
        configured to form a sonic intensifier chamber which receives
        the downwardly spiraling sonic pressure waves and causes an
        increase in the velocity thereof. A plunger is reciprocally
        mounted in the axial bore of the housing with that plunger
        having an axial passage formed therethrough with a one-way check
        valve located at the lowermost end of that passage. The plunger
        is biased upwardly by a compression spring which counterbalances
        the weight of the standing column of liquid. The downwardly
        spiraling sonic pressure waves, which are increased in velocity
        in the intensifier chamber, impinge upon the head of the plunger
        about its periphery thus forcing the plunger down which opens
        the check valve and admits the liquid being pumped to the axial
        passage formed through the plunger. The impinging sonic pressure
        waves are reflected by the head of the plunger inwardly and
        upwardly into a column centrally of the metallic tube. This
        upwardly moving central column will carry the liquid being
        pumped with it. </p>
      <p>The pump of the present invention configured as described
        above, produces high pump output pressure and velocity, as
        compared with prior art pumps such as those hereinbefore
        described, with that output pressure and velocity being
        considerably higher than could be reasonably expected from a
        pump which operates upon hydraulic pressures alone. Exactly what
        takes place in the pump of the present invention is not clearly
        understood. It is known that the special configuration of the
        piston and the sonic nozzle located in the sonic generator
        produces the sonic pressure waves of a special character and
        those waves, in conjunction with the sonic intensifier chamber
        in the down hole pumping mechanism, are responsible for the
        pump's performance. Exhaustive tests and experiments show that
        the generated sonic pressure waves move along the inner walls of
        the metallic tube in a spiral or threadlike motion and those
        downwardly spiraling waves do not appear to exert any downwardly
        applied pressure or other force on the liquid in the center of
        the tube. The downwardly spiraling pressure waves increase in
        velocity upon entering the sonic intensifier chamber and are
        reflected inwardly and upwardly as hereinbefore described. The
        upwardly moving central column of liquid is believed to be
        augmented with regard to pressure and velocity, by counteraction
        with the downwardly spiraling waves acting like a worm gear or
        lead screw to force the central column countercurrent to the
        generated pressure waves. </p>
      <p>Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to
        provide a new and useful pump. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and
        useful sonic pressure wave surface operated single tube pump. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and
        useful sonic pressure wave surface operated single tube pump
        having high pump output pressure and velocity as compared to
        known pumps. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and
        useful pump of the above described type which includes an
        aboveground sonic pressure wave generator which is coupled by a
        metallic tube to an underground pumping mechanism located at the
        level of the liquid to be pumped. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and
        useful pump of the above described type in which the aboveground
        sonic pressure wave generator includes a reciprocally operable
        piston which upon impacting a standing column of liquid
        contained within the metallic tube will generate sonic pressure
        waves which pass through a sonic nozzle and move downwardly
        along the inner walls of the tube in a spiral motion. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and
        useful pump of the above described character in which the piston
        operable in the sonic pressure wave generator has a truncated
        conical recess formed centrally in its liquid impacting face
        with that recess opening into a blind cylindrical bore formed
        axially in the piston. </p>
      <p>Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and
        useful pump of the above described character in which the
        underground pumping mechanism is provided with a sonic
        intensifier chamber for receiving the sonic pressure waves from
        the metallic tube and increasing the velocity thereof. </p>
      <p>Still another object of the present invention is to provide a
        new and useful pump of the above described character in which
        the underground pumping mechanism includes a plunger which is
        reciprocally operated by the sonic pressure waves to accomplish
        a pumping action, with the pressure waves impinging on the
        plunger and being reflected inwardly and upwardly therefrom to
        provide an upwardly moving central column of liquid in the
        metallic tube, with that central column of liquid carrying the
        liquid being pumped with it to the surface. </p>
      <p>The foregoing objects of the present invention, as well as the
        invention itself, may be more fully understood from the
        following description when read in conjunction with the
        accompany drawings. </p>

      <p><b>Description of the Preferred Embodiment ~</b> </p>
      <p>Referring more particularly to the drawings, <a href="#bent1a">Figure















          1</a> illustrates a ground formation having a surface level 10
        and an underground level 12 containing liquid which is to be
        pumped, such as water, oil, and the like. The sonic pressure
        wave surface operated pump of the present invention is seen to
        be located in the ground formation in a conventional manner, and
        the pump includes, as will hereinafter be described in detail,
        an aboveground sonic pressure wave generator, which is
        identified in its entirety by the reference numeral 14, an
        underground pumping mechanism which is indicated generally by
        the reference numeral 16, and an interconnecting metallic tube
        18. </p>
      <p>It will be noted that in accordance with standard practices,
        particularly in the oil well art, the bore formed in the ground
        formation is lined with a casing 19. </p>
      <p><a href="#bent1a">Figure 1</a> also illustrates a drive means
        20 for operation of the aboveground sonic pressure wave
        generator 14, and a reservoir 22 for receiving the liquid pumped
        by the pump of the present invention. </p>
      <p>The drive means 20 may be any of several well known mechanisms,
        and is shown for illustrative purposes as including an electric
        motor 23 which rotatably drives a fly wheel 24 that is carried
        on its output shaft 25. A crank arm 26 is connected on one of
        its ends by a pivot pin 27 eccentrically mounted on the fly
        wheel 24 and has its outer end connected by a similar pin 28 to
        a piston rod 29 extending from the sonic pressure wave generator
        14. In this manner, the drive means 20 which is a rotatably
        driven mechanism, will supply reciprocal movement to the sonic
        pressure wave generator 14 as will hereinafter be described. </p>
      <p>Referring now to <a href="#bent1b">Figure 2</a> and F<a
          href="#bent1c">igure 3</a>, the sonic pressure wave generator
        14 includes a vertically disposed cylinder 30 having an axial
        bore 31 formed therethrough, with that bore 31 having an open
        top 32 and a sonic nozzle 33 adjacent its open bottom. The top
        32 of the bore 31 is open to accommodate the piston rod 29, and
        the bottom is open so that it will communicate with the bore 34
        formed through the metallic tube 18. The axial bore 31 of the
        vertical cylinder 30 is provided with internal threads 35 formed
        therein proximate the open bottom thereof which provides means
        for coupling the metallic tube 18 to The cylinder 30 in a manner
        which places the axial bore 31 of the cylinder 30 in
        communication with the bore 34 formed through the tube 18. The
        sonic nozzle 33 will hereinafter be described in detail. </p>
      <p>The vertical cylinder 30 is also provided with a liquid
        delivery port 38 which extends laterally from the axial bore 31.
        A conduit 39 is connected to the outlet end of the port 38 and
        extends to the reservoir 22 for delivering pumped liquid thereto
        as will hereinafter become apparent as this description
        progresses. </p>
      <p>The axial bore 31 provided in the vertical cylinder 30 has an
        especially configured piston 40 mounted therein. The upper end
        of the piston 40 has a suitable wrist pin 41 to which the
        previously mentioned piston rod 29 is connected in the
        conventional manner so that the reciprocal motion supplied by
        the drive means 20 will reciprocally move the piston 40 in the
        bore 31. The piston 40 is an elongated cylindrical structure
        having a plurality of annular labyrinth grooves 42 which
        effectively prevent the upward escape of air and/or liquid from
        the cylinder 30. The lower, or fluid impacting face 44 of the
        piston 40 has a truncated conical cavity or recess 46 formed
        axially therein with the upper end of that cavity being in
        communication with a blind cylindrical bore or socket 48 formed
        axially in the piston. Thus, the fluid impacting face 44 of the
        piston 40 is of ring-like configuration. </p>
      <p>The sonic nozzle 33 is seen to be a plug-shaped member or body
        which is affixed, such as by welding, in the bore 31 of the
        cylinder 30 adjacent the open bottom thereof. The nozzle 33 is
        provided with a bore 47 which is coaxial with respect to the
        bore 31 of the cylinder 30 and the bore 34 of the tube 18. The
        bore 47 of the nozzle 33 is configured with an upwardly disposed
        inverted frusto-conical surface and a downwardly disposed
        frustro-conical surface. The upper conical surface is provided
        with a diametrically opposed pair of helical grooves 49 (Figure
        4) formed therein. </p>
      <p>The metallic tube 18, which is connected to the bottom end of
        the sonic pressure wave generator 14, as hereinbefore described,
        contains a standing column (not shown) of the liquid being
        pumped. The downstroke of the piston 40 will cause the piston to
        impact the standing column of liquid which, due to the special
        configuration of the piston and the sonic nozzle will generate
        sonic pressure waves which move downwardly in a spiral-like path
        against the inner walls which define the bore 34 formed in the
        tube 18. It will be noted that the downstroke of the piston 40,
        as seen in Figure 3, will close the lateral liquid delivery port
        38 formed in the cylinder 30. </p>
      <p>The underground, or down hole pumping mechanism 16, may be
        connected to the bottom end of the metallic tube 18 in any
        suitable manner with that connection being shown as the
        mechanism 16 being integral with the tube 18 for illustration
        purposes. In any case, the underground pumping mechanism 16
        includes a housing 50 which is preferably of elongated
        cylindrical configuration due to the ease of lowering such a
        housing down through the casing 19. The housing 50 has an axial
        bore 52 formed therethrough, with that bore being of larger
        diameter than the bore 34 of the metallic tube 18, and is in
        axial communication therewith. The transition between the bores
        34 and 52 is special in that the transition is accomplished by a
        truncated conical surface 53 which, in conjunction with the
        cylindrical area 54 immediately therebelow defines a sonic
        intensifier chamber. The sonic intensifier chamber receives the
        downwardly spiraling sonic pressure waves as they emerge from
        the lower end of the metallic tube 18 and causes those waves to
        increase in velocity. </p>
      <p>A plunger 56 is reciprocally mounted in the bore 52 of the
        housing 50, with that plunger having a head portion 58 at the
        upper end of a reduced diameter tubular body or stem 60. The
        plunger is axially disposed in the bore 52 and has an axial
        passage 62 formed therethrough so as to open upwardly onto the
        top surface of the head 58 centrally thereof and to open
        downwardly at the bottom end of the stem portion 60. The housing
        50 is provided with an internal rib 64 which lies in a plane
        transverse to the longitudinal axis of the bore 52, and that rib
        has an opening 65 formed therethrough so as to be coaxial with
        the bore. A compression spring 66 is interposed between the
        downwardly facing surface of the head 58 and the upwardly facing
        surface of the rib 64. The spring 66 is specifically designed
        for each installation of the pump of the present invention so
        that the spring will substantially counterbalance the weight of
        the standing column of liquid in the metallic tube 18. </p>
      <p>The lower end of the stem 60 of the plunger 56 extends through
        the opening 65 of the rib 64 and has external threads 68 formed
        thereon by which a check valve body 70 is threadingly attached.
        The body 70 has an axial bore formed therethrough with spacedly
        arranged vertically aligned valve seats 71 and 72 formed
        therein. A ball valve 73 is positioned in each of those valve
        seats, with those ball valves and their respective valve seats
        constituting a bleed valve assembly by which occluded air or
        other gas in the liquid being pumped is prevented from reaching
        the axial passage 62 of the plunger 56. In many instances, such
        a bleed valve assembly will not be an absolute requirement. </p>
      <p>The lower end of the housing 52 is provided with internal
        threads 78 with the externally threaded upper end of a nipple 80
        threadingly secured therein. The externally threaded lower end
        of the nipple 80 is threadingly attached to the internal threads
        81 formed in the upper end of an end fitting 82. The end fitting
        82 has a cylinder end wall 83 mounted in its bore immediately
        below the nipple 80, and that end wall 83 is formed with a
        central opening 84 which is in axial alignment with the bore of
        the check valve body 70. A valve seat ring 86 is positioned in
        the bore of the end fitting 82 below the end wall structure 83,
        and the valve seat ring 86 has a central passage in which is
        positioned a ball valve 87. The lowermost end of the fitting 82
        is provided with a second valve seat 88 and a ball valve 89 with
        a central opening extending downwardly therefrom into
        communication with the liquid to be pumped from the underground
        level 12 (<a href="#bent1a">Figure 1</a>). </p>
      <p>It will be noted that although two ball valves are shown for
        the air bleed function, and two ball valves are shown at the
        lowermost end of the down hole pumping mechanism, in many
        instances, only one such ball valve will be necessary. </p>
      <p><b>Operation</b> </p>
      <p>As hereinbefore mentioned, exactly what occurs in the sonic
        pressure wave surface operated pump of the present invention is
        not clearly understood. However, extensive testing and
        experimentation have shown the pump to produce much higher
        output pressure and velocity than could be reasonably expected
        from a pump operating on pure hydraulic principles. Those same
        tests and experiments lead me to believe that the pump operates
        in accordance with the following: </p>
      <p>With the piston 40 of the aboveground sonic pressure wave
        generator 14 at the top of its upstroke as seen in <a
          href="#bent1b">Figure 2</a>, the lateral liquid delivery port
        38 is open. When the piston 40 moves downwardly toward the
        bottom of its downstroke, as shown in Figure 3, the piston will
        close the liquid delivery port 38 and will impact the standing
        column of liquid (not shown) that is contained in the lower
        portion of the axial bore 31 of the housing 30 and in the bore
        34 of the metallic tube 18. Due to the special configuration of
        the piston 40, upon impacting the liquid column, it will
        generate a sonic pressure wave which spirals downwardly about
        the inner walls of the metallic tube 18 without exerting any
        appreciable forces on the central core of the standing liquid
        column. </p>
      <p>Although the function of the sonic nozzle 33 is not clearly
        understood, it is thought that it may act somewhat in the manner
        of a venturi and thus increase the velocity of the sonic
        pressure waves. In initial testing of the pump, the nozzle was
        formed without the helical grooves 49, and the pump functioned
        quite well. However, an abrasive fluid was pumped during one
        testing sequence and very definite spiral or helical troughs
        were cut in the nozzle. After discovery of these troughs, the
        nozzle 33 was intentionally provided with the helical grooves 49
        and this resulted in an improvement in the pumping capacity of
        the pump. </p>
      <p>Upon reaching the lower end of the metallic tube 18, the
        downwardly spiraling sonic pressure waves emerge therefrom into
        the sonic intensifier chamber formed in the upper end of the
        down hole pumping unit 16, and will increase in velocity, and
        impinge upon the upper surface of the head portion 58 of the
        plunger 56. Such impingement will drive the plunger downwardly a
        sufficient amount to unseat the ball valves and admit the liquid
        being pumped into the axial passage 62 of the plunger. The
        impinging sonic pressure waves are reflected inwardly and
        upwardly to form an upwardly moving central column or core in
        the liquid within the metallic tube 18. This upwardly moving
        core will carry the liquid admitted to the passage 52 with it
        thus delivering that liquid to the aboveground sonic pressure
        wave generator 14 whereupon it will exit through the liquid
        delivery port 38. It is believed that the velocity and pressure
        of the upwardly moving central column of liquid is augmented by
        counteraction with the downwardly spiraling sonic pressure waves
        which act like a worm gear or lead screw that forces the central
        column countercurrent to the sonic pressure waves. </p>
      <p>During the above mentioned initial testing of the pump, the top
        surface of the head 58 of the plunger 56 was flat, and the pump
        operated quite well. When the pump was disassembled during one
        of the routine inspections between tests, an endless groove 59
        was machined into the previously flat top surface, and
        subsequent tests showed improved pumping capacity without any
        apparent increase in power consumption. </p>
      <p>It will be understood that the rate of rotation of the fly
        wheel 24, and thus the rate at which the piston 40 reciprocates,
        is related to the depth of a particular well, and the time it
        takes a sonic pressure wave to travel the length of the metallic
        tube 18. The rate of travel of the sonic pressure wave will also
        depend upon the particular liquid being pumped and the metal of
        which the tube 18 is made. By way of example, it will be noted
        that if the tube 18 has a length of approximately 2,500 feet and
        the sonic pressure wave will have a travel rate of approximately
        5,000 feet per second, which has been found to be true of many,
        if not most of the materials under and through which the sonic
        pressure wave passes, it will take one-half of a second for the
        downwardly directed sonic pressure wave to engage the head 58 of
        the plunger 56, and another one-half second for its echo return,
        making a total time of one second per cycle of the piston 40.
        This means that the piston 40 would have to reciprocate 60 times
        per minute. Obviously, the rate of rotation of the fly wheel 24
        which causes a cycle of piston reciprocation would vary with
        wells of different depth to accommodate the time required for a
        sonic pressure wave to travel downwardly and be reflected
        upwardly. </p>
      <p>While the principles of the invention have now been made clear
        in an illustrated embodiment, there will be immediately obvious
        to those skilled in the art, many modifications of structure,
        arrangements, proportions, the elements, materials, and
        components used in the practice of the invention, and otherwise,
        which are particularly adapted for specific environments and
        operation requirements without departing from those principles.
        The appended claims are therefore intended to cover and embrace
        any such modifications within the limits only of the true spirit
        and scope of the invention. </p>
