      Salvatore Cezar Pais is an American physicist, aerospace engineer,
      and inventor who works at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River.
      His patent applications on behalf of his employers have attracted
      international attention for their potential military and
      energy-producing applications, but also doubt about their
      feasibility, and speculation that they may be misinformation
      intended to mislead the United States' strategic adversaries about
      the direction of United States defense research. <b><br>

      I'm always amazed at the ability of the "Gizars" to spot
      intriguing information, especially if it concerns technologies
      that don't normally "show up on the radar" of the lamestream
      corporate controlled media, nor, for that matter, on the radar of
      the alternative research field. But L.G.R. spotted this one, and
      passed it along.<br>
      <br>
      And it's a doozie...<br>
      <br>
      Oh, did we mention, it's capable of a little solar manipulation as
      well?:<br>
      <br>
      ...as well as counteracting the effects of solar-induced Coronal
      Mass Ejections... (Paragraph 0012)<br>
      <br>
      Presumably it will do all this by generating electromagnetic
      fields, which, to accomplish all these feats, would have to be
      extraordinarily strong, but not to worry, because the "the design
      of energy generation machinery with power output levels much
      higher than those currently achievable by conventional means, is
      made possible with this invention."(Paragraph (0012)<br>
      <br>
      At this point, the patent goes on to outline how it's going to do
      all of this, and lo and behold, it does so by spinning a plasma,
      utilizing shells in a sphere of peizoelectric ceramics doped with
      radioactive materials. Of course, I'm over-simplifying, but the
      end result of all of this is that this creates the Mossbauer
      Effect of vibrationally stimulated and cohered releases of gamma
      rays. All of <b>this, according to paragraph 30, will generate
        field strengths per square meter of (get this)
        10,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo,ooo to
        100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 watts. That's ten
        septillion to one hundred octillion watts.</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Per square meter.</b><br>
      <br>
      I dunno about you, but this seems to me to be quite a lot of
      deflection. Maybe even enough to "grab and throw"; it's a handy
      thing to have around to "snag" an asteroid, mine it, and then
      throw it away. And you could make it do double duty: when you're
      done mining it, you could throw it at someone you don't like...<br>
      <br>
      See you on the flip side...<br>

            Tech Boss Claims Key 'UFO' Patent Is Operable </b></font><br>
      </div>
      <div align="center"><i>Navy officials claim their radical
          electromagnetic and superconductor technologies aren't
          theoretical, they’re already operable in some form.</i><i><br>
        </i><b>By Brett Tingley</b><br>

      <b>Tingley.Brett@gmail.com<br>
        August 2, 2019<br>
        <br>
      </b>Last month, The War Zone reported on a series of strange
      patent applications the U.S. Navy has filed over the last few
      years and questioned what their connections may be with the
      ongoing saga of Navy personnel reporting incidents involving
      unidentified objects in or near U.S. airspace. <br>
      <br>
      We have several active Freedom of Information Act requests with
      the Department of Navy to pursue more information related to the
      research that led to these patents. As those are being processed,
      we've continued to dig through the U.S. Patent and Trademark
      Office's (USPTO) Public Patent Application Information Retrieval
      database to get as much context for these patents as possible.<br>
      <br>
      In doing so, we came across documents that seem to suggest, at
      least by the Navy's own claims, that two highly peculiar Navy
      patents, the room temperature superconductor (RTSC) and the
      high-energy electromagnetic field generator (HEEMFG), may in fact
      already be in operation in some manner. The inventor of the Navy's
      most bizarre patent, the straight-out-of-science fiction-sounding
      hybrid aerospace/underwater craft, describes that craft as
      leveraging the same room temperature superconductor technology and
      high energy electromagnetic fields to enable its unbelievable
      speed and maneuverability. If those two technologies are already
      operable as the Navy claims, could this mean the hybrid craft may
      also already operable or close to operable? Or is this just more
      evidence that the whole exotic 'UFO' patent endeavor on the Navy's
      behalf is some sort of ruse or even gross mismanagement of
      resources?<br>
      <br>
      At the heart of these questions is the term “operable.” In most
      patent applications, applicants must assert proof of a patent’s or
      invention’s “enablement,” or the extent to which a patent is
      described in such a way that any person who is familiar with
      similar technologies or techniques would be able to understand it,
      and theoretically reproduce it.<br>
      <br>
      However, in these patent documents, the inventor Salvatore Pais,
      Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division's (NAWCAD) patent
      attorney Mark O. Glut, and the U.S. Naval Aviation Enterprise's
      Chief Technology Officer Dr. James Sheehy, all assert that these
      inventions are not only enabled, but operable. To help me
      understand what that term may mean in these contexts, I reached
      out to Peter Mlynek, a patent attorney. <br>
      <br>
      Mlynek informed me that the terms “operable” or “operability” are
      not common in patent applications, but that there is little doubt
      that the use of the term is meant to assert to the USPTO that
      these inventions actually work:<br>
      <br>
      "Generally, patent applications are rejected on the basis of
      enablement more frequently than for operability. The Patent Office
      rejects patent applications based on enablement because the patent
      attorney did not describe the invention fully, because either the
      patent attorney did a sloppy job, or the patent attorney caved to
      the client's pressure to disclose as little about the invention as
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      "Operability/operative, on the other hand, means that the
      invention actually works. From what I've seen, operability
      rejection comes up in cases where the patent attorney does not
      really understand the science or technology behind the invention.
      In many cases, the rejection based on inoperability is a kind of
      way of telling the patent attorney that the attorney has no idea
      what he/she is talking about."<br>
      <br>
      All of these technologies - the room temperature superconductor,
      the high-energy electromagnetic field generator, and the hybrid
      aerospace/underwater craft (HUAC) - are inventions of the same
      NAWCAD aerospace engineer, the aforementioned Salvatore Cezar
      Pais. Our previous article on the Navy’s patents explored the
      hybrid craft and whether or not it could be related to other
      developments such as Navy pilots reporting strange objects in U.S.
      airspace during training exercises and members of Congress now
      asking for answers on UFOs. <br>
      <br>
      In a conference paper that Pais presented earlier this year at the
      2019 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)
      SciTech Forum in San Diego, the inventor states that the research
      that led to all of these technologies was funded by a single Naval
      Innovative Science &amp; Engineering (NISE) – Basic &amp; Applied
      Research (BAR) program, titled “The High Energy Electromagnetic
      Field Generator (HEEMFG).” <br>
      <br>
      In the Navy’s patent application for the HUAC, it’s claimed that
      the radical abilities of propulsion and maneuverability are made
      possible thanks to an incredibly powerful electromagnetic field
      that essentially creates a quantum vacuum around itself that
      allows it to ignore aerodynamic or hydrodynamic forces and remove
      its own inertial mass from the equation. Thus, the ability to
      generate such high-frequency electromagnetic waves is key to the
      alleged abilities of this theoretical hybrid craft that can soar
      near effortlessly through air and water at incredible speeds with
      little to no resistance or inertia.<br>
      <br>
      In the patent application documents for the HEEMFG, we came across
      a record of an interview requested by Pais and the Navy as part of
      the appeal process for the patent’s initial rejection. During this
      telephone interview, which took place on July 10, 2018, Pais and
      the Navy’s attorney presented evidence that the high energy
      electromagnetic field generator was, in fact, operable and was a
      “formative invention in its incipient stage(s).”<br>
      <br>
      In the patent for the HEEMFG, the technology is described as being
      able to create what is essentially a force field straight out of
      science fiction, one that could generate “an impenetrable
      defensive shield to sea and land as well as space-based military
      and civilian assets, protecting these assets from such threats as
      Anti-Ship Ballistic Missiles, Radar Evading Cruise Missiles, Top
      Attack for Main Battle Tanks (land and sea-based systems), as well
      as counteracting the effects of solar-induced Coronal Mass
      Ejections or defending critical military satellites in an ASAT
      [anti-satellite] role (space based system).”<br>
      <br>
      In his presentation at the 2019 AIAA SciTech Forum, Pais claims
      that this device could even serve as an optimal asteroid deflector
      to save the world from 99942 Apophis, a 370-meter diameter
      near-Earth asteroid which has been predicted to come dangerously
      close to our planet in 2029 and 2036. <br>
      <br>
      While saving the world from a massive asteroid is without a doubt
      a worthwhile application of this alleged high energy
      electromagnetic field generator, the military applications of this
      supposed technology would give a paradigm-exploding advantage to
      any military wielding such an impenetrable electromagnetic force
      field. Is it only a hypothetical technology, though? The inventor
      and his attorney assured the patent office it is indeed operable,
      at least to some degree.<br>
      <br>
      Many readers have also questioned whether or not Salvatore Cezar
      Pais is, in fact, a real person. In our search for information
      about the elusive inventor, we have found a few mentions in one of
      his alma mater's class notes updates, which states that Pais
      obtained his undergraduate degree in 1990 and a graduate degree in
      1993 in mechanical engineering. The Mathematics Genealogy Project,
      meanwhile, states he obtained his Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve
      University in 1999.<br>
      <br>
      We also came across this image purporting to depict Pais on a
      Chinese news blog which covered our original patent story, but we
      have so far been unable to ascertain its veracity. However, a
      smaller version of the same picture appears on a U.K.-based book
      review site under the author name Salvatore Cezar Pais.<br>
      <br>
      While the HEEMFG sounds like pure science fiction, another one of
      Pais’ patents may be somewhat closer to reality, depending on who
      you ask. For years, scientists have sought to create
      room-temperature superconductors, electrical circuits with zero
      resistance that generate powerful electromagnetic fields. Most
      superconductors require incredibly low temperatures, however,
      making them impractical for most uses outside of laboratories or
      other carefully controlled environments. <br>
      <br>
      As noted by Pais in his 2019 AIAA presentation, "the achievement
      of room-temperature superconductivity (RTSC) represents a highly
      disruptive technology, capable of a total paradigm change in
      Science and Technology,” and adds that its “military and
      commercial value is considerable." <br>
      <br>
      Several recent experiments into room temperature or
      high-temperature superconductivity have had some preliminary
      success, which suggests this once-out-of-reach technology could
      possibly become obtainable with further research. A 2019 Nature
      article summarizing results with room temperature
      superconductivity under high pressure states that "it seems more
      likely than ever that the dream of room-temperature
      superconductivity might be realized in the near future" and that
      "experimental data now confirm superconductivity at higher
      temperatures than ever before."<br>
      <br>
      Nevertheless, Pais’ room temperature superconductor patent was
      rejected under 35 U.S.C. 101 because the examiner determined “the
      disclosed invention is inoperative and therefore lacks utility”
      and that “no assertions of room-temperature superconductivity have
      currently been recognized or verified by the scientific
      community.” That code states that patents will be granted only for
      "any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition
      of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof." <br>
      <br>
      According to the Manual of Patent Examining Procedure (MPEP) code
      2164.07, patents are rejected on these grounds in cases “when the
      examiner concludes that an application claims an invention that is
      non-useful, inoperative, or contradicts known scientific
      principles.”<br>
      <br>
      Following that rejection, Naval Aviation Enterprise Chief
      Technology Officer Dr. James Sheehy once again stepped in to write
      a letter to the USPTO personally to vouch for the room temperature
      superconductor, going so far as to declare that the RTSC is
      “operable and enabled via the physics described in the patent
      application” and Pais’ publications. Again, the keyword here is
      “operable,” which has a different meaning than simply “enabled.”<br>
      <br>
      Sheehy assures the examiner that he is “well versed in the
      generation of electromagnetic fields, high temperature super
      conductivity, and physics in general.” Note, too, the last line:
      Sheehy’s declaration was made with the knowledge that false
      statements to the USPTO are punishable by fine or imprisonment.<br>
      <br>
      Sheehy’s letter was accompanied by a statement from Naval Aviation
      Enterprise attorney Mark Glut in which Glut states that “Sheehy
      states the invention is operable and enabled, thus overcoming both
      rejections."<br>
      <br>
      In a separate appeal document, Glut states that in the case of the
      RTSC patent, “there is no reason to doubt the truth of the
      statements contained in the specification” and that the patent
      office “must provide a factual basis for an enablement rejection,
      rather than conclusory statements regarding the state of
      conventional scientific theory.”<br>
      <br>
      Glut goes even further with somewhat of a dig at USPTO examiner
      Paul A. Wartalowicz, writing that in the case of this rejection,
      “the examiner turned to perceived mainstream science to indicate
      the concept was not possible” but that “in this matter, the
      gatekeepers of science (the peer reviewers of Applicant’s papers)
      indicated the concept is possible and enabled.”<br>
      <br>
      However, it's important to note that while many of Pais'
      publications were published in peer-reviewed journals, his most
      recent publication wasn’t actually peer-reviewed. The publication
      “Room Temperature Superconducting System for use on a Hybrid
      Aerospace-Undersea Craft” does not appear in a peer-reviewed
      journal, but was instead presented at the 2019 AIAA SciTech Forum.
      <br>
      <br>
      On the AIAA’s Abstract Submission Process &amp; Requirements page,
      it is stated that “All abstracts will be evaluated by qualified
      individuals from industry, academia, or government. It is
      recommended to the Technical Program Committee to have the
      broadest representation of reviewers appropriate for the
      forum/conference. Exceptions may be made for invited abstracts.
      Please note that this is a review of abstracts only and that
      AIAA’s meeting papers are not peer-reviewed.” Thus, the statements
      made by the Navy attorney aren’t entirely accurate.<br>
      <br>
      In another one of the correspondences between the USPTO and the
      Navy regarding the Room Temperature Superconductor patent, the
      examiner writes that “in such instances where the utility of the
      claimed invention is based upon allegations that border on the
      incredible or allegations that would not be readily accepted by a
      substantial portion of the scientific community, sufficient
      substantiating evidence of operability needs to be submitted by
      appellant.” <br>
      <br>
      Following that rejection, Pais and NAWCAD’s patent attorney Mark
      Glut requested a telephone interview that took place on June 6,
      2019. According to the USPTO’s public database, the appeals
      surrounding the room temperature superconductor are still ongoing
      despite the declarations made by Dr. James Sheehy and attorney
      Mark Glut.<br>
      <br>
      After our last article on these bizarre Navy Patents, and the
      hybrid craft patent, in particular, some readers were quick to
      point out that like the physicists I have spoken with while
      researching these patents, they are unconvinced that the Navy may
      have actually already developed, or even could develop, radical
      new forms of electromagnetic propulsion or the room-temperature
      superconductors the patents and their related publications
      describe as the key component in their operability. <br>
      <br>
      To help contextualize the science or pseudoscience behind these
      patents and what it may or may not signify, I spoke with Dr. Mark
      Gubrud, a University of North Carolina physicist who teaches
      Peace, War &amp; Defense courses and whose PhD is in ultra-low
      temperature and nanoscale experimental physics. Like many
      physicists, Gubrud has for years encountered claims of
      room-temperature superconductors and so-called spacetime metric
      engineering:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In the past, I have attended conferences of
      'free energy' and 'cold fusion' cranks, and encountered very
      similar claims. The claim to have developed, or know how to
      develop, a room-temperature superconductor is a perennial; so are
      claims based on some woolly physics to alter space, inertial mass
      or the laws of motion. One sees these things at the meetings and
      in the publications that constitute a crackpot hobby industry
      which is mostly about the vanity of its participants.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pais's patents flow as an intimidating river of
      mumbo-jumbo that most trained physicists would recognize as
      nonsense, although many might simply disengage in confusion, and
      there are always some who might even be credulous. Of what,
      however, is hard to say, as it is not really clear what Pais is
      even claiming, apart from the room-temperature superconductor
      which, if it were true, would be huge news.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pais deploys fairly sophisticated babble to
      make this sound plausible to those who know what real physics
      sounds like, but don't understand much of it. Which is likely to
      include most patent examiners, journalists, and Pais's own
      enablers in the Navy."<br>
      <br>
      I asked for Gubrud’s opinion on why Dr. James Sheehy would vouch
      for Pais’ patents, to which he replied that it’s likely someone at
      NAWCAD has been misled or fooled:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know why Sheehy defended Pais's
      patents. I am certain it's not because they really make some kind
      of sense. I suspect the story is just one professional charlatan
      who has embedded himself in the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft
      Division, plus one or a few supervisors he's managed to fool. It's
      possible, of course, that it is a bigger story which involves some
      actual 'experiments' and expenditure of funds, which is now being
      protected from scrutiny."<br>
      <br>
      Ultimately, Guburd believes the patents signify nothing more than
      “an illustration of the need for transparency and peer review,”
      but that “even with such niceties, nonsense gets funded, often for
      political and ideological reasons, or simply out of corruption.
      But nonsense seems an especially hardy perennial in hierarchical,
      closed and secretive organizations.”<br>
      <br>
      Despite months of research and FOIA requests, it’s still unclear
      why the Navy would go to bat so vehemently for these patents
      which, as another physicist I spoke with put it, “bear no more
      resemblance to quantum physics as I understand it than does ‘The
      Force’ from Star Wars."<br>
      <br>
      If the Navy has indeed managed to develop operable room
      temperature superconductors and electromagnetic force fields,
      these technologies would revolutionize warfare in ways not seen in
      centuries, or maybe even ever, not to mention leading to paradigm
      changes in civilian technology. Yet the largest question remains:
      if the Navy indeed possesses these technologies, or even thinks
      they are obtainable in the near term, why make the patents public?
      <br>
      <br>
      With all this in mind, it's certainly possible that these patents
      are part of some ongoing information campaign designed to make
      America’s competitors question what types of black budget research
      is currently underway at NAWCAD and other research organizations.
      With so many revolutionary new aerospace technologies on the brink
      of deployment, perhaps this is an attempt to essentially
      “weaponize” patents and sow doubt among our adversaries and even
      inject confusion among the American populace. <br>
      <br>
      That scenario seems more likely given the fact that the Naval
      Aviation Enterprise Chief Technical Officer Dr. Sheehy claimed
      Chinese advances in similar capabilities as a means of getting the
      hybrid aerospace/underwater craft patent application approved. The
      U.S. and China are in a new technological arms race to develop the
      next generations of aircraft and advanced weaponry. Part of this
      race includes producing disinformation and misinformation to make
      your enemy invest resources, both intelligence and research and
      development related, that are, for lack of a better word,
      dead-ends. <br>
      <br>
      Being able to explain away strange objects in the sky as UFOs,
      which may indeed be emerging classified capabilities, is also
      beneficial both here at home and abroad. Overall, these patents
      certainly add to an increasingly complex narrative mosaic that is
      emanating directly from the Navy, one that began just as a new era
      of so-called 'great power competition' was being declared at the
      highest rungs of the Pentagon's leadership.<br>
      <br>
      At the same time, maybe this is the Pentagon's grasping attempt to
      try to make sense of and emulate mysterious and seemingly highly
      advanced craft that are supposedly being increasingly observed
      near its own aircraft, vessels, and installations. Maybe the
      Chinese competition claim is just a placeholder for the unknown. <br>
      <br>
      It's also at least worth considering that some breakthroughs in
      highly exotic propulsion might have been made and that the Navy is
      willing to invest big bucks into seeing them progress further.
      Maybe those advances happened many years ago and only now is the
      Pentagon willing to slowly disclose them. Or all this could be a
      case of wasteful, misguided, or even downright corrupt spending on
      ideas that have no real chance of paying off down the line. <br>
      <br>
      The bottom line is that after months of investigation, reaching
      out directly to the Navy and all those involved, as well filing
      numerous FOIA requests that will take months or even years to
      process, there is still so much we don't know about the
      technological developments the Navy is pursuing or that it is at
      least acting like it's pursuing. The existence of these patents
      and the underlying documentation we've brought to light and
      examined has only made this case more puzzling, especially in
      contrast to experts we have talked to who claim there is no way
      these patents could describe actual working technologies.<br>
      <br>
      One thing is certain, our investigation into these patents and the
      Navy-funded research that led to them has only just begun.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>The electromagnetic field generator includes a shell, an
      electrostatic generator, a power plant, a thermoelectric
      generator, and an electric motor. The shell has embedded
      polycrystalline ferroelectric ceramic material which is polarized
      such that the ceramic material exhibits strong Piezoelectric
      Effect properties thus inducing high frequency vibrations. The
      shell may be further doped with radioactive elements which under
      high frequency vibrations induce gamma ray emission. The
      electrostatic generator is for charging up the shell and is
      disposed within the shell. The power plant is to generate thermal
      power, and is disposed within the sphere. The thermoelectric
      generator is to convert the thermal power generated by the power
      plant to electrical energy. The electric motor powered by the
      electrical energy generated by the thermoelectric generator, and
      supplies input voltage such that the shell spins at high angular
      speeds, vibrates at high frequencies, and generates an
      electromagnetic field.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>A craft using an inertial mass reduction device comprises of
      an inner resonant cavity wall, an outer resonant cavity, and
      microwave emitters. The electrically charged outer resonant cavity
      wall and the electrically insulated inner resonant cavity wall
      form a resonant cavity. The microwave emitters create high
      frequency electromagnetic waves throughout the resonant cavity
      causing the resonant cavity to vibrate in an accelerated mode and
      create a local polarized vacuum outside the outer resonant cavity
      wall.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b>A plasma compression fusion device which includes a hollow
      duct and at least one pair of opposing counter-spinning dynamic
      fusors. The hollow duct includes a vacuum chamber disposed within
      the hollow duct. Each dynamic fusor has a plurality of orifices
      and an outer surface which is electrically charged. In
      combination, the pair(s) of dynamic fusors create a concentrated
      magnetic energy flux and electromagnetic radiation within the
      vacuum chamber, whereby the concentrated magnetic energy flux
      compresses a mixture of gases that are injected through the
      orifices to the vacuum chamber such that a plasma core is created,
      and the to electromagnetic radiation heats the plasma core, while
      produced magnetic fields confine the plasma core between the
      dynamic fusors, such that when an additional mixture of gases is
      introduced into the plasma core through the orifices, an energy
      gain is created.<br>

      </b>A high frequency gravitational wave generator including a gas
      filled shell with an outer shell surface, microwave emitters,
      sound generators, and acoustic vibration resonant gas-filled
      cavities. The outer shell surface is electrically charged and
      vibrated by the microwave emitters to generate a first
      electromagnetic field. The acoustic vibration resonant gas-filled
      cavities each have a cavity surface that can be electrically
      charged and vibrated by acoustic energy from the sound generators
      such that a second electromagnetic field is generated. The two
      acoustic vibration resonant gas-filled cavities are able to
      counter spin relative to each other to provide stability, and
      propagating gravitational field fluctuations are generated when
      the second electromagnetic field propagates through the first
      electromagnetic field.<br>
