      </div>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is one of the most important fuels of the future, and the
      sun will be one of our most important sources of energy. Why not
      combine the two to produce hydrogen directly from solar energy
      without any detours involving electrical current? Why not use a
      process similar to the photosynthesis used by plants to convert
      sunlight directly into chemical energy?<br>
      <br>
      Researchers from the German Max Planck Institute have now
      developed a catalyst that may do just that. As they report in the
      journal Angewandte Chemie, titanium disilicide splits water into
      hydrogen and oxygen. And the semiconductor doesn’t just act as a
      photocatalyst, it also stores the gases produced, which allows an
      elegant separation of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>

      Researchers from the German Max Planck Institute have now
      developed a catalyst that may do just that. As they report in the
      journal Angewandte Chemie, titanium disilicide splits water into
      hydrogen and oxygen. And the semiconductor doesn’t just act as a
      photocatalyst, it also stores the gases produced, which allows an
      elegant separation of hydrogen and oxygen.<br>
      <br>
      “The generation of hydrogen and oxygen from water by means of
      semiconductors is an important contribution to the use of solar
      energy,” explains Martin Demuth (of the Max Planck Institute for
      Bioinorganic Chemistry in Mülheim an der Ruhr). “Semiconductors
      suitable for use as photocatalysts have been difficult to obtain,
      have unfavorable light-absorption characteristics, or decompose
      during the reaction.”<br>
      <br>
      Demuth and his team have now proposed a class of semiconductors
      that have not been used for this purpose before: Silicides. For a
      semiconductor, titanium disilicide (TiSi2) has very unusual
      optoelectronic properties that are ideal for use in solar
      technology. In addition, this material absorbs light over a wide
      range of the solar spectrum, is easily obtained, and is
      inexpensive<br>
      <br>
      At the start of the reaction, a slight formation of oxide on the
      titanium disilicide results in the formation of the requisite
      catalytically active centers. “Our catalyst splits water with a
      higher efficiency than most of the other semiconductor systems
      that also operate using visible light,” says Demuth.<br>
      <br>
      One aspect of this system that is particularly interesting is the
      simultaneous reversible storage of hydrogen. The storage capacity
      of titanium disilicide is smaller than the usual storage
      materials, but it is technically simpler. Most importantly,
      significantly lower temperatures are sufficient to release the
      stored hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      The oxygen is stored as well, but is released under different
      conditions than the hydrogen. It requires temperatures over 100°C
      and darkness. “This gives us an elegant method for the easy and
      clean separation of the gases,” explains Demuth. He and his
      German, American, and Norwegian partners have founded a company in
      Lörrach, Germany, for the further development and marketing of the
      proprietary processes.<br>

      Divide and separate: Photocatalytic splitting of water into
      hydrogen and oxygen is achieved with a catalyst which is formed on
      the surface of titanium dicilicide (see picture). The two product
      gases are reversibly physisorbed by the catalyst. Desorption of
      hydrogen occurs at ambient temperature, but oxygen is entirely
      stored up to 100?°C in light and can be released upon heating at
      this temperature in the dark, which allows convenient separation
      of the gases.<br>

      Electricity is generated simultaneously or separately from water
      decomposition. In the case where only electricity is produced, the
      silicide is illuminated but there is no contact with water.
      Otherwise contact is made with water, under illumination. Metallic
      and non-metallic silicides are used. The silicides have the
      molecular formula RSi. R is an organic, organometallic, and/or
      inorganic radical (or a mixture). Si represents silicon. In listed
      formulae, R is present as one or more atoms of Ti, Ni, Fe, Th, B
      (silicon tetraboride), Co, Pt, Mn, CSi/poly-CSi, Ir, N, Zi, Ta, V
      and Cr. The silicide contains at least one silicon atom with
      increased electron density. The silicide acts as a catalyst and
      receiver of artificial and solar light. The light participates in
      a photo-electrical process e.g. water decomposition, and/or a
      photovoltaic process generating electricity. The silicides serve
      as electrodes in a conductive-electrolyte system. They are
      connected with one or more opposite electrodes. Current is
      generated, with or without water decomposition. The opposite
      electrode is conductive. It is a: metal, transition metal, metal
      oxide, transition metal oxide, non-metallic structure and/or mixed
      structure. The two types of operation, photoelectric and
      photovoltaic, proceed separately or in combination. The silicide
      is in crystalline form and the artificial light and/or sunlight is
      concentrated and/or diffuse. With silicide electrodes connected to
      conductive opposite electrodes, each with suitable doping,
      electrolyte can be dispensed with and the electrodes are in direct
      connection. The light sources and/or additional thermal energy
      sources emit energy in the waveband 200-15000 nm. Silicide light
      absorption is increased by one or more dyes. These are coupled,
      complexed, coated or bonded to the silicide. The dyes are
      perylenes and their analogs. High temperatures and light
      concentrations enhance reaction. Energy introduced for this
      purpose comes from e.g. electrical-, microwave- and/or geothermal
      heating. Other oxide semiconductors are listed as agents actively
      assisting the process. The silicides are immobilized in e.g.
      listed polymers or glasses. These are conductive. Numerous
      possible electrode dopants are listed.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a process for the
      photoelectrochemical production of hydrogen and oxygen from water
      and of electricity, this in the presence of silicides (silicides)
      in general and especially in presence of metal silicides and
      nonmetallic silicides, such as borosilicides, carbon-containing
      silicides and nitrogen-containing silicides, i.e., compounds
      containing silicon and having the composition RSix. R represents
      in this connection an organic, metallic, organometallic,
      non-metallic or inorganic residue and Si stands for the element
      silicon (silicon) with an increasing number of atoms X&gt;0. In
      the following text, these classes of substances are named
      silicides. The silicide subunits of these substances are
      characterized by enhanced electron density. The silicides in the
      aforementioned processes catalytically active wherein these
      processes can occur with or without light. However, when
      illuminated, using artificial light and sunlight, an increase of
      gas evolution is observed. Higher reaction temperatures are often
      accelerating the reaction. Silicides are mostly semiconductor
      materials.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The silicides are used as electrode materials
      (alternatively as anode or cathode), coupled with a counter
      electrode (e.g., a metal, a metal oxide or another conducting
      material and/or as a light-harvesting material as a part of a
      photoelectronic/electrical process. In this way, they can be
      employed as part of a photovoltaic system. The silicides serve to
      (a) produce hydrogen and oxygen from water in the presence of
      light and (b) to also simultaneously or separately produce
      electricity (electrical energy). In case of (b), liquid and/or
      non-liquid electrolytes are employed and for the purely
      photovoltaic application, with suitable doping of the electrodes,
      electrolytes can be eliminated entirely.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] Furthermore, it was found that coupling or complexing of a
      dye, such as perylenes or analogs thereof, to the silicides is
      favorable for the light absorption of these substances as well as
      the charge separation and hence the reactivity of the silicides.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Further, it was found that reactions with silicides for
      splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen in presence of light for
      the purpose of generating hydrogen and oxygen but also for
      generating electricity can be performed also with immobilized
      silicides, i.e., with silicides which are located on or in
      polymeric materials and/or on or in glasses or glass-like
      materials as well as on or in electrically/electronically
      conducting materials. This applies also to the photovoltaic
      application of the silicides. The process of the invention
      delivers aside from hydrogen and oxygen also electricity, i.e.,
      electric energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0005] For carrying out photochemical reactions to produce
      hydrogen and oxygen from water with metallic catalysts, several
      processes have been disclosed. These are lanthanide-like
      photcatalysts such as, for example, NaTaO3:La, catalysts from rare
      earth metals, such as R2Ti2O7 (R=Y, rare earth metal), or
      TiO2-derived semiconductor systems, so-called tandem cells,
      wherein up to now no use of silicides has been disclosed for the
      application according to the title.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The processes for production of hydrogen and oxygen from
      water are based on reduction and/or oxidation of water with
      semiconductor materials and light. Such processes are also named
      water splitting processes. The hitherto disclosed processes use UV
      light. Although in some cases an appreciable development of
      hydrogen and oxygen has been found, the required illumination
      conditions are not suitable for solar-based application of the
      process. In addition, the production of the catalysts is laborious
      and requires the use of uneconomically high temperatures, starting
      from expensive basic materials of extremely high purity.
      Furthermore, for performing the aforementioned processes the use
      of very pure (triple distilled) water is required. In most cases
      there is no mention with respect to long-term applicability and
      the related stability of the catalysts.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] The only promising approach so far employs silicide powder
      wherein the semiconductor itself splits the water into hydrogen
      and oxygen gas in presence of light. Oxygen has to be separately
      removed from the system. All these systems can be used only to
      split water and not for simultaneously or separately occurring
      production of electric power (photovoltaic principle).<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Silicides have so far not been used for the configuration
      of photovoltaic systems. Only in individual cases (i.e., IrSi2 and
      beta-FeSi2) electrical and optical properties of films were
      measured.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] Surprisingly, it has now been found that these
      disadvantages can be avoided when using silicides (silicides),
      i.e. metal silicides and non-metallic silicides such as
      borosilicides, carbon-containing silicides and nitrogen-containing
      silicides, i.e., compounds that contain silicon and have the
      composition RSix, when these processes are carried out according
      to a photoelectric principle, i.e., when the silicides are used as
      light absorbers and/or electrode. R can be an organic, metallic,
      organometallic or inorganic moiety and Si stands for the element
      silicon (silicon) with an increasing number of atoms X&gt;0. In
      the following text these classes of substances are named
      silicides. The silicide subunits of these compounds are
      characterized by an enhanced electron density, i.e., a negative
      charge density, or they have a negative charge.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Non-metallic silicides such as borosilicides,
      carbon-containing silicides and nitrogen-containing silicides are
      also called silicon borides, silicon carbides and silicon
      nitrides, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Examples of silicides, metal silicides and non-metallic
      silicides, such as borosilicides, carbon-containing silicides and
      nitrogen-containing silicides are nickel silicide (Ni2Si), iron
      silicide (FeSi2, FeSi), thallium silicide (ThSi2), borosilicide,

      silicide (YSi), lanthanum silicide (LaSi), cerium silicide (CeSi),
      praseodymium silicide (PrSi), neodymium silicide (NdSi), samarium

      silicide (MoPSi), tungsten-phosphorus silicide (WPSi), titanium
      phosphorus silicide (TIPSi), cobalt-boron silicide (Co5BSi2),

      (W2BSi), titanium-boron silicide (TiBSi), chromium-arsenic
      silicide (CrAsSi), tantalum-arsenic silicide (TaSiAs),
      titanium-arsenic silicide (TiAsSi) or mixtures thereof. Notably,
      the elemental compositions given in parentheses (empirical
      formulas) are exemplary only and the ratios of the elements
      relative to each other are variable.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Silicides are abundant and easily accessible materials
      (mostly semiconductor materials) and so far have not been applied
      for the applications according to the title in
      photoelectrochemical as well as photovoltaic application.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Silicides are mainly semiconductor-like materials with high
      electron densities (negative charge densities) at the silicon,
      carbon, nitrogen and boron. The claimed processes for the
      production of hydrogen and/or oxygen by means of silicides proceed
      efficiently with light. The employed light energy can be in this
      connection artificial or solar-generated (emission range:
      200-15,000 nm) and can be of diffuse or concentrated nature. The
      thermal energy which accompanies photonic energy of a light source
      or also thermal energy in general can accelerate the gas-producing
      claimed processes. In general terms, the application of higher
      temperatures as well as higher light concentrations can lead to a
      higher efficiency of the claimed processes. This applies not only
      to water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen but also to the
      production of electricity via photovoltaics, i.e., electric
      energy, which can proceed jointly or separately with water
      splitting.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The silicides are applied as electrode materials
      (alternatively as cathode or anode) in these photoelectrochemical
      and photovoltaic processes and are coupled to one or several
      counter electrode(s) (alternatively as anode(s) or cathode(s)) in
      an electrically conducting manner. The counter electrodes have to
      be of metallic or non-metallic but electrically conducting nature.
      In this arrangement an electrolyte is used between the electrodes.
      For the purely photovoltaic application of the silicides, with
      suitable p-/n-doping of the electrode materials the presence of an
      electrolyte is not necessary and the electrodes can be brought in
      direct contact.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] When used as part of a photovoltaic device undoped or doped
      silicides (see doping examples below) are used that are brought
      into electrically conducting contact. In this connection, also
      other photoelectrically/photovoltaically active materials can be
      employed; this also external to the system as a light absorber.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The silicides absorb themselves usually enough solar or
      artificial radiation energy without requiring larger surface
      modifications in order to effect splitting of water for generating
      hydrogen and oxygen or for simultaneously or separately occurring
      generation of electricity (photovoltaics).<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Surprisingly, it was found also that the quality and purity
      of the employed water is not important or can be neglected for
      carrying out the processes according to the title, i.e., relative
      to the oxidation and reduction of water and/or the simultaneously
      or separately occurring generation of electricity (photovoltaics).<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The reactivity of the silicides with respect to water
      splitting claimed in this application for generation of hydrogen
      and oxygen and/or the simultaneously or separately occurring
      generation of electricity (photovoltaics) is primarily of a
      catalytic nature.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Further, it was found that the processes that are performed
      with the silicides for water splitting to produce hydrogen and
      oxygen and/or simultaneous or separate generation of electricity
      (photovoltaics) can also be conducted with silicides in
      immobilized form, i.e. the processes can also be performed with
      compounds that are bound/fixed on or in polymeric surfaces or
      materials as well as on or in glasses or glass-lice materials as
      well as on or in other solid surfaces or also on nano particles,
      and especially also when these materials are electrically
      conducting, i.e., are charge-conducting. Further, the silicides
      can be existing as a solid composite, preferentially crystalline,
      but can also be of amorphous constitution.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The processes described above can be conducted at higher or
      lower temperatures than room temperature and high as well as low
      light intensities.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In case of the production of electricity, it is also
      possible to eliminate the use of an aqueous/liquid electrolyte and
      instead a viscous, solid and/or gel-type electrolyte can be used.
      In case of suitable p-/n-doping of the electrodes, the electrolyte
      can also be eliminated and the electrodes can be brought into
      direct contact.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Further, it was found that
      coupling/complexing/attaching/bonding of a dye or an agglomeration
      of dyes on silicides is favourable for the light absorption and
      charge separation and, in turn, for the reactivity of these
      compounds (so-called dye-sensitized reactions with
      semiconductors). Especially suited for this purpose are dyes such
      as perylenes and analogs thereof. These dye-complexed silicides
      can also be used in thermally conducted reactions, even at higher
      temperatures, because perylene dyes are thermally stable.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The higher temperatures mentioned above can be achieved
      electrically, by geothermal energy, light energy, solar energy,
      heating devices, microwave discharge or any other source of
      thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Further, it was found that the silicides can be used for
      the applications according to the title individually or in
      combination of two or more silicides. It is also possible to carry
      out the title processes with one or more silicide(s) together with
      application of additional semiconductor materials that are not of
      silicide-type structure such as e.g. ruthenium dioxide (RuO2),
      manganese dioxide (MnO2), tungsten trioxide (WO3) and generally
      other semiconductor material in order to assist/enhance the
      processes according to the title.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] Furthermore, it was found that the processes according to
      the title can be enhanced that are with silicides
      doped/combined/alloyed with lithium, sodium, magnesium, potassium,
      calcium, aluminum, boron, carbon, nitrogen, silicon, titanium,
      vanadium, zirconium, yttrium, lanthanum, nickel, manganese,
      cobalt, gallium, germanium, phosphorus, cadmium, arsenic,
      technetium, alfa-SiH and the lanthanides up to 50 percent by
      weight (relative to the silicides and the silicide-type
      compounds). As dopant (p- and n-doping) generally the elements
      usually applied in photovoltaics are conceivable that have a
      chemical valance that is different from the surrounding material.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] This new technology, based on the applications of silicides
      described above, can be employed in the following fields: New
      heating systems, fuel cell technology and/or production of
      electricity in general. There will be also applications in
      terrestrial and extra-terrestrial area for moving as well as
      static constructions and devices; this to replace, support or
      supplement these constructions and devices that up to now are
      driven by devices that utilize conventional fossil energy sources.<br>

      <b>EXAMPLES</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Example 1</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0027] Crystalline titanium disilicide (TiSi2) in solid form
      (“sputtering target”, 5 cm in diameter) is placed into a vessel
      (cylindrical shape and coolable and with free gas space, reaction
      temperature: 25-30° C.) and electrically connected with a counter
      electrode (e.g., IrO2 or RuO2).<br>
      <br>
      [0028] A membrane, e.g. of nafion or Teflon that is permeable for
      hydrogen and oxygen is placed between the electrodes. An
      electrolyte is added to the water phase (e.g., acidified with
      sulphuric acid to pH 2) and irradiation is done along the
      longitudinal axis of the cylindrical apparatus (white light,
      500-1,000 W or sunlight); the silicide is irradiated in doing so.
      The gas analyses are conducted by gas chromatography. The employed
      water used can be purified by ion exchange material; but normal
      water can be used also. The silicide in this arrangement serves as
      a cathode (hydrogen generation) and the transition metal oxides as
      anode (generation of oxygen). An appreciable electrical current
      can be measured in addition.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 2</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0029] Instead of the silicides mentioned in example 1, other
      silicides were employed such as cobalt silicide (CoSi2), platinum
      silicides (PtSi, Pt2Si), titanium carbosilicide (Ti3C2Si),
      carbosilicide/poly-carbosilicide (also named silicon
      carbide/polysilicon carbide (CSi/poly-CSi or SiC/poly-SiC)),
      zirconium silicide (ZrSi2), or chromium silicide (CrSi2). The
      reactions were carried out in analogy to example 1. In principle
      any silicide is suitable in this application.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0030] Same experimental set-up as in example 1, but titanium
      disilicide (TiSi2) serves as anode and platinum as counter
      electrode (cathode). Less oxygen and hydrogen are formed but a
      higher electrical current is measured that can be used for example
      for drives and other energy-dependent systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 4</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0031] If in the processes described in experiments 1 and 2, TiSi
      is employed as cathode material, no gas evolution is observed but
      a significant electrical current is measured.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 5</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0032] Example 4 can also be conducted without water contact In
      this connection, instead of the aqueous sulphuric acid as
      electrolyte, an electrolyte gel has to be used between the
      electrodes as a contact.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 6</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0033] When in the processes described in experiments 1 and 2,
      higher reaction temperatures are applied (45-100° C.), a more
      vigorous gas evolution is observed. Practically, such temperatures
      can be reached upon use of flat-bed solar reactors and sunlight as
      a radiation source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 7</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0034] A perylene such as
      N,N′-bis-phenyl-ethyl-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxyl-diimide (2
      g) which is soluble in chloroform (but not in water), is dissolved
      (in chloroform, 5 ml), 5 g of titanium silicide (TiSi2 or Ti5Si3)
      are added, and the shiny stirred and irradiated (see example 1) at
      room temperature for 2 hours.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] After removal of the solvent in vacuum the residue is used
      for further reaction according to the conditions as described in
      example 1. A higher hydrogen and oxygen development was measured
      in this connection.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8<br>
      <br>
      [0036] As an alternative to the reaction conditions that have been
      described in connection with examples 1 and 2, flat-bed solar
      reactors or a sunlight concentrator system (parabolic troughs or
      Fresnel optics) can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Heating of the silicide to, for example, 200° C. under
      these conditions is no problem for the success of the reaction
      according to the title and even process-promoting. This applies
      also to the use of concentrated light energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 9</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0038] The silicide (e.g., TiSi2) was provided with (doped)
      according to standard techniques with Pt and a reaction carried
      out in analogy to example 1. A higher gas yield and higher
      electrical current compared to example 1 were measured.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 10</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0039] Both water splitting for generating hydrogen and oxygen as
      well as the production of electricity is achieved upon external
      use of a silicide (e.g., as a plate) electrically connected to the
      platinum electrode and a transition metal electrode as a counter
      electrode. In this connection, the electrode spaces can be
      separated for water splitting by a membrane (nation or Teflon) and
      an electrolyte, as mentioned in example 1, can be used<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 11</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0040] For the production of electricity (photovoltaics) water
      contact can also be eliminated and an electrolyte-gel in analogy
      to example 5 is used between the electrodes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 12</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] Carried out as in example 11, but with several electrodes
      in series (connected electrically) and provided with an
      electrolyte (as in examples 5 and 11) As electrodes
      TiSi/beta-FeSi2/RuO2)alfa-FeSi2) were employed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 13</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0042] Upon suitable p-/n-doping of the electrodes the use of an
      electrolyte is not necessary and the electrodes can be brought
      into direct contact upon electrical connection. For p-doping
      aluminum on TiSi2 and for n-doping phosphorus on TiSi were chosen
      and the two layers were brought into contact. A considerable
      electrical current was measured. It is also possible to bring
      several layers into contact wherein a significantly higher current
      flow was measured when this arrangement was exposed to artificial
      light as well as solar radiation. <br>

      The invention relates to a method for the photo- and
      thermochemical generation of hydrogen and/or oxygen from water in
      the presence of silicides, silicide-like compositions,
      metallosilicides and non-metallic silicides such as borosilicides,
      carbosilicides and nitrosilicides, i.e. all compositions
      containing silicon and being of the molecular formula RSix and/or
      RSixOy wherein R represents an organic, metallic, organometallic
      and/or inorganic residue and/or oxides thereof, and Si being
      silicon and specifically a silicide moiety with X &gt; zero and O
      representing oxygen with Y zero. The silicide moieties in these
      compositions exhibit characteristically a high electron density on
      silicon all of which can also be oxidized. The silicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof can react
      catalytically in these aforementioned processes proceeding with or
      without light. However, upon irradiation of the reactions an
      increase of gas evolution is observed, this notably applying to
      artificial light as well as sunlight. Higher reaction temperatures
      are often favourable for these processes. Silicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof are mostly
      semiconductor-type materials. Furthermore, these compositions are
      able to absorb/desorb hydrogen and oxygen reversibly wherein
      oxygen absorption/desorption is favourable but can occur
      simultaneously with hydrogen absorption and desorption. The
      desorption of hydrogen and oxygen can occur at ambient or higher
      temperatures, especially the processes concerning hydrogen,
      depending on the nature of the silicides and silicide-like
      compositions and/or oxides thereof employed.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a process for the photo- and
      thermochemical production/generation of hydrogen and/or oxygen
      wherein water is brought into contact with silicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Several procedures for the oxidation and/or reduction of water to
      yield hydrogen and oxygen by the aid of metallic catalysts have
      been disclosed. The catalysts employed so far for this latter
      purpose are lanthanide-type photocatalysts, such as NaTa03:La,
      catalysts based on rare earth metals, such as R2Ti207(R = Y, rare
      earth), or Ti02-derived semiconductor materials arranged in a
      so-called tandem cell. Notably, in these procedures no mention of
      the use of suicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides
      thereof has been made for the title applications.<br>
      <br>
      The processes for the generation of hydrogen and oxygen from water
      comprise reduction and/or oxidation processes using semiconductors
      and light. These processes are also called in summa water
      splitting processes. The hitherto disclosed procedures employ UV
      light. Although in some cases remarkable amounts of hydrogen and
      oxygen evolution is observed, the irradiation conditions are not
      suitable for solar applications. Further, the preparations of the
      catalysts are laborious and require uneconomically high
      temperatures, starting from expensive materials of very high
      purity. Furthermore, these processes require water of very high
      purity, i.e. tri-distilled water. Of the cases no indication
      concerning longer time applications including the consequences for
      the stability of the catalysts is made.<br>
      <br>
      Therefore subject matter of present invention is a process for the
      photo- and thermochemical production/generation of hydrogen and/or
      oxygen wherein water is brought into contact with suicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof., i.e.
      compositions all containing silicon and oxides thereof and being
      of the molecular formula RSixOywherein R represents pure or mixed
      organic, metallic, organometallic and/or biochemically derived
      residues and/or inorganic residues, and Si being silicon and
      specifically a suicide moiety with X &gt; 0 and O is oxygen with Y
      0. The suicide moieties in these compositions exhibit
      characteristically a high electron density at silicon. The
      suicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof can
      react catalytically in these aforementioned processes proceeding
      with or without light. However, upon irradiation of the reactions
      an increase of gas evolution is observed, this notably applying to
      artificial light as well as sunlight. Higher reaction temperatures
      are often favourable for these processes. Suicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof are mostly
      semiconductor-type materials. Furthermore, these compositions are
      able to store/release and/or absorb/desorb hydrogen and oxygen
      reversibly wherein oxygen storage/release and/or
      absorption/desorption is favourable but can occur simultaneously
      with hydrogen storage/absorption and desorption/release. The
      release/desorption of hydrogen and oxygen can occur at ambient or
      higher temperatures, especially the processes concerning hydrogen,
      depending on the nature of the suicides and silicide-like
      compositions and/or oxides thereof employed.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it was found that
      coupling/complexing/attaching/binding of a dye such as perylenes,
      perylene dyes and perylene congeneers/analogs to suicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof is favourable for
      the light absorption and hence reactivity of the suicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it was found that the reactions using suicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof for the purpose
      of water reduction and/or oxidation to yield hydrogen and/or
      oxygen, respectively, can be carried out by employing the suicides
      and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof in
      immobilized form, i.e. when these compositions are attached/fixed
      onto or in a polymeric surface or material, as well as onto or in
      a glass or glass-like material, especially when the polymeric
      and/or glass-type material is electrically conducting.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it was found that the storage/release and/or
      absorption/desorption of hydrogen and/or oxygen using suicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof when these
      compositions are immobilized, i.e. when these materials are
      attached/fixed onto or in a polymeric surface and/or glass and/or
      glass-like material, this in processes carried out with or without
      light.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, processes wherein oxygen is transformed to polyoxygen
      of the formula On(n &gt; 3) and/or hydogenpolyperoxides of the
      formula H2On(n &gt; 2) including the back reactions to form oxygen
      again have not been described in literature so far, but have been
      found experimentally here; theoretical studies based on
      calculation predicting a shallow energy minimum and hence low to
      questionable stability for polyoxygen and hydrogenpolyperoxides in
      the gas phase. However, the experienced stability of polyoxygen
      and hydrogenpolyperoxides is seemingly due to stabilization in
      solution and/or by a metal. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Description of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Surprisingly, it has now been found that these disadvantages can
      be avoided by employing silicides, silicide-like compositions,
      metallosilicides and non-metallic silicides such as borosilicides,
      carbosilicides and nitrosilicides, i.e. compositions all
      containing silicon and being of the molecular formula
      RSixOywherein R represents an organic, metallic, organometallic or
      inorganic residue, and Si being silicon and specifically a suicide
      moiety with X &gt; zero and O is oxygen with Y zero (this ensemble
      of silicide-type compositions is in the following text named
      silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof).
      The suicide moieties in these compositions exhibit
      characteristically a high electron density at silicon, i.e. higher
      than in the parent silicon atom.<br>
      <br>
      The non-metallic silicides such as borosilicides, carbosilicides
      and nitrosilicides are also called silicon borides, carbides and
      nitrides, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      Examples of silicides, silicide-like compositions,
      metallosilicides and non-metallic silicides are silicides of the
      formula RSixOywherein R represents an organic, metallic,
      organometallic, biochemically derived and/or inorganic residue,
      and Si being silicon and specifically a suicide moiety with X &gt;
      zero and O is oxygen with Y zero wherein a choice of R can be
      lithium, beryllium, sodium, potassium, calcium, copper, zinc,
      rhodium, scandium, rubidium, gallium, selenium, rhodium,
      palladium, cadmium, lead, osmium, antimon, iridium, tungsten, tin,
      strontium, barium, titanium, nickel, iron, thallium, boron,
      cobalt, platinum, manganese, titanium, silicon, carbon, carbon in
      form of nanotubes, iridium, molybdenum, nitrogen, zirconium,
      tantalum, vanadium, chromium, silver, gold, lanthanides,
      actinides, organic residues such as dyes, i.e. perylenes, alkoxy
      residues and/or oxides of these residues R as well as mixtures of
      these residues R. Selected examples are titanium silicides (TiSi2,
      Ti5Si3), nickel suicide (Ni2Si), iron silicides (FeSi2, FeSi),
      thallium suicide (ThSi2), borosilicide or also silicon tetrabohde
      named (B4Si), cobalt suicide (CoSi2), platinum suicide (PtSi,
      Pt2Si), manganese suicide (MnSi2), titanium carbosilicide
      (Ti3C2Si), carbosilicide/poly-carbosilicide or also silicon
      carbide/poly-silicon carbide named (CSi/poly-CSi or SiC/poly-SiC),
      iridium suicide (lrSi2), nitrosilicide or also named silicon
      nitride (N4Si3), zirconium suicide (ZrSi2), tantalum suicide
      (TaSi2), vanadium suicide (V2Si) or chromium suicide (CrSi2)
      and/or oxides thereof, perylene titanium or vanadium silicides,
      methoxy or ethoxy titanium or vanadium or iron silicides and
      oxides thereof. The silicides and silicide-like compositions
      and/or oxides thereof are cheap, abundant and have so far not been
      claimed for the use with respect to the title applications. They
      have been used for transistor technique and photovoltaic devices
      and applications thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof
      can be used for the generation of hydrogen and/or oxygen from
      water by conducting the reactions with or without light, i.e.
      photonic and/or thermal processes, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof
      are materials containing also silicon atoms with enhanced electron
      densities as compared to elemental silicon. Such effect happens
      when silicon is brought into contact with other elements and/or
      oxides thereof which can be of metallic and/or non-metallic
      nature.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to note that silicides and silicide-like
      compositions oxidize upon contact with water, oxygen and other
      oxidizing media to various degree, i.e. 0-100% dependent on the
      reaction conditions.<br>
      Silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof can
      be prepared by bringing into contact the individual elements
      and/or the oxides thereof in various ratios in solution/suspension
      as well as in solid and/or melted and/or gaseous form.<br>
      <br>
      The silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof
      are mainly semiconductortype materials with high electrondensities
      at silicon, carbon, nitrogen and boron, respectively. The claimed
      processes for the generation of hydrogen and/or oxygen using
      silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof can
      be achieved with or without light, but are significantly more
      efficient when running under irradiation. The light and thermal
      energy can be artificial or of solar origin (200 - 15000 nm
      emission of the light and thermal source) and can be diffuse or
      concentrated. The thermal energy being produced by the light
      source, besides the photonic energy and heat in general, can
      accelerate the gas evolution processes. In general, higher
      reaction temperatures are usually promoting the processes rather
      favourably.<br>
      The silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof
      are mostly absorbing sufficient solar or artificial radiation by
      themselves without the need for major surface engineering to
      effect reduction and/or oxidation of water to generate hydrogen
      and/or oxygen, respectively. Furthermore, the herein claimed title
      processes are occurring concomitantly, but can be steered by
      temperature and the nature of silicides and silicide-like
      compositions and/or oxides thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Surprisingly it was also found that the water quality and purity
      is of minor importance or even negligible for carrying out the
      title processes, i.e. oxidation and/or reduction of water as well
      as storing/abrorbing and releasing/desorbing hydrogen and oxygen,
      respectively, using silicides and silicide-like compositions
      and/or oxides thereof.<br>
      <br>
      It has also to be noted that the herein claimed activity of the
      silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof for
      the purpose of water reduction and/or oxidation to yield hydrogen
      and/or oxygen, respectively, is predominantly of catalytic nature,
      this refers to dark reactions as well as to reactions using light
      (artificial and/or solar light).<br>
      <br>
      Further, it was found that the reactions using silicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof for the purpose
      of water reduction and/or oxidation to yield hydrogen and/or
      oxygen, respectively, can be carried out by employing the
      silicides and silicide-like compositions in immobilized form, i.e.
      when these materials are inbedded in, attached/fixed onto a
      polymeric material (such as polyamid, macrolon or plexiglass) or
      surface or glass or glass-like material, especially when the
      polymeric and/or glass-type material is electrically conducting.<br>
      <br>
      The reactions such as described above can also be conducted at
      elevated temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      The formation of the oxides of the silicides and silicide-like
      compositions can be carried out in water and/or oxygen containing
      atmosphere or in presence of other oxidants wherein the speed of
      oxide formation depends on the reaction conditions, such as
      temperature, presence of inert gas, pH of the reaction media and
      other physical conditions such as stirring, shaking or not moving
      the reaction media at all. The growth of the oxide layers (0-100%)
      can conveniently be followed and analyzed by XPS and XRD
      spectroscopy. The same types of analyses are applied when bringing
      into contact already oxidized elements and components prior to
      reaction and employing these silicides and silicide-like oxides
      and/or partially oxidized compositions for the above described
      purposes.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it was found that
      coupling/complexing/attaching/binding of a dye or an agglomeration
      of dyes to silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides
      thereof is favorable for the light absorption and hence reactivity
      of these compositions (so-called dye sensitized semiconductor
      reactions). Most favorably dyes such as perylenes and analogs
      thereof are employed. These dye-complexed silicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof can also be
      applied when running thermal reactions, this even at elevated
      temperatures, since the perylene dyes are thermally stable.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, it was found that the silicides and silicide-like
      compositions and/or oxides thereof can store/release and/or
      absorb/desorb hydrogen and/or oxygen reversibly. The
      storage/release and/or absorption/desorption of oxygen is therein
      most favourable but can occur together with the storage/release of
      hydrogen. The release/desorption of hydrogen and oxygen can occur
      at ambient temperatures, especially the release/desorption of
      hydrogen, but these processes are more favourable at higher
      temperatures. The rates of these processes depend on the reaction
      temperature and the nature of the semiconductor-type material
      employed, i.e. of the silicides and silicide-like compositions
      and/or oxides thereof.<br>
      <br>
      The higher temperatures stated above can be created electrically,
      by earthem temperature, solar energy, furnaces, microwave
      discharge or any other source of thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it was found that the reactions using silicides and
      silicide-like composrf/&lt;'&gt;ons and/or oxides thereof for the
      purpose of water reduction and/or oxidation to yield hydrogen
      and/or oxygen, respectively, can be carried out by employing the
      silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof in
      immobilized form, i.e. when these compositions are attached/fixed
      onto or in a polymeric surface or material, as well as onto or in
      a glass or glass-like material, especially when the polymeric
      and/or glass-type material is electrically conducting.<br>
      <br>
      It was also found that the storage/release and/or
      absorption/desorption of hydrogen and/or oxygen using silicides
      and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof when these
      compositions are immobilized, i.e. when these materials are
      attached/fixed onto or in a polymeric surface or glass or
      glass-like material, this in processes carried out with or without
      light.<br>
      <br>
      The photochemical and thermal processes stated above can be
      conducted with silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or
      oxides thereof in catalytic amounts.<br>
      <br>
      Both, the photochemical and thermochemical processes stated above
      can be conducted at elevated temperatures which is even beneficial
      for the course of the processes. The processes stated above
      leading to storage/absorption of oxygen are concomitant with the
      storage/absorption of hydrogen but it is found that the
      selectivity and the speed of such processes are dependent on the
      reaction conditions, such as temperature, concentration, pressure,
      light vs. dark reactions, pH, physical conditions such as
      stirring, ultrasound treatment, shaking etc. The presence of other
      gas storage material can help to improve the selectivity and speed
      of the absorption/desorption of hydrogen and/or oxygen on and/or
      in the silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides
      thereof. Absorption and/or adsorption (storage) of oxygen is found
      in most cases to be very efficient and even more efficient than of
      hydrogen.<br>
      <br>
      The processes stated above leading to the release/desorption of
      hydrogen are concomitant with the release/desorption of oxygen but
      are found to be predominant dependent on the reaction conditions
      applied (such as nature of the suicide or silicide-like
      composition and/or oxides thereof used, temperature and pressure):
      E.g. when processing with titanium suicide at ambient temperature
      and pressure. At higher temperatures and in light the
      release/desorption of oxygen can be forced.<br>
      <br>
      Furthermore, it was found that the silicides and silicide-like
      compositions and/or oxides thereof can be employed for the title
      applications individually or in combinations of two or more
      silicides or silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof. It
      is also possible to conduct the title processes with one or more
      of the silicides or silicide-like compositions together with
      additional semiconductor materials of non-silicide structures such
      as ruthenium dioxide (Ru02), manganese dioxide (Mn02), tungsten
      trioxide (W03) and other semiconducting materials in order to
      enforce the title processes. The ratio of hydrogen-to-oxygen
      evolution and storage thereof varies with the semiconductor
      mixtures, temperature and pressure employed. The same is true for
      silicides or silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof
      which are doped (see below).<br>
      <br>
      It was also found that storage/release and/or
      absorption/desorption of hydrogen and/or oxygen using silicides
      and silicide-like compositions is active when the contact of the
      silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof to
      water is disrupted or cancelled, i.e. when the storage device was
      attached to the reaction vessel externally via a pipe.<br>
      <br>
      Further, it was found that the title processes can be forced by
      doping/mixing/alloying the silicides and silicide-like
      semiconductors and/or oxides thereof with any of the previously
      mentioned elements/residues for the choice of R and/or oxides
      thereof as well as mixtures thereof in the third paragraph of this
      chapter. The silicides and silicide-like compositions and/or
      oxides thereof can be prepared by bringing into contact the
      individual elements and/or the oxides thereof as well as other
      derivatives thereof, all in various ratios in fully or partlially
      oxidized form or in non-oxidized form, this in solution,
      suspension as well as in solid, e.g. by milling or by
      alloying/melting, or in liquid or any other chemical and/or
      physical form.<br>
      <br>
      Polyoxygen of the formula On(n &gt; 3) and/or hydogenpolyperoxides
      of the formula H2On(n &gt; 2) are formed in the above described
      reactions from oxygen and preferentially under light and in
      connection with the above described catalysts reversibly. These
      methods can also include biochemical transformations such as the
      application of a peroxidase. Examples of polyoxygen and
      hydrogenpolyperoxides, i.e. a selection of ring size and chain
      lengths, show UV-absorptions with maxima in the region of 221
      (016), and 202 nm (H08) (both species with tailing up to 350-400
      nm), respectively, and mass peaks/fragmentation peaks in mass
      spectroscopy at m/z 256 (O[iota]6), 129 (H08), 97 (H06), 81 (H05)
      and 32 (02) in water.<br>
      <br>
      The novel technology based on the use of silicides and
      silicide-like compositions and/or oxides thereof as stated above
      can find applications e.g. for the purpose of novel heating
      systems, in fuel cell technology which will be ultimately applied
      for and in terrestrial and nonterrestrial traffic and static
      constructions and devices replacing or supporting or supplementing
      such constructions and devices driven so far by devices based on
      the use of conventional fossil energy.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Examples</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Note, in all examples the silicides and silicide-like compositions
      are oxidized by water and/or oxygen to various degrees (0-100%)
      dependent on the reaction conditions. But in most cases oxidation
      stops at a layer size of 1-5 nm depth which protects the catalyst
      from further (rapid) oxidation. Such effects can be controlled for
      example by temperature and pH as well as by other physical and
      chemical conditions. The same or silmilar effects can be achieved
      by bringing into contact individually oxidized (0-100%) elements
      and components of the catalyst's compositions prior to reaction.
      Analyses of the state of oxidation of the catalysts and the
      respective components have been performed by XRD and XPS
      spectroscopy.<br>
      <br>
      Example 1: 3-5 g of a titanium suicide (TiSi2or Ti5Si3) are
      stirred in 200 - 400 mL of water (filtered over ion exchange
      resin, a slightly lower gas yield was determined when using plain
      water without purification) in a vessel which is transparent for
      solar radiation or radiation of an artificial light source. As
      light source served a Heidelberg irradiation system with lamps
      having emission maxima at 415, 525, or 660 nm and emission ranges
      from 300-550, 490600 or 610-700 nm, respectively, or halogen lamps
      with emossions in the range of 350-800 nm. This reaction set-ups
      yield 25 mL and more of hydrogen and oxygen per day at room
      temperature (gas evolution and ratios depend on the nature of the
      catalyst used, temperature and pressure). Most of the oxygen is in
      such reactions absorbed by the catalysts to give hydrogen/oxygen
      molar ratios of 2/1 up to 20/1. The oxygen and hydrogen evolution
      is measured volumetrically in conjunction with gas chromatography
      and mass spectrometry. The experiment can be continued up to at
      least 3 months if the gas volume of the reaction vessel is emptied
      and flushed with air after periods of 2-3 days. Alternatively, a
      solar flatbed reactor made of macrolon or plexiglass and sunlight
      irradiation can be employed.<br>
      <br>
      Example 2: Instead of the silicides mentioned in example 1 , also
      nickel suicide (Ni2Si), iron silicides (FeSi2, FeSi), thallium
      suicide (ThSi2), boron suicide (B4Si), cobalt suicide (CoSi2),
      platinum suicide (PtSi, Pt2Si), manganese suicide (MnSi2),
      titanium carbosilicide (Ti3C2Si), carbosilicide/poly-carbosilicide
      (also named silicon carbide/poly-silicon carbide (CSi/poly-CSi or
      SiC/poly-SiC), iridium suicide (lrSi2), nitrosilicide or also
      named silicon nitride (N4Si3), zirconium suicide (ZrSi2), tantalum
      suicide (TaSi2), vanadium suicide (V2Si) or chromium suicide
      (CrSi2) can be employed. The reactions are carried out as
      described in example 1.<br>
      <br>
      Example 3: Same experimental set-up as in example 1 , but using
      nickel suicide (Ni2Si). A hydrogen/oxygen molar ratio of approx.
      20/1 was measured. <br>
      <br>
      Example 4: If in reactions given in examples 1 and 2, higher
      temperatures (30-45 degrees Celcius) were applied, more vigorous
      gas evolution was observed. Conveniently this temperature can be
      reached by using solar flatbed reactors and sunlight.<br>
      <br>
      Example 5: The same conditions as in examples 1 and 2, but without
      the application of light gave at higher reaction temperatures
      (30-40 degrees Celcius) more vigorous gas evolution.<br>
      <br>
      Example 6: A chloroform soluble perylene (but not soluble in
      water), such as N,N'-bisphenyl ethyl
      perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (2 g), was dissolved (in
      5 mL of chloroform) and stirred with a titanium suicide (3 g,
      TiSi2or Ti5Si3) during 2 hours at room temperature. The solvent
      was then removed in vacuo and the residue subjected to the
      conditions stated in example 1. An increase of hydrogen and oxygen
      evolution (&gt; 30 mL per day) was observed.<br>
      <br>
      Example 7: Alternatively to the reaction conditions stated in
      example 1 , a flatbed reactor made of macrolon or plexiglass can
      be employed wherein the reactor material macrolon or plexiglass
      was heated (50-100 degrees Celcius) prior to the reaction and in
      the presence of the semiconductor material (Ni2Si) to achieve
      immobilization of the catalyst on the polymer surface of the
      reactor. Otherwise the experiments were conducted as in 1.<br>
      <br>
      Example 8: If for reactions such as stated in example 1 , a closed
      reaction vessel was employed, storage of hydrogen and oxygen is
      exercised when opening the vessel after two weeks. Vigorous
      release of hydrogen and oxygen (20/1) at room temperature is
      observed and the amount of gas collected and measured corresponded
      to a continuous experimental set-up which includes the collection
      of the gases repeatedly after 2-3 days. The reason for a lack of
      oxygen in these reactions has been identified. Oxygen is
      continuously consumed under the given reaction conditions to form
      polyoxygen and hydrogenpolyperoxides of the formula On(n &gt; 3)
      and H2On(n &gt; 2), respectively. Polyoxygen and
      hydrogenpolyperoxides can be converted back to oxygen by treatment
      with metal oxides (such as with mixtures of Mn02, CuO and suicide
      oxides) and light or thermal activation.<br>
      <br>
      Example 9: The same reaction set-up as in example 1 was employed
      here, but 1 g of W03was added to the reaction slurry. A more
      vigorous gas evolution than in example 1 resulted (&gt; 30 mL per
      day). <br>
      <br>
      Example 10: 3 g of TiSi2were doped with Pt using standard
      techniques. A reaction run according to example 1 gave a higher
      yield of gases than in the latter example (&gt; 25 mL per day).<br>
