      A cyclogyro flies using "cycloidal propellers" - several wings
      positioned around the edge of a rotating cylindrical framework, a
      bit like a paddle-wheel. <br>
      <br>
      As each wing rotates, its blades move through the air generating
      lift and thrust. And, since each wing rotates through a full
      circle, altering the angle of the individual blades can pull the
      aircraft forwards, backwards and down as well up. <br>
      <br>
      The maneuverability that cycloidal propellers could offer provides
      benefits over more established flying methods. <br>
      <br>
      Although no cyclogyro has yet flown without being tethered, its
      proponents say the design could prove more efficient and
      maneuverable than helicopters at small scales. <br>
      <br>
      A team of Singapore researchers is leading the race to construct a
      working cyclogyro with a prototype that hovers on the end of a
      line. After studying the performance of different cycloidal
      designs, the pair modified a toy helicopter, giving it two
      cycloidal propellers with three blades each, and a small tail
      rotor for stability. <br>
      <br>
      "On the tether, the aircraft can spin, move directly up and down
      or fly forward and backward," says Hu. "This is perhaps the first
      recorded flight for a cyclogyro," he adds. "There were some people
      claiming successful flights, but no video or proof for that." <br>
      <br>
      "Cyclogyros are more relevant now because people want to build
      small, agile UAVs [uncrewed aerial vehicles]," says Weihs. At such
      sizes they have greater advantages over helicopters, he says. The
      parts of a helicopter blade nearest and furthest from the hub are
      moving too slowly and too fast, respectively, to generate thrust.
      "With a cyclogyro every bit moves at the same speed, so there is
      no 'dead space'," says Weihs. Cyclogyros can also be more
      manoeuvrable, says Weihs. Helicopters must tilt to travel
      laterally. But cycloidal propellers can generate thrust in any
      direction so the craft can remain level, or adopt any other
      position and still fly in any direction. These advantages are
      greatest at small sizes. "They are probably not practical above
      half a metre across," says Weihs. "You won't see one carry a
      passenger." <br>

          The investigation over several possible cyclogyo designs was
          performed in the paper. The concept of cyclogyro has existed
          almost 100 years, but still more research are needed. The

          investigated in this paper. The comparison between different
          designs shows that the tapered blades with larger aspect ratio
          can improve propellers performance. A new and simple blade
          structure is also presented to demonstrate how to keep blades
          with large aspect ratio work safely with neglectable weight
          penalty.<br>

      The cyclogyro, or cyclocopter, is an aircraft design that uses
      cycloidal rotors which consist of airfoils rotating around a
      horizontal axis for both lift and thrust. They are capable of
      vertical take off and landing and hovering performance like a
      helicopter, without the same disadvantages.[citation needed]
      Although a number of cyclogyros were built in the 1930s, none were
      known to have successfully flown until 2011.[citation needed] The
      cyclogyro should not be mistaken for flettner airplanes, the
      unsuccessful and aerodynamically different aircraft designs using
      cylindrical wings which attempted to harness the Magnus effect.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Function</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The cyclogyro wing resembles a paddle wheel, with airfoils
      replacing the paddles. The airfoils' pitch (angle of attack) is
      adjusted either collectively (by means of a control ring with
      links to all blades, which is located eccentrically and variably
      relative to the rotor's axis of rotation) or the blades are
      individually adjustable in pitch and are adjusted continually by
      the control system as they move around the rotor's axis. In normal
      forward flight the airfoils are given a slight positive pitch at
      the upper and forward portions of their arc, producing lift and
      forward thrust. They are given flat or negative pitch at the
      bottom, and are "flat" through the rest of the circle to produce
      little or no lift in other directions. The pitch can be adjusted
      to change the thrust profile, allowing the cyclogyro to travel in
      any direction.[1] Differential thrust between the two wings (one
      on either side of the fuselage) can be used to turn the aircraft
      around its vertical axis, although conventional tail surfaces are
      generally used as well.[2]<br>

        History</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Early Designs</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Jonathan Edward Caldwell appears to have been the first to patent
      the concept, and invent the term. He filed a patent on the concept
      that was granted in 1927, but immediately moved on to an
      ornithopter design and appears to have made no effort to build a
      cyclogyro of his own.[3] Several attempts to build a working
      cyclogyro were made by other designers. The earliest full-sized
      example appears to be the Schroeder S1 from 1930, which used the
      cyclogyro "wheels" for forward thrust only.[citation needed] Adolf
      Rohrbach of Germany designed a full VTOL version in 1933,[4] which
      was later developed in the US and featured a tall fish-like
      fuselage to keep the wings well clear of the ground.[5] Another
      early example was by Rahn Aircraft in 1935, which used two much
      larger chord wings instead of a multi-blade wheel driven by a 240
      hp supercharged Wright Whirlwind[6] In 1935 NACA carried out a
      series of wind tunnel experiments on the cyclogyro concept, and
      found that the power required to turn the wheels was much higher
      than expected.[citation needed] Theoretical tools of the era
      simply weren't useful for prediction on the highly asymmetrical
      lift profiles and the greatly simplified models they used varied
      dramatically from real-world results.[citation needed] Early
      experiments then ended.<br>
      <br>
      The concept has recently been applied to smaller Unmanned aerial
      vehicle designs, where the hovering capability would be
      particularly useful.[7][8][9] Several of these designs have
      produced flying prototype models:<br>
      <br>
      In 2007 a team at the University of Singapore built a working
      model of cyclogyro, although it has only flown in tethered flight.
      Their cycloidal model was a modified helicopter, with the rotor
      replaced with two sideways cycloidal rotors, each with three
      blades sticking out of them in the perpendicular.[10]<br>
      <br>
      A team at Northwestern Polytechnical University in China built a
      free flying Cyclogyro. This design used two cycloidal rotors for
      the efficient generation of lift and small and noisy conventional
      head and tail rotors to stabilize the craft and provide control of
      its horizontal position and direction of flight. Video of the
      team's test flights can be found here. In September 2013 another
      Cyclocopter model was flight tested in China<br>
      <br>
      In December 2011 a team at the University of Maryland successfully
      built and tested a micro Cyclocopter, as seen here. Their design
      does not require a head rotor in addition to the usual tail
      rotor.[citation needed]<br>
      <br>
      The Austrian company Innovative Aerodynamic Technologies (IAT)
      premiered a 4 rotor cyclogyro at the Paris Air Show in June 2011.
      IAT has christened their creation Project D-DALUS.[11] A video can
      be found here.<br>
      <br>
      A team at the Seoul National University has built and in December
      2012 successfully demonstrated a stable, mostly hovering flight of
      a 4 rotor Cyclocopter<br>
      <br>
      The Korean team design solution provides for stable and
      controllable flight by having two pairs of the counter-rotating
      rotors which are parallel to each other and rotate at the same
      rpm. However this approach will not work for the higher forward
      speeds. Not one of the teams (mentioned above) so far has achieved
      the Power Loading (Lift/Power in kgf/hp) which is any better than
      that achieved by the helicopters. The University of Maryland team
      and the team in China use individual motors for each rotor for
      stability by varying their rpm. Using a number of individual
      motors makes that design heavier, more complicated and costlier.
      The Korean team has announced the building of a two main rotor 90
      kg UAV back in 2012.<br>
      <br>
      A European Seventh Framework Programme consortium, the CROP,[12]
      also studied cycloidal rotors with the optic of optimizing their
      performances. Within this project, various possible aircraft
      configurations were considered. One of those is the Heligyro, for
      which a conceptual aeroelastic study rendering is shown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Future Developments</b><br>
      <br>
      Future developments, such as a variable cycloidal rotor, may
      improve the cyclogyro design. This technology allows the blades to
      travel about the horizontal axis along the most aerodynamically
      desirable orbit as continuously determined by the control system.
      This orbit will generally be non-circular and elongated, with that
      orbit shape dynamically modified by the control system as the
      flight regime and conditions change to keep the relative airflow
      about the blades optimized. The dynamic counterbalancing of the
      blades radial movements is used to keep the rotor balanced. This
      design would also allow their operation and the blade orbit shape
      to be optimized not only for the highest efficiency, but
      alternatively also for the highest flight speed or for the highest
      possible lifting capability or for the most silent
      operation.[citation needed] In addition to the horizontally
      elongated blade orbits being conducive to greater stability, the
      ability of this technology to precisely control in real time the
      localization and distribution of the lift/thrust generation may
      also largely eliminate the stability issues[citation needed] which
      is the most serious problem faced by current cyclogyro
      designs.;[citation needed] the second biggest problem faced by the
      current designs, namely that of blade bending due to the
      centrifugal forces, can also be addressed via the trajectory shape
      as on flat or nearly flat portions of the trajectory the
      centrifugal force acting on the blades will respectively be either
      zero or small.<br>

      In 1933, experiments in Germany by Adolf Rohrbach resulted in a
      paddle-wheel wing arrangement. Oscillating winglets went from
      positive to negative angles of attack during each revolution to
      create lift, and their eccentric mounting would, in theory,
      produce nearly any combination of horizontal and vertical forces.<br>
      <br>
      The DVL evaluated Rohrbach’s design, but the foreign aviation
      journals of the time cast doubt on the soundness of the design
      which meant that funding for the project could not be raised, even
      with a latter proposal as a Luftwaffe transport aircraft.<br>
      <br>
      There appears to be no evidence that this design was ever built,
      let alone flown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Platt’s Cyclogyro</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Note the tall thin fuselage required to lift the rotary wings
      clear of the ground<br>
      <br>
      Based on Rohrbach’s paddle-wheel research, however, Platt in the
      US designed by 1933 his own independent Cyclogyro. His
      paddle-wheel wing arrangement was awarded a US patent (which was
      only one of many similar patents on file), and underwent extensive
      wind-tunnel testing at MIT in 1927.<br>
      <br>
      Despite this, there is no evidence Platt’s aircraft was ever
      built.<br>
      <br>
      By 1935, Platt had designed his Vertigiro helicopter having a
      single rotor with moveable vanes in the rotor downwash for
      anti-torque control. Platt’s US patent # 2,074,805 of the control
      system revealed a three-way drawing of a multi-seat version of the
      craft. Sometime thereafter, Platt and LePage worked on this design
      together, but never got past the model stage.<br>

      winglets on this wheel went from positive to negative angles of

      motorcycle, set the heavily-braced wings into a flapping frenzy,
      but before it got any serious ideas about flying its tail broke

      In 1924 Swedish engineer Strandgren has received the patent for
      vertical take-off aircraft. Then he was experimenting with models
      in France within 9 years and in 1933 has begun construction of
      full-scale cyclogyro. In this drawing, surprising are
      disproportionately small rotors.<br>

      This aircraft was constructed in San Francisco about 1930. It was
      expected that paddle wheel arrangement, named "cycloidal
      propeller", will create both thrust and lift. The propellers of
      such a type, where blades are placed in a vertical plane, have
      appeared effective only for water environment, but hadn't got
      prevalence for aircrafts. Source : "Unconventional Aircraft" by

      A simplified aerodynamic theory of the cyclogiro was developed. In
      addition, examples have been calculated: cyclogiro rotor (4
      blades, radius: 6 ft., span: 24 ft., chord: 0.472 ft., speed: 300
      ftps) and a rotorcraft with two similar rotors (weight: 3000 lb.,
      engine power: 300 hp). The main conclusions were:<br>
      <br>
      The cyclogiro is aerodynamically sound in principle. Hovering
      flight, vertical ascent, and reasonable forward speed may be
      obtained without the excessive expenditure of power. Autorotation
      in a gliding descent is available. <br>

      In 1933 Strandgren (see above) has finished a series of
      experiments with models and together with the company "Liore &amp;
      Olivier" has begun a construction of full-scale cyclogiro. The
      most part of charges was paid by Societe d'Expansion
      Franco-Scandinave. On the nonvalidated data, in 1934 construction
      was completed and tests have begun.<br>

      Calculated characteristics:<br>
      <br>
      Rotors: diameter — 6 m, five blades, blade length — 245 cm, chord
      — 40.8 cm, thickness — 3.8 cm. Blades made from duralumin, weight
      of each — 5 kg. Maximal rotation speed — 180 rpm.<br>

      The project was well worked. Calculations were checked up in NACA

      Cycloidal propeller was patented by prof. Frederick Kurt Kirsten
      in the beginning of 1920th. The idea was supported by William
      Boeing. Have begun with a water propeller. Tests of a vessel model
      have passed successfully, but further business has failed, and
      Kirsten has sold the patents to Voith-Schneider Corp.<br>
      <br>
      For studying of an air version of a propeller the wind tunnel of
      the sufficient size was required. Such tunnels were scarce in USA
      then, and Kirsten has offered the University of Washington to
      construct their own big (8x12 ft) wind tunnel. Twist of fate: the
      tunnel was constructed in 1936, but immediately began to be used
      so intensively that only in 1942 Kirsten could test a model of his
      "Cycloplane". Results appeared unfavourable.<br>

      Cyclogiro rotors of small radius, covered with casings, are placed
      in a wing and used as ordinary fans. Angles of incidence are
      controlled by simplified eccentric mechanism. In horizontal flight
      the rotors are disconnected from the engine, and horizontal thrust
      is created by usual variable-pitch pushing propeller. The
      longitudinal balancing is provided by an elevator placed in an
      airflow from propeller. The elevator has an additional shutter for
      thrust reversind.<br>

      The project is delightful in its own way. The rotors are
      two-bladed. In the first version, the variation of an angle of
      incidence is "automatic" — the blades are freely swinging between
      the terminators under the action of aerodynamic and/or centrifugal
      forces. When moving down, the blade produces lift, when moving up
      — thrust. Thus, in the bottom of a cycle the angle of incidence
      changes abruptly, with an impact. Therefore terminators, on a plan
      of the inventor, should be elastic. In the second version the
      angle of incidence is changing "by program" with the means of
      profiled cams. It is supposed to have a set of cams for different
      modes of flight (take-off, climb, cruise flight, descent or
      landing). The style of this mechanics reminds the tape drive
      mechanism of the tape recorder of 1960's. Though the toothed belts
      are used instead of elastic ones. And one more detail: it is
      supposed to place the elevator assembly (at the presence of those)
      in front of fuselage, to prevent its appearance in the airflow
      from the rotor.<br>

      The main purpose of this composite aircraft is to be a flying
      crane. The body weight of the craft is counterbalanced by
      aerostatic lift of a balloon 1, and weight of a cargo — by lift of
      cyclogiro wings 2. The wings and thrust means are mounted on
      turnable pylones 3, playing also a role of the propeller blades.
      The device can accept a configuration of a "classical" dirigible,
      "classical" cyclogiro and all intermediate. Due to this there are
      no restrictions on a summary thrust vector orientation — that is
      what the flying crane needs for. The large, typical for balloons,
      size of this craft will allow to spin it up to significant tip
      speed while the moderate centrifugal stresses.<br>

      A cyclogiro rotor (4 blades, span and diameter: 8 ft., chord:
      0.312 ft.) was tested in the N.A.C.A. 20-foot wind tunnel.<br>
      <br>
      The tests showed that:<br>
      <br>
      The cyclogiro is capable of vertical ascent, forward flight, and
      gliding flight without power.<br>
      The probable performance of the cyclogiro is very poor for normal
      power loadings, and a maximum speed of 100 mph would be attained
      only with a power loading of less than 7 lb./hp.<br>
      The variations of the power required by the cyclogiro with the
      vertical and horizontal force coefficients is correctly predicted
      by mathematical analysis.<br>
      The profile-drag coefficient of the cyclogiro rotor blades
      increases rapidly with tip-speed ratio and is probably influenced
      by the blade oscillations.<br>
      Research on the oscillating airfoil is needed in order to clarify
      past and future rotating-wing research. <br>
