        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0001] This application claims the benefit of the earlier filed
      Provisional Application Serial No. 60/274,413; filed Mar. 9, 2001.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] It is known that all matter in the universe takes the form
      of particles. Atoms are composed of heavy particles in the nucleus
      with lighter weight particles, or electrons, orbiting around the
      nucleus of the atom. The particles are discrete, individual and
      indivisible units, and are referred to as quanta. Quanta interact
      when in close proximity. Just as earlier scientific theory has
      indicated that light, which is composed of individual particles
      called photons, exhibits wave-like properties, so too do atoms,
      which exhibit the phenomenon of absorbing and radiating energy
      discontinuously, rather than in a continuous manner. The energetic
      characteristics of the molecules of a given substance are thus
      based on the arrangement and interaction of the atomic particles,
      or quanta, forming the molecules of the substance.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] This explanation of the energetic characteristics of matter
      is known as quantum theory or quantum mechanics. From that theory,
      it can be understood that a change in molecular structure or
      arrangement can impact and change the energetic characteristics of
      a substance. It has also been postulated that exposure to
      electromagnetic radiation can also alter the chemical and biologic
      properties of substances.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The present inventor has developed a process and<span
        style="font-weight: bold;"> apparatus for effecting changes in
        the molecular structure of a primary material, such as metal and
        ceramics, to induce atypical energetic attributes in such
        material. Further, it has been discovered that the primary
        material in which the molecular structure has been altered can
        be used to impart similar molecular changes in secondary
        substances that come into close proximity to the altered primary
        material. One example of such usage is to use the primary
        altered material to treat and purify water.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0005] A process and an apparatus are provided for altering the
      biological, chemical, and molecular activity of primary materials,
      such as metals and ceramics, in order to confer atypical abilities
      and energy effects on the so-altered primary materials. The
      primary material to be treated is vibrated at high speed and is
      then exposed to an array of varying energy types at varying
      frequencies. Electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic and thermal
      energy may be employed in effecting molecular change, and the
      primary material may also be exposed to light in the far-infrared
      range and laser radiation, as well. Such exposure causes
      vibrational excitation of the primary material at the molecular
      level and a change in the rotational states of the electrons of
      the atoms forming the molecules of the primary material. The
      molecular changes caused by exposure to the process of the present
      invention changes the energetic nature of the so-treated primary
      material.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The primary material is then effective in altering the
      biologic, chemical, and molecular activity of secondary materials
      brought in close proximity thereto. An example of the use of the
      apparatus and process of the present invention is to employ the
      treated primary material in a process and apparatus for purifying
      water.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] An apparatus for inducing these molecular changes employs a
      high power output, including frequencies that excite vibrational
      and rotational states of the treated materials at an intensity
      sufficient to activate the materials to a level such that
      molecular and ionic bonds that determine the spatial character and
      biologic activity of materials be irreversibly changed to such
      extent that the materials assume different energy characteristics
      relative to their pre-treatment states.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The apparatus employs a high power output, including
      frequencies that can excite vibrational and rotational states of
      the treated materials at an intensity sufficient to activate the
      materials to dislodge electrons from quantum shells surrounding
      the nucleus of the atom and displace them into quantum shells
      different from those in which the electrons orbited in the primary
      material prior to treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Material that is molecularly changed by the process and
      apparatus according to the invention is referred to as
      "molecularly changed work material" or just "work material" or
      "primary material." Material that is molecularly changed by being
      exposed to molecularly changed work material is referred to as
      "molecularly changed substance" or "secondary material."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0010] Inducing the molecular
        changes in primary materials using the invention is a complex,
        energy dependant, and time-consuming process. However, use of
        primary material, once they have been molecularly changed, so as
        to induce secondary molecular changes in other materials, is a
        relatively simple process whereby gases, fluids or solids are
        brought into close interfacial contact with the primary material</span>.
      The effective operating principal of inducing the molecular
      changes in the secondary material is the implosion of subtle
      electromagnetic energy fields emanating from the primary material.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] In a broad sense, the invention is directed to the
      restructuring of molecules into spatial characteristics with
      altered atomic configurations. The altered materials are modified
      with respect to the shifting of electrons from one quantum shell
      to another, thereby irrevocably altering the molecular, chemical
      or biological structure of the material in such a manner as to
      affect other materials brought into close proximity.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] One example of material that can be molecularly changed by
      the inventive process and apparatus disclosed herein is a
      far-infrared (FIR) ray-emitting material. Preferably, such
      material comprises ceramic beads or spheres having diameters
      varying from 0.1-1.5 inches, or small cubes or hexagons with sides
      varying from 0.5-2.5 inches, or as plates or discs having
      dimensions or diameters of up to three feet with a thickness of at
      least one inch.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The ceramic material can be composed of a core material
      having an ultra fine powder of one or more compounds selected from
      alumina hydrate, silica hydrate, alumina, silica, and silicate
      adhered to the core material. This material itself, or combined
      with other substances, can provide far-infrared radiation to
      various objects to effect excitation vibration of molecules of
      solids, liquids or gases in the materials so exposed, thus aiding
      in the production of both primary molecular changes, and secondary
      molecular changes.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] A far-infrared radiating material can be obtained by
      methods such as by pulverizing natural stone which has been
      absorbing solar energy for a geologically long time period,
      emitting far-infrared radiation of the wavelength 4-14 [mu]m and
      comprising at least about 20% of Si, about 15% of Al, about 10% of
      K and about 5% of Fe, and forming the materials into spheres or
      other geometric shapes as already described.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The infrared laser radiation process is accomplished by
      sweeping the laser beam over the surface of the primary material
      to be molecularly changed. If sweeping the beam is deemed not to
      be sufficient to adequately cover the surface of the primary
      material, highly reflective mirrors or surfaces of reflecting
      plates can be used, and/or the specimen can be moved or rotated.
      In this manner, the entire surface of the specimen can be covered.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Molecular changes in the primary material are produced by
      the interaction of all of the energy components acting on the
      primary material as described in the invention, under conditions
      described in the invention. However, different degrees of
      molecular changes can be induced in the primary material by the
      use of separate components of the invention, such as for example,
      far-infrared radiation, used either alone or in various
      combinations with the other energy sources described in the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Metal or ceramic devices in which primary molecular changes
      have been induced using the process and/or apparatus of the
      invention are then employed as molecular change-inducing tools to
      create secondary molecular changes in secondary materials, e.g.
      water. The primary material must be re-exposed to the molecular
      change-inducing apparatus of the invention at various time
      intervals in order to be "recharged."<br>
      <br>
      [0018] The time interval necessary for recharging primary
      materials by re-inducing primary molecular changes will depend on
      many parameters such as the original degree of primary molecular
      changes induced in the material, the activity to which it has been
      applied as a molecular change-inducing tool, and the length of
      time that the molecular change-inducing tool has been in service.
      Notwithstanding these variables, it is expected that molecular
      change-inducing tools will maintain their viability for a period
      of at least six to twelve months.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] Primary material can bring about secondary molecular
      changes in other secondary materials provided the secondary
      material is brought into close proximity with the primary material
      created or enhanced by the invention. This relationship can have
      significant benefits in a number of fields related to medicine,
      industry and commerce.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] With respect to unaltered secondary materials, particularly
      liquids and gases, pulses of energy from primary material, brought
      into close contact with the as yet unaltered secondary material,
      affect secondary materials so as to alter the molecular, chemical
      or biologic structure of the secondary material, referred to as a
      process of inducing secondary molecular changes.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The use of primary material molecularly changed through the
      use of the process and apparatus described above to induce changes
      in secondary material or substances can have far ranging uses.
      Examples of the use of energy radiated by molecularly changed
      primary material include use of the primary material or secondary
      substances or material in biological treating apparatus for plants
      or animals, including humans, and use of the primary material or
      secondary substances or material in thermal apparatus including
      hairdryers, and lamps for treating living tissue, as, for example,
      in saunas.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] A specific example of the use of primary material altered
      to radiate energy is the use of such material in "molecular
      purification" processes, for example, to cleanse contaminated
      water in order to make it potable. This can be carried out at the
      industrial level in terms of cleaning contaminated water brought
      up from below ground as well as to devices used at the household
      level to clean and remove contaminants and foreign ions from tap
      water. It can also be used for maintaining "clean" water in
      swimming pools and hot tubs without the necessity for adding
      chemicals, as is the current standard practice. The technology has
      many other applied technology applications and beneficial effects
      whereby contaminants are removed, materials are made more
      energetic and reactive, and the growth of organisms such as
      bacteria, fungi and algae is suppressed or inhibited.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] For example, when water is the secondary material treated
      by exposure to radiated energy from the primary materials,
      clusters of water molecules are disassociated. Thus, impurities
      existing within such water clusters can be removed by exposing the
      water to the primary material. The impurities are precipitated
      from the water, whereby the water is purified. For example, water
      contaminated with such gases as sulfurous acid gas, hydrochloric
      acid gas, carbonic acid gas, and so on, which lie inside the water
      clusters, is purified by the application of radiated energy since
      the radiated energy cleaves the clusters, and thus the gases are
      released therefrom. Also, for the case of contamination of water
      with heavy metals such as mercury, cadmium, and so on, the
      application of the radiation causes the dissociation of the
      clusters which include such metals, and consequently these metals
      precipitate. The water is purified, simply by removing the
      precipitates from the water.<br>
      <br>

      invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0029] While this invention is susceptible of embodiments in many
      different forms, there are shown in the drawings, and will be
      described herein in detail, specific embodiments thereof with the
      understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered as
      an exemplification of the principles of the invention and is not
      intended to limit the invention to the specific embodiments
      illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment molecular-change
      inducing apparatus 20 used to induce molecular changes in a work
      material, tool or device, or "primary material" 22 introduced
      therein.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] <span style="font-weight: bold;">The apparatus 20 includes
        an insulated sub-base 24 measuring about, but not limited to, 4
        inches in thickness and 6 ft in length and 4 ft in width. An
        insulating block of about four inches in thickness of solid
        electrically insulating material is used as a base 28 and having
        substantially the same dimensions as the insulated sub-base 24
        to which it is attached.</span><br>
      <br>
      [0032] A plexi-glass chamber 34 of at least two inches in
      thickness is affixed to the base 28. The dimensions of the chamber
      34 are about 4 ft in length, 2.5 ft in width, and 18 inches in
      height. The chamber 34 may require strengthening along its
      dimensions with rigid struts or the like in order to maintain
      integrity when under vacuum. The chamber 34 is constructed with
      airtight seals so that it can be vacuuated. It has a removable top
      36 for specimen access which is affixed to the main body of the
      chamber 34 with an airtight seal employing a suitable gasket and
      means of closure such as thumb screws (not shown).<br>
      <br>
      [0033] An insulated specimen table 44 with suitable clamps (not
      shown) is contained in the center of the chamber 34. The specimen
      table 44 is constructed from the same insulating material used in
      the base 28 of the apparatus and is about 30 inches in length, 18
      inches in width. The specimen table 44 is mounted on an axle or
      shaft 50 which passes through the chamber 34 and is connected to a
      vibration motor 52 so that the primary material specimen 22 can be
      vibrated at high speed while it is under energetic bombardment.
      Where the axle 50 passes through the chamber 34 adequate seals
      must be provided to ensure it will be vacuum-tight.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] A power generation assembly 53 is located adjacent to the
      chamber 34 and will be large in size in order to house the
      components necessary to generate the power requirements of the
      invention. Alternatively, the power generation assembly, or
      assemblies, may be housed in an adjacent separate housing or room
      since it must accommodate large and high-powered equipment capable
      of generating and delivering the necessary power to the specimen.
      All power leads bringing supply to the chamber will be connected
      to the outer aspect of a connector plate 55a located in the wall
      of the chamber using suitable connectors such as Lemo or Reddel
      connectors, from a corresponding plate 55b on the power generating
      assembly 53. Power will be brought into the chamber to the
      specimen table 44 via connectors/leads 54 attached at the inner
      aspect of the connector plate 55a using similar connectors to
      those used on the external surface. Power cables 57 inside the
      chamber terminate in conducting clamps 58 for attachment to the
      specimen on the specimen table so as to apply the generated
      electrical energy directly to the primary material undergoing
      treatment. The power generation assembly 53 must be able to
      produce a powerful electro-magnetic field within the chamber.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] <span style="font-weight: bold;">A high magnetic
        background field such as 12,000 gauss and up, and high field
        gradients of the order of at least 1300 kilogauss per centimeter
        are employed using electromagnets 62. A suitable array of
        electromagnets 62 are placed within chamber 34 surrounding the
        specimen table 44 to generate the magnetic background field.
        Electrical energy is supplied to electromagnets 62 from the
        power generation assembly through the use of conventional
        cabling 61. A far-infrared (FIR) light field of high intensity,
        provided by FIR radiators 63 is arranged surrounding the chamber
        so that the specimen table 44 will come under FIR bombardment.
        The FIR output wavelength will be in the ideal range of 4-20
        [mu]m but a wider spectrum of 4-1000 [mu]m is acceptable.</span><br>
      <br>
      [0036] Laser radiation is directed into a light pipe 60 to be
      reflected, if necessary, by one or more mirrors or highly
      reflective plates (not shown) pivotally attached to the light
      pipe. The light pipe can be moved along its axis or rotated about
      its axis. High energy infrared laser radiation sources employed
      can be a <span style="font-weight: bold;">CO2 laser adapted to
        radiate principally at 10.6 [mu]m and 9.6 [mu]m; or a CO laser
        adapted to radiate at many frequencies between 5-6.2 [mu]m; or a
        YAG:Nd.&lt;+3 &gt;solid-state laser adapted to radiate at about
        1 [mu]m.</span> The amplitude of radiation emitted by the laser
      can be also controlled and the output radiation frequency from the
      particular laser employed can be modulated and filtered to produce
      substantially one determined frequency.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] When undergoing treatment using the process and apparatus
      disclosed herein, the temperature of the specimen 22 should be
      within the range of 0-200 degrees F. In some circumstances it may
      be necessary to initially cool or freeze the specimen prior to
      commencing the process. A thermocouple (not shown) should be
      supplied to attach to the specimen 22 to monitor the temperature
      of the specimen 22. The output signal of the thermocouple can be
      supplied to a printer/recorder to record the temperature of the
      specimen 22 during the treatment. The thermocouple output signal
      can also be supplied to a suitable dial gauge or LED readout
      interface to allow monitoring of the temperature of the specimen
      22 during the treatment process.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] When the FIR radiators 63 are used during the treatment
      process, the thermal energy produced by the radiators 63 should be
      sufficient to heat the specimen 22 to the desired temperature. A
      heating source 64 may be provided within the chamber 34 to insure
      that the desired temperature of the specimen 22 is maintained when
      the FIR radiators 63 are not employed during treatment of the
      specimen 22, or as an auxiliary source of thermal energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The electrical energy provided by the power generating
      assembly 53 to the primary material 22 via cables 57, 59 and
      clamps 58, 61, respectively, has variable voltage which is
      independently controlled, with such <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">voltage preferably in the range 5-100K volts</span>. The
      electrical energy can alternately have variable current which is
      independently controlled, <span style="font-weight: bold;">preferably











        in the range of 5 mA-50K amperes</span>. The electrical energy
      has variable frequency which is independently controlled,
      preferably in the range 0.1 Hz to 100 GHz.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The application of the above-described energy to the
      specimen 22 should take place in a vacuum. In order to create the
      vacuum within the chamber 34, a connector 70 with an open/close
      tap for use in the creation of a vacuum in the chamber is
      supplied. A suitable vacuum pump 74, such as a 3 hp staged unit,
      capable of creating a<span style="font-weight: bold;"> vacuum of
        1*10&lt;31 4 &gt;Torr.</span> within chamber 34, is connected to
      connector 70.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] All of the above parameters are independently controlled
      and the specimen 22 can be exposed to any or all of the above, and
      at any step in the output ranges specified. Output parameters
      should be recorded using suitable means such as computers,
      calibrated charts or printers, and may be monitored during the
      process through the use of conventional meters and/or LED
      readouts.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> [0042] In order to carry out one
        exemplary process of the invention, a steel specimen having a
        mass of 10 lbs is subjected concurrently to the outputs
        according to the schedules given below. The outputs are
        ramped-up evenly during a portion of, or all of, each time
        segment. Alternate metals which can be used are aluminum and
        chromium cobalt.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> [0043] The specimen is radiated
        with Far Infrared radiation (FIR) as a constant output, whereby
        the radiation emitted is fixed within the frequency range of
        4-1000 [mu]m. The FIR radiators are activated at the
        commencement of the process and are left on and remain constant
        throughout the process. The specimen is subjected to constant
        vibration at about 30 Hz throughout the process.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> [0044] The specimen is heated

        temperature of about 200 degrees F.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> [0045] The specimen is subjected
        to a vacuum environment of up to 1*10&lt;31 4 &gt;Torr during
        the first, third, and fifth hour of the process, each time
        period lasting sixty minutes.</span><br style="font-weight:
        bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> [0046] The specimen is charged
        with electrical energy, the voltage and current are ramped up
        according to the schedule shown in the appropriate table below.
        The sequence takes place over a 15-hour time period. The
        frequency and corresponding magnetic energy ramp-up are also
        included in the table.</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"> [0047] With respect to high

        the second, fourth, sixth and eighth hour of the process, with
        each radiation period continuing for a sixty minute period,
        employing the frequency ranges specified.</span><br>
      <br>
      [0048] While the above output schedule can be taken as one
      approach to inducing molecular change of a particular specimen, in

      [0049] Once energetically bombarded as described above to induce
      changes in the molecular structure of the primary material 22, the
      material 22 may be removed from the apparatus 20 and can be used
      as a tool or device to induce molecular changes in a secondary
      substance. As one example, a water "rejuvenation" process and
      apparatus for undertaking the process will be described. Not only
      will molecular changes achieve similar or greater purity in the
      water as will be effected by passing the water through a filter, a
      distillation process, or a treatment train, but such use of the
      molecularly changed primary material will also produce energy
      effects that cannot be obtained by any other process.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] It is known that all matter in the universe takes the form
      of particles. Atoms are composed of heavy particles in the
      nucleus, with lighter electrons orbiting around the outside in
      discrete quantum shells. The particles are discrete, indivisible
      units, or quanta. Although these particles continue to be studied
      in depth, they cannot be measured accurately, and it is not
      possible to predict what they will do. Sometimes they behave like
      particles, sometimes like waves. However, it has been established
      that particles interact when they are in close proximity. This is
      the basis of the secondary molecular changes induced by the
      primary material, according to the invention. The operating
      principle of the apparatus for inducing secondary molecular
      changes in a substance or "secondary treating apparatus" is the
      bringing of the secondary material to be treated into close
      proximity to molecularly changed primary material. The implosion
      of the subtle electromagnetic energy fields emanating from the
      primary material that has been subjected to molecular changes
      causes a molecular change in the secondary material.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The use of molecularly changed primary material to effect
      molecular changes in secondary material can best be described by
      reference to an example of such use. For example, use of primary
      material that has been molecularly changed by use of the process
      and apparatus of the present invention has been used to induce
      molecular change in water. In this example, the molecular change
      is brought about by passing water through a tube of material
      containing a series of baffles, referred to as a molecular
      change-inducing filter or tube. The tube in its entirety has been
      previously subjected to primary molecular changes in accordance
      with the process and by use of the apparatus described above.
      Water passing through the molecular change-inducing filter
      undergoes a change in its structural composition that cannot be
      brought about by conventional methods aimed at purification of
      water. There are no limitations to the dimensions of the
      molecularly changed filter used in the process, nor are there any
      limitations to the flow rate of water, or volume of water, passing
      through the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The device itself neither employs electricity nor
      magnetism. Materials that have been changed at the molecular level
      molecularly change other materials brought into contact, for
      example water, provided that there is close proximity of the
      interfaces. The energy fields produced within the molecularly
      changed tube interact with the water to cause a restructuring of
      the physical and energetic properties of the water. In this way,
      water molecules that come into contact with the molecularly
      changed tube become reactive at a molecular level through
      vibrational excitation that, in turn, affects the quantum shell
      around the nucleus of the molecule. This shift produces an
      extremely high level of energy that is the initiator of the
      molecular change phenomenon.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0053] This process therefore
        creates high energy or concentrates natural energies at the
        molecular level and transmits it to the water molecules flowing
        through the tube, resulting in an energized, "healthy", and more
        "alive" water. Molecularly changed water shows a reduction in
        its surface tension and tastes different from either regular tap
        water or water that has been processed with various types of
        filtration or distillation apparatus. Molecularly treated water
        also offers an unfriendly environment for the growth and
        survival of pathogenic bacteria, fungi and algae. The treated
        water remains free from the usual contaminants since the
        negative oscillations of chemical toxins and heavy metals are
        removed by the molecular change process.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0054] <span style="font-weight: bold;">The end result of the
        water treatment process of the example given is that water
        becomes activated in a positive manner as it is restored to a
        pristine state, a state which it is theorized existed millions
        of years ago.</span> Thus, the oscillation energy composition of
      the water is harmonized and restored to a more natural state,
      hitherto not obtained using any conventional synthetic purifying
      process.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The molecularly changed water becomes activated in a
      positive way as it is restored to a pristine state similar in many
      ways to unaltered water from a mountain spring. Thus, the
      oscillation energy composition of the water is harmonized and
      restored to a more natural state, hitherto not obtained using any
      conventional synthetic purifying process.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Below are two simple analogies that help to describe and
      visualize the molecular change phenomenon imparted by use of
      primary material molecularly changed through use of the process
      and apparatus of the present invention, and by specific reference
      to the example of use of the primary molecularly changed primary
      material to effect molecular changes in a secondary material, such
      as water.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] One such analogy is to imagine that the secondary molecular
      change-inducing apparatus as a device containing red-colored dye.
      When such apparatus is suspended in a container of water, the
      water that comes into contact with the dye apparatus is stained
      red by the dye. This is seen first in the water immediately
      surrounding the dye container. Over time, however, the dye spreads
      throughout the water until all of the water is eventually dyed a
      uniform red color. Agitation to the water, or causing water to
      flow through the dye-containing apparatus, will decrease the time
      necessary for the water to become uniformly colored, in that the
      amount of water that has come into contact with the apparatus is
      increased. Just as water coming into contact with the
      dye-containing apparatus is stained red, water coming into contact
      with molecularly changed primary material is itself molecularly
      altered, until, over time, all the water in the reservoir into
      which the molecularly changed primary material is placed is
      treated. The time required to effect such change can be shortened
      by agitation of the water or by passing the water through the
      primary material.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The molecular change process can also be compared to some
      extent to the effects of a vibrating tuning fork. When a vibrating
      tuning fork is placed in close proximity to a stationary tuning
      fork, the vibrations from the vibrating tuning fork pass through
      the air to cause the previously stationary tuning fork to resonate
      similarly. This is detected both by the sight of the fork
      vibrating as well as by the sound emitted. Other stationary tuning
      forks placed in proximity will also be affected in the same manner
      and commence similar vibrations. This analogy demonstrates the
      principle of vibrational excitation caused by a substance coming
      into close proximity to a vibrationally-excited material.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate a secondary molecular change
      inducing apparatus 100 wherein the secondary material is a gas or
      liquid. The secondary substance 101 to be molecularly changed
      using the secondary molecular change apparatus and process
      disclosed herein is contained in a holding tank 102 which can be
      of varying sizes. The tank may be constructed from any material
      such as metal, or plastic such as cross-linked medium density
      polyethylene. The holding tank 102 can have, for example, the
      dimensions of six feet in height and 4 feet in diameter. In such
      an example, a vertical rod 106 of about one inch in diameter and
      greater than six foot in length, constructed from steel or other
      metal of suitable strength, is arranged in a central position in
      the tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The base of the rod 106 fits into a recessed metal cup 110
      in the center of a floor 114 of the tank 102, the cup 110 having a
      diameter slightly greater than that of the thickness of the rod,
      and in which it can rotate freely. The hole through which the rod
      projects into the upper part of the tank is located in the center
      of a horizontal bar 120 that spans the diameter of the tank at its
      upper lip and which is fixed securely to the sides of the tank.
      The tank may or may not have a top or lid that covers the
      contents. The top of the rod terminates in a crank handle 126 that
      can be rotated either manually or by the attachment of a motor or
      other power supply. The crank handle 126 can be continuous with
      the rod or removably attached to the upper end of the rod by a
      mechanism such as a grooved and sleeved device.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] A number of primary molecularly changed plates or discs 132
      are attached at various levels to the rod so that they remain
      suspended into the tank. These plates are constructed from either
      a ceramic material, a solid metal, or a metal mesh which can
      contain particles of primary molecularly changed material such as
      ceramic cubes or spheres. The plates 132 may be circular,
      rectangular or rod-shape in dimension and are attached to the
      central rod by a suitable mechanism, such as by holes through the
      center of the plates and a locking apparatus to secure them at any
      interval along the length of the rod.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The plates 132 may have one or more paddles or vanes 160
      attached to the outer aspect of the plates so that when the plates
      are turned by movement of the crank handle 126, the surrounding
      secondary material 101 moves in a circular direction. This
      movement will aid in the process of molecularly changing the
      secondary material by causing more secondary material to come into
      contact with the molecularly changed discs, and by breaking up the
      molecularly changed secondary material that will form adjacent to
      the entire outer surface of each plate as the molecular change
      process evolves and continues.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The size of the plates 132 in this example, for use in a
      holding tank 102 which is four feet in diameter and six feet in
      height, would be three feet in diameter and two inches or more in
      thickness for a solid plate, and about six inches in thickness for
      a metal mesh container into which molecularly changed particles
      would be suspended.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] At least one primary molecularly changed disc 132 would be
      used in this apparatus attached to the central rod, but more
      likely there would be several discs 132 attached at various levels
      of the rod. For example, one molecularly changed disc would be
      placed in the central location along the rod, that is at a depth
      of three feet from the top of the tank, whereas a second primary
      molecularly changed plate would be attached between this central
      plate and the top of the tank at a position eighteen inches in
      depth from the top of the tank. A third primary molecularly
      changed plate would be affixed to the rod between the centrally
      placed molecularly changed plate and the base of the tank at a
      position of four feet six inches from the top of the tank. The
      actual number and position of the plates attached to the central
      rod would depend on the level to which such tanks would be filled
      with secondary material. Alternatively to a solid disc 132, one or
      more mesh disc-shaped containers 138 holding molecularly changed
      beads 140 could be used. Secondary material would be introduced
      into the tank at a level which may be up to and above the top
      primary molecularly changed disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] As a simple means of estimating the efficacy of the
      molecular change process when water, for example, is the secondary
      material undergoing treatment, and to help in determining an end
      point in the process, a pH meter can be attached to an outlet
      valve in the holding tank, or water samples can be withdrawn from
      the tank for pH measurement.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The pH of the sample should be taken at commencement of the
      process and estimates of pH change should be noted at intervals,
      which may be as often as every hour or as infrequent as every
      eight hours. An increase in pH level of the sample will indicate
      that the secondary molecular change process is being carried out
      effectively. These<span style="font-weight: bold;"> pH reading
        will become more alkaline, that is, increase in numeric value,
        up to a range of pH 8.0 to 9.0 or beyond.</span><br>
      <br>
      [0067] Another relatively simple test that can be performed when
      water is the secondary material undergoing treatment to assess the
      progress of molecular change is to measure the change in its Redox
      potential. Other more sophisticated estimates and assays of water
      purification and content can be used on samples removed from the
      tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The crank handle 126 is turned either by hand or by a power
      source so that a circular motion is produced in the secondary
      material that increases surface contact between the secondary
      material and the molecularly changed discs. The presence of
      paddles or vanes 160 on the periphery of the discs would help
      produce and maintain the movement of water. If a power source is
      available to turn the crank handle, this can be run at a slow
      revolution for about one hour, and restart after a one-hour break.
      This duty cycle of one hour on and one hour off can continue for
      the entire period during which the secondary material is
      undergoing treatment. If the crank handle is to be turned
      manually, then it can be rotated at intervals that are convenient
      to those operating the system(s).<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The time necessary to induce molecular change of the
      secondary material in a holding tank of the dimension described
      above is about twelve hours, but this time interval is not
      critical. The tank can be filled with secondary material when
      convenient and be ready to empty any time after the twelve hour
      period has elapsed. When it has been estimated that sufficient
      molecular change of the secondary material has occurred, such
      material is evacuated from the holding tank and replaced by
      another quantity of untreated secondary material which is to be
      molecularly changed by the same process.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] It is not necessary to empty the holding tank completely
      before adding more secondary material to be molecularly changed.
      What constitutes "sufficient molecular change" will depend on the
      nature of the secondary material, and the purpose for which the
      secondary material is to be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Molecular change filters 200 should be employed. These
      molecular change filters are described below and should be placed
      in the incoming material supply 168 to the holding tank, and in
      the outgoing material supply tube 170 coming from the holding
      tank, or both.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] FIG. 4 illustrates a molecular change filter 200. The
      filter 200 includes a body 202 formed by a molecularly changed
      tube 204 about<span style="font-weight: bold;"> twenty-four inches
        in length and about twelve inches in diameter substantially
        closed at its opposite ends</span>. The filter 200 has an entry
      nozzle 210 at the center of one end, and an exit nozzle 214 at the
      other end, each being about three inches in diameter and four
      inches in length. These nozzles are used for connection to a pipe
      containing the incoming source of secondary material and, after
      passing through the molecular change filter, to the outgoing
      secondary change supply going, for example, to the holding tank
      102 previously described. Different diameter entry and exit
      nozzles can be used depending on local requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A first mesh filter 222, preferably composed of stainless
      steel, is placed between the entry nozzle 210 and the internal
      aspect of the filter, and a second filter 226, preferably composed
      of stainless steel, is placed between the internal aspect of the
      filter and the exit nozzle. The mesh filters placed between the
      entry nozzle 210 and the body 202 of the filter, and the exit
      nozzle 214 and the body 202 of the filter prevent the molecularly
      changed primary material, such as ceramic beads, from escaping
      from the body of the molecularly changed filter. The body of the
      filter contains, and is packed with molecularly changed primary
      material, such as, for example, ceramic beads or spheres 236
      having diameters which vary from 0.1-1.5 inches.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Although this apparatus and method describes a commercial
      system for the molecular change of secondary material, a
      scaled-down version can be easily employed for personal or
      domestic use. This can be used on, for example, the main incoming
      water supply to a house so that all water systems within the house
      will supply molecularly changed water. As a further example of
      personal use, alternatively, a small under sink device can be
      employed to molecularly change water that flows through that
      particular faucet system. With these scaled-down versions, a
      similarly scaled-down molecular change filter should be supplied
      on the outgoing pipe from the device into the house. At the very
      least, a conventional filter containing, for example, a molecular
      sieve, should be supplied through which the water supply will flow
      from the device to either the house or particular faucet system.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] As a further use of the molecularly changed filter
      described above, the example of attachment of such a filter to the
      outgoing side of a pool pump filter is given. Such use will keep
      the water in a swimming pool in a clean and relatively bacteria
      and algae free condition without the necessity for using acids
      such as muriatic acid, and halogenated agents such as chlorine or
      bromine. This system works effectively and efficiently
      irrespective of the size of the swimming pool. The molecular
      filter nozzles 210 and 214 that are used for connection to the
      tubing are sized in relation to the pool filter pump. The
      molecularly changed filter is therefore placed within the outgoing
      water supply path coming from the pump to the swimming pool. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The body of the molecularly changed
        filter is packed with molecularly changed primary material, such
        as ceramic beads or spheres of varying diameter.</span> Two mesh
      filters are used. One is placed between the entry nozzle and the
      internal aspect of the filter, and the other is placed between the
      internal aspect of the filter and the exit nozzle. These are
      affixed to the internal walls so that they are placed directly
      over, and cover completely, the incoming and outgoing nozzles. The
      steel mesh filters, placed between the entry and exit nozzles and
      the body of the filter, prevent the molecularly changed primary
      material from escaping from the body of the molecularly changed
      filter.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] During construction of the molecularly changed filter, it
      would be subjected to the primary molecular change-inducing
      apparatus 20 of the invention, and subsequently would be effective
      to induce secondary molecular changes to the water supply for the
      swimming pool. The same techniques can be applied to Jacuzzi's and
      hot tubs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0077] Experimental Results</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0078] An experiment was carried out by the inventor using a
      prototype of this molecularly changed filter. The filter used was
      less sophisticated than the one described above in this invention
      and consisted of a simple metal tube as the primary material which
      had previously been molecularly changed according to the following
      protocol.<br>
      <br>
      [0079]<span style="font-weight: bold;"> The metal tube, a steel
        tube, which weighed approximately 40 pounds, was contained in a
        closed aluminum chamber approximately seven feet in length and
        two feet in width. The tube was subjected to electrical AC
        voltage at 60 Hz., which was constantly ramped up over a
        four-hour period from zero volts to a maximum of about 500
        volts. An array of electromagnets was arranged in the chamber
        surrounding the tube and supplied a magnetic field to the tube,
        which was constantly ramped up from zero gauss to 150 gauss,
        during this four-hour period. During the four-hour period, the
        tube was exposed to vibration of about 30 Hz.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0080] The so-treated tube was placed into the outgoing water flow
      from the filter pump to the swimming pool and was approximately <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">24 inches in length and six inches in
        diameter</span>. The metal tube was completely open throughout
      its length and contained no inclusions.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] In this experiment, a large swimming pool was employed,
      having dimensions of 35 feet by 30 feet with a depth varying from
      two feet to six feet in the main area, and with an attached diving
      area of twelve feet by twenty feet with a depth of ten feet.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] With this particular swimming pool, colorimetric analyses
      (dye tests) were used on a daily basis in order to test the degree
      of contamination of pool water and to determine the time at which
      to add chemicals. As a result of this analysis, it had been
      standard practice to add chemicals to the pool every third day in
      order to maintain it in a condition suitable for use, that is
      without yellow discoloration due to a change in pH, build up of
      contaminants, bacteria and algae.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] <span style="font-weight: bold;">After two days use of the
        molecularly changed filter, the pool water did not turn cloudy
        with signs of yellow discoloration nor did the pH of the water
        change. In fact, it became clear and sparkling in nature, much
        cleaner than at any previous time during previous use of the
        pool even with the constant addition of chemicals. Swimming
        proved to be more pleasant since there was no irritation to the
        eyes that inevitably occurred when chemicals were added, and no
        chemical smell that always appeared to stay with the swimmer for
        long periods.</span><br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0084] The experiment was
        continued for a five-month period. Colorimetric analysis of the
        water was carried out on a daily basis and confirmed the stable
        pH, and clean and uncontaminated nature of the water. During the
        five month period that the molecularly changed filter was
        attached to the filter pump flow system, the pool water was
        maintained at this clear and sparkling level. At no time were
        chemicals added to the water. The results were clear and
        unequivocal with respect to the efficacy of the molecularly
        changed filter.</span><br>
      <br>
      [0085] The molecularly changed pool filter described in this
      section of the invention, being an improvement on what was used in
      the above experiment, will be at least as effective, if not more
      so, than that used in the above experiment. <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">The inclusion of ceramic beads or
        spheres in the molecularly changed filter will enhance the
        degree of molecular change achieved.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">[0086] Other Potential Uses and
        Benefits of Molecular Change Process and Apparatus</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0087] The use of molecularly changed filters used in automobile
      engines should prove to have a significant effect in increased
      efficiency and therefore make the vehicle more power and energy
      efficient. The use of molecularly changed gas tanks in vehicles
      will also have the effect of decreasing gas consumption. This will
      apply to both diesel and gasoline fuels due to greater
      efficiencies of use. The effect will increase the number of miles
      per gallon irrespective of the type of gasoline used or the type
      of vehicle being utilized. Both of the above are highly relevant
      considering the high price of petroleum by-products and the huge
      use of gasoline in industrialized countries such as the United
      States. It would also make the U.S. and other countries less
      reliant on oil producing countries.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Molecular changes of natural gas lines should also have
      similar effects on the gas passing through the pipes leading to
      more efficient usage and reductions in costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] The above-applied technologies could mean huge financial
      savings to nations as a whole and especially to individuals.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] The production of molecularly changed primary material,
      using the process and apparatus described above, for use in
      inducing changes in secondary material or substances can have far
      ranging uses including: use of the primary material in biological
      treating apparatus for plants or animals, including humans, use of
      the primary material in thermal apparatus including hairdryers,
      lamps for treating living tissue, saunas.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] From the foregoing, it will be observed that numerous
      variations and modifications may be effected without departing
      from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is to be understood
      that no limitation with respect to the specific apparatus
      illustrated herein is intended or should be inferred. It is, of
      course, intended to cover by the appended claims all such
      modifications as fall within the scope of the claims.<br>
