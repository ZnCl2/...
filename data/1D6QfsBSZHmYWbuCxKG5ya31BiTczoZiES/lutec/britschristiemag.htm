          <br>
          This invention relates to heat generator apparatus.<br>
          <br>
          This invention has particular but not exclusive application to
          heat generator apparatus for harvesting wind power and for
          illustrative purposes reference will be made to such
          application. However, it is to be understood that this
          invention could be used in other applications, such as
          conversion of rotational motion to heat generally.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIOR ART</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In the field of alternative or renewable energy technology,
          wind power occupies a credible niche in the partial
          replacement of fossil fuel usage Wind farms are well
          established in the United States and Europe, some
          installations approaching base load utility. Invariably, wind
          power is utilized one of three ways. In the first instance
          there are large capital intensive installations adapted to
          produce electricity for a grid. In the second instance there
          are variations on the traditional windmill theme of pumping
          water. In the third there are opportunistic DC electrical
          generators, typically for marine use and adapted to provide
          part of a mixed-charging regime for batteries in remote
          locations, usually in conjunction with solar panels and
          engine-driven alternator backup.<br>
          <br>
          Small wind installations are of limited utility in the
          capturing of wind energy for domestic use. At low wind speeds
          the small DC outputs of wind generators are impractical for
          supplying power to anything other than storage batteries. At
          low wind speeds the start-up loads are also significant. At
          high wind speeds, the DC output must be regulated down,
          capping rotor load and resulting in even faster rotation as
          wind speed increases further. This wastes available energy as
          dissipated heat<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          This invention in one aspect resides broadly in heat generator
          apparatus including:<br>
          <br>
          a non-conductive and non-magnetic support body having a
          plurality of magnetic elements spaced about a periphery
          thereof:<br>
          <br>
          a non-magnetic, electrically and thermally conductive inductor
          body supported in close proximity to periphery;<br>
          <br>
          heat exchange means associated with said inductor body; and<br>
          <br>
          drive means effecting relative rotation between said support
          and said inductor whereby said inductor sequentially cuts the
          lines of force of said plurality of magnetic elements.<br>
          <br>
          The support body and the inductor body may be configured as a
          rotor and a stator or as two rotors. In view of the inductor
          body being associated with the heat exchange means, it is
          preferred that the inductor body be static and that the
          support body rotate relative to it. The rotating support body
          may be configured as a disc, cylinder or a solid of rotation,
          the choice being at least in part configured according to the
          form of the inductor body.<br>
          <br>
          The rotating support body is preferably formed of an
          engineering material selected to allow the mounting of the
          plurality of magnetic elements and having regard to the
          centrifugal forces to which the rotating support body and
          magnetic elements will be subjected It may be advantageous to
          avoid metallic fixings to avoid distortion of the magnetic
          fields. For example, the magnetic elements may be wholly or
          partially embedded in the material of the support body during
          the formation thereof.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of disc-like support bodies, the magnetic elements
          are preferably disposed with like poles directed radially
          outward of the disc. The magnetic elements may be disposed
          with their outer pole faces shaped to conform to the surface
          of rotation of the support body, whereby the clearance between
          the pole surface and the inductor body may be reduced. The
          magnetic elements may be in diametrically opposed positions on
          the disc, particularly where the diameter of the disc is large
          relative to the significant extent of the individual magnetic
          fields. In the alternative, the positions of the magnets may
          be diametrically staggered to minimize pole-to-pole
          interactions across the disc.<br>
          <br>
          The magnetic elements may be selected from permanent magnets
          and electromagnets. In the case of permanent magnets, the flux
          density of rare earth magnets makes this type of magnet
          desirable.<br>
          The number and spacing of the magnetic elements will be at
          least in part determined by the nature of the inductor. For
          example, the inductor may be configured to be located radially
          outward of a disc-like support body and extend partially about
          and clear of the circumference thereof. In practice it has
          been established that, for a support body of radius R and for
          eight permanent magnetic elements of circumferential extent
          0.42R, the spacing on the support body between the pole faces
          is 0-32R. It has been empirically determined that an inductive
          body of circumferential extent of about 0.5R functions well.<br>
          <br>
          The inductor body is preferably of aluminium or other material
          known to be capable of having circulating currents induced
          therein that may interact with a magnetic field. The inductor
          body may be disposed at the circumference of a rotating
          support body as above Alternatively, the inductor body may
          comprise a substantially horseshoe-shaped radial section
          whereby the edge portion of a disclike support body may pass
          through the reentrant of the inductor body in use.<br>
          <br>
          In other embodiments the relationship between the support body
          and its magnetic elements and the inductor may be modified to
          relate to specific applications. For example, a low reactance
          shaft such as a stainless steel propeller shaft on a shaft
          driven vessel may support a cylindrical support member having
          magnetic poles arrayed about its cylindrical surface. In
          sailing vessel applications where the shaft freewheels under
          sail (that is, non-featherable propellers), or in powered
          applications, the inductive heat in the inductor body may be
          harnessed to heat water for reticulation, desalination or
          other purposes.<br>
          <br>
          The drive means may take any form capable of effecting the
          relative rotation of the support body and the inductor body
          and overcome the inherent drag of extracting heat energy
          therefrom. In wind power applications, the drive means may
          comprise a direct or indirect drive from a wind turbine or the
          like.<br>
          <br>
          It is particularly observed that the speed to output curve of
          the present invention admits to use of direct drive using
          simple wind driven elements. This particular application
          utilizes the observation that the start-up load is purely
          inertial and that the relationship between the heating effect
          and rotor speed is a very shallow curve approaching zero speed
          and shows an increasing braking force (and yield) with
          increasing speed from higher speeds. This is to be
          distinguished from dynamos which have significant
          electrodynamic forces to overcome from start-up, and
          alternators which run essentially dead at start-up until the
          field is energized. In addition, the act of regulating speed
          for output, and regulating voltage and/or current, all tend to
          dissipate energy.<br>
          <br>
          In the light of the foregoing, the directly-driven nature of
          the above wind powered embodiments allows the use of the
          simplest of wind rotors. For example, an Arrhenius rotor
          requires no steering mechanism for keeping the head of the
          rotor to windward, and accordingly suffers no torque reaction
          from having one. Further, the apparatus functions independent
          of the direction of rotation.<br>
          It has been observed by the present applicant in test
          embodiments of the present invention that some advantage may
          accrue from varying the speed of rotation of the apparatus
          over time. In particular it is observed that in an
          electrically driven model the pulsing of the driving electric
          motor results in an improvement of efficiency regarding power
          consumption vs heat generated over time. By turning the motor
          power off and allowing the shaft speed to wash off, and then
          turning it back on, so allowing the shaft speed to return to
          it's steady state rpm is enough to demonstrate the effect. It
          is expected in wind driven embodiments that natural variation
          in wind speed and thus rotor rpm will achieve an efficiency
          advantage over constant-speed apparatus.This in turn removes
          the need for a constant speed transmission system such as is
          provided by variable pitch rotors or continuously variable
          transmissions.<br>
          <br>
          The heat exchanger means may utilize any fluid heat transfer
          medium and may be thermally integrated with the inductor block
          by any suitable means consistent with the maintenance of the
          circulating currents upon which the electrodynamic heating
          effect of the present invention depends. The fluid heat
          transfer medium may be liquid or gas. The fluid heat transfer
          medium may be used directly as in hot water or air supply, or
          may comprise an intermediate heat transfer medium such as high
          temperature oil or the like.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of the preferred inductor blocks of aluminium or
          alloys thereof, the heat exchange may occur in passages
          provided in the inductor body per se, suitably manifolded to a
          circuit conveying the energetic fluid to reservoir or work.
          For example, heat exchange passages may be formed by a
          plurality of fins integrally formed with or assembled to the
          inductor block and encased in a preferably non-inductive cover
          which possesses coolant inlet and outlet means.<br>
          <br>
          The energy harvested by apparatus in accordance with the
          present invention may be used to generate hot water or steam,
          for domestic or industrial use.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED
            EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In the figures, there is provided heat generator apparatus 10
          including a support body 11 of about 12 cm radius and about
          5.5 cm thick and formed of a glass reinforced plastics
          material Eight permanent magnets 12 (A to H) are embedded in
          spaced relation about the peripheral portion of the support
          body 11. Each of the magnets extends circumferentially for
          about 5 cm. The outer pole faces 13 of the magnets are
          circumferentially contiguous with the periphery of the support
          body 11. The support body 11 is supported for driven rotation
          on a shaft 14.<br>
          <br>
          An aluminium inductor body 15 has a part cylindrical face 16
          selected to be concentric and close to the cylindrical edge
          surface of the support body 11, the inductor body 15 being
          mounted in this relation. The inductor body 15 has a
          circumferential extent of about 6 cm. Formed in the inductor
          body 15 is a heat exchange labyrinth 17 communicating with an
          inlet 20 and outlet 21 for coolant,<br>
          the labyrinth 17 being closed to form a coolant passage by a
          cover member (not shown).<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 1</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In use, the shaft 14 was couple to an electric motor to
          provide an indication of power input. The motor was run at
          1157 rpm with water running through the labyrinth 17. At
          steady state with a water throughput of 1300 ml/min the
          temperature of the water at the inlet was 30[deg]C and at the
          outlet was 37.1[deg]C. Current measurements determined that
          the motor was running at 745.2 W for the test.<br>
          <br>
          For a 15 second calculation, the electric motor, running at a
          power of 745.2 watts expended 3.015 watt-hrs of energy, or
          2592.45 cal. The specific heat of water is 1cal/g/[deg]C; to
          raise 325g by 7.1[deg]C takes 2307.5 cal. Energy efficiency
          (maximum) is thus 89%, including motor losses. Motor
          specifications indicate that, at rated power and steady state,
          losses at the shaft are less than 10%.<br>
          In Fig. 3, there is illustrated an alternative form of the
          inductor body 15 wherein the labyrinth 17 of Figs. 1 and 2 are
          replaced by integral fins 22 adapted to cooperate with a
          non-inductive cover (nor shown) to form the heat exchange
          means therewith.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLE 2</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In a test run of the apparatus of Fig 1, the output at steady
          state at a shaft speed of 2000 rpm was measured. Interruption
          of power to the motor resulted in a slowing for 2.98 seconds
          to 1400 rpm. Resumption of the motor current resulted in
          acceleration of the apparatus to steady state at 2000 rpm in
          2.78 seconds. This cycle was repeated several times. Motor
          current integration versus temperature rise in the test volume
          of water was measured as before. Despite load losses inherent
          in accelerating the motor, the overall efficiency as compared
          with Example 1 was improved to approximately <span
            style="font-weight: bold;">91%</span>.<br>
          <br>
          It will of course be realised that while the above has been
          given by way of illustrative example of this invention, all
          such and other modifications and variations thereto as would
          be apparent to persons skilled in the art are deemed to fall
          within the broad scope and ambit of this invention as is
