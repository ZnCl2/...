      <p>A Dumagueteño who invented an alternative source of energy
        called the Water Fuel Conversion System is hoping that the
        government will use his invention to address high cost of fuel
        importation and possible depletion of fossil fuels in the Middle
        East due to increased demand from developing countries. </p>
      <p>Antonio Teves, 87, exhibited his invention, which uses 70
        percent water and 30 percent fuel as alternative energy in
        running power plants during the trade fair of the Visayas Area
        Business conference in Dumaguete. </p>
      <p>Teves said the invention was conceived before the war in 1940
        while he was working as a chemist at the Central Azucarera de
        Bais paper division. He went to the United States where he
        perfected the prototype and in 1996, got a patent for his
        invention and another patent the following year in the
        Philippines. </p>
      <p>With the use of his invention, ordinary water will be separated
        into hydrogen and oxygen, the former to replace the gasoline or
        diesel fuel. </p>
      <p>Teves projected a P3 billion savings for the government with
        the use of the Water Fuel Conversion System. </p>
      <p>The invention, he added, will not go to waste because the
        National Power Corporation-Small Plant Unit Group diesel power
        plant in Pilar, Cebu has already installed it and the plant had
        been operating for two years. </p>
      <p>In Siquijor, the system is undergoing final testing for use by
        the electric cooperative there. </p>
      <p>Teves is expected to assist in the installation of the system
        in all of the 236 engines of NAPOCOR throughout the country. </p>
      <p>He said he believed it is high time that government starts to
        use alternative fuels like hydrogen to prepare for any fuel
        crisis in the future. <br>

      <p><b>Abstract: </b>Device and method of generating hydrogen from
        water and utilizing simultaneously the generated hydrogen gas as
        alternative fuel or supplemental for automotive and other
        engines as means to replace up to at least as much as 80% of the
        hydro-carbon fuels used by such engines. The hydrogen generating
        device comprises an electrolytic cell or combination of two or
        more cells energized by a high density direct current of as much
        as 5,000 amperes, such electrical energy derived from the
        automotive engine by transforming mechanical energy to
        electrical energy by means of a direct current generator. The
        electrolytic cell or cells is supplied by a continuous feed
        water supply system. Increased capacities are possible due to
        high amperage loads attainable by the electrolytic cell without
        overheating. This is necessary to produce the requisite amount
        of hydrogen gas fuel capable of operating automotive and other
        engines, for example, with a fuel mixture of hydrogen and only
        20% by volume of the gasoline fuel usually used in the engine,
        after a steady state condition is achieved. The electrolytic
        cell or cells are equipped with means to control energy load,
        water flow, gas flow, gas pressure, and presenting the hydrogen
        gas fuel into the combustion chambers of the automotive and
        other engines. </p>

      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p><b>1. Field of the Invention</b> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to an efficient water fuel converter
        which converts water into hydrogen and oxygen whereby the
        generated hydrogen gas is utilized simultaneously as an
        alternative fuel to replace up to at least 80% of the
        hydrocarbon fuels or other synthetic fuels with the hydrogen
        fuels used by automotive and other engines. For example, the
        fuel generated from the system can replace up to 80% of the
        volume of gasoline admixture normally used in an automobile
        engine. Recycle of the oxygen to the combustion chamber can
        reduce undesirable combustion byproducts, such as nitrogen
        oxide. </p>
      <p><b>2. Description of the Prior Art</b> </p>
      <p>Several patents pertaining to utilization of hydrogen gas as a
        source of fuel for automotive and other engines were not
        well-appreciated by vehicle owners because of several drawbacks,
        disadvantages, and inherent defects in the system. Some were
        very cumbersome, utilizing the ready-made hydrogen contained in
        heavy steel cylinders (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,508,084; 3,983,882;
        4,178,882), while others dealt with generation of hydrogen on a
        very limited scale insufficient to replace a majority (and even
        at least about 80%) of the total volume of fuel requirements of
        automotive and other engines. Other patents (U.S. Pat. Nos.
        4,597,363; 4,368,696; 4,489,864; 3,458,412; 3,242,665;
        4,203,814), generate very limited quantities of hydrogen from
        chemicals and other sources insufficient to supply a majority to
        at least about 80% of the total fuel needs of automotive
        engines. Still another invention (U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,181)
        describes the use of metal hydrides, particularly magnesium
        hydride, in generating hydrogen gas as fuel for automotive
        engines. However, the drawbacks of this invention are: 1) the
        metal hydride is expensive; 2) the process of generating
        hydrogen is complicated and involves costly equipment; and 3)
        the method of refueling is inconvenient and time-consuming.
        Further, the process of regenerating the spent hydride involves
        costly and complex operations. </p>
      <p>Another invention (U.S. Pat. No. 4,763,610) relates to a gas
        generator which generates hydrogen from a 30% solution of sodium
        hydroxide (30% NaOH). The generated hydrogen is not utilized
        directly, but is subsequently mixed with the petroleum- based
        fuel in an engine component before it can run an engine. This
        method has several drawbacks, among which are the following: 1)
        the gas generating device has a limited capacity because it can
        only generate a small amount of hydrogen gas that can not
        replace at least about 80% of the petroleum fuel needed by the
        automotive engine; 2) the products of combustion still contain
        appreciable amounts of pollutants due to the higher proportion
        of petroleum base fuel present; e.g., (CO 0.7%; NO 2 8.9%;
        unburnt hydrocarbon fuel 13.8%). The large amount of unburnt
        hydrocarbon fuel not only increases pollution, but is actually
        energy lost in the combustion process; 3) the process involves
        relatively high concentration of sodium hydroxide (30% NaOH),
        which is prohibitively expensive when compared to the cost of
        pure gasoline or diesel fuel. All these schemes of hydrogen
        generation share two serious problems: 1) the generator is not
        designed to operate a continuous feed system necessary to
        increase output or production of hydrogen from the cell; 2) the
        hydrogen generator is not designed to operate at high current
        densities in order to produce sufficient hydrogen to replace at
        least about 80% of the hydrocarbon fuel used by automotive and
        other engines. </p>
      <p>Another invention (U.S. Pat. No. 4,609,120) dealt with
        photoelectrolytic production of hydrogen only on a very limited
        scale, but this method is not commercially viable and not
        applicable to automotive and other engines. </p>
      <p>Still another invention (U.S. Pat. No. 4,099,489 by Bradley)
        deals with generation of hydrogen in small quantities to be
        combined with the hydrocarbon fuel whose prime purpose is
        reduction of pollution, but not to replace at least about 80% of
        the petroleum fuels used by automotive and other engines. This
        patent has several drawbacks and disadvantages, including the
        following: 1) the method utilizes expensive equipment such as
        turbine, high pressure pumps, water purifier, flow and pressure
        control instruments, D.C. and A.C. generators, condenser, etc.,
        in addition to the costly high pressure electrolytic cell used;
        2) the method employs two sets of generators and a rectifier
        unit which complicates transformation of energy from mechanical
        to electrical energy thereby greatly reducing overall
        efficiently; 3) the complex method and equipment used in
        producing a small quantity of hydrogen to replace an even small
        portion of hydrocarbon fuel required to run the engine with the
        object of simply reducing the pollutant emissions to a very
        small degree will result in a prohibitively high fuel cost; 4)
        the pollutant effect of the hydrocarbon fuel still present in
        the combustion process will remain unabated and will continue to
        be a problem; 5) no laboratory test on the emissions of the
        exhaust of an engine using Bradley's method have been conducted
        or reported. </p>
      <p>Considering the drawbacks of Bradley's invention and other
        cited in the foregoing, the best alternative to conserve the
        energy resources of the United States and eliminate pollution is
        to replace a major portion (e.g. 81%) of the hydrocarbon fuel
        with relatively non-pollutant fuel such as hydrogen, which is
        the object of the present invention. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>When percentage is expressed herein it refers to percent by
        volume. The present invention comprises utilizing an efficient
        hydrogen generator to convert water into hydrogen and oxygen in
        sufficiently large quantities capable of supplying (at steady
        state) a major percentage up to at least about 80% of the volume
        of fuel normally required by an automotive or other internal
        combustion engine by passing a high density direct current
        through water contained in an electrolytic cell or water fuel
        converter, in the range of 50 to 5,000 amperes, whereby the
        generated hydrogen is utilized simultaneously by the automotive
        or other engines, the hydrogen gas passing through a flash back
        preventer, and thence into a hydrogen gas collector tank,
        carburetor adapter and finally to the carburetor of the gasoline
        engine. For diesel and other fuel injection types of engines,
        the hydrogen gas is simply introduced into the respective fuel
        lines of these engines. For gas turbine engines, the hydrogen
        gas is introduced directly into the combustion chamber of the
        engine. </p>
      <p>The drawbacks of the inventions mentioned in the preceding
        Description of the Prior Act (U.S. Pat. No. 4,763,610 and
        others) are solved or overcome in the present invention by
        incorporating the following features: 1) the electrolytic cell
        or cells in the present invention are designed for a continuous
        feed system which enables the cells to maintain the anodic level
        necessary for safe operation even at high amperage loads or high
        current densities in the range of 50 to 50,000 amperes; 2) the
        direct current supply used is in the range of 50 to 5,000
        amperes, which amperage is capable of generating sufficient
        hydrogen gas fuel which can supply (at steady state), a majority
        up to at least about 80% of the total liquid volume fuel needs
        of automotive and other engines. </p>
      <p>One object and advantage of this invention is that the
        emissions resulting from the combustion of hydrogen are
        relatively non-pollutant, thereby greatly reducing CO and
        unburned hydrocarbons by as much as 65%. Still another advantage
        of internally generated hydrogen as a primary source of fuel and
        recycling the generated oxygen is the reduction of undesirable
        nitrogen pollutants due to the decreased consumption of air as
        an oxygen source. </p>
      <p>A feed pump continuously supplies water into the electrolytic
        cell, passing through a feed tank and a constant level and flow
        control device to maintain anodic level inside anodic chamber
        while excess water flows back to the sump tank by way of outlets
        at the bottom of the cathodic chambers. </p>
      <p>The electrolytic cell is designed as a compact unit, comprising
        a rectangular body or frame made of material such as bakelite, a
        graphite carbon anode perforated and grooved for fast and easy
        circulation of anolyte water inside the anodic compartment; a
        perforated steel cathode with back up compartment to hold the
        hydrogen gas and cathodic liquid; a set of asbestos diaphragms
        to separate the anodic from the cathodic compartments placed at
        both sides of the frame fitted with gaskets at both sides to
        form a tightly sealed inner and outer compartment which are
        bolted together with the cathodic plates in place. </p>
      <p>The graphite carbon anode is fitted loosely into the frame so
        that water can continuously enter the anodic compartment of the
        cell; the mild steel comprising the cathodic chambers has holes
        at the bottom for excess water to pass through the sump tank,
        while holes at the top of the cathodic chambers serve as exit
        for the hydrogen gas to pass through continuously into the flash
        back preventer, thence to the hydrogen gas collector tank and
        finally into the carburetor through the carburetor adapter of
        the carburetor type of engine and gas turbine engines by way of
        the two-way fuel selection valve and Y-connection element of the
        routing device. Similarly, the generated oxygen can be recycled
        to reduce the quantity of air needed for combustion (at steady
        state). By "steady state" is meant the operation of the engine
        combustion after start-up and sufficient operation to achieve
        generation of sufficient hydrogen to replace at least about 81%
        of the volume of gasoline normally used at that point in the
        operation of the engine. Although there is a consumption of
        energy in converting gasoline to electricity, and water to
        hydrogen, the advantages of the invention overcome this loss by
        an overall more efficient combustion. </p>
      <p>The water fuel converter includes an electrical power source or
        supply such as a direct current generator of 50-5,000 amperes
        direct current output rating run by the automotive engine
        connected by means of a rotational energy connecting element. </p>
      <p>This invention operates initially during start-up on a dual
        feed system whereby the carburetor adapter is fitted
        side-by-side with the carburetor of a gasoline engine to convert
        the engine from gasoline (liquid) feed to hydrogen gas (gas)
        feed by means of a two-way fuel selection valve and Y-connection
        element. In such manner, the gasoline fuel can be decreased or
        even shut off simultaneously and hydrogen gas introduced without
        stopping the engine. For diesel, gas turbine and other fuel
        injection type of engines, no carburetor adapter is required
        because the hydrogen gas is simply introduced into the fuel
        lines of these engines by means of the two-way fuel selection
        valve and Y-connection element with appropriate means to present
        the hydrogen gas (and, if desired, the oxygen) into their
        respective combustion chambers. </p>
      <p>At the initial start-up, the engine is run first with the
        gasoline fuel available, but as soon as sufficient amount of
        hydrogen gas is stored in the hydrogen gas collector tank, the
        gasoline fuel gradually is closed to a point where only 19% of
        the gasoline fuel is left in admixture with 81% of the gasoline
        fuel originally used before introduction of hydrogen gas, while
        simultaneously opening the hydrogen gas fuel into the combustion
        chamber of the engine. For an LPG gas fuel operated engine in
        use, the automatic switching mechanism with the two-way fuel
        selection valve and Y-connection element is simply used to
        change from the throttle and adjust the LPG gas valve which is
        mixed with the hydrogen gas fuel generated from the cells at any
        point along the fuel line. </p>
      <p>For subsequent start ups, the hydrogen gas stored in the
        hydrogen gas collector tank could be able to run the engine
        easily with the minimal supplement of gasoline (i.e. 19%) diesel
        fuel, or LPG gas. In the automobile, the water sump tank is
        simply installed beside the gasoline tank, while the
        electrolytic cell is installed as a compact unit in the back
        compartment of the car. </p>
      <p>In operation, water is first treated with an alkali to obtain a
        pH range of 7.1-14. The water, thus activated, is fed
        continuously into the electrolytic cell from a feed tank through
        a constant level flow control device, the feed tank being
        supplied continuously with activated water from the sump tank by
        means of a 6-12 volts D.C. electric pump. High density direct
        current in the order of 50-5,000 amperes is then supplied to the
        electrolytic cell through the respective anode and cathode
        connections with current density adjusted by means of a variable
        power supply control device to provide the amperage loads
        required for a particular automotive engine model and
        horsepower. The hydrogen gas generated from the cell is utilized
        simultaneously by the automotive engine passing through the exit
        tube, flash back preventer, then to the hydrogen gas collector
        tank, two-way fuel selection valve, Y-connection element,
        carburetor adapter, and finally to the carburetor of the
        automotive engine; e.g., with minimal supplement of gasoline,
        diesel, or LPG gas. The oxygen, liberated and separated at the
        anodic compartment, is pumped by a D.C. electric pump to the
        carburetor of the engine or, less desirably, simply vented into
        the atmosphere. Check valves before and after the pump provide
        safety measures to prevent back flushing. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b> </p>
      <p>Reference FIG. 2, (1) is the Electrolytic cell which generates
        hydrogen from water as water is fed continuously from a feed
        tank (2) maintained at constant head by a feed pump (3) while
        excess water flows back to the sump tank (4). Water is fed
        continuously to the Electrolytic cell (1) through a constant
        level flow control device (5) by way of the inlet hole (6).
        Excess water flows back to the sump tank (4) through discharge
        holes (5) of the cathodic liquid level control device (7). </p>
      <p>The Electrolytic cell is energized by a direct current (d.c.)
        generator (41) of 50-5,000 amperes d.c. current output, run by
        the automotive engine (20) by means of a rotational energy
        connecting element (42). The positive terminal of the d.c.
        generator (41) is connected to the bus bar (28) of the graphite
        carbon anode (32) while the negative terminal is connected to
        the negative (27) of the cathodic plate. </p>
      <p>As current is supplied to the electrolytic cell (1), water
        inside the cell is immediately decomposed into hydrogen and
        oxygen, the hydrogen gas passing through the hydrogen outlet
        (26) while the separated oxygen from the anodic chamber is
        discharged through the oxygen exit tube (11). The hydrogen gas
        from the hydrogen outlet (26) flows continuously through conduit
        (8) leading to the flash back preventer (10) containing water
        (9) maintained at a predetermined level, then through check
        valves (12) and (12) and finally into the hydrogen gas collector
        tank (14). Pressure inside the anodic chamber of the
        electrolytic cell (1) and pressure at the hydrogen gas collector
        tank (14) are maintained at a certain point by means of the 6-12
        volts d.c. electric pump (13). Hydrogen from the hydrogen gas
        collector tank (14) is introduced into the engine by means of
        the pump (15), the hydrogen gas passing through the two-way fuel
        selection valve (16) connected with Y-connecting element (17)
        and thence through the carburetor adapter (18) to the carburetor
        (19) and finally to the combustion chamber of the automotive
        engine (20) inlet (21) for gasoline fuel and inlet (43) for LPG
        gas fuel are provided in the fuel selection valve (16) to enable
        presenting to hydrogen gas simultaneously while maintaining the
        desired or requisite proportions; e.g., about 19% of the volume
        of gasoline feed with the remainder of fuel being hydrogen gas,
        the energy equivalent of LPG gas feed and the remainder
        hydrogen. </p>
      <p>The anode (32), FIGS. 3 and 4, is made of graphite carbon,
        perforated (36) and grooved (37) to allow free circulation of
        activated water from the bottom to the top of the anodic chamber
        by natural convection currents resulting in a rapid dissipation
        of heat in the system. The location of the inlet feed (6) also
        facilitates the rise of heated water thereby providing a fresh
        supply of water in the system which is readily decomposed by the
        flow of the high density direct current through it. </p>
      <p>The frame of the electrolytic cell (1), (FIG. 4), is provided
        with bolt holes (35) around the periphery of the frame to allow
        stud bolts at both sides of the frame, firmly anchoring the
        asbestos diaphragms (46), (FIG. 8). The graphite carbon anode
        (32), (FIG. 4) is supported by porcelain supports (38) to avoid
        grounding or short-circuiting of the cell and is connected to
        the outside positive terminal circuit of the d.c. generator (41)
        by means of copper rods (22) threaded at both ends, one end of
        which is screwed tightly to the graphite carbon anode (32)
        spaced at convenient intervals along the axis while the external
        ends of the copper rods (32) are attached to the copper bus bar
        (28) which is electrically connected to the d.c. generator (41)
        which is driven by the automotive engine (20) by means of the
        rotational energy connecting element (42). </p>
      <p>The cathodic steel plate (40), (FIG. 6) is shown with
        perforations (39) in the cut-away view. A clamp (48) is fitted
        snugly around the rectangular body of the cathodic chamber, with
        bolt holes (49) for the bolts to pass and hold firmly the
        gaskets (29), asbestos diaphragms (46) and cathodic plates (47),
        (FIG. 8). </p>
      <p>The negative terminal (27) of the cathode (FIG. 1) is connected
        electrically to the negative terminal of the d.c. generator
        (41). Means to adjust and regulate the power load to the
        electrolytic cell with a variable power supply control device
        (50). (FIG. 2) are connected between the electrolytic cell (1)
        and the d.c. generator (41) enabling the cell to operate at
        varying amperage loads adaptable to each particular engine model
        and horsepower rating in order to generate the requisite amount
        of hydrogen gas which is added to (as by mixing) with the
        gasoline, diesel fuel, or LPG gas required to operate such
        engine. </p>
      <p>The oxygen gas coming from the exit tube (11) is pumped by
        means of a pump (51) provided with check valves (52) and (53) to
        maintain pressure inside anodic chamber which is presented to
        the carburetor (18) or simply vented into the atmosphere by
        means of the two-way valve (54). </p>
      <p>Although the description above contains many specificities,
        these should not be construed as limiting the scope of the
        invention but as merely providing illustrations of some of the
        presently preferred embodiments of this invention. For example,
        the d.c. generator may vary over the range of 50-5,000 amperes.
        The anode could be fabricated from nickel or appropriate
        metallic element, and the diaphragms could be any other
        acid-alkali resistant filtering material. The hydrogen gas an be
        routed by an electric blower, and fuel injection nozzles could
        replace the carburetor. The cathodic steel plate could be
        fabricated from stainless steel or other appropriate metallic
        element. </p>
      <p><b>EXAMPLE</b> </p>
      <p>A Wisconsin engine was started with gasoline fuel to drive a
        direct current generator feeding electrical power to
        electrolytic cells. While the engine was running on pure
        gasoline fuel, the hydrogen generated from the cells was vented
        to the atmosphere and the rate of gasoline consumption was
        determined. Then the hydrogen was introduced into the engine by
        way of a T-connection, and through a valve, and gradually
        closing the gasoline fuel petcock valve to a point where the
        engine could continue running with the gasoline and hydrogen
        fuel mixture. Attempts were made to completely close or shut off
        the gasoline fuel and run the engine with 100% hydrogen fuel,
        but the engine stopped. The engine was made to run with the
        minimal mixture of gasoline combined with the total volume of
        hydrogen generated from the electrolytic cells, and the engine
        was made to run with this combined gasoline and hydrogen fuel
        mixture for a period of 12 minutes. The rate of flow of gasoline
        fuel used to supplement the hydrogen fuel to keep the engine
        running normally was also measured. </p>
      <p>In the hydrogen run, 81 volume percent less gasoline was used
        at steady state. The "gasoline only" test was run under a "no
        load" condition while the "gas/H2 mixture" test was run under a
        "load" condition. This was because the "load" was the actual
        charging of the electrolytic cells, and a "gasoline only"
        condition required no charging of electrolytic cells. </p>
      <p>Analysis of the exhaust gases showed, in volume percent, with
        gasoline only 8.84% CO, 0.87% total hydrocarbons, and NOx of
        44.1 ppmv. The hydrogen and gasoline rune showed 3.20% CO, 0.36%
        total hydrocarbons, and 283.0 ppm NOx. The NOx can be greatly
        lowered in the present invention by recycling the generated
        oxygen to the engine. </p>
      <p>The scope of this invention should be determined by the
        appended claims and their legal equivalents, rather than by the
        examples given. </p>
