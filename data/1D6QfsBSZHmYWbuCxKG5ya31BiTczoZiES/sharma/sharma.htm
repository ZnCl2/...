      CHAMPAIGN, Ill. — Plastic shopping bags, an abundant source of
      litter on land and at sea, can be converted into diesel, natural
      gas and other useful petroleum products, researchers report.<br>
      <br>

        fuel. Photo by L. Brian Stauffer</i><br>
      <br>
      The conversion produces significantly more energy than it requires
      and results in transportation fuels – diesel, for example – that
      can be blended with existing ultra-low-sulfur diesels and
      biodiesels. Other products, such as natural gas, naphtha (a
      solvent), gasoline, waxes and lubricating oils such as engine oil
      and hydraulic oil also can be obtained from shopping bags.<br>
      <br>
      A report of the new study appears in the journal Fuel Processing
      Technology.<br>
      <br>
      There are other advantages to the approach, which involves heating
      the bags in an oxygen-free chamber, a process called pyrolysis,
      said Brajendra Kumar Sharma, a senior research scientist at the
      Illinois Sustainable Technology Center who led the research. The
      ISTC is a division of the Prairie Research Institute at the
      University of Illinois.<br>
      <br>
      “You can get only 50 to 55 percent fuel from the distillation of
      petroleum crude oil,” Sharma said. “But since this plastic is made
      from petroleum in the first place, we can recover almost 80
      percent fuel from it through distillation.”<br>
      <br>
      Americans throw away about 100 billion plastic shopping bags each
      year, according to the Worldwatch Institute. The U.S.
      Environmental Protection Agency reports that only about 13 percent
      are recycled. The rest of the bags end up in landfills or escape
      to the wild, blowing across the landscape and entering waterways.<br>
      <br>
      Plastic bags make up a sizeable portion of the plastic debris in
      giant ocean garbage patches that are killing wildlife and
      littering beaches. Plastic bags “have been detected as far north
      and south as the poles,” the researchers wrote.<br>
      <br>
      “Over a period of time, this material starts breaking into tiny
      pieces, and is ingested along with plankton by aquatic animals,”
      Sharma said. Fish, birds, ocean mammals and other creatures have
      been found with a lot of plastic particles in their guts.<br>
      <br>
      Whole shopping bags also threaten wildlife, Sharma said.<br>
      <br>
      “Turtles, for example, think that the plastic grocery bags are
      jellyfish and they try to eat them,” he said. Other creatures
      become entangled in the bags.<br>
      <br>
      Previous studies have used pyrolysis to convert plastic bags into
      crude oil. Sharma’s team took the research further, however, by
      fractionating the crude oil into different petroleum products and
      testing the diesel fractions to see if they complied with national
      standards for ultra-low-sulfur diesel and biodiesel fuels.<br>
      <br>
      “A mixture of two distillate fractions, providing an equivalent of
      U.S. diesel #2, met all of the specifications” required of other
      diesel fuels in use today – after addition of an antioxidant,
      Sharma said.<br>
      <br>
      “This diesel mixture had an equivalent energy content, a higher
      cetane number (a measure of the combustion quality of diesel
      requiring compression ignition) and better lubricity than
      ultra-low-sulfur diesel,” he said.<br>
      <br>
      The researchers were able to blend up to 30 percent of their
      plastic-derived diesel into regular diesel, “and found no
      compatibility problems with biodiesel,” Sharma said.<br>
      <br>
      “It’s perfect,” he said. “We can just use it as a drop-in fuel in
      the ultra-low-sulfur diesel without the need for any changes.”<br>
      <br>
      The research team also included Bryan Moser, Karl Vermillion and
      Kenneth Doll, of the USDA National Center for Agricultural
      Utilization Research, in Peoria, Ill.; and Nandakishore
      Rajagopalan, of the ISTC at the U. of I.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Pyrolysis of HDPE waste grocery bags followed by distillation
      resulted in a liquid hydrocarbon mixture with average structure
      consisting of saturated aliphatic paraffinic hydrogens (96.8%),
      aliphatic olefinic hydrogens (2.6%) and aromatic hydrogens (0.6%)
      that corresponded to the boiling range of conventional petroleum
      diesel fuel (#1 diesel 190–290 °C and #2 diesel 290–340 °C).
      Characterization of the liquid hydrocarbon mixture was
      accomplished with gas chromatography–mass spectroscopy, infrared
      and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, size exclusion
      chromatography, and simulated distillation. No oxygenated species
      such as carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ethers, ketones, or alcohols
      were detected. Comparison of the fuel properties to the
      petrodiesel fuel standards ASTM D975 and EN 590 revealed that the
      synthetic product was within all specifications after addition of
      antioxidants with the exception of density (802 kg/m3). Notably,
      the derived cetane number (73.4) and lubricity (198 µm, 60 °C,
      ASTM D6890) represented significant enhancements over those of
      conventional petroleum diesel fuel. Other fuel properties included
      a kinematic viscosity (40 °C) of 2.96 mm2/s, cloud point of 4.7
      °C, flash point of 81.5 °C, and energy content of 46.16 MJ/kg. In
      summary, liquid hydrocarbons with appropriate boiling range
      produced from pyrolysis of waste plastic appear suitable as blend
      components for conventional petroleum diesel fuel.<br>

      <b>1. Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Plastic retail bags are ubiquitous in modern society because they
      represent a convenient means to transport purchased goods from the
      supermarket to the home. Plastic bags are plentiful, inexpensive
      to produce, sturdy yet low weight, and easy to store and
      transport. However, the same properties that make them
      commercially successful also contribute to their proliferation in
      the environment. Although they are recyclable, the U.S. EPA noted
      that only 13% of the approximately one trillion produced in 2009
      were recycled in the U.S. [1]. The remainder were disposed of in
      landfills, released into the environment as litter, or used in
      secondary applications by end-users eventually ending in
      landfills. Plastic bags may take centuries to naturally decompose
      due to their stable chemical composition [2]. In addition to being
      a source of litter in urbanized areas, plastic bags exacerbate
      localized flooding by clogging municipal drainage systems and
      constitute a significant portion of floating anthropogenic marine
      debris [3], [4] and [5]. In fact, plastic bags contribute to the
      so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch of floating refuse in the
      Pacific Ocean and have been detected as far north and south as the
      poles [3], [4] and [5]. Once in the environment, plastic bags are
      lethal to animals that ingest or become entangled in them [6], [7]
      and [8]. Because of these and other factors, various regional and
      national governments have banned or are contemplating bans or fees
      on plastic bags [9].<br>
      <br>
      Standard plastic bags consist of thin polyethylene (PE) sheets
      produced commercially from polymerization of ethylene. PE is
      divided into categories based on density and molecular branching
      frequency. The two types most important to production of plastic
      bags are low-density PE (LDPE) and high-density PE (HDPE). HDPE is
      a copolymer with up to 1% 1-butene and is made historically with
      either Cr or Ziegler catalysts at 1–16 MPa at temperatures as low
      as 60 °C. More recently, single site catalysts such as
      metallocenes have been employed [10]. LDPE is produced at high
      temperatures (200–300 °C) and supercritical ethylene pressures
      (130–260 MPa) using peroxide-free radical initiators [10]. HDPE is
      a linear copolymer with a density range of 0.945–0.965 g/cm3
      whereas LDPE is branched with densities ranging from 0.915 to
      0.925 g/cm3[10]. Due to these differences in structure, the
      crystalline melting point, softening point and tensile strength of
      LDPE are considerably lower than the corresponding values for HDPE
      [10]. However, LDPE shows higher elongation at break and higher
      impact strength than does the more rigid HDPE [10]. It is also
      translucent rather than opaque due its lower crystallinity (55%)
      relative to HDPE (85–95%) [10]. HDPE is more commonly utilized for
      production of plastic bags due to its greater tensile strength
      coupled with its less energy-intensive production process.
      Pyrolysis is defined as the irreversible anaerobic thermochemical
      decomposition of material at elevated temperature (300 + °C). The
      principal benefit of pyrolysis is conversion of low energy density
      substrates into higher density liquid (bio-oil) and solid
      (biochar) fractions. A low-density volatile (syngas) fraction is
      also produced. Pyrolysis has been utilized for millennia to
      produce charcoal and coal. More recently, pyrolysis is used to
      produce charcoal, activated carbon, coke, carbon fiber, and
      methanol, among others. The distribution of products (bio-oil,
      biochar and syngas) is dependent on the type of pyrolysis,
      reaction conditions and feedstock. Pyrolysis is classified into
      four categories: slow, fast, flash, and gasification. Of these,
      fast and flash pyrolysis maximizes bio-oil production, slow
      pyrolysis augments the yield of biochar and gasification maximizes
      syngas production. With regard to production of liquid
      transportation fuels, fast or flash pyrolysis is employed to
      produce bio-oil [11], [12], [13] and [14]. The properties and
      composition of bio-oil such as high moisture and heteroatom
      content, presence of oxygenates such as organic acids, and broad
      distillation curve prevent its direct use as a transportation
      fuel; thus upgrading such as hydroprocessing and distillation is
      necessary [14], [15] and [16].<br>
      <br>
      Fast or flash pyrolysis has been reported on biological materials
      such as wood [13], triglycerides [17], grasses [18], shrubs [19],
      corn cobs and stover [20], alfalfa [21], oilseed presscakes [22],
      and pig compost [23], among others. Examples of fast pyrolysis on
      non-biological feedstocks include scrap tires [24] and [25],
      sewage sludge [25], general municipal solid waste [26], waste
      electrical and electronic equipment [27], and various plastics
      [25], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35] and [36]. The
      plastics include polystyrene [30], [31] and [32], poly(vinyl
      chloride) [30] and [31], polypropylene [31], [32], [33] and [34],
      PE terephthalate [32], acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene [32], and
      PE [30], [31], [32], [35] and [36]. In some cases plastics were
      co-pyrolyzed with other materials such as waste motor oil [32].
      With regard to fast pyrolysis of PE, pyrolysis of LDPE [30], HDPE
      [35] and [36] and various mixtures [31] and [32] was reported. In
      all PE studies, the properties of the resulting bio-oils were not
      reported, nor were the upgrading to fuel-grade hydrocarbons and
      subsequent fuel property determination.<br>
      <br>
      The objective of our study was the production, characterization
      and evaluation of alternative diesel fuel from pyrolysis of HDPE
      waste grocery bags. Comparison of our pyrolyzed polyethylene
      hydrocarbons (PPEH) with conventional petroleum-derived ultra-low
      sulfur (&lt; 15 ppm S) diesel (ULSD) fuel was a further objective,
      along with a comparison to petrodiesel standards such as ASTM D975
      and EN 590 (Table 1). Blends of PPEH with ULSD and biodiesel were
      prepared and the resultant fuel properties measured. It is
      anticipated that these results will further understanding of the
      applicability and limitations of HDPE as a feedstock for the
      production of alternative diesel fuel.<br>

      </b><b>2. Materials and methods</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>2.1. Materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Plastic HDPE grocery bags were collected from local retailers and
      represent the typical ones used in grocery stores. Summer grade
      ULSD was donated by a major petrochemical company. With the
      exception of conductivity and corrosion inhibitor additives, ULSD
      contained no performance-enhancing additives. Soybean oil methyl
      esters (SME) were donated by a BQ-9000 certified commercial
      producer. All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
      Corp (St. Louis, MO). All materials were used as received.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.2. Pyrolysis of HDPE to produce plastic crude oil</b><br>
      <br>
      Thermochemical conversion of plastic grocery bags (HDPE) to oils
      were conducted using a pyrolysis batch reactor in triplicate.
      Pyrolysis was performed in a Be-h desktop plastic to oil system
      (E-N-Ergy, LLC, Mercer Island, WA) containing a 2 L reactor and
      oil collection system using approximately 500 g of plastic grocery
      bags each time. The pyrolysis reactor has two heating zones (upper
      and lower); the upper and lower temperatures were set to 420 and
      440 °C, respectively. Once the reactor reached the set
      temperatures, a reaction time of 2 h was employed from that point
      on. Vapors produced as a result of pyrolysis were condensed over
      water as plastic crude oil (PCO). The upper oil layer was
      separated and weighed. The reactor lid was opened once the
      temperature was below 50 °C to remove the remaining residual solid
      material and weighed separately. The mass balance yields were
      calculated as the ratio of the corresponding product phase (liquid
      and solid) obtained in 12 batch experiments to the initial
      feedstock mass. Lastly, the gas-phase yields were calculated based
      on the resulting mass difference.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2.3. Distillation of plastic crude oil to yield diesel-range
        hydrocarbons</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Distillation of PCO was performed in a Be-h desktop plastic to oil
      system. A known amount of PCO (1 L) was added to the Be-h reactor
      vessel. The oil collection tank was cleaned by removing the water
      and dried before starting distillation. For collecting the
      gasoline equivalent fraction (&lt; 190 °C), the upper and lower
      temperatures were set to 175 and 190 °C, respectively. Once the
      liquid stopped dripping into the collection vessel, the gasoline
      equivalent fraction was removed, filtered, and weighed to provide
      yield. The upper zone temperature was then raised to 275 °C and
      lower zone to 290 °C to collect a #1 diesel equivalent fraction
      (190–290 °C). The # 2 diesel equivalent fraction (290–340 °C) was
      then collected by setting the upper zone temperature to 330 °C and
      lower zone to 340 °C. The material remaining in the reactor vessel
      was an atmospheric residue equivalent fraction (&gt; 340 °C),
      which was removed using a siphon pump once the reactor temperature
      was below 50 °C. All fractions except the atmospheric residue
      equivalent (&gt; 340 °C) were filtered through Whatman filter
      paper #4 to remove residual solid particles.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>3.1. Preparation and chemical composition of pyrolyzed
        plastics</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The pyrolysis temperature range of 420–440 °C was chosen based on
      previous studies [34]. These temperatures resulted in
      decomposition reactions of HDPE to provide hydrocarbons of
      different chain lengths. Pyrolysis of waste plastic grocery bags
      at temperatures of 420–440 °C provided 74% yield of liquid product
      referred to as PCO, as shown in Fig. 1. Although not determined in
      the present paper, literature data suggested gaseous product
      obtained from pyrolysis of PE consisted primarily of ethane and
      ethene (C2, 52%) and C4 (32%) compounds [34]. The higher solid
      residue yield (17%) is likely due to the inorganic content and/or
      char content and/or unconverted HDPE. As the pyrolysis of PE has
      higher activation energy (280–320 kJ/mol) compared to
      polypropylene (190–220 kJ/mol), therefore, increasing the
      pyrolysis temperature to certain extent could result in increased
      amounts of the liquid fraction [34]. Also, this residue may have
      been the fraction boiling above 420 °C (analogous to the higher
      boiling vacuum gas oil fraction, VGO from petroleum distillation).
      Further thermal cracking of this product could have been achieved
      by increasing pyrolysis temperature and/or time, which we
      speculate would have resulted in higher yields of the desired PCO
      fraction. This residue along with the VGO fraction from PCO have
      potential to be used as lubricant basestocks, which upon further
      refining such as dewaxing/wax isomerization may yield API Group
      II/III lubricant base oils.<br>
      <br>
      The PCO thus obtained after pyrolysis of waste plastic grocery
      bags was distilled into four fractions (&lt; 190; 190–290;
      290–340; and 340 + °C equivalent of motor gasoline (MG), diesel#1
      (PPEH-L), diesel #2 (PPEH-H) and VGO respectively. The product
      yields are represented in Fig. 2. Similar results were obtained
      from SimDist analysis of PCOs with maximum coefficient of
      variation ranging from 0 to 7% (Table 2). In the absence of a
      catalyst, the major product is PPEH-L (41%). The product
      distribution can be changed with the use of zeolite catalysts such
      as ZSM-5, which will increase conversion to more low boiling
      products, such as MG and PPEH-L [34].<br>

      Elemental analysis of waste plastic grocery bags and PCO fractions
      revealed less than 0.5% nitrogen content and less than 0.7% oxygen
      content (Table 3). As expected, waste plastic grocery bags have an
      empirical formula of CH2.1N0.005O0.007 quite similar to that of
      polyethylene (CH2). Higher carbon and hydrogen content and lower
      oxygen and nitrogen content resulted in a higher calculated HHV
      [37], [38] and [39] of 49–50 MJ/kg for most of the fractions,
      making these high energy liquid fuels (Table 3). The calculated
      values were slightly higher than the actual determinations (Table
      1)...<br>
      <br>
      The boiling point distribution of PCO fractions was obtained using
      high temperature GC–FID. Table 2 shows that the method developed
      for boiling point distribution was repeatable with a CV of less
      than 7% for distribution of various fractions in PCO and was
      similar to actual distillation data. All PCOs contained a large
      percentage of fraction 2 (PPEH-L) followed by PPEH-H and MG.
      Around 98% of the PCO was distilled under 400 °C, which is a good
      range for producing various fuels such as naphtha, gasoline,
      aviation fuel, diesel, and fuel oil. The boiling point
      distribution of PCO and its four fractions is shown in Fig. 3. As
      boiling point and MW distribution of PCO were similar to petroleum
      fractions and contained negligible heteroatom content, therefore,
      we speculate that these PCOs will be compatible with petroleum
      crude oil for refining in a conventional refinery. The
      compatibility is further depicted in 10–50% blends of PPEH in ULSD
      as shown in Fig. 4. As the PPEH content increased in ULSD, the
      boiling point distribution shifted towards the higher boiling
      range, although overall the mixture remained within the boiling
      range of diesel fuel...<br>
      <br>
      Depicted in Table 7 and Table 8 are fuel properties of PPEH-L
      (Table 7) and PPEH-H (Table 8) blended with ULSD. For each sample,
      blends of 10 (P10), 20 (P20), 30 (P30), 40 (P40) and 50 (P50)
      vol.% in ULSD were investigated. With regard to cold flow
      properties, as the percentage of PPEH-L increased in blends with
      ULSD, values for CP, CFPP and PP became progressively lower due to
      the superior low temperature performance of PPEH-L relative to
      ULSD. In the case of PPEH-H, the opposite trend was elucidated in
      which cold flow properties (CP and PP) deteriorated as the
      concentration of PPEH-H in ULSD increased. CFPP of PPEH-H was not
      measured due to insufficient sample. Similarly, oxidative
      stability decreased as the percentage of PPEH increased in blends
      with ULSD. Comparison to the IP specification in EN 590 revealed
      that only the P10–30 blends of PPEH-H were above the minimum
      specification of 20 h. Results obtained from measurement of OT
      corroborated those obtained for IP: deterioration of stability as
      the concentration of PPEH increased in ULSD as indicated by
      progressively lower OTs.<br>

      <br>
      ...It was found that diesel obtained from pyrolysis of plastic is
      as compatible with biodiesel as ULSD due to quite similar
      hydrocarbon structures and chain length distribution of molecules.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4. Conclusions</b><br>
      <br>
      Pyrolysis of HDPE waste plastic grocery bags followed by
      distillation resulted in a major liquid hydrocarbon product
      (PPEH-L) with average structure consisting primarily of saturated
      aliphatic paraffinic hydrogens (94.0%) and smaller amounts of
      aliphatic olefinic hydrogens (5.4%) and aromatic hydrogens (1.0%)
      that corresponded to the boiling range typical of conventional
      petroleum diesel fuel (190–290 °C). Negligible
      heteroatom-containing species were detected from elemental
      analysis. Also obtained was a heavier boiling fraction (290–340
      °C) equivalent of diesel#2 from distillation of the crude
      pyrolysis product, PPEH-H, which also consisted of paraffinic
      protons (96.8%), olefinic protons (2.6%) and aromatic protons
      (0.6%). Based on the results obtained after determination of fuel
      properties and comparison to petrodiesel standards, the following
      conclusions were made regarding the applicability of these
      materials as alternative liquid transportation fuels:<br>
      <br>
      1. PPEH-H is more appropriate as an alternative diesel fuel
      because it exhibited higher values for FP, IP, KV, DCN, HHV,
      density, and lubricity than PPEH-L.<br>
      2. PPEH-H, after addition of antioxidants, met all ASTM D975 and
      EN 590 fuel specifications with the exception of density in the
      case of EN 590.<br>
      3. PPEH-L did not meet EN 590 specifications for IP, KV, FP, and
      density due to its higher content of lower MW constituents.<br>
      4. A 1:1 mixture of PPEH-H and PPEH-L met all ASTM D975 and EN 590
      specifications with the exception of density and IP in case of EN
      590, therefore PPEH-L and PPEH-H distillates can be collected
      together to provide ~ 64% diesel equivalent fraction from
      pyrolysis of plastic grocery bags.<br>
      5. P10–P30 blends of PPEH-H with ULSD met all ASTM D975
      specifications whereas only the P20–P30 blends met all EN 590
      limits. P40 and P50 blends require antioxidants to meet the
      oxidative stability specification listed in EN 590.<br>
      6. P10 blend of PPEH-L with ULSD met all ASTM D975 specifications
      except lubricity, while none of the blends of PPEH-L with ULSD met
      EN 590 specifications primarily due to poor DCN, IP, FP, and KV.<br>
      7. Diesel obtained from pyrolysis of plastic is as compatible with
      biodiesel as ULSD due to similar hydrocarbon structures and chain
      length distribution of molecules.<br>
      8. Biodiesel blends with PPEH-H met the specifications for
      lubricity and KV, while PPEH-L blends satisfied the lubricity
      limits, but not KV limits. PPEH-L improved low temperature
      properties of SME biodiesel whereas PPEH-H had the opposite
      effect.<br>
      <br>
      Based on these findings, PPEH-H and a mixture of PPEH-H/PPEH-L are
      suitable blend components for ULSD in the P10–P50 blend range so
      long as antioxidants are employed...<br>
