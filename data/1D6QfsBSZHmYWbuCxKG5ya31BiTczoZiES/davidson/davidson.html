      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;DAVIDSON DAN, et al. <br>
      <br>
      The Acoustic Magnetic Field Power Generator uses an acoustic
      signal focused into a permanent magnet to stimulate the nuclear
      structure of the magnet to cause the magnetic field of the
      permanent magnet to move or oscillate. This effect can be used to
      tap power from the oscillating magnetic field by putting a coil of
      wire in the oscillating field. When an alternating current signal
      generator is connected simultaneously to an acoustic transducer
      and a stimulating coil; whereby, both the acoustic transducer and
      the stimulating coil are located within the magnetic field of the
      magnet, the acoustic signal enhances the stimulating effect to the
      permanent magnet transformer. The acoustic transducer can be any
      acoustic generation device such as a piezoelectric,
      magnetostictive, or other acoustic transducer. The combined effect
      of the acoustic signal and the stimulating coil increases the
      efficiency of permanent magnet induction transformers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a solid state electrical
      generator having no moving parts in its structure. More
      particularly, the invention makes use of a new method of
      stimulating the nuclear material of a permanent magnet so that the
      electronic structure of the atom will vibrate and thus cause the
      magnetic field of the permanent magnet to oscillate. It is a
      well-known fact that an oscillating magnetic field will induce
      electrical current in a coil and was originally discovered by
      Michael Faraday in the last century. What is new in this invention
      is the discovery of the ability of an acoustic field to stimulate
      the nuclear structure of a material to cause the electrons to
      wobble under the influence of the acoustic field. If the material
      is magnetic or temporarily magnetized by an external magnetic
      field then the magnetic field will vibrate under the stimulus of
      the acoustic field. If this effect is combined with a coil which
      is simultaneously stimulating the magnet then the efficiency of
      stimulating the permanent magnet's field is enhanced. If a pickup
      coil is placed in the oscillating magnetic field so as to create
      an induction transformer then the combination of the acoustic and
      magnetic stimulation will enhance the efficiency of the induction
      transformer.<br>
      <br>
      The most relevant prior art known to the inventor comprises U.S.
      Pat. No. 4,904,926 (1990) to Mario Pasichinsky, entitled Magnet
      Motion Electrical Generator; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,077,001 (1978) to
      Frank Richardson, entitled Electromagnetic Converter With
      Stationary Variable-Reluctance Members; and U.S. Pat. No.
      4,006,401 (1977) to de Rivas, entitled Electromagnetic Generator.<br>
      <br>
      The above references to Pasichinsky, Richardson, and de Rivas all
      use inductive methods to stimulate the motion of a permanent
      magnetic field. In the de Rivas invention, the Electromagnetic
      Generator, the flux of the permanent magnet is "alternate(d) by
      switching" using inductive coupling. In the Richardson disclosure
      an "energy conversion system" the flux of the permanent magnet is
      also "shifted" by inductive means. In the Pasichinsky disclosure,
      alternating magnetic coils induce flux changes in a closed
      magnetic circuit and output coils attached to the circuit are
      induced by the changing flux to produce a magnetic field. All of
      these devices are essentially variations of transformer design
      with permanent magnets as part of the transformer cores and all
      use magnetic induction. The transformer aspect of these references
      is the use of permanent magnets as the transformer core with coils
      wrapped around the magnetic core which are energized to produce
      oscillation or movement of the permanent magnet's field. The above
      references are herein called under a class name herein referred to
      as "permanent magnet transformers".<br>
      <br>
      Other prior art relevant to the invention are U.S. Pat. No.
      2,101,272 (1937) to H. J. Scott, entitled Combined
      Magnetostriction and Piezoelectric Selective Device; and U.S. Pat.
      No. 2,636,135 (1953) to R. L. Peek, Jr. entitled Stress Coupled
      Core and Crystal Transformer, and U.S. Pat. No. 2,834,943 (1958)
      to R. O. Grisdale, etal entitled Mechanically Coupled
      Electromechanical and Magnetomechanical Transducers, and U.S. Pat.
      No. 3,246,287 (1966) to H. F. Benson entitled Piezoelectric
      Transformer, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,261,339 (1966) to H. P. Quinn
      entitled Magnetostrictive Transformer, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,274,406
      (1966) to H. S. Sommers, Jr. entitled Acoustic Electromagnetic
      Device, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,309,628 (1967) to F. A. Olson entitled
      YIG Variable Acoustic Delay Line, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,457,463
      (1969) to L. Balamuth entitled Method and Apparatus for Generating
      Electric Currents of Small Magnitude, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,443,731
      (1984) to Butler et al. entitled Hybrid Piezoelectric and
      Magnetostrictive Acoustic Wave Transducer, and U.S. Pat. No.
      4,552,071 (1985) to R. B. Thompson entitled Method and Apparatus
      for Measuring Stress.<br>
      <br>
      The above cited reference to Peek takes advantage of the
      difference in operation of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive
      crystals to produce a response in one when stimulated by the
      other. The Peek patent does not use an acoustic wave to stimulate
      a permanent magnet as in the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The above cited reference to Sommers is a transducer which uses a
      conductive bar or tube, which supports relatively slow helicon
      waves, placed next to a piezoelectric or magnetostrictive crystal.
      The transducer is designed in such a way to either enhance the
      acoustic wave or the electric wave by interaction of the two
      materials. The Sommers patent does not use an acoustic wave to
      stimulate a permanent magnet as in the present invention to
      enhance to oscillation of the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The above cited reference to Balmuth uses mechanically resonant
      reeds, rods, or chambers that are coupled to transducers that are
      piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, or transistorized. The electrical
      output of the transducers stimulate an electrical circuit when the
      resonator receives acoustic energy and again does not use an
      acoustic wave to stimulate a permanent magnet as in the present
      invention to enhance to oscillation of the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The above cited reference to Olson uses an acoustically responsive
      material such as a piezoelectric or a magnetostrictive to act as a
      delay line for microwave signals and again does not use an
      acoustic wave to stimulate a permanent magnet as in the present
      invention to enhance to oscillation of the magnetic field.<br>
      <br>
      The above cited references to Benson, Quinn, Grisdale, Scott, and
      Butler are all concerned with acoustic transducers which convert
      acoustic pressure to an electrical signal or vice versa using only
      the piezoelectric and/or the magnetostrictive effect. The Benson
      patent is an underwater acoustic transformer which converts
      acoustic waves hitting a transducer into an electromagnetic field
      which excites a transformer. The Quinn patent uses a
      magnetostrictive effect to stimulate piezoelectric crystals to
      output a high voltage which is a reverse of the Benson patent. The
      Grisdale patent uses mechanically stacked piezoelectric or
      magnetostrictive crystals to produce a more efficient mechanical
      gyrator. The Scott patent uses and electrical oscillator to
      stimulate magnetostrictive rods which put pressure on
      piezoelectric crystals to output a high voltage from the
      piezoelectric crystals. The Butler patent uses a combined effect
      of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive crystals to produce an
      enhanced acoustic energy detector.<br>
      <br>
      The above cited reference to Thompson uses a permanent magnetic
      transducer to induce eddy currents in metal which is in the field
      of the transducer or uses moving eddy currents in a piece of metal
      to stimulate a magnetic field. The induction of the eddy currents
      is the result of an oscillating magnetic field generated in the
      transducer.<br>
      <br>
      None of the above cited references use an acoustic wave to
      stimulate the atoms of a permanent magnet and hence are not
      related to this invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      An object of this invention is to provide a power generator
      invention with no moving parts therein.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to use an acoustic field to
      stimulate the nuclear level of the magnetic material and provide a
      method of oscillating the magnetic field of permanent magnets.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of this invention is to provide a simple method of
      generating electrical energy by including a piezoelectric
      transducer which is used to vibrate the magnetic field of a
      permanent magnet. When the nucleus the atom is vibrated by the
      piezoelectric, it in turn, vibrates the electronic structure of
      all the atoms. Since the electronic structure is the basis of the
      magnetic field of the magnet then the entire magnetic field of the
      magnet is vibrated when the electronic structure is vibrated.
      Coils placed in the vibrating magnetic field will have voltage and
      current induced in them.<br>
      <br>
      It is well established fact that when the magnetic field of the
      permanent magnet is vibrated it is possible to generate an
      alternating current in a coil winding which is within the
      vibrating magnetic field influence. What is unique about this
      invention is to increase the efficiency of permanent magnet
      transformers by using acoustic stimulation from piezoelectrics to
      further stimulate the permanent magnet so as to add to the
      inductive effects of permanent magnet transformers. This invention
      does this by stimulating the permanent magnet cores of permanent
      magnet transformers with an acoustic field generated by a
      piezoelectric or other acoustically active generator which is
      vibrated at the same frequency as the electrical induction of the
      permanent magnet transformers.<br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      In FIG. 1 a frequency signal generator 6 is connected to a
      piezoelectric 1 via wires 4 and 5 connected to the electrode
      surfaces of the piezoelectric 2 and 3 respectively. The
      piezoelectric 1 is defined to be a high dielectric material such
      as barium titanate or lead zirconate titanate or any other
      acoustic transducer material suitable for sonic and ultrasonic
      generators. The piezoelectric 1 is placed in close proximity to
      the permanent magnet 7 such that the acoustic field of the
      piezoelectric 1 can radiate into the permanent magnet material. A
      permanent magnet transformer defined by a coil 8 is in the
      magnetic field of the permanent magnet 7. When the piezoelectric 1
      is stimulated by the frequency generator 6 then a voltage and
      current is generated at the output 9 and 10 of the above defined
      permanent magnet transformer.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment of this invention is shown in FIG. 2. and is
      similar to FIG. 1. with a similar frequency signal generator 6
      connected to a piezoelectric material 1 via wires 4 and 5
      connected to the electrode surfaces of the piezoelectric 2 and 3
      respectively. The piezoelectric 1 is as defined above, that is, a
      material suitable for sonic and ultrasonic generators. The
      piezoelectric 1 is placed in close proximity to the permanent
      magnet 11 such that the acoustic field of the piezoelectric 1 can
      radiate into the permanent magnet material. A permanent magnet
      transformer defined by a coil 12 in the magnetic field of the
      permanent magnet 11. When the piezoelectric 1 is stimulated by the
      frequency generator 6 then a voltage and current is generated at
      the output 13 and 14 of the above defined magnetic transformer.<br>
      <br>
      FIG. 3 is similar to FIG. 1 and FIG. 2 with a frequency signal
      generator 6 connected to a piezoelectric 1 via wires 4 and 5
      connected to the electrode surfaces of the piezoelectric 2 and 3
      respectively. The piezoelectric 1 is as defined in the
      descriptions above. The signal generator 6 is also connected to
      the input coil 20 of the permanent magnet transformer defined by
      the torroidal permanent magnet core 11, input coil 20 and output
      coil 19. The piezoelectric 1 is placed in close proximity to the
      permanent magnet 11 such that the acoustic field of the
      piezoelectric 1 can radiate into the permanent magnet material.
      The magnetic transformer defined by 11, 19, and 20 is in the
      magnetic field of the permanent magnet 11 and is connected to the
      frequency signal generator 6 wires 15 and 16. The frequency
      generator 6 by stimulates the piezoelectric 1 which stimulates the
      permanent magnet transformer via the acoustic field and at the
      same time the signal generator also stimulates the coil
      electromagnetically. A voltage and current is generated at the
      output coil 19 and power can be taken from the output wires 17 and
      18 of the magnetic transformer.<br>
      <br>
      A further embodiment of this invention, shown in FIG. 4, is a
      frequency signal generator 6 driving a pair of permanent magnet
      transformers defined by 26, 35, 27 and 25, 36, 28 respectively and
      also driving a piezoelectric transducer 1. The piezoelectric is as
      described above. The signal generator is connected via input wires
      23 and 24 to the input coil 26 of the permanent magnet transformer
      on the left and to the input coil 25 of the transformer on the
      right respectively. The other input wire 38 of the left permanent
      magnet transformer is connected to the remaining input wire 39 of
      the right magnetic transformer. The output of the signal generator
      in also connected to the piezoelectric 1 via connections 21 and 22
      to the connector surface of the piezoelectric 33 and 34
      respectively. The output of the permanent magnet transformer on
      the left is connected to a load 40 via wire 30 and the output of
      the permanent magnet transformer on the right is connected to the
      load via wire 29. The remaining output wires 31 and 32 of the left
      and right permanent magnet transformers are also connected to the
      load. The load 40 can be anything such as a motor or electrical
      lights or appliance.<br>

      This invention is not limited to the 4 different versions of the
      invention shown in FIGS. 1, 2, 3, and 4 as there are any number of
      cascading and electrical hookup techniques that can be
      accomplished to amplify power and to take advantage of the
      acoustic influence of the piezoelectric upon the magnetic
      material. Similarly, this invention is not limited to the
      torroidal core configuration as there can be many types of
      permanent magnet transformers with any number of magnetic core and
      coil configurations that can be enhanced with acoustic stimulation
      depending on power and output requirements according to the rules
      of electronics and those familiar with the state of the art in
      permanent magnet power transformers.<br>
