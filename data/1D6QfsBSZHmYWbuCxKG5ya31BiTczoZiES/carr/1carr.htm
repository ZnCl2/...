      <p>In the late 1950s, Otis Carr claimed to have discovered what he
        called the "Utron", a "molecular shell" that houses the atoms.
        The cohesion of molecular shells is brought about by inertial
        systems in the gravity field, manifesting in the two poles of
        natural magnetism and electromagnetism. He claimed that by
        "hatching" the atomic egg, particularly of paramagnetic and
        diamagnetic elements (especially bismuth), atomic energy could
        be released gently. The Carr affair is generally considered to
        be a fraud. This file is a collection of excerpts of technical
        factoids from articles, interviews, etc., on the subject,
        without consideration of Carr's botched attempts to make a
        business of it. The technology actually makes some sense (to me,
        anyhow, with qualifications and reservations). I was told by
        Ralph Ring (one of Carr's engineers) that he himself had flown
        in a short test flight of a small model of the craft. Carr's
        business methods (fraudulent stock offerings and amateurish
        publicity tainted with hubris and non-performance) doomed his
        efforts. His engineer Norman Colton was an alcoholic who
        stupidly threatened a local newspaper publisher, thus generating
        more negative feedback. It was a sad pass from Carr's earlier
        statement that "We shall not stop until we have penetrated our
        great discoveries into all the ends of the earth, or even as far
        into outer space as man desires to go!" </p>
      <p>The historic details as published in various newspaper articles
        and particularly in <i>True, The Man's Magazine </i>("King of
        the Non-Flying Saucers", January 1961), are too long to be
        transcribed here for any useful purpose. This file is composed
        only of technical factoids gleaned from the collection of papers
        offered by Rex Research (albeit as poor-quality photocopies,
        caveat emptor), plus a couple of short articles cribbed from
        Keelynet/Fate magazine. </p>
      <p>According to Carr, "Any vehicle accelerated to an axis rotation
        relative to its attractive inertial mass, immediately becomes
        activated by free-space-energy and acts as an independent
        force... We have shown that a charged body, accelerated to an
        axis rotation relative to this attractive inertial mass,
        indicates polarity in a given direction. The dip-needle points,
        say, up toward the top of the body. But mount this while
        rotating body, with its spindle, on another platform and rotate
        this platform on a spindle, then if the counter-rotation is
        greater than the inertial forward rotation of the body, a
        dip-needle on the second platform will point down while the
        first dip-needle points up, indicating complete relativity of
        polarity. When the exact counter-rotation matches the forward
        rotation the body loses its polarity entirely and immediately
        becomes activated by free-energy (tensor stresses in space) and
        acts as an independent force... The above-described assembly of
        counter-rotating charged masses becomes weightless and will
        escape the immediate attraction of gravitational forces..." <br>

            Nebel (WOR Radio, NY) with Otis Carr, <i>et al.</i> (1959)
            ---</font></b> </p>
      <p>OTC (Otis T. Carr): "Our system utilizes gravity,
        electromagnetism, and electromotive force and a relative field
        to get its functional operation. We use an electrified sender.
        It's a sensor power core. Now this is what we call an
        accumulator... It is a storage cell, an accumulation of storage
        cells which provide an electromotive force in the same manner
        that any known battery produces and electromotive force... </p>
      <p>This [the Utron] is a dimensional product. It was designed with
        the dimensions of space itself. We say it is truly the geometric
        form of space, because it is completely round and completely
        square. It has been proven in scientific laboratories that the
        very smallest unit of mass matter ever photographed in the
        electron microscope are square in shape... We have applied this
        principle into an electrified system, which is the power core of
        our space vehicle. Now what makes this unique and novel from a
        battery is the fact that this is a piece of moving machinery
        that rotates. Our average storage battery is an inanimate object
        set in an inertial spot and then the electromotive force is
        conducted by wires from this battery to animate some object. </p>
      <p>LJ ["Long John" Nebel]: Let me interrupt for a moment; I'll try
        to describe it further. Well, it looks like two ice cream cones
        put together at the wide ends, but he angle is a lot wider [90
        degrees] than that of the ice cream cones. There are a series of
        ridges; they look like gears would fit in. Is that correct? </p>
      <p>OTC: No, those are in a sense turbine; they are reactive
        channels and where there is atmosphere a flow of air there aids
        in rotation. </p>
      <p>LJ: Well, then, this is one of the components of the drive;
        this is the battery. </p>
      <p>OTC: This is the center power core. </p>
      <p>LJ: This generates electricity? </p>
      <p>OTC: This is right. This is a storage cell for electrical
        energy. In operation it generates electricity at the same time
        it puts out electromotive force. This is the central power
        system for our spacecraft. </p>
      <p>LJ: I can tell this: that it opened up and it appears to be
        hollowed out on the inside... it's circular, the inside; when
        the two parts are put one on top of the other and they fit into
        place, the cavity inside is circular... </p>
      <p>OTC: It is a sphere, yes. And each unit is a hemisphere. We
        call the center of this large dimension the equator and of
        course it contracts and expands to a point on each side It's the
        union of two presto-conical sections; that is what it is Two
        right angle sections, and we say it is the dimensions of space
        and we have shown how this comes about... </p>
      <p>LJ: In the literature you've provided us with, there's a
        mathematical formula that crops up here that intrigues me: minus
        zero divided by plus zero equals zero. Can you tell me more
        about it and how you stumbled on this idea? </p>
      <p>OTC: The equation is brought about by the shape of our Utron
        electrical accumulator; this is the name given to our central
        power system. In our operation of working models and in checking
        out experiments, we had to find the formula that fir the reason
        for the action and reaction we were getting. So in exploring
        nature and studying the great inspirational work of the Dr.
        Einstein on relativity, we came upon this formula of linear
        correlation. And when we study linear correlation in geometric
        form we have to have a starting point and this is the point. And
        from there it explains through the cross and through the circle.
        And the only mathematical way we can express it is in the
        symbolism of zero X or 0X, and this formula brings us to that.
        We claim that this is the true unified field theory in physical
        practice. </p>
      <p>In a further study of Dr Einstein's great inspirational work
        --- and we corresponded with him and we had the great good
        fortune of being advised by him at one time --- we learned that
        all measurements of time and space had to be considered in
        relationship to the observer and therefore there never was a
        fixed quantity of any number. Now in physical form, this is
        something else again... </p>
      <p>On this craft, insofar as the individuals are concerned, we can
        travel in the same manner as a pressurized airliner. We don't
        have the problem of a heat shield... because the electromagnetic
        system sets up a protective shield in our craft which enables us
        to overcome this [thermal] barrier without any discomfort to the
        occupants of the craft. And we can very slowly rise, and once we
        are outside the atmosphere we can accelerate to tremendous
        velocities up to the speed of light itself. </p>
      <p>LJ: How would it land, sir? </p>
      <p>OTC: Very simply, we can fall at a very slow velocity of 100
        feet/minute or less and we can set it down as gently as a
        feather because we have joined part of the operation of our
        craft to universal systems. This is a relative velocity craft
        and the minute it reaches the relative velocity of the
        attractive inertial mass, it becomes weightless as regards this
        inertial attraction. Individually, it is not weightless; t has
        the same weight as before, but when it reaches the relative
        location it becomes an independent system just as a planet is an
        independent system. </p>
      <p>LJ: Is there any gravitational pull at this point, sir? </p>
      <p>OTC: None whatsoever. They will have the same feeling of
        pressure or weight that they have right now because we will
        maintain as far as possible the atmospheric pressure of the
        earth at sea level inside the craft. </p>
      <p>LJ: I am under the impression that the only reason I'm able to
        sit in this chair is because of gravitational pull. </p>
      <p>OTC: We have around 14 lb/square inch pressure within our
        atmosphere. We have been able to be sealed off away from such a
        condition and then artificially with atmospheric pressure the
        pressure in the cabin is maintained. We have it very well in
        submarines. The same may be used in our craft. </p>
      <p>LJ: In other words, under sea where a submarine may be there is
        no gravitational pull; is that what you're saying? </p>
      <p>OTC: There is gravitational pull at all times, but we are
        speaking about the atmosphere of the occupants inside a sealed
        unit. </p>
      <p>LJ: Is that necessary to keep the occupants in the position
        they desire? </p>
      <p>OTC: Absolutely, because in a vacuum they are at the mercy of
        any velocity. </p>
      <p>LJ: What would happen, sir, if there were some kind of
        instrument that you could turn on and eliminate the
        gravitational pull that was in this room? </p>
      <p>OTC: You would in a sense become very buoyant and this is not
        in itself a novelty but it certainly does not have any
        disastrous effect on humanity. </p>
      <p>LJ: Would I remain in this position? </p>
      <p>OTC: You could, but any movement would move you out of it. </p>
      <p>LJ: Would objects remain in position? </p>
      <p>OTC: Until they were brought into any movement. Any movement
        would make them buoyant themselves. </p>
      <p>LJ: I have a lead pencil; if I hold it in the air and release
        my fingers it would fall because of gravitational pull. If we
        had this other condition which you so aptly described a moment
        ago, if I released my fingers would the pencil remain in midair?
      </p>
      <p>OTC: This is true; it would stay there. </p>
      <p>LJ: I believe what you're saying is that you'd be creating an
        artificial gravitational field within the body of the spacecraft
        and yet there would not be any gravity on the outside? </p>
      <p>OTC: Exactly correct. </p>
      <p>LJ: And this is done by the battery which I attempted to
        describe, spinning around and producing its own gravitational
        influence? </p>
      <p>OTC: Yes, this is the beginning of an answer to your question:
        we have capacitor plates and electromagnets as a part of this
        system. Now, this is counter-rotating; the electromagnets rotate
        in one direction, and the batteries rotate in another. The
        capacitor plates rotate in conjunction with the battery so that
        we have a clockwise and counterclockwise rotation. Now the third
        system is the cabin that maintains the crew. This does not
        rotate; it is fixed due to the fact that the two bodies are
        rotating clockwise and counterclockwise. Therefore the system
        causes the craft to escape from the gravity pull. The craft
        itself due to this system still has internal gravity because it
        still has the same weight that it had in the beginning. </p>
      <p>LJ: What charges this battery? </p>
      <p>OTC: This starts out electrochemically the same as other
        batteries, but we do have a regenerating system that is very
        unique. We are able here, for the first time to our knowledge,
        to use atmospheric electricity as a recharging system. This is
        done as part of the operational principle of the craft. </p>
      <p>LJ: You say you use atmospheric electricity. What happens when
        you leave the atmosphere? </p>
      <p>OTC: We have electrochemical systems to provide us with all the
        energy that we need and have a regenerating system in the manner
        of a regenerative coil that recharges this battery in the same
        manner that the storage battery in the automobile is recharged
        now, by a generator. </p>
      <p>LJ: What you have doe is made the first perpetual motion
        machine. </p>
      <p>OTC: There is nothing perpetual about our machine. The energies
        which cause it to operate are perpetual. You cannot destroy
        matter, and you cannot destroy energy; molecular flow is
        perpetual and that has been proven in the laboratory. It has
        been proven that electricity itself is immortal. When we take
        away resistance we can set up a spark of electricity and it will
        continue to operate; therefore we have perpetual energy. No
        machine that we can conceive of made by man would be perpetual,
        but it is free energy. It's self-energizing and as long as all
        parts function and do not wear out this is truly a
        self-energizing machine. </p>
      <p>Ben: About this formula: were using conventional algebraic
        methods? </p>
      <p>OTC: No, we weren't. Partially conventional, but we were
        joining actual space forms. We arrived at satisfactory equations
        for ourselves which can be demonstrated. </p>
      <p>Ben: Are the physical laws upon which your invention works
        expressed in mathematical terms? </p>
      <p>OTC: Possibly, but I wouldn't say that I'm qualified. We're
        satisfied with this formula. </p>
      <p>Ben: Well, it's like saying plus 4 divided by minus 4 equals 4.
      </p>
      <p>OTC: Sometimes these solutions are not always what appear. As
        we know in synergy, we know 1 plus 1 equals 3. </p>
      <p>Ben: 1 plus 1 equals 3, when? </p>
      <p>OTC: Because two conditions always produce a third. </p>
      <p>Ben: the third condition is 2, isn't it? </p>
      <p>OTC: Not necessarily. </p>
      <p>Ben: Could you go over these conditions? </p>
      <p>OTC: If one condition operates one way and another operates
        another way, when you join them you have another condition and
        their sum is 3. </p>
      <p>Ben: Well, that is a little bit over my head. I've been looking
        at this prototype you have here and I notice a wooden frame or
        scaffolding you have a larger model of that you have on a
        turbine and around it is a wooden ring and it seems to be filled
        with electromagnets. </p>
      <p>OTC: That's right; this is a wood model of an operational
        model. What we have here is the cones, our Utron electric
        accumulator; that is the power system. This system activates the
        electromagnets and in turn activates. </p>
      <p>Ben: Does the system --- the thing inside --- activate the
        electromagnets on the outside? </p>
      <p>OTC: This is true. We do this by contacting this lead wire from
        the positive and negative poles of these batteries to the
        electromagnets and then we have circuit breakers from these
        electromagnets and we have counter-rotation. These
        electromagnets will rotate counter-clockwise while the internal
        area is rotating clockwise. </p>
      <p>Ben: Are these spools of wire on the model itself, are they
        magnetized also? </p>
      <p>OTC: The coils of wire inside the ring are regenerative coils;
        they are electromotive force coils and they assist in
        regenerating the battery, because they are loops of wire brought
        through a magnetic field which sets up an electromotive force.
        These others are capacitor plates and these are also activated
        by the central power core, but these plates, which can accept a
        very high charge in neutral conductance also through the process
        of ionization utilize atmospheric electricity. </p>
      <p>Ben: The fact that you have two cones meeting at their bases,
        so that you have something that is also square. I don't see how
        you get a square. </p>
      <p>OTC: Dimensionally it is; it is square in these dimensions and
        when this rotation starts and builds up to a certain velocity,
        this form is very important because we have the total equation
        of action and reaction. Now this is done by a system of coil
        winding wherein we start at a point, expand to an equator, and
        continue our winding down to a point. With this physical
        expansion and contraction, is an electromagnetic field. Gravity
        enters the picture in the form of this relative rotation. When
        the relative rotation ---- inertial effective mass ---, it's a
        matter of dimension. So that is the earth, say, is 8,000 miles
        in diameter, we know its fixed rotation is 1 in 24 [blurred
        text, possible additional digit]. If we were 1 mile in diameter
        its rotation would be 8000 in 24 [blurred text, possible
        additional digit]. And by the same system, our 45-foot craft has
        a rotation of 580 rpm and when it reaches this rotation it is
        totally independent of its inertial attractive mass, in an
        electromagnetic field. </p>
      <p>Ben: If your models get up to 580 rpm, will they take off? </p>
      <p>OTC: This model was spun at 40,000 rpm and when it did it set a
        pressure pattern of 1,000 tons; the horsepower reading was a
        little over 700. Six engineers checked this out. Now the
        relative rotation of this model would be about 68,000 rpm, and
        when it reaches this rotation, it would immediately take off. </p>
      <p>LJ: Would the time factor be involved with this craft? </p>
      <p>OTC: In our solar system, the time factor would be involved,
        yes. We evaluate time on the velocity of light and in certain
        systems, if we exceed the velocity of light, unquestionably time
        would slow up. </p>
      <p>Ben: Your craft can exceed the velocity of light? </p>
      <p>OTC: We don't say this; I say I other systems. </p>
      <p>Ben: I thought nothing could do this. I thought it was a
        constant factor, one of Einstein's factors. </p>
      <p>OTC: Possibly in our system, but not necessarily true in other
        systems. </p>
      <p>Ben: Anything approaching the sped of light becomes pure
        energy. </p>
      <p>OTC: Pure energy, but in other systems it could change. </p>
      <p>Ben: What other systems? </p>
      <p>OTC: Other solar systems. We are completely controlled by our
        system and the velocity of light is our yardstick and our
        pattern and our craft is designed around this. </p>
      <p>Ben: You don't just upset one of the basic principles of the
        universe. </p>
      <p>Mel Salomey: Doesn't Einstein say any measurement is relative?
      </p>
      <p>Ben: Except this one; it's the first axiom. </p>
      <p>Mel: What is an axiom? </p>
      <p>Ben: Self-evident truth. </p>
      <p>Mel. Thank you. Wasn't Einstein theorizing; wasn't he assuming?
      </p>
      <p>[Discussion of the speed of light, not included in transcript
        of the interview] </p>
      <p>Roy: What are these coils? To describe this the best I can,
        imagine if you will a circle about 18 inches in diameter. Two
        circles that form a sort of a -- In other words, one circle fits
        over another circle and from the top of the circle and coming
        down from the other an inverted round pyramid. There are a
        number of what appear to be copper wound coils around the edge
        of it. And then there's a sort of a framework on top and
        underneath there's sort of braces. That's the general idea. I
        noticed these cones placed mouth to mouth with some coils, the
        coils on the edge of this thing; it revolves within this
        structure. A tough thing to describe. </p>
      <p>Q: What is this over here, Mr Colton? </p>
      <p>Colton: This is a paper mockup to show the counter-rotation
        principle and its outside section that Roy is describing looking
        at the other mockup. It contains the electrified horseshoe
        magnets. This would rotate in one direction counter-clockwise
        while the center section with the electron accumulator [Utron]
        would rotate clockwise in the other direction. </p>
      <p>Q: Would these coils in the outer rim? </p>
      <p>Colton: Rotate counter-clockwise -- It has a rotation speed
        relatively equal the earth's rotation speed, at about 580 rpm. </p>
      <p>Q: When you say 580 rpm do you mean the outer rim is rotating
        on one direction 580 rpm and the inner rotating in the other
        direction at the same speed, giving a total rotation, one
        relative to the other, of 1160? </p>
      <p>Colton: Exactly, although I don't know if 1160 has any bearing
        on it or not. </p>
      <p>Q: Well, it would be twice the rotation in reference to the
        earth. </p>
      <p>Colton: We're not giving it for a certain rotation for the sake
        of rotation but for the sake of relativity to the attractive
        mass. The earth at 8,000 miles diameter rotating once in 24
        hours is relatively equal to a 45-foot craft rotating at 580
        rpm, and 580 rpm would calculate to be the approximate
        rotational speed of an automobile tire on a car moving at about
        25-30 mph. </p>
      <p>LJ: Could a small craft be made to take off? </p>
      <p>OTC: We plan to build a prototype model as a demonstration
        device. Now I would like to state that certain models have been
        built by me and tested. Each one has been airborne. One was lost
        entirely in space. We had a control system and this one didn't
        function. This has already been done. </p>
      <p>Q: As was calculated, the speed of the circumference was 1263
        mph. It gets kind of warm at that, doesn't it? </p>
      <p>OTC: No, it won't because it has its own protection field which
        is its electromagnetic actuation. We described it as a
        self-contained unit. This ionization of the capacitor plates
        sets up a glow brilliantly with a very soft luminescent light. </p>
      <p>LJ: What color? </p>
      <p>OTC: It would be in the nature of blue-green or very similar to
        the electric arc you see in welding. This is the field we are
        testing. It does not have a heat barrier in forward velocity at
        all. This electromagnetic field is being tested out now in
        conventional aircraft and proved very efficient. </p>
      <p>Q: Would you suppose you could put rockets toward the edges of
        the cone and have the thing spin by rocket propulsion? </p>
      <p>OTC: We don't need it. We have a tremendous spin here. An
        electric motor operates the same way. You set up an
        electromotive force inside a magnetic field and you get
        rotation. So what we actually have here is an improved
        electrical motor which in itself is a circular device, and we
        say we make energy out of the air, from another dimension. </p>
      <p>To clear your analogy up also, we would like to demonstrate the
        fact that this earth itself is literally a space craft
        demonstrating what we're talking about; it's rotating and
        orbiting at a certain constant speed with a magnetic field and
        it is in itself a spacecraft. </p>
      <p>Q: Mr Colton, we assume the moon has a gravitational field. How
        does it make a gravitational field and yet it does not rotate on
        its axis. </p>
      <p>Colton: It does not rotate on its axis? </p>
      <p>Q: No, the moon does not rotate on its axis. </p>
      <p>Ben: Sure it does, 1 rotation for 1 revolution. </p>
      <p>Q: How long does it take? </p>
      <p>Ben: 28 days. </p>
      <p>Q: And the earth takes one day. </p>
      <p>OTC: And that's how engineers and scientists have evaluated the
        velocity of the craft we call the earth by the orbit of it. Upon
        the pattern already set up, by the amount of time it takes the
        moon to rotate once around the earth from the center of the
        earth's core: 28 days. The distance being 245,000 miles. It is
        easy to calculate. </p>
      <p>Q: These cones seem to revolve over intricately wound copper
        coils. Do you supply any motor power to this? </p>
      <p>OTC: All energy comes from these two cones [Utron]. This in
        vernacular is a battery. The big novelty is that we have put a
        battery in motion. We have designed it within the accepted
        knowledge of total dimensions of space-matter and we have
        activated it electrochemically [electrolyte in the hollow
        center] and used the force through chemical activation to
        activate the entire craft, after which we have motion as the
        feature of this accumulator. </p>
      <p>Ben: Mr Osgood's telegram brought up a very important and
        perhaps crucial point, mainly, James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated
        that light is an electromagnetic radiation, also verified by
        hertz who laid the foundation for modern radio. Now the speed of
        electromagnetic radiation such as radio waves also travels
        186,000 miles per second. In other words, light and all forms of
        electromagnetic radiation travel at the speed of 186,000 miles
        per second. Now if it were possible for your craft to travel
        faster than the speed of light, it could, therefore, travel
        faster than the speed of electromagnetic radiation. So once it
        exceeded 186,00 miles per second, you wouldn't be gaining all
        this energy from this electromagnetic radiation you're
        generating and wouldn't you fall rapidly down? </p>
      <p>OTC: There is a continuous falling in space which in itself can
        bring velocity and can bring you to another system. We mentioned
        conjecturally that in other systems, there could be different
        velocities. We're not applying them to our craft. We don't
        identify them wit our craft. Relatively, we could not go faster
        than the speed of light unless we were in a system that
        permitted it. In our solar system, which we have mentioned now 3
        times, it is designed on known principles. We conjectured about
        other systems. If we go beyond the speed of light in other
        systems the conditions within that system would make it possible
        for us to have power. </p>
      <p>Roy: Let's assume, Mr Carr, this vehicle is at rest. What is it
        that originally overcomes the inertia of this rotor and starts
        the rotor moving? </p>
      <p>OTC: The electromagnetic force stored in the energy of the
        Utron electric-accumulator, which in vernacular is a battery. </p>
      <p>Roy: Now the Utron electric accumulator is these cones that are
        inverted to each other with bases together. I know of zinc
        batteries, nickel-cadmium, lead-acid cells. Could you use those?
      </p>
      <p>OTC: We could use any of the kinds you mentioned; what we have
        here is tremendous power size in comparison to other batteries;
        therefore, it's very easy to put 1000 2-volt cells inside this
        one unit as you see it. It has functioned very well. In our
        45-foot craft we plant to have 12,000-volt batteries which will
        extend an electromotive force which will energize the
        electromagnets and the capacitor plates. The generative coils
        will put back into the batteries in this system the same amount
        of volts going out until there is a breakdown of
        electro-chemicals or wear-out of equipment. But it could last as
        long as average storage batteries in automobiles. </p>
      <p>Roy: In order to start the motor off originally, is it
        necessary to cause a flow of electricity through one set of the
        coils? </p>
      <p>OTC: That's true. </p>
      <p>Roy: Is there any magnetic force in the other set of coils at
        this point? </p>
      <p>OTC: They individually operate by circuit breakers and the
        first motion begins to start a repetition. The same we have in a
        motor that has the opposite of a commutator, which is an
        accumulation of contact points where each coil is energized as
        the current flows through this coil. Then this starts the
        motion, the repetition of this motion brings the whole motor
        into phase in the same sense our accumulator and magnets become
        speeded up and the circuits are made and broken as they rotate.
      </p>
      <p>Roy: Where the inner rotor rotates in one direction and the
        outer in the other direction. and if the cabin is located on top
        of the rotating mechanism, what keeps it from rotating in one
        direction or the other? </p>
      <p>OTC: We have this cabin as the center of the craft and the
        battery below the cabin and the electromagnets are the total
        outside of the circular foil. The shaft of the accumulator goes
        through the cabin and there is a bearing. Now, just as this
        stays stationary when this is rotated, so will the cabin because
        there are two rotating forces. You have the clockwise rotation
        of the accumulator, the capacitor plates, the generative coils,
        you have a counter-rotation of the entire circular area of the
        craft, the larger diameter which houses the electromagnets;
        therefore, when you have rotation in both directions, the cabin
        itself is like a bearing and extension of the shaft. We've built
        models and proved this is correct. </p>
      <p>Roy: OTC XI was accomplished? </p>
      <p>OTC: Six crafts were airborne, one escaped; we used circuit
        breakers of various types and fuses burned through the switch
        and we lost one craft. </p>
      <p>Roy: What was the size? </p>
      <p>OTC: The largest and the one lost was 6 feet in diameter. </p>
      <p>Roy: You also talk of the Caroto Gravity Motor and you mention
        it requires no fixed location in which to function, and you also
        say a lot of other wonderful things about the possibility for
        this motor. Is it something else than the spacecraft? </p>
      <p>OTC: They are two separate packages. The spacecraft utilizes
        the electrical accumulator and the gravity motor uses the energy
        of the inertial attractive forces. We have learned how to take
        this energy and key it to a working shaft and get work power
        which we call free energy because it is. We don't make any part
        of it. Now in the rather vulgar vernacular sense this would have
        been classified as perpetual motion. It is nothing of the sort.
        It's free energy. Now we have learned that all masses that are
        smaller than the masses to which they are attracted exert
        energy. Even this ashtray; if it takes a pound of energy to lift
        it, then it is exerting a pound of energy. We have a true
        gravity motor. Its functional operation is to produce power
        continuously without any dissipation of the energy which causes
        it to operate, and we have built models of this and they operate
        and function and we are in the patent procedure with this. </p>
      <p>Mel: Back to a question a while ago regarding an analogy of the
        earth as a spacecraft. Taking another look at the mock up
        prototype power package there in front of you. It resembles the
        solar system itself, and as a matter of fact one of the
        statements in the brochure published in 1957, stated it
        illustrated the geometry of the universe. It seems that this
        device miniaturizes and essentially duplicates the motion of
        bodies in the solar system. It must have the ability to
        miniaturize their energy. So in a sense, the bodies in the solar
        system, in all time, have maintained their constant motion
        perpetually in those motions and this is why people characterize
        this power package as a perpetual motion machine. </p>
      <p>OTC: But we do not make any such claim. </p>
      <p>Colton: The Utron has many applications, has many forms, many
        variation. In one sense you might describe it as an energized
        armature or in other words a motor with a self-contained moving
        battery, also capable of continuously re-energizing itself. The
        offer in regards to spacecraft applies to government and
        industry alike. We will only make total disclosure demonstration
        after we have procured a firm order. In other words, we're not
        looking for anyone to evaluate our development. Mr Carr has come
        a long way in his research. He doesn't need any risk money from
        taxpayers or industries for further exploration and development.
        We will disclose to anyone who is a purchaser, but not to anyone
        who comes along for curiosity. </p>
      <p>Mel: What does the word "Utron" mean? </p>
      <p>Colton: "Utron" is a coined word, a word Mr Carr put together:
        the letter "U" and "tron", U meaning the direction or shape of
        motion as applied and used and equated in this accumulator or
        battery we described -- U is the plane, the geometrical figure
        that is the portrait of the wave, you might say. The letter U as
        described on paper, the two-dimensional, is a portrait on paper
        of the wave or the wave motion with the cut field, with the
        straight line, the pressure energy in the Utron accelerator. </p>
      <p>OTC: To me there's no such thing as a completed curve; you only
        go half way, just like you only go half way into the woods, then
        you're coming out. This is the same. A bisection of a total
        sphere is its exact curve and one half of it is primarily
        U-shaped. Because in magnets there are always two poles and one
        normal way to show them is in a U-shape, but if it's in a bar
        magnet, there are still two poles and the shape is still the
        same. We can only put a rope one half way around the tree and
        it's coming back the other way, and this is true in all wave
        motion. Now, if you extend this into velocity, this is the
        pattern in the sine wave and definitely the electromagnetic
        wave. </p>
      <p>Ben: I see... the vortexian of the wave </p>
      <p>OTC: All motion is relative to all other motion, so this
        serpentine, spiral state. </p>
      <p>Ben: So it's not the form of that motion, the graph and the
        equation. I'll accept the fact that it's the form of the utron
        motion though. </p>
      <p>OTC: Also the form as well in two dimensions is intensified in
        the geometry of our accumulator. </p>
      <p>Q: Why do you refer to this vehicle as a 4th dimensional
        vehicle? </p>
      <p>OTC: Because the geometry of the accumulator is such as the 4th
        dimension. To me the application of space and time, a vibratory
        field and electricity as we know it is a vibratory force in
        motion. This is symbolic of it and when it is activated it
        becomes such. Now this may be a little bit difficult to
        understand, but nevertheless the very smallest electronic
        particles of matter have been shown under the highest type of
        electron microscope to be one-dimensional squares. To me this is
        verification that this is truly a space dimension because it is
        the shape of matter. Without matter you couldn't have space. </p>
      <p>Q: I'm holding a thing that looks like two loudspeakers in a
        simplified form, placed mouth to mouth, two cones mouth to
        mouth, like two tops together so they have a point at each end
        and actually like a thickened flying saucer... Now what is it
        that comes from that: is it a high voltage? </p>
      <p>OTC: The voltage is whatever we wish to make it by design. </p>
      <p>Q: In other words, then, this is a battery? </p>
      <p>OTC: That's right. </p>
      <p>Q: The battery then goes through these magnets? </p>
      <p>OTC: The battery rotates in this magnetic field. The average
        armature today in any electrical system is usually the
        permeability, iron wound with copper, then through a magnetic
        field acts as a motor, or it becomes a generator, depending upon
        the lead. The great novelty here in the area in which an
        armature is normally used, we have a [power unit, and this a
        battery, and this is a moving power unit. </p>
      <p>Q: In other words, you might call this a self-contained power
        supply, right? How would this generator --- maybe I'm using the
        wrong word --- gather additional energy from outside? </p>
      <p>OTC: This is due to its circular motion. Electrical forces are
        motions where they manifest. Now we have cycles in alternating
        current; AC gives you 60 cycles per second; we have discovered
        in our experiments that there is a space cycle related to
        electricity, and if we join the cycle we get energy from it. </p>
      <p>Q: Mr Colton, will you try to describe to our listeners how
        they can draw at home a facsimile of an Utron? </p>
      <p>Colton: You can take a pencil and draw four lines to form an
        open square. When you have a square, draw a straight line from
        one point of the square to an opposite point and you'll have two
        right angle triangles. Now if you convert the line you've just
        drawn into a small lip you'll begin to see two inverted cones,
        the base of which form a circular equator. While you started
        with a square, you now have two cones. Obviously, the base of
        the cone is a circle or completely round as we describe it, and
        you have the device which is described as completely round and
        completely square, the Utron electric accumulator. The cavity in
        the center of these which is a hemisphere when the two cones are
        put together have a hollow sphere. This is the cavity which
        contains the electrolyte which would be used in some of the
        applications of the accumulator. </p>
      <p>Q: Of what value is the term "completely round and completely
        square" apart from its obvious redundancy. </p>
      <p>Colton: It is Carr's definition of the geometry or the basic
        space form or the basic form of all matter large or small
        relatively as we describe&nbsp; it. It is the definition of the
        terminal motions of universal energies in what we call space. </p>
      <p>Q: In one of your brochures you make mention of a "photon gun"
        and you say, "This is primarily a development that works outside
        of the earth's atmosphere. We are entering an age of space
        flight and the use of solar energy is practically unlimited"...
        What is a photon gun? </p>
      <p>OTC: I am using the word gun as a reaction principal instead of
        as a weapon, nevertheless it is a gun and in fact fires billions
        of rays of solar energy at right angles to the reception. By
        placing them through a certain chamber, we have been able to get
        a reaction and whenever there is a reaction, we can get power,
        we can get force from it. So we feel outside the earth's
        atmosphere new systems of propulsion even beyond our own of
        electromagnetism will make themselves apparent. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Otis T. Carr, President of OTC Enterprises in Baltimore and
        inventor of a manmade spacecraft, which he has offered to build
        and deliver to the government without one penny of risk to the
        American taxpayer, publicly revealed the propulsion principle of
        his spacecraft in the following statement: </p>
      <p>"Any vehicle accelerated to an axis rotation relative to its
        attractive inertial mass, immediately becomes activated by
        free-space-energy and acts as an independent force..." </p>
      <p>An excellent example of this principle applied in practice is
        the fact that the two satellites now orbiting the earth, have
        achieved space-energy activation by an equivalent inertial
        velocity, and were it not for their susceptibility to internal
        or inherent physical deterioration, they would theoretically and
        factually be kept orbiting by natural space forces until the end
        of time in our solar system. These statements in evaluation of
        natural physical phenomena as first discerned and made public by
        Mr Carr, have been physically tested in laboratory experiment by
        an impartial scientific laboratory and confirmed as follows: </p>
      <p>"We have shown that a charged body, accelerated to an axis
        rotation relative to this attractive inertial mass, indicates
        polarity in a given direction. The dip-needle points, say, up
        toward the top of the body. But mount this while rotating body,
        with its spindle, on another platform and rotate this platform
        on a spindle, then if the counter-rotation is greater than the
        inertial forward rotation of the body, a dip-needle on the
        second platform will point down while the first dip-needle
        points up, indicating complete relativity of polarity. When the
        exact counter-rotation matches the forward rotation the body
        loses its polarity entirely and immediately becomes activated by
        free-energy (tensor stresses in space) and acts as an
        independent force... The above-described assembly of
        counter-rotating charged masses becomes weightless and will
        escape the immediate attraction of gravitational forces. </p>
      <p>"Your discovery therefore is distinctly a possibility, and its
        creative genius lies in its inventor's ability to provide it
        with a process for generating its own power as a result of its
        self-rotation." </p>
      <p>Translated into familiar terms, this scientific explanation
        means that the above-described assembly of counter-rotating
        charged masses becomes weightless and will escape the
        immediately attractive gravitational forces... </p>
      <p>Our experiments and investigations have made known to us that
        the mighty power from the Sun can be utilized when the geometry
        of design is properly evaluated. We are aware of the resistance
        factors involved, due to the earth's atmosphere, and our
        developments have been predicated on overcoming these, which in
        some instances has been done. </p>
      <p>We have invented a Fourth Dimensional Vehicle. This Fourth
        Dimensional Vehicle is powered by the revolutionary Utron
        electric accumulator, which is completely round and completely
        square, and generates its own power, which is electromagnetism
        and electromotive force. It can be launched form the earth, and
        does not have to be blasted into space. The basic design was
        brought to the attention of the United States Government, and a
        patent application was filed in 1949. </p>
      <p>Some tests were independently made by qualified engineers at
        one of America's leading plants and it was estimated that a
        small model, only 4 inches in diameter, produced energy
        equivalent to 1,000 tons. This was in 1952, and Mr Carr was
        unable to interest anyone in his efforts at that time. Things
        have changed, and the Government has now put its blessing on
        space flight development. </p>
      <p>At the present time the rocket enthusiasts are commanding
        topmost attention. But there will be changes in thinking, and
        new directions of endeavor very soon. Our experiments with
        circular-foil design, as relates to gravity, electromagnetism,
        and electromotive force, have led us to the certain conclusion
        that it is possible to use the inverse-proportion laws of Newton
        as successfully as the third law of motion applies to
        accelerated rockets. We will produce the OTC-X1 circular-foil
        spacecraft as the first operational prototype as symbolized in
        this conception drawing. </p>
      <p><b>Claims Christ Disclosed True Nature of the Universe in
          Symbolism of the Cross ~</b> </p>
      <p>Visionary Mr Carr claims that Christ disclosed the true nature
        of the Universe in the Symbolism of the Cross. He pointed out
        that "Christ is truly expressed in the sign of the Cross -- the
        true Cross -- the absolute, the finite expression of the cosmos
        that we call the Universe". The inventor further stated: </p>
      <p>"A universe has only two basic properties: the motions and the
        directions. The correlation of these properties manifest in
        several forms, their two categories being called energy and
        matter. </p>
      <p>"These two forms are equal to each other, and are the product
        of each other, matter being energy under the pressure of motion
        and having relative finity because of the harmonious correlation
        of the direction of such pressure, and energy being matter
        released from pressure by any change in the direction of motion.
      </p>
      <p>"In any universal system, these motions and directions manifest
        their finite totality in what we call space, and describe their
        total form in what we call straight lines and curves, the
        geometry of which is expressed in a finite form whose dimensions
        are a constant correlation of the directions and motions. We
        have equated the shape of this universal space and translated it
        into physical form which we have called the Utron Electrical
        Accumulator, which expresses the linear correlation of space
        motions and directions in a form that is therefore completely
        round and completely square. </p>
      <p>"In its linear proportions the Utron Electrical Accumulator is
        the union of straight lines brought together in and from all
        directions, and in its correlation of and with curved lines it
        expands from a point to the circumference of its equator and
        contracts from that equator to a point, always being a
        correlation of complete curves. The aim of these linear
        correlative dimensions is three points, the exact center point
        of which is +0 and -0, the exact peripheral points of which are
        +X and -X. </p>
      <p>The space ship designer then mathematically points out his
        theory: </p>
      <p>-0 / +0 = 0 </p>
      <p>-X / +X = X </p>
      <p>0 + X = 0X </p>
      <p>Continued Mr Carr: </p>
      <p>"We were inspired to complete this work in the service of the
        Christ Jesus by Albert Einstein's search for a unified field.
        This relativity is a unified field, expressed in physical form
        is the square in the circle bisected by the Cross. The Utron
        Electrical Accumulator is the full expression of the dot that
        was the beginning of 0X, extended in all directions to form the
        cross, which in motion continues on to form the square and the
        circle. </p>
      <p>"In the beginning was the Word. The Word was 0X [actually:
        AeTZI], and in the revelation of Jesus, was given for all who
        wanted to see, in the symbolism of the true cross. </p>
      <p>"Set the cross in motion and you will see the halo that is
        Light and which we also call Energy. </p>
      <p>"If there is not time <br>
        And there is no space <br>
        There can be no other place. <br>
        And perhaps there is no far. <br>
        Perhaps the Universe <br>
        Is right where we are." </p>
      <p>Peace and plenty through the Application of Free Energy to
        Supply All Things to All People. </p>

      <p>This invention relates generally to implements in amusement
        devices, and more particularly to an improved amusement device
        of the type where the passengers will receive the impression of
        riding in an interplanetary spacecraft. </p>
      <p>The present invention contemplates a novel amusement device
        having the overall configuration of a spacecraft and being
        formed in various sections, with portions of the sections being
        rotated in opposite directions to give the impression of
        movement to the passengers. It is also contemplated to move the
        craft up and down and display an animated movie of heavenly
        bodies above the passengers to give the passengers an impression
        of leaving the earth and approaching a distant planet or the
        like. This invention further contemplates the provision of
        electromagnets, cones, and the like carried by the oppositely
        rotating sections of the device, and windows through which the
        passengers may view these simulated objects to give the
        impression that they are viewing the inner workings of an
        interplanetary spacecraft during flight of the craft. Finally,
        this invention contemplates the construction of the various
        portions of an amusement device simulating an interplanetary
        spacecraft in such a manner that the device may be easily
        transported in sections from one location to another and
        reassembled in a minimum of time. </p>
      <p>An important object of this invention is to provide an
        amusement device wherein a passenger in the device receives an
        impression of flying in an interplanetary spacecraft. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide an amusement
        device having a general configuration of an interplanetary
        spacecraft and having oppositely rotating sections simulating
        the movement of various portions of the device to impress the
        passengers with flight in a spacecraft. </p>
      <p>Another object of this invention is to provide an amusement
        device simulating an interplanetary spacecraft wherein the
        passengers will be physically moved a very minor distance and
        yet will receive the impression of flying in a spacecraft. </p>
      <p>A further object of this invention is to provide a portable
        amusement device simulating an interplanetary spacecraft which
        may be easily disassembled and transported from one location to
        another. </p>
      <p>A still further object of this invention is to provide an
        amusement device which is simple in construction, may be
        economically manufactured, and which will have a long service
        life. </p>
      <p>Other objects and advantages of the invention will be evident
        from the following detailed description, when read in
        conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate my
        invention. </p>

      </center>
      <p>Referring to the drawings in detail, and particularly Figures 1
        and 2, a preferred embodiment of the present invention
        comprises, generally speaking, a supporting structure and
        landing gear 10, an outer rotating shell 12, an inner rotating
        assembly 14 (shown only in Figure 2) and a passenger cabin 16
        extending downwardly into the upper end portion of the outer
        shell 12. The landing gear and supporting mechanism 20 comprises
        a vertically extending tubular member 18 around which the outer
        shell 12 and inner rotating assembly 14 are journaled as will be
        hereinafter set forth, and a plurality of legs 20 extending
        radially outward in circumferentially spaced relation from the
        lower end of the tubular member 18. The tubular member 18 is
        telescoped over a supporting stanchion 22 which may be in the
        form of a pipe, and the tubular member 18 is slidingly supported
        on the stanchion 22 by suitable wheels or rollers 24 to
        facilitate vertical movement of the member 18 on the stanchion
        22, as will be hereinafter set forth. The stanchion 22 is
        preferably supported in a suitable foundation 25 to provide
        adequate strength for the amusement device. </p>
      <p>A suitable jack 26, preferably a hydraulic jack, is anchored in
        the foundation 23 underneath the outer end portion of each of
        the landing gear legs 20 and is provided with an extension 28
        extending upwardly into connection with the respective leg 20.
        The jacks 26 are operated simultaneously to raise and lower the
        landing gear and supporting structure 10, as will be described.
        A suitable shaped housing 20 is preferably secured around each
        of the landing gear legs 20 to provide a streamlined appearance.
        It may be noted that each of the legs 20 is preferably
        constructed out of a structurally strong member, such as an
        I-beam, and is secured to the lower end potions of the tubular
        member 18 by suitable braces 32 and plates 34 to assure a rigid
        and adequate connection of the legs to the tubular member 18. </p>
      <p>A pair of rollers 36 (see also Figure 3) are rotatably
        supported adjacent the outer end portion of each leg 20 of the
        landing gear and are arranged to engage a circular track 38
        (Figures 2 and 4) for partially supporting the outer shell 12
        and the inner rotating assembly 14 as will be described. Also, a
        suitable drive motor 40 (Figure 3) is mounted on one of the legs
        20 of the landing gear and is connected through a suitable gear
        box 42 to one of the rollers 36 to rotate the outer shell 12
        with respect to the landing gear and the supporting structure
        10. The roller 36 connected to the drive motor 40 may be
        suitably chained (not shown) to its companion roller 36 to
        assure an adequate drive connection between the drive motor and
        the circular track 38. </p>
      <p>The shell (Figure 2) is tubular in configuration, with the
        diameter of the central portion thereof substantially larger
        than the diameter at the opposite ends thereof, and is supported
        in an upright position to give the general appearance of two
        saucers placed face-to-face. The outer edge portion 44 of the
        shell 12 is preferably formed of partially transparent material,
        such as Plexiglass, and is illuminated from within (not shown)
        to provide a band of light around the central portion of the
        shell 12. the remainder of the shell 12 is formed of any desired
        opaque and relatively strong material, such as
        aluminum-laminated masonite sheets. </p>
      <p>The shell 12 is supported on a frame generally designated by
        reference character 46 and illustrated in Figures 2 and 4. the
        frame 46 is circular in plan, as viewed in Figure 4, and is
        substantially U-shaped in cross-section (as shown in Figure 2)
        to provide an upper horizontally extending portion 48 and a
        lower horizontally extending portion 50 which extend from
        adjacent the support member 18 outwardly to the central portion
        of the shell 12. The frame 46 may be easily formed with
        industrial steel tubing 52 formed into a truss with bracing of
        steel rods 54. With this construction, the frame 46 may be
        easily fabricated in sections for convenient assembly, or the
        entire frame 46 may be lifted off of the supporting member 18
        and transported to another location. </p>
      <p>Support of the frame 46 and the outer shell 12 is provided by
        the track 38 (previously mentioned) which is secured on the
        lower face of the lower horizontally extending portion 50 of th3
        frame 46 in a position to engage the roller 36 carried by the
        landing gear legs 20. Additional support for the frame 46 is
        provided by rollers 56 (Figure 6) secured around the inner edge
        of the lower portion 50 of the frame, and rollers 58 secured
        around the inner periphery of both portions 48 and 50 of the
        frame. The rollers 56 are arranged in circumferentially spaced
        relation around the inner periphery of the frame 46 and engage a
        circular track 60 supported by the legs 20 of the landing gear.
        The track 60 may be an extension of the upper plate 34 shown in
        Figure 3. The rollers 58 engage tracks 62 extending
        circumferentially around the supporting member 18 to accommodate
        any radial forces imposed on the frame 46. It will be understood
        that any desired number of the rollers or wheels 36 operated by
        the motor 40 will engage the track 38 to rotate the shell 12 in
        one direction around the longitudinal axis of the supporting
        member 18. The rollers 56 will engage the track 60, and the
        rollers 58 will engage the tracks 62 during such rotation of the
        outer shell 12 and frame 46. </p>
      <p>The inner rotating assembly 14 is generally annular-shaped, as
        illustrated in Figure 5, for movement around the supporting
        member 18 between the upper and lower horizontally extending
        portions 48 and 50 of the frame 46. The assembly 14 is also
        preferably constructed as a frame out of square steel tubing 52
        formed into a truss with steel rods 54 for bracing, and is
        provided with a double conically-shaped framework 64 adjacent
        the supporting member 18. The framework 64 is provided to
        support a covering material 66 of any suitable type such as
        laminated metal or plastic, to simulate a solid member in the
        central portion of the amusement device, which in turn simulates
        a portion of a spacecraft, such as the power unit for the craft.
        The covering material 66 may be corrugated if desired. The
        framework 64, as illustrated in Figure 6, is also provided to
        support the rotating assembly 14 on the supporting member 18 and
        the frame 46. A plurality of rollers 68 are provided around the
        lower face of the framework 64, and a plurality of rollers 70
        are provided around the upper face of the framework 64 to engage
        circular tracks 72 and 74, respectively, which are mounted on
        the frame 46. The rollers in each set of rollers 68 and 70 are
        provided in circumferentially spaced relation around the inner
        periphery of the rotating assembly 14 to accommodate vertical
        thrusts imposed on the rotating assembly. Additional rollers 76
        and 78 are provided around the inner periphery of the framework
        64 to engage tracks 80 extending circumferentially around the
        supporting member 18 to accommodate radial thrusts imposed on
        the central rotating assembly 14. It will be apparent that any
        desired number of rollers 76 and 78 may be provided around the
        inner periphery of the framework 64 to adequately support the
        rotating assembly 14. </p>
      <p>I also prefer to support a plurality of conically-shaped member
        82 in the outer edge portion of the central rotating assembly
        14. Each conically-shaped member 82 may be easily formed out of
        a suitable sheet material, such as aluminum or plastic, and is
        supported at its opposite ends by suitable trunions 84 to extend
        through the truss comprising the frame of the central rotating
        assembly 14. The conically-shaped members 82 are preferably
        provided in circumferentially spaced relation around the
        assembly 14, as illustrated in Figure 5, and are positioned to
        move through simulated electromagnets 86 supported around the
        frame 46, as illustrated in Figures 2 and 4. Each simulated
        electromagnet 86 may be formed in horseshoe shape out of any
        suitable sheet material, and is provided with tubing or the like
        88 around a portion thereof to simulate the winding of an
        electromagnet. I further prefer to secure a plurality of plates
        90 in spaced relation 14 to simulate capacitor plates in a
        spacecraft. The plates 90 may be formed out of any suitable
        material such as aluminum-laminated masonite to provide a
        striking appearance. </p>
      <p>The inner rotating assembly 14 is driven by a friction or dead
        wheel 92 pivotally supported on the tubular member 18, as
        illustrated in Figure 6, engaging circular plate 94 and 96
        carried by the inner rotating assembly 14 and the frame 46,
        respectively. The plates 94 and 96 are arranged in vertically
        spaced relation with sufficient distance therebetween to
        frictionally engage opposite portions of the wheel 92. It will
        therefore be apparent that when the frame 46 is turned in one
        direction, the plate 96 will engage the periphery of the wheel
        92 to drive the wheel 92 and in turn drive the central rotating
        assembly in the opposite direction by frictional engagement of
        the wheel 92 with the plate 94. Therefore, the various
        conically-shaped members 82 will be moved successively through
        the simulated electromagnets 86 and give the appearance of the
        generation of electrical energy. </p>
      <p>The cabin 16 is supported on the upper end of the tubular
        supporting member 18 and is rigidly secured to the member 18 by
        bracing 100 to move with the supporting member 18 and to be
        prevented from rotating with the shell 12 or rotating assembly
        14. Additional support is provided by a plurality of rollers 101
        carried by the frame 46 engaging a complementary track on the
        bottom of the cabin. The cabin 6 is constructed out of a
        suitable framework 102 such as aluminum laminated with masonite,
        on the outer surface of the framework and any other suitable
        material 106, such as masonite, around the inner surface of the
        framework. It will be understood that substantially strong
        members 108 must be provided in the floor of the cabin 16 to
        adequately support passengers in the cabin. As illustrated in
        Figure 7, a plurality of transparent windows 110 are provided
        adjacent the outer and inner peripheries of the floor of the
        cabin 16, through which the passengers in the cabin may
        adequately view the inner rotating assembly 14 and the frame 46.
      </p>
      <p>Passengers may either stand or sit in the cabin 16 and may gain
        entrance and exit from the cabin through suitable doors 112 as
        illustrated in Figure 2. It will also be noted that the upper
        edge portion 114 of the outer shell 12 is extended upwardly to
        overlap the lower end portion of the cabin 16. A portion of the
        upper edge 114 of the shell 12 is removed, as at 116 in Figure
        1, such that passengers may enter the cabin 16 through the doors
        112.&nbsp; Simulated portholes 118 are provided around the upper
        edge portion of the cabin 16 to further simulate an
        interplanetary spacecraft. It will be noted, however, that the
        portholes 118 are preferably covered with an opaque material on
        the inside of the cabin 16 to prevent the passengers from seeing
        familiar objects outside the cabin 16. </p>
      <p>A dome 120 is preferably provided in the top central portion of
        the cabin 16 and the under surface thereof is covered with a
        suitable material 122, such as cloth or the like, which will
        display a movie scene. A projector 124 is suitably mounted in
        the central portion of the cabin 16 to project an animated movie
        onto the screen 122 during the operation of the amusement device
        to give passengers the impression of interplanetary flight. </p>
      <p>In summarizing the operation of the referred amusement device,
        the passengers are directed into the cabin 16 through the
        opening 116 in the upper edge portion of the shell 12 and
        through the doors 112. The doors 112 are then securely fastened
        in close depositions and the passengers are thereafter prevented
        from viewing any object outside the amusement device during the
        simulated flight. The drive motor 40 is then placed in operation
        to rotate the shell 12 and frame 46 in one direction, while the
        friction wheel 92 drives the inner rotating assembly 14 in an
        opposite direction. Passenger sin the cabin 16 will then view
        the movement of the inner assembly 124 and the frame 46 through
        the windows 110 to receive the impression of watching the inner
        workings of a spacecraft. Also, suitable lighting effects (not
        shown) are preferably provided in the sell 12 to illuminate the
        moving parts. Simultaneously with rotation of the shell 12 and
        the inner rotating assembly 14, the jacks 26 are actuated to
        raise the supporting member 18 on the stanchion 22. This upward
        movement of the supporting member 18 will be rather minor, but
        will be sufficient to give the sensation of rising to the
        passengers in the closed cabin 16. It will be observed that when
        the supporting member 18 is raised, the shell 12 and the inner
        rotating assembly 14 are simultaneously raised to retain the
        vertical relationship between the cabin and the remainder of the
        apparatus viewed by passengers in the cabin. Also,
        simultaneously with rotation of the shell 12 and rotating
        assembly 14, the movie is displayed by the projector 124 on
        screen 122 on the dome of the cabin to give the passengers the
        impression of approaching one or more heavenly bodies. The jacks
        26 are then operated in the opposite direction to lower the
        cabin 16 and the movie projected by the projector 124 may then
        provide an impression on the screen 122 that the passengers are
        returning to earth. </p>
      <p>From the foregoing it will be apparent that the present
        invention provides an amusement device which will give the
        impression and sensation to patrons or passengers of the device
        that they are taking an interplanetary flight. The device
        includes counter-rotating sections simulating the inner workings
        of a spacecraft and these moving sections may be easily viewed
        by passengers in the device. Also, the passengers are slightly
        raised during operation of the device to simulate flight from
        the earth and a movie is simultaneously displayed to give the
        impression of approaching a heavenly body. It will also be
        apparent that the construction of the amusement device is such
        that the device may be easily disassembled and moved from one
        location to another. It will further be apparent that the
        present amusement device is simple in construction, may be
        economically manufactured and will have a long service life. </p>
      <p>Changes may be made in the combination and arrangement of parts
        or elements as heretofore set forth in the specification and
        shown in the drawings, it being understood that changes may be
        made in the embodiment disclosed without departing from the

      <p>As your eyes take in the shapes and relationships in these
        illustrations of the miniature model you are about to build,
        your reasoning will let you understand much about the invisible
        forces that contribute to the noise-free, pressure-free, and
        vibrationless sensation of floating flight to be experienced in
        the passenger living rooms aboard the OTC-X1. It will be very
        much like reclining in an overstuffed armchair on our
        comfortable old planet Earth. </p>
      <p>It mechanical behavior being like that of a giant gyroscope,
        and electrically like a planet with its own atmosphere and force
        field, the OTC-X1 craft will know nothing of sound barriers,
        shockwaves, skin friction, turbulence, or G-strains. </p>
      <p>Neither will its occupants need fear any harm from cosmic
        forces, gamma rays, x-rays, or other radiation, because the
        OTC-X1 craft will either be using or absorbing all such forces,
        or by the pressure and polarity of its own force field, be
        shielded against their penetration. </p>
      <p>While the commutation system for the actual energized flight
        model craft is not shown together with the other components on
        this on this sheet, its design for the circuitry of
        electro-gravitational forces permits an environmental
        surroundment of equal and opposite pressures in and from all
        direction, whose circumference is nowhere and whose center is
        everywhere relative to the universal field. </p>
      <p>Thus, by imitating nature, we become one with nature --- by
        translating her shapes and duplicating her motions we join
        forces with natural energies and become magnetically independent
        of manmade limitations, man-constructed barriers, man-invented
        feats, and man-imposed controls! [&amp;c, &amp;c., yada yada

        </p>
        <p><img src="ralph_ring_sm.jpg" width="300" height="428"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Ralph Ring is a technician who worked with Otis T. Carr in the
        late 1950s and early 1960s. Ring stresses that resonance is the
        key to working with nature: "Resonance. You have to work with
        nature, not against her." According to Ring, when the model
        Utrons were powered up to operational speed, "...the metal
        turned to Jell-o. You could push your finger right into it. It
        ceased to be solid. It turned into another form of matter, which
        was as if it was not entirely here in this reality. That's the
        only way I can attempt to describe it. It was uncanny, one of
        the weirdest sensations I've ever felt." </p>
      <p>Ralph Ring describes Otis Carr thus: "He was an unquestioned
        genius. Tesla had recognized his quality immediately and had
        taught him everything he knew. He was inspired, and  like Tesla
         seemed to know exactly what to do to get something to work. He
        was a private man and was also very metaphysical in his
        thinking. I think the fact that he was not formally trained in
        physics helped him. He was not constrained by any preconceived
        ideas. As crazy as it sounds now, he was determined to fly to
        the moon and really believed it could be done. I believed it. We
        all did." </p>
      <p>Ring described his "flight" in the Utron craft, saying that
        "Fly is not the right word. It traversed distance. It seemed to
        take no time. I was with two other engineers when we piloted the
        45' craft about ten miles. I thought it hadn't moved --- I
        thought it had failed. I was completely astonished when we
        realized that we had returned with samples of rocks and plants
        from our destination. It was a dramatic success. It was more
        like a kind of teleportation. </p>
      <p>"What's more, time was distorted somehow. We felt we were in
        the craft about fifteen or twenty minutes. We were told
        afterwards that we'd been carefully timed as having been in the
        craft no longer than three or four minutes. I still have no
        complete idea how it worked. We just built it exactly according
        to Carr's instructions. Everything had to be perfect... it all
        had to be just so, or it he said it would not work: a kind of
        symbiotic state between man and machine. </p>
      <p>"The Utron was the key to it all. Carr said it accumulated
        energy because of its shape, and focused it, and also responded
        to our conscious intentions. When we operated the machine, we
        didn't work any controls. We went into a kind of meditative
        state and all three of us focused our intentions on the effect
        we wanted to achieve. It sounds ridiculous, I know. But that's
        what we did, and that's what worked. Carr had tapped into some
        principle which is not understood, in which consciousness melds
        with engineering to create an effect. You can't write that into
        equations. I have no idea how he knew it would work. But it did.
      </p>
      <p>"...There are two secrets to making the alien saucers work. One
        is their advanced engineering, and the other is their mental
        ability." </p>
      <p>"I've lost count of the number of people who have refused to
        believe what happened. I no longer talk about it. It's no fun
        being laughed at and ridiculed. But I've described it exactly as
        it occurred. One day someone will build the disk just as we did
        and they'll have the same experience. All his blueprints still
        exist. Nowadays, it would all be done with digital and solid
        state circuitry --- no moving parts would be necessary. </p>
      <p>"I've heard that the aliens use the same principle to operate
        their craft. Their physics seems to work in harness with their
        consciousness. The craft amplifies the power of their minds.
        Their craft won't operate without the pilots. I've heard that's
        why we can't operate their craft --- or, at any rate, we can't
        operate them the way they do. We're just not adept enough
        mentally and spiritually. So there are two secrets to making the
        saucers work. One is the advanced engineering, and the other is
        the mental and spiritual ability. We may have duplicated some of
        the first, but we may be a long way from the second yet." </p>

      <p>The following summary was sent from a Ship's Paper of October
        30,1957, after being copied from a CW News broadcast while at
        sea. It is unusual because no other report of this announcement
        reached us. It certainly is sensational --- if true. </p>
      <p>Baltimore, MD (October 29):--- A group of inventors claimed
        Monday they have been able to utilize gravity in circular&nbsp;
        motion machines capable of powering everything from hearing aids
        to space cruisers. </p>
      <p>Otis T. Carr, president of OTC Enterprises, Inc., detailed his
        claims in an interview and demonstration of a crude model of a
        circular motion machine which he said is the principle of a
        "free energy circular foil" spacecraft he can build, if someone
        puts up the money. </p>
      <p>He said the machine can be adapted to devices of any size to
        produce continuous power absolutely free of dissipation. </p>
      <p>Its immediate application, Carr said, would be in a spacecraft
        --- which would be able to fly among the planets in controlled
        flight. </p>
      <p>It could land or take off as desired on the earth, the moon or
        any planet in the earth's solar system, he said. </p>
      <p>Carr and his associates said their claims are based on the most
        simple practical applications of natural laws and discoveries in
        science and mathematics. They have no formal education in
        science or engineering. </p>
      <p>He said the same "free energy" which causes the earth to rotate
        on its axis and orbit around the sun will turn a machine he
        described as two cones joined at their circular bases. </p>
      <p>When the rotation of such a machine reaches a certain velocity
        relative to the earth's orbital velocity, Carr said, it will
        take off. </p>
      <p>Carr said the core of his space ship would be a huge battery
        which would spin at the velocity of the external craft and which
        would be recharged, he said, by its motion. Carr declared such a
        battery, built to any size, could be designed to power the
        largest electric generating plant, operate an&nbsp; automobile,
        heat a house or power any conceivable machine or device. </p>
      <p>The principle on which Carr said such circular motion machines
        would operate is that "any vehicle accelerated to an axis
        rotation relative to its attractive inertial mass (the earth)
        immediately becomes activated by free space energy and acts as
        an independent force." </p>

              Didn't Fly"</font></b> </p>

      </center>
      <p>The serious field of UFO's and flying saucer research received
        a setback at Oklahoma City in late April when a highly
        publicized launching attempt by O.T.C. Enterprises of Baltimore,
        Md., resulted in failure.&nbsp; Hundreds of persons had been
        invited to Oklahoma City by Otis T. Carr to watch him "launch a
        six-foot prototype model of the O.T.C. X-1, a space craft which
        works on 'utron' energy." Those who were there came away
        disappointed. The flying saucer did not fly.&nbsp; The six-foot
        model, well-hidden in a warehouse, never even got to the
        launching site, or to the amusement park called Frontier City,
        where it was to have been displayed beside a 45-foot version of
        the same X-1 which will be an amusement "ride" in the near
        future. </p>
      <p>The launching site was to have been a gravel pit eight miles
        north of Oklahoma City where Carr claimed the saucer would rise
        "400 to 600 feet."&nbsp; Launching time was set for 3:00 PM
        Sunday, April 19. Two and a half hours past this time Major
        Wayne Aho finally announced that the launching had to be
        postponed because of "technical difficulties." Later it was
        stated by O.T.C. officials that one bearing housing was "off
        one-sixteenth of an inch."&nbsp; Most of the major flying saucer
        clubs had ignored the "launching". Except for a story in early
        April there was no advance news on Carr's experiment in Oklahoma
        City newspapers. </p>
      <p>One Oklahoma City television reporter expressed the general
        feeling of the townspeople, "This thing will never leave the
        ground. And I feel that a great deal of the ballyhoo they're
        giving out is tied in with the ride at Frontier City. I have
        tried constantly to get in to see the saucer model, but they've
        kept it hidden."&nbsp; Equally well hidden was Carr himself. He
        was finally located in Mercy Hospital, Room 302, by John Nebel,
        the famed "Long John" of WOR, New York City.&nbsp; Carr did not
        show up at a meeting at a local church the day before the
        scheduled launching but a taped speech was delivered to the 70
        people who attended.&nbsp; "Barring any flat tires," Carr said,
        "I feel that history will be made Sunday afternoon when the
        model of the O.T.C. X-1 is launched here." </p>
      <p>Carr did not leave his hospital room until Monday, when he was
        taken to the home of Major Aho, the man in charge of publicity
        for the company. A scheduled "victory" dinner was pretty dismal
        Sunday night, where again a taped message from Carr was
        presented.&nbsp; Monday morning at 5 AM a rumor spread that the
        model launching would again be attempted. At that early hour a
        group of a half-dozen people, including Norman Colton, Carr's
        chief aide, went to the warehouse. But it was three hours later
        before anyone else showed up and most of those who had come to
        see the model had given up in disgust and left.&nbsp; Many
        believers in UFO's, although skeptical, had traveled to Oklahoma
        City to see what developed. All of them had left town by Monday
        afternoon. </p>
      <p>One member of a Pennsylvania saucer club commented, "I don't
        know what's going on but I feel they never had any intention of
        trying to launch the model. I could not see any plans in sight
        for the model and, in fact, I understand, that a Mr. Maywood
        Jones presented only what he called "three-dimensional
        illustrations" of Carr's ideas."&nbsp; Monday afternoon there
        was more activity in the warehouse and finally, around 4 PM, the
        model was "turned on" and revolved, although it showed no signs
        of taking off from the table on which it sat.&nbsp; "We hoped to
        try to launch it again but unfortunately one of the seams burst
        during the test," an O.T.C. official said.&nbsp; "We still hope
        to have a launching shortly," another member of Carr's group
        added.&nbsp; Left unanswered were such questions as: </p>
      <p>1) Why was there no publicity about the launching in Oklahoma
        City for two weeks before the model was supposed to fly? </p>
      <p>2) Why did Carr ready a taped message for delivery at the
        "victory dinner" a day before the scheduled launching? </p>
      <p>3) How could any engineer make a mistake of one-16th of an inch
        in a precision part? This would be similar to a navigator
        landing an airplane 300 miles off course. A mistake of
        one-10,000th of an inch can be a major engineering calamity. </p>
      <p>Carr was apparently undaunted by the weekend's developments. He
        again commented, "This indeed is an historic occasion."&nbsp;
        Questioned about the failures of his model, he added, "The
        theory itself has been proven. The model will go up, if not this
        week, then next week or next month."&nbsp; Mr. Carr also has
        stated that he and Major Wayne Aho will "fly to the moon in a
        flying saucer on December 7, 1959." </p>
