      The engine from the Mayan texts :<br>
      <br>
      The gods be thanked: Many ancient writings of the Old and New
      Worlds were in our Century salvaged. For some records can be a
      long in oblivion read out integrated guessed technology. In
      so-called Dresden Codex of the Maya are characters contain and
      drawings, in which we (even if no longer everything seems
      understandable, what should be shown here) repeatedly find a
      Signum that a double-walled rectangular balances with two
      intersecting diagonals. Various Maya researchers have tried to
      interpret characters. Always the representation is (primarily in
      the old-Troano Manuskript the Maya) that is connected to actions
      that a technically verifiable process recalls. It therefore
      interpreted the Mayan characters with the modern concepts of
      "energy booster" "driving force" or "engine". <br>
      <br>
      Two Tyroleans succeeded in 1973 to get the solution to the puzzle
      may closer. The atomic physicist Dr. Friedrich Egger and
      journalist Dr. Klaus Keplinger developed on the drawing board a
      reconstruction of this Mayan glyph. What emerged was a totally
      unusual model. The two "inventor" named their development
      unceremoniously "Maya-engine".<br>
      <br>
      The extraordinary apparatus works on the principle of two mutually
      penetrating inclined planes of rotation. The individual parts
      revolve exclusively around a common co-center point -- and the
      engine (a name the Egger and Keplinger prefer) can both be
      supplied as combustion engine, but also by means of compressed air
      or steam in function.<br>
      <br>
      The Mayan engine is running largely vibration-free and has
      self-critical tests by professionals large industrial companies,
      such as the Tyrolean company Swarovski Optik KG, was held. The
      calculation calculations by experts have shown that the developed
      by Egger and Keplinger combustion engine at a size of 40 cubic
      centimeters and an operating pressure of 10 atmospheres (about
      what the test pressure of a pressure cooker equivalent) already at
      500 rpm with a performance of more than 480 hp emits. A
      conventional engine of similar size creates itself in 5000 (!)<br>
      <br>
      Revolutions per minute, not more than 200 horsepower.<br>
      <br>
      For Egger and Keplinger fixed anyway: The ancient Maya had in
      Troano manuscript entirely apparently recorded a heat engine and
      not ever forget the control valve.<br>
      <br>
      Meanwhile, the invention and reconstruction of the two Tyrolean
      been in more than twenty countries patented. Unfortunately Egger
      and Keplinger had the downside of note take. From one of them
      hoped for mass production at its Mayan engine could be no
      question.<br>
      <br>
      Because apparently some multinationals and lobbies had their
      fingers in the pie. They banished the economically revolutionary
      development in the motor sector in those "safe" in the long ago
      some other pioneering inventions wait for better times.<br>
      <br>
      The Mayan engine of the two researchers would have actually had in
      him to cause a sensation. So would the enormous power of these
      prehistoric combustion engine as a drive for our air pollution
      piston motor vehicles have been a positive alternative. In a
      combustion outside the Cylinder less harmful emissions would be
      significantly developed, but would be a good utilization been
      garntiert the energy offered. And besides, would the Mayan engine
      instead of petrol or Diesel also coped with other fuels. Energy
      sources, as described today in the aerospace industry REITs are
      used, this would have been useful.<br>
      <br>
      Naturally arises questions whether the Maya developed this
      technical knowledge itself were able to make it or merely
      inherited. Dr. Fiedrich Egger and Dr. Klaus Keplinger, the
      Re-designers of the Mayan engine are, anyway, convinced that the
      technical content of the presentation ]<br>

      The links to the pictures in the second of the above links have in

      wonder, why... <br>
      <br>
      The first link mentions that certain multinational companies and
      lobbies have intervened to stop the development by the two
      scientists Egger and Keplinger. One probably bought the patents,
      promising to make something out of them, and then locked them
      away... of course with a non-disclosure clause in the contract.

      A rotary motor and/or pump includes a housing which is in the form
      of a hollow body of rotation and which has a main axis and inlet
      and outlet apertures. A rotor is rotatable about the main axis and
      comprises rotary members which are fixedly interconnected. A
      rotary plate is inclined with respect to the main axis and passes
      through the housing and the rotor. The center points of the rotor,
      housing and rotary plate coincide. The shaft forming the main axis
      is rigidly connected to the housing. The rotary members of the
      rotor and the rotary plate are mounted about the fixed shaft
      rotatably relative to the housing and to the shaft.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This invention relates to a rotary motor and/or pump, having a
      housing which is in the form of a hollow body of rotation and
      which has inlet and outlet apertures, a rotor which is rotatable
      about the main axis of the housing and which comprises rotory
      members which are fixedly interconnected, and a rotary plate which
      is inclined with respect to the main axis and which passes through
      the housing and the rotor, the centre points of the rotor, housing
      and rotary plate coinciding.<br>
      <br>
      Such motors or pumps are already known from various publications,
      but hitherto have not achieved widespread use in practice.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, there exist for example motors or pumps which comprise two
      main parts, a stationary housing and a rotary internal part which
      comprises a shaft and vanes secured thereto. Passing through the
      vanes is a plate which is set at an angle to the shaft, thereby
      producing variable chambers of different sizes.<br>
      <br>
      These known systems commonly have the disadvantage that the vanes
      are only held in the shaft at one side, while the other three
      sides of the vanes are free and are exposed to loadings which have
      an alternating action thereon, when pressure differences occur in
      the individual chambers or due to the displaced mounting in the
      rotary plates. In addition, the use of a two-part construction, as
      referred to above, gives rise to very severe sealing problems as
      between the rotary vanes and the stationary housing, and it is
      scarcely possible to find a technical solution for such problems.<br>
      <br>
      Complicated systems have been developed in order to overcome the
      above-mentioned disadvantages, as are known for example from U.S.
      Pat. No. 2 908 224.<br>
      <br>
      Described in this specification is a motor or a pump which, in
      addition to the two main parts referred to above, includes two
      rotary members which are in form of spherical surfaces and which
      are connected together by the vanes and which together are secured
      on the main shaft. The rotary plate is of a conical configuration
      on both sides, and is arranged at the end of a further shaft which
      is inclined relative to the main shaft, the angle of inclination
      of the further shaft being adjustable. As the rotary components
      which are inclined at an angle to each other, namely the rotary
      members and the rotary plate, engage into each other, it is not
      possible to use a central mounting. The mounting can therefore
      only be outside, in the housing. This means that the masses of the
      rotary plate and its shaft are relatively large in relation to the
      mass of the rotor, and the imbalance which occurs due to the
      continuously varying angular speed of the rotary plate is further
      increased as a result. This has a very detrimental effect on the
      running smoothness of the system and the load on the outside
      mounting.<br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the system described in U.S. Pat. No. 2 908 224 has four
      vanes, which are each arranged at 90 DEG relative to each other.
      There is no provision for compensating for the angular variations
      which occur, due to the inclined rotary plate, in one revolution.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      It is the object of the present invention to provide a motor or a
      pump in which the disadvantages of the previously known systems
      are eliminated, and a simple and operationally more reliable
      construction is possible.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention, this is achieved in that the
      main shaft is rigidly connected to the housing, and that the
      rotary members of the rotor and the rotary plate are mounted on
      the main shaft fixed to the housing, rotatably relative to the
      housing and the main shaft.<br>
      <br>
      By virtue of the rotor and the rotary plate which is inclined
      relative to the main shaft, being arranged in accordance with the
      invention so as to be rotatable about the main shaft which is
      fixed to the housing, so that the hollow body is divided into
      variable chambers, it is possible, simply by rotating the
      rotor-plate system, to provide the necessary, successive,
      continuous increase and reduction in volume of the individual
      chambers.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the rotary members of the
      rotor are truncated cone portions of a right double cone.<br>
      <br>
      The fixed connection between the two rotary members is
      advantageously effected in accordance with the invention by a
      single pair of per se known partition walls which lie diametrally
      opposite to each other and which extend radially from the main
      shaft and which are oriented parallel thereto.<br>
      <br>
      In the motor according to the invention, it is in fact possible to
      provide further partition walls, but in practical production this
      involves a considerable additional cost as the angle to the
      existing partition walls must be variable.<br>
      <br>
      A further construction of the invention is characterised in that
      the angle of the axis of the rotary plate to the main shaft is
      determined by annular grooves which serve to receive the rotary
      plate and which are milled into the main shaft and into the
      two-part casing of the housing, concentrically to the axis.<br>
      <br>
      In a further preferred construction in accordance with the
      invention, the rotary plate lies sealingly against a generating
      line of the double cone.<br>
      <br>
      Another construction according to the invention provides that at
      least one of the two rotary members has an inlet aperture.<br>
      <br>
      In the actual construction in accordance with the invention, the
      drive medium can be supplied through an aperture in the cover
      plate of the housing and a passage through the rotary member. The
      drive medium can be taken off in a similar manner through a
      further outlet through the rotary member and the cover plate of
      the housing, however, this can also be done through apertures in
      the casing of the housing.<br>
      <br>
      If now rotation of the rotor-rotary plate system is begun from a
      given point, for example 0 DEG, at which the rotary plate is in
      contact with the rotary member at one partition wall, it will be
      seen that continuing rotation provides a chamber which
      continuously increases in size and tends towards a maximum value.<br>
      <br>
      As a preferred construction according to the invention provides
      equal phase-displaced working cycles or strokes on both sides of
      the rotary plate, this machine can be referred to as
      self-distributing, in the same sense as a two-stroke engine is
      self-distributing.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention it is also provided that an
      outlet aperture is disposed in the casing of the housing.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The hollow body 1 of rotation is preferably in the form of a
      hollow cylinder and is closed by a lower cover plate 2 and an
      upper cover plate 3. In accordance with the invention however, any
      other rotationally symmetrical hollow body can be used.<br>
      <br>
      The main axis A of the body 1 is at the same time also the main
      axis of the rotor. An axis B around which a rotary plate 4 rotates
      extends at an angle .alpha. to the main axis A. The rotary plate 4
      is mounted rotatably in the shaft forming the main axis A, in an
      annular groove 5 which is arranged concentrically to the axis B,
      and also in a two-part casing 6 forming the hollow body 1, in a
      further annular groove 7 which is also disposed concentrically to
      the axis B. Thus, the position of the axis B and the angle of the
      two axes relative to each other is fixed by this arrangement. It
      will be noted that the two axes A and B intersect at the centre
      point 8 of the hollow body 1, and this is also the centre point of
      the rotary plate 4.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor comprises two rotary members 9 and 10 which are arranged
      symmetrically relative to a plane which extends perpendicularly to
      the main axis A, through the centre point 8. The rotary members 9
      and 10 are connected by a pair of partition walls 11 which lie
      diametrally opposite to each other. A portion 10' of rotary member
      10 extends outwardly of the housing and forms a motion transfer
      shaft, i.e. drive or driven shaft, of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The partition walls 11 are arranged parallel to the main axis A
      and extend radially thereof, and interconnect the individual,
      independently rotatable rotary members 9 and 10 so as to form a
      unit, so that two closed chambers are formed by the rotary members
      9 and 10, the partition walls 11, the shaft forming main axis A
      and the casing 6 of the hollow body 1.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiments illustrated, the rotary members 9 and 10 of the
      rotor are in the form of truncated cone portions of a double cone.
      The angle of inclination .beta. of the conical surface 13 of the
      truncated cone portion, relative to the base surface 14 of the
      truncated cone portion, corresponds to the angle .alpha. between
      the two axes A and B, so that the rotary plate 4 lies parallel to
      the surface 13.<br>
      <br>
      The rotatable plate 4 which is rotatably mounted in the annular
      grooves 5 and 7 has radial slots 15 for receiving the partition
      walls 11. The plate 4 is fixedly connected by the partition walls
      11 to the rotary members 9 and 10, and necessarily performs all
      rotary movements performed by the rotor, the truncated cone
      surface 13 rolling against the rotary plate 4. The hollow body is
      divided by the rotary plate 4 into two closed spaces. Due to the
      movement of the spaces formed by the partitions 11 and the rotary
      plate 4, there are produced chambers 12 the volumes of which are
      variable by rotation of the rotor. In one revolution of the rotor,
      the lines of engagement 16 of the rotary plate 4 with the
      partition walls 11 move along the partition walls 11.<br>
      <br>
      In order to provide suitable sealing of the chambers at the
      transition from the partition wall 11 to the rotary plate 4,
      roller seals 17 are provided in known manner. The radial slots 15
      in the rotary plate 4 are constructed with concave, circularly
      curved side walls, whereby the roller seal 17 is rotatably mounted
      in the radial slot and is prevented from displacement in the
      direction of the partition wall.<br>
      <br>
      The roller seals 17 themselves have a longitudinal slot 18 through
      which the partition walls 11 are slidingly guided. When the rotor
      is rotated, the roller seals which are mounted rotatably in the
      rotary plate 4 are displaced parallel to the lines of engagement
      16 and at the same time reciprocatingly rotate in their mounting
      in the radial slot 15, so that a good sealing action is provided
      in every position.<br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment of the invention (FIG. 6), there is a
      hollow body with a spherical internal chamber 20. In this
      embodiment the main shaft has a spherically formed enlarged
      portion 21 disposed around the centre point of the hollow body.
      This substantially simplifies the solution to the problem of
      sealing.<br>
      <br>
      For the intake and exhaust of the drive medium into and out of the
      chambers of the hollow body, the hollow body has inlet and outlet
      apertures 22 (FIGS. 2 and 7) which are advantageously arranged in
      a known manner in the lower and/or upper cover plates 2 and/or 3.
      It would also be readily possible however for the apertures 22 to
      be provided in the casing 6 of the hollow body.<br>
      <br>
      Labyrinth seals 23 for example are provided for sealing between
      the rotary members 9 or 10 and the cover plates 2 or 3.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 3a to 3d show individual phases of the movement of the
      rotor, in the form of a developed representation, along the inside
      wall of the hollow cylinder. It can be seen that the rotary plate
      4 follows a cosine curve, the partition walls 11 of the rotor
      appear as vertical interruptions, and the rotary members 9 and 10
      appear in the form of horizontal beam members. The degree scale
      relates to the representations of FIGS. 4a to 4c.<br>
      <br>
      The machine according to the invention can be used both as a power
      producing engine and as a working machine. The possibility, due to
      the construction of the machine being symmetrical relative to the
      rotary plate, of using the machine as a simultaneous working
      machine and a power producing engine, has been found particularly
      advantageous.<br>
