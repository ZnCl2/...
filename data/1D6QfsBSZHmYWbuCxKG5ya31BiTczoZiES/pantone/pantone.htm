      <p>A brief description : </p>
      <p>The GEET is a dynamic fuel-exhaust recycling device that can be
        fitted to an engine, between the air intake and the exhaust. </p>
      <p>A model suitable for a small two- or four-stroke (lawn-mower or
        small generator) typically consists of two horizontally-lying,
        concentric steel or metallic pipes of about 50 cm in length, one
        inside the other. The outer pipe has an inside diameter of 25.4
        mm, the inner pipe an outside diameter of 12.7 mm and an inner
        diameter of 12.4 mm. Within the latter is a long solid steel or
        iron bar, whose diameter is 12 mm, that doesn’t touch it, except
        at three solder points at each of its extremities. Let us call A
        and B the two ends of the 50 cm long pipes and bar. </p>
      <p>The exhaust from the engine travels </p>
      <p>* From A along the "outer" concentric space, between the two
        pipes, to B. <br>
        * From there, it is sent bubbling at high pressure to the bottom
        a jug of water with some fuel that is vapourized by the heat. <br>
        * It is then sent along the inner pipe, in the thin space round
        the central solid steel bar, back from B to A, to near the air
        intake, where it is mixed with some fresh air. <br>
        * The latter mixture is input to the motor </p>
      <p>A preliminary analysis of the GEET </p>
      <p>Two-strokes are known to be inefficient as only a certain
        proportion of their fuel is burnt. </p>
      <p>Their exhaust typically consists of the following : </p>
      <p>1 - Air somewhat depleted in oxygen <br>
        2 - Carbon dioxide <br>
        3 - Carbon and nitrogen monoxyde <br>
        4 - Water vapour <br>
        5 - Unburnt volatile gasoline <br>
        6 - Particles of heavier hydrocarbons, lubrifying oil and soot </p>
      <p>In the case of four-strokes, there is less of 5 and 6. </p>
      <p>* As the exhaust first travels between the "outer" space,
        between inner and the outer pipes, it heats their surface to its
        own temperature. In order that this temperature be as high as
        possible, the outer pipe should be thermally insulated with a
        glass wool jacket. Another contribution to higher temperatures
        at the inner surface of the outer pipe involves the
        Ranque-Hilsch effect : the exhaust flow should spiral, so that
        the hotter components in the gas gather against the outer
        surface where the steam is more thoroughly reduced into hydrogen
        while the pipe surface is oxidized. In turn, the released
        hydrogen reacts with the carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide and
        water (CO2 + H2 &gt;&gt; CO + H2O) at high temperatures, while
        the steam can again be reduced by the hot iron into hydrogen.
        Provided that the outer surface of the cooler inner tube
        contains catalyzers such as nickel, already at 200° C, carbon
        dioxide and hydrogen combine into methane and water (CO2 + 4H2
        &gt;&gt; CH4 + 2H2O), the latter of which can again be reduced
        at the hotter surface of the outer pipe. Therefore, both the
        water and the carbon dioxide are reduced, the exhaust becomes
        depleted in carbon dioxide and enriched in fuels such as carbon
        monoxide, hydrogen and methane. </p>
      <p>* This pretreated exhaust bubbles through the jug of water and
        fuel, the latter remaining at the top when not miscible
        (gasoline, heavy fuel or miscible glycol alcohol, etc). The
        depth of the water increases the pressure in the preceding
        reducing stage. Now, along with some soot, heavy hydrocarbons
        and unburnt fuel that are recycled, the carbon dioxide dissolves
        in the water and is removed from the exhaust so long as the
        water isn’t saturated. To increase the amount of carbon dioxide
        dissolved, the pressure should be maximal and the water
        circulated. In critical closed-cycle applications, the resulting
        carbonic acid could react with a metal such as zinc or magnesium
        to release hydrogen. The resulting carbonate and hydroxide, as
        well as the reducing metal of the inner surface of the outer
        pipe could then be recycled later by using solar energy.&nbsp;
        Another option is using some mix of photosynthetic algae in an
        adjacent first stage to convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen
        and biomass, and fermenting anaerobic bacteria in a second stage
        to generate methane and hydrogen from the latter. </p>
      <p>* The fuel as well as some water are vapourized in the bubbler.
      </p>
      <p>* The cooled and enriched exhaust now travels at high speed
        inside the inner pipe, as the available space is thin, round the
        solid steel bar. Here, it must be observed that there are heat
        gradients, as the outer surface of the inner pipe is heated by
        the exhaust, while the steel bar inside that doesn't touch it is
        cooled by the cooler flow of the bubbled exhaust. The
        Ranque-Hilsch effect can again be used to further reduce the
        temperature round the inner bar. This involves replacing the
        three extremal solder points by small soldered coiled lines of
        wire at the B end of the iron bar. </p>
      <p>* Some of the previously generated hydrogen may, here again,
        catalytically combine with the remaining carbon dioxyde into
        methane and water against the outer surface of the nickel inner
        tube. </p>
      <p>* Because steel is magnetic and its Curie temperature is even
        higher than that of the outer, hotter pipe, all the surfaces
        inside the GEET are mesoscopically strongly magnetized, locally,
        on the level of magnetic domains of about 80nm, even if this
        magnetism isn’t apparent macroscopically. However, only the
        inner steel bar is in contact with a sufficiently cool flow so
        it is below the Curie temperature of the Magnegas. </p>
      <p>As a result, when the molecules bounce against the surface of
        the pipes, they experience a strong magnetic field of several
        Tesla. As R.M. Santilli has shown, diatomic molecules such as H<sub>2</sub>
        , O<sub>2</sub> and CO can be magnetically polarized, and may
        assemble into clusters that this researcher calls magnecules.
        These have a Curie temperature which is at about 150° C for H<sub>2</sub>
        and CO. The rate of formation of such magnecules will thus be
        higher on the cooler surface of the steel bar. The corresponding
        magnetically polarized gas is called a Magnegas <sub><font
            size="-2">(TM)</font></sub>. Because most chemical reactions
        involve polarized molecules while ordinary gases are
        unpolarized, magnegases release far more energy than expected
        from the combustion of their unpolarized counterparts. Also note
        that, due to the recycling, the O<sub>2</sub> molecules may pass
        several times into the magnetically polarizing cavity. </p>
      <p>MASER emission might also occur in this cavity, which might
        accelerate the formation of magnecules. </p>
      <p>The recycled and enriched exhaust thus in the end contains: </p>
      <p>* CO, NO, O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub> molecules, the latter
        resulting from the reduction of steam on the outer hot steel
        surface or from biomass recycling. <br>
        * Magnecules of the latter. <br>
        * Some methane from catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide and
        hydrogen or from biomass. <br>
        * Recycled unburnt fuel. <br>
        * Vapourized fuel from the bubbler. <br>
        * Less CO<sub>2</sub> than in the original exhaust, at least
        until the water becomes saturated in the simplest devices. This
        suggests the importance of increasing the pressure in the
        bubbler. </p>
      <p>The mechanisms involved suggest an improvement in efficiency
        from: </p>
      <p>* Thermally insulating the outer pipe. <br>
        * Placing reducing elements at the inner surface of the outer
        pipe, with high surface area if in the solid state, or as a
        liquid circulating blanket maintained by centrifugal forces in a
        rotating configuration. <br>
        * Using spiralling vents at the entry of the exhaust into the
        cylindrical outer space, and coiled elements at the entry of the
        bubbled exhaust round the inner bar so that the flow spirals
        and, by the Ranque-Hilsch effect, concentrates its hot
        components on the outside and its cooler ones on the inside. <br>
        * Using a steel or alloy with high magnetic permeability and
        saturation, or very pure Iron for the inner bar. <br>
        * Polarizing the fuel in the bubbler into a Magneliquid, and the
        fresh air into a Magnegas. <br>
        * Increasing the pressure at the bubbler so that a maximal
        amount of carbon dioxide is dissolved. <br>
        * Using a metallic powder of Zinc or Magnesium so that the
        resulting carbonic acid releases hydrogen and carbonate in
        critical closed-cycle applications, or a multistage biomass of
        photosynthetic algae and anaerobic bacteria to convert the
        carbon dioxide into oxygen and biomass and the latter into
        methane in less critical or fixed applications. </p>
      <p>The central iron bar should be at less than 150° C (the Curie
        temperature of Magnegas), the surrounding catalytic pipe at
        about 200° C (that converts carbon dioxyde and hydrogen into
        water and methane), and the outer pipe at yet higher
        temperatures. </p>
      <p>According to the inventor, Mr Pantone, the central steel or
        iron bar acquires an overall magnetization and must always be
        oriented in the same way with respect to the magnetic north in
        devices where it is horizontal, and similarly with respect to
        the vertical, when vertical. </p>
      <p><i>The energy balance:</i> </p>
      <p>On the minus side: </p>
      <p>* The vapourized fuel spent (whatever the actual proportion of
        fuel in the bubbler, which can be as low as 20%) <br>
        * The steel or reducing agent oxidized, mainly at the inner
        surface of the outer pipe <br>
        * The metallic powder turned into carbonate. </p>
      <p>On the plus side : </p>
      <p>* The unburnt fuel and hydrocarbons recycled, especially for
        two-strokes <br>
        * The unburnt CO and NO recycled <br>
        * The increased energy released by the use of magnecules <br>
        * The possibility of using a wide variety of cheap fuels <br>
        * Dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> converted to oxygen and biomass and
        then the latter into methane and hydrogen in several stages or
        into carbonates and hydrogen by a metal in the bubbler itself or
        some adjacent reactor. </p>
      <p>Any test of exhaust emissions should take into account the CO<sub>2</sub>
        retained in the water. Also note that, when this CO<sub>2</sub>
        is eventually released in the atmosphere or recycled, one is
        left with a brew consisting of residual, unvolatilized fuel,
        soot and various heavy hydrocarbons, which would be ideally
        suited for recycling in a "Hadronic Reactor" into Magnegas.
        Thus, provided that the overall cycle proves to have a
        favourable efficiency, there might be a synergy between the GEET
        and Hadronic reactors, as they both involve Magnegases and the
        waste from the one may be taken as starting materials for the
        other. </p>
      <p>For most two-strokes, there should be quite a significant
        improvement in efficiency from the recycling of the unburnt fuel
        alone. For other motors in which there is less of the latter,
        the gain could be lower but still not negligible. Note also that
        the Magnegas produced in "Hadronic Reactors" is unsuitable for
        two-strokes, as these require a liquid fuel into which the
        lubricating oil is mixed. </p>
      <p>Thus, this system has several positive points. On the other
        hand, claiming that it runs on 80% of water and 20% of fuel when
        this is just the proportion that is present in the bubbler where
        the fuel is preferentially vapourized by the hot exhaust,
        ignoring the oxydation of the metal in the pipes and their
        effective lifetime, ignoring the CO<sub>2</sub> retained in the
        water, especially during the first ten minutes after start-up,
        as well as the liquid wastes that are produced when measuring
        the exhaust emissions and not mentionning for how long a
        specific test was performed can be very misleading, to the point
        of bordering on fraud. </p>
      <p>Suggested improvements involve the use of spiralling
        aerodynamic flows so as to optimize the temperature gradients at
        several key locations by the Ranque-Hilsch effect (to minimize
        the temperature round the central iron bar, and maximize it at
        the inner surface of the inner and outer pipes), thermally
        insulating the outer pipe, increasing the pressure so as to
        maximize the solution of carbon dioxide in the bubbler, and
        circulating the resulting carbonic acid in adjacent reactors,
        using a multistage configuration of photosynthetic and anaerobic
        recycling biomass to convert it to oxygen and methane or using a
        reactive metal to release hydrogen in certain critical
        closed-cycle applications. Solar energy can be used at a later
        stage to release the oxygen taken up by the reducing metal and
        recycle it. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract ~</b> </p>
      <p>A novel fuel pretreater apparatus and method for pretreating an
        alternate fuel to render it usable as the fuel source for fuel
        burning equipment such as internal combustion engines, furnaces,
        boilers, and turbines, includes a volatilization chamber into
        which the alternate fuel is received. An exhaust plenum may
        enclose the volatilization chamber so that thermal energy
        supplied by exhaust from the fuel burning equipment can be used
        to help volatilize the alternate fuel. A bypass stream of
        exhaust may be diverted through the alternate fuel in the
        volatilization chamber to help in volatilizing the alternate
        fuel and help carry the volatilized fuel through a heated
        reactor prior to its being introduced into the fuel burning
        equipment. The reactor is preferably interposed in the exhaust
        conduit and is formed by a reactor tube having a reactor rod
        mounted coaxially therein in spaced relationship. The exhaust
        passing through the exhaust conduit provides thermal energy to
        the reactor to pretreat the alternate fuel. </p>

      <p>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p><i>1. Field</i> </p>
      <p>This invention relates to fuel burning equipment and, more
        particularly, to a novel fuel pretreater apparatus and method
        for making it possible for such fuel burning equipment to
        utilize as a fuel a material not otherwise considered suitable
        as a fuel for such equipment. </p>
      <p><i>2. State of the Art</i> </p>
      <p>Most fuel burning equipment in use today is designed to burn a
        particular fuel. For example, internal combustion engines are
        designed to burn gasoline or diesel fuel, furnaces and boilers
        to burn natural gas, oil, or coal, and turbines to burn kerosene
        or jet fuel. Fuels or other materials other than the fuels for
        which the equipment is designed to burn cannot generally be used
        in such equipment. </p>
      <p>For example, in internal combustion engines, particularly in
        light of the extreme sophistication of many current engines, not
        only for fuel economy but also for reduction in the emitted
        pollutants, great care is taken in the selection of the fuel
        grade particularly as to its quality prior to its introduction
        into the internal combustion engine. One does not consider crude
        oil or recycled materials such as used motor oil, cleaning
        solvents, paint thinner, alcohol, and the like, as a suitable
        fuel source for an internal combustion engine. Further such
        materials would not be considered suitable fuels for furnaces,
        boilers, turbines, or most other fuel burning equipment. In
        addition, one would not consider using such fuels if
        contaminated by water, nor would one consider using nonfuels
        such as used battery acid or other waste products as fuels for
        fuel burning equipment. </p>
      <p>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </p>
      <p>The present invention is a novel fuel pretreater apparatus and
        method for fuel burning equipment. This novel fuel pretreater
        enables the fuel burning equipment to utilize as fuels
        combustible products selected from material such as crude oil or
        recycled materials such as motor oils, paint thinners, solvents,
        alcohols, and the like and noncombustible products such as
        battery acid. Any substance that can be preheated and then
        burned in the fuel burning equipment will be referred to as
        alternate fuel. This alternate fuel is introduced as a liquid
        into a volatilization chamber. The volatilization chamber may be
        heated to aid in volatilization and in most cases may be
        advantageously heated by thermal energy from the exhaust in the
        exhaust conduit of the fuel burning equipment. A portion of the
        exhaust may even be bubbled through the alternate fuel to assist
        in the volatilization of the alternate fuel. The fuel vapor
        produced in the volatilization chamber is drawn through a heated
        thermal pretreater. The thermal pretreater may be mounted,
        preferably concentrically, inside the exhaust conduit to be
        heated by the exhaust gases. The thermal pretreater serves as a
        reactor and is configured as a reactor tube having a reactor rod
        mounted, preferably concentrically, therein with a reduced
        annular space surrounding the rod. The volatilized alternate
        fuel passes through this annular space where it is subjected to
        thermal pretreatment prior to being introduced into the intake
        system of the fuel burning equipment. </p>

      <p>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENT </p>
      <p>The invention is best understood from the following description
        and the appended claims taken in conjunction with the
        accompanying drawings wherein like parts are designated by like
        numerals throughout. </p>
      <p>The present invention is a unique apparatus and method for
        pretreating materials to be used as fuel for fuel burning
        equipment such as internal combustion engines, furnaces,
        boilers, turbines, etc. The pretreatment makes it possible for
        the fuel burning equipment to utilize as its fuel source fuels
        or other materials that are generally considered as not being
        suitable fuels for such fuel burning equipment. These alternate
        fuels include almost any liquid hydrocarbon such as crude oil or
        recycled material such as motor oil, solvents, paint thinners,
        and various alcohols, to name several. These alternate fuels may
        even be contaminated with water or may be material such as used
        battery acid which is not considered combustible or a fuel.
        Importantly, as shown in FIG. 1, the alternate fuel is
        volatilized in a volatilization chamber and is then subjected to
        a high temperature environment in a heated reaction chamber
        prior to its being introduced into the intake system of the fuel
        burning equipment. The reaction chamber provides a heated
        reaction zone with a reaction rod therein about which the fuel
        flows. It is this flow through the heated reaction zone about
        the reaction rod which makes the fuel suitable for burning in
        the fuel burning equipment. In most cases, since the fuel
        burning equipment involved will produce high temperature exhaust
        gases, in order to save energy, the heating for the reaction
        chamber will be provided by the exhaust gases from the fuel
        burning equipment. The reaction chamber will thus usually be
        positioned in the exhaust conduit, whether an exhaust pipe,
        flue, chimney, etc., leading from the fuel burning equipment. It
        is believed important that the fuel flow through the reaction
        chamber be opposite the flow of exhaust gas in the exhaust
        conduit so that the most intense heating of the reaction chamber
        is at the end thereof where the fuel exits the reaction chamber.
        Currently, it is not known precisely what happens to the
        volatilized alternate fuel in this high temperature environment
        although one speculation is that the larger molecules are broken
        down into smaller molecular subunits of the heavy molecules. </p>
      <p>In any event, I have found, for example, that I am able to
        satisfactorily operate an internal combustion engine using as my
        fuel source materials generally considered to be totally
        unsuitable as fuels for an internal combustion engine. For
        example, in one experimental run I was able to successfully
        operate an internal combustion engine using recycled motor oil.
        In another experimental run I was able to operate the internal
        combustion engine using crude oil as my sole fuel source. In yet
        another run I was able to use waste battery acid as my sole fuel
        source. </p>
      <p>However, I should state at this point that when the reaction
        chamber is heated by exhaust gases from the engine, in order to
        generate sufficient thermal energy necessary to volatilize the
        alternate fuel in the volatilization chamber, it is necessary to
        operate the internal combustion engine initially using ordinary
        gasoline. This step is necessary since, absent my unique
        pretreatment process, it is impossible to operate an internal
        combustion engine with the alternate fuels that I am using.
        Accordingly, the internal combustion engine is started and
        operated for an initial period until sufficient thermal energy
        has been generated in order to initiate the volatilization and
        the pretreatment processes. Once these processes are self
        sustaining, the fuel system is switched over from the gasoline
        system to the alternate fuel system. The internal combustion
        engine continues to operate for as long as the alternate fuel is
        supplied or until the internal combustion engine is switched
        off. </p>
      <p>Similarly, with other fuel burning equipment, when the reaction
        chamber is positioned in the exhaust conduit, conventional fuels
        are supplied to the equipment upon start up and until sufficient
        thermal energy is supplied to the reaction chamber to produce
        fuel usable in the equipment from the alternate fuel. </p>
      <p>The invention will be illustrated and described in detail with
        respect to an embodiment thereof for use with an internal
        combustion engine. Referring now to FIG. 2, the novel fuel
        pretreater apparatus of this invention is shown generally at 10
        and includes a volatilization chamber 12 and a fuel pretreater
        section 14 incorporated into an exhaust conduit 16.
        Volatilization chamber 12 is enclosed in an exhaust plenum 17
        through which a stream of exhaust 18 passes. Exhaust 18 is
        produced by an internal combustion engine 20 which can be any
        suitable internal combustion engine ranging in size from a
        small, one-cylinder internal combustion engine to a large,
        multicylinder internal combustion engine. Internal combustion
        engine 20 is shown herein schematically particularly since no
        claim is made to an internal combustion engine, per se, only to
        the novel fuel pretreater apparatus 10 shown and claimed herein.
      </p>
      <p>Internal combustion engine 20 includes a fuel tank 22 which
        supplies a starting fuel 24 and has a valve 26 for controlling
        the flow of fuel 24 through a fuel line 28 into an intake
        manifold 29. Fuel 24 enters internal combustion engine 20
        through an intake manifold 29 either through carburetion or fuel
        injection (not shown), both of which are conventional systems
        for introducing fuel 24 into internal combustion engine 20 and
        are, therefore, not shown herein but only indicated
        schematically through the depiction of intake manifold 29. Fuel
        24 is ordinary gasoline and provides the necessary starting fuel
        for internal combustion engine 20 until sufficient thermal
        energy has been produced in order to sustain the operation of
        volatilization chamber 12 and pretreater section 14. Thereafter,
        valve 26 is closed and internal combustion engine 20 is operated
        as will be discussed more fully hereinafter. Internal combustion
        engine 20 produces exhaust 18 which is collected from internal
        combustion engine 20 by an exhaust manifold 30. Exhaust 18 is
        then directed through exhaust conduit 16 into fuel pretreater 10
        where it provides the necessary thermal energy for the operation
        of fuel pretreater 10. </p>
      <p>Exhaust 18b represents a portion of exhaust 18 and passes
        through plenum chamber 17 surrounding volatilization chamber 12
        prior to exiting exhaust conduit 16. Exhaust 18b represents the
        residual portion of exhaust 18 since a bypass 40 diverts a
        portion of exhaust 18 (shown as exhaust 18a) into volatilization
        chamber 12. Plenum chamber 17 acts as a heat exchanger for
        transferring thermal energy from exhaust 18b to volatilization
        chamber 12. A valve 42 controls the amount of exhaust 18a
        diverted into volatilization chamber 12. </p>
      <p>Volatilization chamber 12 receives a quantity of alternate fuel
        60 through a fuel line 62 from an alternate fuel source 63 with
        the flow thereof being controlled by a valve 64. Alternate fuel
        60 accumulates as a pool of alternate fuel 60 in the bottom of
        volatilization chamber 12. Bypass 40 directs exhaust 18a into
        the bottom of the pool of alternate fuel 60 where a bubble plate
        44 disperses exhaust 18a upwardly into the pool of alternate
        fuel 60 in order to assist in the volatilization of alternate
        fuel 60. However, the primary source of thermal energy for the
        volatilization of alternate fuel 60 is supplied by exhaust 18b
        as it passes through plenum chamber 17. The volatilized
        alternate fuel 60 is shown as volatilized fuel 66 which passes
        into an inlet 51 which is the end of reactor tube 52 extending
        upwardly into volatilization chamber 12. </p>
      <p>Referring also to FIG. 3, an enlarged segment of pretreater
        section 14 is shown generally as a reactor 50 which includes a
        reactor tube 52 located concentrically inside exhaust conduit
        16. A reactor rod 54 is mounted concentrically in spaced
        relationship inside reactor tube 52 to provide an annular space
        or reaction chamber 56. As shown, exhaust 18 passes through an
        annular space 51 surrounding reactor tube 52 where it transfers
        a portion of its thermal energy to reactor tube 52. Volatilized
        fuel 66 passes countercurrently through the annular space of
        reaction chamber 56. The turbulent mixing of volatilized fuel 66
        as it passes through reactor 50 in combination with the thermal
        energy imparted to it from exhaust 18 along with what is
        believed to be a catalytic reaction therein initiated by reactor
        rod 54 produces a pretreated fuel 68. Pretreated fuel 68 is then
        directed through an intake line 53 (which is an extension of
        reactor tube 52) into intake manifold 29. A valve 57 in intake
        line 53 controls the flow of pretreated fuel 68 into intake
        manifold 29. Supplemental air 80 is introduced into pretreated
        fuel 68 through an air intake 82 with the flow of supplemental
        air 80 being controlled by a valve 84. </p>
      <p>The presence of the reactor rod has been found important to
        operation of the invention. The make up of the reactor rod does
        not appear to be important. A steel reactor rod has been found
        satisfactory as have stainless steel, aluminum, brass, and
        ceramic reactor rods. </p>
      <p>Steady state operation of internal combustion engine 20
        involves exhaust 18 contributing thermal energy to reactor 50. A
        portion of exhaust 18 is diverted as exhaust 18a and bubbled
        through the pool of alternate fuel 60 in the bottom of
        volatilization chamber 12. Exhaust 18a combines with the
        volatilized fuel from alternate fuel 60 to provide volatilized
        fuel 66. Volatilized fuel 66 is drawn into inlet 51 thence
        through reaction chamber 56 of reactor tube 52. The balance of
        exhaust 18b passes through plenum chamber 17 where a substantial
        portion of the balance of the thermal energy in exhaust 18b is
        transferred into alternate fuel 60 to assist in the
        volatilization of the same. </p>
      <p>The method of this invention is practiced by starting internal
        combustion engine 20 using starting fuel 24 obtained from
        starting fuel tank 22. The flow of starting fuel 24 through fuel
        inlet line 28 is controlled by valve 26. Valve 84 is opened
        initially to allow the free flow of air 80 through air intake 82
        during this starting phase of internal combustion engine 20.
        Internal combustion engine 20 generates exhaust 18 which is
        collected in exhaust manifold 30 where it is then directed into
        exhaust conduit 16. Exhaust 18 contains a significant amount of
        thermal energy resulting from the combustion of starting fuel 24
        in internal combustion engine 20. A portion of the thermal
        energy in exhaust 18 is used to heat reactor 50 and then to
        volatilize alternate fuel 60. Specifically, exhaust 18a is
        diverted through exhaust bypass line 40 into volatilization
        chamber 12 where exhaust 18a is dispersed by bubble plate 44
        into alternate fuel 60. Exhaust 18a transfers its thermal energy
        to alternate fuel 60 and also provides a carrier stream for the
        volatilized products of alternate fuel 60 so that this
        combination becomes volatilized alternate fuel 66 which is then
        drawn into intake 51. At this point it should be noted also that
        valve 84 is partially closed in order to create a partial vacuum
        in pretreated fuel line 53, which means that a partial vacuum
        will also be created in intake 51. Simultaneously, valves 42 and
        57 are selectively controlled in order to suitably recirculate
        the flow of exhaust 18a and volatilized alternate fuel 66,
        respectively. In the meantime, the balance of exhaust 18 becomes
        exhaust 18b which passes through plenum chamber 17 where it
        transfers its thermal energy into volatilization chamber 12 and
        alternate fuel 60 therein. Accordingly, a major portion of the
        balance of thermal energy in exhaust 18 after exhaust 18 has
        passed through reactor 50 is transferred into alternate fuel 60
        for the volatilization of the same. </p>
      <p>Volatilized alternate fuel 66 is directed into reaction chamber
        56 where it is subjected to the pretreatment process of this
        invention by becoming reaction fuel 67 and then pretreated fuel
        68. At the present time I am unable to state with any degree of
        certainty precisely what happens to reaction fuel 67 in reaction
        chamber 56. However, I have found that the larger molecules in
        volatilized fuel 66 appear to be broken into fragments with some
        type of reaction taking place. Specifically, I have found that a
        portion of the length of reactor 50 becomes quite hot,
        substantially hotter than could otherwise be accounted for from
        the thermal energy from exhaust 18 alone. This surplus thermal
        energy implies that some form of reaction is occurring in
        reaction fuel 67 as it is transformed into pretreated fuel 68.
        For example, in one prototype of the invention, the end of the
        exhaust conduit 16 positioned adjacent the end of reactor 50
        closest the exhaust manifold 30 maintained a temperature of
        between about 500.degree.-700.degree. F. The portion of exhaust
        conduit 16 positioned along the central portion of the reactor
        50 had a temperature between about 600.degree.-900.degree. F.,
        while the position of the exhaust conduit 16 positioned adjacent
        the end of the reaction chamber where the volatilized alternate
        fuel entered was at a temperature between about
        200.degree.-300.degree. F. Thus, the position of the exhaust
        conduit along the central portion of the reactor 50 reached
        temperatures higher than would be expected from the temperature
        of the other position of the pipe. Pretreated fuel 68 is
        directed into intake manifold 29 where it becomes the fuel
        source for internal combustion engine 20. </p>
      <p>The change over from starting fuel 24 to pretreated fuel 68 is
        accomplished by the careful adjustment of valves 26, 84, 57, and
        42. In this manner, the operation of internal combustion engine
        20 is smoothly transferred from sole reliance on starting fuel
        24 to reliance entirely on pretreated fuel 68. Using the novel
        teachings of this invention, I have run internal combustion
        engine 20 on alternate fuel 60 selected from materials generally
        considered to be totally unsuitable as a fuel for internal
        combustion engine 20. These alternate fuels have included crude
        oil and recycled materials such as motor oil, paint thinners,
        alcohols, and the like. Also, such fuels having some water
        content have also been used. Many of these alternate fuels are
        waste products for which disposal is a significant problem. By
        being able to use such waste products as fuel, a major source of
        pollution is eliminated. Tests on the exhaust generated by the
        engine 20 burning the alternate fuels have indicated that such
        exhaust is much cleaner than exhaust normally generated by such
        engines when burning gasoline in normal manner (gasoline can be
        used in the system as the alternate fuel of the invention to
        operate the engine more efficiently and without significant
        pollutants in the exhaust). </p>
      <p>The dimensions of the reaction chamber and the reaction rod are
        such that the rod forces the volatilized fuel to flow
        substantially along the wall of the reaction chamber. For a 350
        cubic inch V-8 Chevrolet engine, a reaction tube of about
        one-half inch inside diameter is placed substantially
        concentrically in an exhaust pipe from the engine. The reaction
        rod has a diameter to leave a concentric space between the
        reaction rod and inside wall of the reaction tube of about
        0.035-0.04 inches and the reaction rod is between about ten
        inches and twelve inches in length. Lighter fuels, such as
        gasoline, work with the larger spacing between the reaction rod
        and reaction tube wall and the shorter rod while the smaller
        spacing and longer length may be required for heavier fuels such
        as crude oil since the heavier fuels generally require more
        heating and velocity through the reaction zone. Similar
        dimensions have been found satisfactory for use with single
        cylinder engines such as those having up to about fifteen
        horsepower. The smaller engines seldom require a reaction rod
        greater in length than about four inches. Similar dimensions
        will be used with other internal combustion engines. </p>
      <p>The various dimensions indicated are examples only and can
        vary, usually depending upon the type and size of engine, lfuel
        volume required, and the type of alternate fuels to be used. The
        important thing is that the passage for the volatilized
        alternate fuel through the reaction chamber be such as to cause
        the reaction to take place to convert the volatilized alternate
        fuel to the reaction fuel which is satisfactory for operating
        the engine. </p>
      <p>While the invention has been described in detail in connection
        with an internal combustion engine, the invention can be used
        equally as well and in similar manner with any fuel burning
        equipment. Thus, it can be used to treat material so it can be
        used in fuel for furnaces and boilers in place of the normal
        natural gas, fuel oil, or coal, or to power turbines in place of
        the normal kerosene or jet fuel. The reaction chamber can be
        positioned in the exhaust conduit, such as a flue or chimney,
        similarly as it is placed in the exhaust conduit from the
        internal combustion engine shown. </p>
      <p>Rather than heating the reaction chamber with exhaust gases
        from the fuel burning equipment being powered, and such heating
        is presently preferred because such heating is integrally a part
        of the equipment used which appears to provide optimum results,
        the reaction chamber could be heated by other means. Such other
        means, however, should be arranged to provide similar heating
        and heat gradients as are provided by the exhaust gas. </p>
      <p>Whereas the volatilization chamber is shown as heated by the
        exhaust gas, the volatilization chamber could be heated by other
        means or, depending upon the material used as fuel, the
        volatilization chamber might not be heated at all. The important
        thing is that the material to be used as fuel is volatilized in
        the volatilization chamber so the volatilized material is drawn
        into the reaction chamber. As used herein, the volatilization
        chamber does not have to be a chamber as such, but may be any
        means which volatilizes the alternate fuel. It could be a
        carbuerator or an injection nozzle or other volatilizing or
        spray means. Further, it is not necessary that exhaust gas be
        combined with the volatilized fuel as it is in the embodiment
        described. It has been found that in most cases the invention
        works satisfactorily without exhaust gas in the volatilized
        fuel. In most instances the volatilization fuel will be drawn
        through the reaction chamber by a low pressure or a pump at the
        fuel inlet of the fuel burning equipment. </p>
      <p>The fuel pretreater of the invention is a novel discovery in
        that it allows me to successfully operate fuel burning equipment
        using alternate fuels. As such, I am able to achieve several
        highly desirable goals, namely, the extraction of valuable
        energy from alternate fuel while at the same time removing
        alternate fuel from the waste stream; or, in the case of crude
        oil, using this material directly thereby eliminating the need
        to subject the same to the expensive and capital intensive
        refining processes. </p>
      <p>The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms
        without departing from its spirit or essential characteristics.
        The described embodiments are to be considered in all respects
        only as illustrative and not restrictive. The scope of the
        invention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather
        than by the foregoing description. All changes which come within
        the meaning and range of equivalency of the claims are to be
        embraced within their scope.</p>

    <blockquote>&nbsp; <br>
      The first working prototype was developed long before the
      technical analysis was attempted. Plasma research is a fairly new
      field of acceptable science. At this time most printed text is
      from foreign Countries, and a majority from Russia.
      <p>The technology used in the GEET Fuel Processor is a combination
        of the most basic scientific principles, most of which falls
        within the normal rules and of thermodynamics. But some of the
        70 simultaneous phenomenon are not found in those books, since
        it is the combination of events, which is the body of this
        discovery. Put quite simply, the exhaust heat is transferred to
        the incoming fuel vapor, which must be maintained in a vacuum,
        and the overall configuration provides a molecular breakdown
        within the vacuum of all of the heavier elements. Therefore,
        intensifying the vacuum, the speed of molecular breakdown or
        reaction is magnified, and less heat is required. </p>
      <p>The GEET Plasma unit generates several "electrical" fields at
        the same time while operating, some of which are in opposite
        direction and all are affected by the direction of mass movement
        as well as by the gravitational field of our planet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        During lectures from coast to coast Paul and Molley have
        explained that it is frequency and vibration that determines the
        amount of plasma or energy being developed. Reseach in private
        laboratories in Europe is helping to isolate some of the basic
        field replication of the plasma generator that the Pantones need
        for visible demonstrations. </p>
      <p>Many attempts to use the external electrical mechanical devices
        to enhance the production of Plasma in the GEET Fuel Processor
        have all failed to show any promise, such as the Plasmatron.
        This has occurred because the outside interference has opposed
        the "natural" order of the energy, which must be self generated
        to maximize the results, as well as will increase the
        charge-discharge at specific needs of demand of the Plasma - or
        GEET GAS. It should also be noted that using outside non-natural
        heating diminishes the fields which are normally self generated.
      </p>
      <p>The specific movement of vapor within the GEET Fuel Processor
        is "focused" to exact flow direction and velocity being self
        created thereby maximizing and intensifying the "field and
        enhancing the molecular, or atomic disassociation. Without all
        other natural elements increasing to equal proportions, one
        cannot expect that merely increasing the Arc-Field will be the
        main reason for specific success of any given substance to be
        broken down to it's base elements. When the ideal Plasma has
        been created is the time to begin increasing or decreasing all
        parameters involved at their respective equal or balanced
        increments to satisfy an increase or decrease in the Plasma
        flow. In doing so one can increase the Plasma flow to a viable
        delivery state for all commercial use demands. During tests the
        over-reving to engines has startled engineers and scientists
        from around the world, as engines are sped up to over twice the
        normal rpm, and slowed down to a fraction of their normal idle
        speed, with no noticeable vibration. Have you ever seen a 350
        Chevrolet idle at 80 rpm? We have. </p>
      <p>All of the currently studied Plasma generators, basically share
        a design and operational feature in that they attempt to Push
        the Fuel, under pressure, into a reaction, whereby a need for
        outside energy to force the device to function. The most unique
        feature of the GEET Plasma Fuel System is that by supplying the
        fuel into the Plasma chamber in a vacuum and through a
        longitudinal, natural release, causes a Radial reaction which is
        self induced, which creates energy as electrons are pulled into
        the reactin of plasma, instead of consuming energy. Thus the
        Plasma becomes more "homogenized" with atmospheric air, causing
        a well-blended fuel for final delivery. </p>
      <p>An additional stabilizing feature within our system is the
        natural circulation of opposing masses as a vorticular motion
        within the Plasma Field, a condition as described by Molley
        Pantone as Thermal momentum-or Inertia. Such field is caused in
        part by the chamber beginning before and after the Field zone.
        The size of the Field zone must coincide with the fuel and
        parameters with specific limitations, dependent on the fuel
        demand.&nbsp; Now we should also explaain that a small unit,
        such as a 10 hp engine can be used as a "servant" to produce
        fuel to be used by an un-modified larger engine or furnace, by
        adapting pumps and only modifiying the air intake only.&nbsp;
        Thus a 10 hp engine could make the fuel for a locomotive. </p>
      <p>The exact length of the Plasma chamber need be adjustable to
        fully accommodate rapid change of fuels when different blends
        are being used. This is quite simple but requires some very
        expensive equipment for analysis of the final exhaust for the
        average mechanic. </p>
      <p>The "balance " point of a perfectly adjusted GEET Plasma
        reaction chamber, will give the same temperature coming out of
        the exhaust pipe as the ambient air, as well as the air quality
        should be the same or a slight increase of oxygen coming out of
        the tailpipe. So far the inventor has accomplished a 2% increase
        in oxygen coming out of an internal combustion using crude oil
        as fuel and a 3.5% increase using Battery acid mixed with 80%
        saltwater. At the higher than ambient oxygen levels you normally
        find ice forming on the exhaust pipes as a normal function of
        this phenomenon. </p>
      <p>When the Plasma field chamber is too short or too long for the
        density of the fuel being used, it overheats the South end and
        Chills the North end of the reactor, this also causes the field
        to consume oxygen, instead of creating it. The direction and
        configuration of the heat source is critical to the proper
        balance of the reaction to create a Plasma. We have now learned
        that down is the same as South in relationship to using a
        compass, and therefore North is up. </p>
      <p>Other Plasma generators, such as the copy cat from MIT, which
        they call the Plasmatron, uses outside applied power to create
        heat to run the units, but have extremely limited use and
        output, when compared to the GEET system. Since the power output
        of Plasma is constant and generates power we can only assume
        that it is of a DC nature and is a constant output which we have
        not yet attempted to harness. ( hopefully coming soon.) </p>
      <p>There will be a large number of reports dating back to 1984
        that the inventor was not ready to release until he felt the
        timing was right. He feels the timing is now right and these
        will be posted as soon as possible. If you would like to share
        some of your experience with the inventor contact him at
        info@geet.com. </p>

      <p>The Geet fuel processor may soon make it possible for you to
        own the ultimate home production power plant... one that heats
        your water, generates electricity, takes care of heating and air
        conditioning, simply by utilizing waste heat from refrigeration
        and applying it to storage or hot water, while the generator is
        giving you all the electricity you want. </p>
      <p>In simple definition, the GEET Fuel Processor could be called a
        new type of carburetor with a miniature refinery built in. With
        it, There is no need for catalytic converters, smog pumps and
        many other costly items on cars , as the GEET fuel processor is
        not just a fuel delivery system it is also a pollution
        elimination unit! Your mileage will be greatly increased if you
        are truly consuming ALL of the available energy From whatever
        fuel you may be using. </p>
      <p>I began working on the original concept of better mileage over
        fifteen years ago, During the fifteen years of testing and
        research, I was able to achieve the goals of ZERO pollution,
        while running internal combustion engines on fuel such as crude
        oil, battery acid, cleaning solvents, even gasoline... some of
        the tests were done with mixtures with as much as 80% water
        IMPOSSIBLE ??? SEEING IS BELIEVING ! </p>
      <p>Having demonstrated the GEET Fuel Processor countless times, I
        heard over and over " thats impossible." Most of the hundred
        scientists who have been invited to help in this project have
        Refused to even come out to look at it, claiming it is
        impossible. Yet after repeated showings , many potential
        financial backers have depended on the professional opinion of
        qualified people, who did not even take the time to even look. </p>
      <p>One scientist -Jim _ who Wanted to help me was employed at a
        major United States Testing Laboratory. We spent several days
        reviewing how and why the device worked. Jim claimed he could
        get all the necessary funding to get through the R&amp;D stages
        by telling the other scientists at work what he had viewed, Jim
        told me to call him at work the following Wednesday. </p>
      <p>When I , called the number I was informed that Jim was asked to
        resign. They told me that Jim must have been doing some drugs,
        if he truly believed that he saw a gasoline engine run on crude
        oil with no pollution. </p>
      <p>This type of response is very normal to this inventor. Many
        sincere people have turned their backs and walked away, because
        of the input of knowledge of others who laugh and say it is
        absolutely not possible. </p>
      <p>However , a few years ago , at a smog certification station in
        California, this fuel system was demonstrated while being
        monitored and videotaped. While running a gasoline engine on
        crude oil, the final exhaust was actually cleaner than the air
        in the establishment --zero pollution. This does not defy
        physics, it only operates within the most basic laws of physics
        in a unique manner. Basics of GEET technology </p>
      <p>The GEET fuel processor is a self inducing plasma generator. In
        my case, the working proto type was developed long before the
        technical analysis was attempted. Plasma research is a fairly
        new field of science. Most of the available text on this subject
        are from foreign countries. </p>
      <p>The technology used on the GEET fuel processor is a combination
        of very basic scientific principles which fall within most of
        the normal rules and laws of thermodynamics. </p>
      <p>Put quite simply the exhaust heat is transferred to the
        incoming fuel, which is in a vacuum, and the overall
        configuration provides a molecular breakdown within the vacuum ,
        the speed of the molecular reaction, or breakdown, is greatly
        magnified. The GEET Plasma Generator </p>
      <p>The phenomenon which occurs within and around the GEET Fuel
        Processor, can best be described as controlled lightning. As
        masses of cold and warm air colliding, an electrical discharge
        occurs. The specific lengths of each colliding mass determines
        the type and the amount of discharge. </p>
      <p>It can be a bolt of lightning, or if the configuration of
        masses is conductive to a radial type of discharge it may appear
        as a ball of energy. Many discharges of this nature are so small
        they are not visible to the human eye. Others are magnified by
        moisture and radiate in an energy field which is visible as
        colored light. </p>
      <p>When the electromagnetic field is radial as well as
        longitudinal, and balanced to create the center of the plasma
        reaction, maximum efficiency of the field is accomplished. This
        is done within the GEET Fuel Processor, as the plasma is created
        on demand. Using a steady self generated magnetic field one does
        not have the problem of random Plasma clusters, as every
        molecule is held as a constant potential contributor to the
        demand and the demand controls the field which stabilizes itself
        within a specific ratio. </p>
      <p>The elemental components of the GEET Fuel Processor allow the
        transfer of virtually all the generated heat into the plasma,
        which further stabilizes the electromagnetic field, as well as
        increases the electron flow at any specific need, on demand. </p>
      <p>In the GEET device the plasma fields is generated internally.
        Many attempts to use external electrical mechanical devices to
        enhance the production of plasmas in the GEET fuel processor,
        have all failed. This has occurred because the outside
        interference has opposed the "natural" electromagnetic field,
        which is self-generated in the GEET fuel processor. Thus the
        entire magnetic field collapses and entire system shuts down. </p>
      <p>In conventional generators, the means of introduction of the
        magnetic flow is perpendicular or angled to the plasma tube
        through wave guides, the effectiveness is diminished due the
        turbulence created. By simply changing the position of the
        electrode to the center of the plasma field, the turbulence is
        eliminated, thus more usable energy is created. Furthermore,
        less extraneous equipment is used to produce and control the
        plasma. </p>
      <p>The movement within the GEET Fuel Processor is "focused" to the
        specific flow direction of the Plasma being created, thereby
        maximizing and intensifying the magnetic field and enhancing
        molecular, or atomic, disassociation. </p>
      <p>Without all other elements increasing to equal proportions, one
        cannot expect that merely increasing the electric arc/magnetic
        field will be the main reason for specific success of any given
        test. When the ideal plasma reaction has been created is the
        time to begin increase or decreasing all parameters involved at
        their respective equal, or balanced, increments to satisfy an
        increase or decrease in the plasma flow. In so doing one can
        increase the Plasma flow to a viable delivery state for
        commercial use. Plasma Flow </p>
      <p>All the current studied Plasma generators, basically share a
        design and operational feature in that they attempt to PUSH the
        Plasma chamber. One of the unique differences of the GEET Fuel
        Processor, is that reduced pressure (vacuum), PULLS the Plasma,
        which enhances the homogenization of the newly created fuel. </p>
      <p>An additional stabilizing feature within our Plasma unit is the
        recirculation zone is through and beyond both ends of the
        magnetic field, thus intensifying and further stabilizing the
        plasma. The size of the recirculation zone needs to coincide to
        all other parameters within specific limitations- depending on
        the fuel source-and demand at any given time. </p>
      <p>The exact length of the Plasma generation chamber needs to be
        fully adjustable, to compensate for changes in the molecular
        density or massive expansions of the fuel being used for Plasma.
        An example of this would be when 20% battery acid is mixed with
        80% saltwater and used as fuel; it needs a shorter Plasma
        chamber than the one needed for Alaskan Crude Oil. </p>
      <p>If the same or larger unit is chosen for the acid mix, the
        normal running temperatures are exceeded, and the balance of the
        plasma field is at its optimum performance when ambient air and
        the final discharge are at the same temperature, and air quality
        at both points are equal. </p>
      <p>When the plasma field tube is too short or too long for the
        density of the fuel being used, it overheats the high end or
        forms ice on the low end, respectively. This characteristic is
        further evidence by numerous tests. When pollutants are
        noticeable there is an imbalance. </p>
      <p>The direction and configuration of heat applied, was made on
        many of the prior units to formulate conclusions. The specific
        natural flow of self generated energy which does create its own
        fields (outside of lightning, and natural phenomenon). </p>
      <p>Other plasma generators using outside applied power seem to
        have less technological reason and practical use than the GEET
        fuel processor which requires no outside power. Since the energy
        field which is radial and longitudinal, as well as self
        generated and constant, we may assume that the current-voltage
        characteristic of the GEET plasma field is a pulsating direct
        current. New Theories Needed </p>
      <p>With the proper team of open minded scientists, this technology
        should be easily understood. since prototypes already exist. A
        few months ago, when the inventor invited scientists from all
        over the country, to help in compiling a reasonable theory or
        formula for why the invention works, he found very few takers. </p>
      <p>One scientist, Dr. Andreas Kurt Richter, spent most of a week
        at the inventors home as a house guest. There were hours of
        discussion on physics and unknown phenomenon. In a letter, dated
        July 3, 1995, Dr. Richter states, I am a consultant to Paul
        Pantone in the search for the scientific and technical
        explanations to understand the operation of this energy device.
        According to my present knowledge it should not work and I would
        not believe it had I not seen it with my own eyes. It is my
        opinion that Mr. Paul W. Pantone has invited an amazing energy
        device or engine with potential as yet unheard of. </p>
      <p>Another scientist, Dr. Grant Wood, has similar comments. Dr.
        Wood has taught automotive science for most of the last 35
        years. </p>
      <p>I am still seeking scientists, doctors, manufacturers, and all
        other professionals to assist me, not only in this but hundreds
        of other inventions and products and concepts. Testing </p>
      <p>Getting testing done or the interest to get them done at such
        places as Lawrence Livermore Laboratories, Southwest Research
        Laboratories Universities, etc., is difficult. First you must
        convince them it works, and then have a ton of money. These
        laboratories have expressed that testing would be a waste of
        money, and their valuable time. Most simply do not understand
        this device. </p>
      <p>To get testing done, the inventor went to numerous companies
        including Cooper Industries, Briggs and Stratton, Waukesha;
        (this list is quite long), and in most cases these industries
        were not interested, even though many sent representative out
        and can convey that the prototypes did in fact work. At first,
        most of the tests were accomplished on small internal combustion
        engines. Combustion studies were done in furnace applications to
        enable the inventor a better fuel study. </p>
      <p>In 1983, I approached the small engine manufacturers in an
        effort to gain knowledge and technical support. Up to this point
        I had used old beat up equipment for most of my testing. Briggs
        and Stratton was the only company willing to discuss such
        technology which is advanced, they wanted to be the first engine
        company to go public. </p>
      <p>A few years later in 1987, I did go to Wawatosa, Wisconsin and
        ran this engine, hooked up to their testing dyno. These test
        were done on crude oils, gasoline, and fuel oils, mixed with
        water. They knew the engine worked and would be controversial
        and suggested that I try to market the device the device in
        third world countries. I still want to market the device in the
        United States first. </p>
      <p>A few test engines have been tested in cars. Now a 240 kW
        Waukesha Generator (Model #H2475) has also been retrofit with
        the GEET Fuel Processor and the only thing needed to get this
        into production is automatic controls and money. A Pollution
        Solution </p>
      <p>Many have asked what the true value of this technology is. To
        being with, please place a value on what would it be worth, in
        dollars and cents, if you could just double the
        mileage/performance on every car, truck, locomotive, ship,
        furnace, boiler, hot water heater, etc., not to mention reducing
        pollution, on a world wide application? The truth is that if you
        only disposed of some forms of toxic waste, it would be
        invaluable to man. And if you generated energy from raw crude
        oil, without the need for refineries, this would satisfy many
        countries all by itself. </p>
      <p>Although the automotive field is very large, our global buildup
        of toxic waste has become my first choice for production. This
        can be accomplished in a reasonably short time by installing
        electronic controls to the necessary control components. </p>
      <p>Utilities and communities can greatly benefit from the GEET
        Fuel Processor, while running power plants, desalinization
        plants, pumping plants, etc., all the while getting paid to take
        toxic fuel to run the plants. When toxic waste is transported
        from coast to coast there is always a danger of accents, and by
        locating toxic disposal units throughout the country this will
        shorten the risk and distances traveled, providing more safety
        to the public. </p>
      <p>GEET (Global Environmental Energy Technology), was formed as a
        holding company for this technology. Patent applications have
        been filed for the US and foreign Countries. The GEET Business
        Trust is exclusively authorized as the only licensing agency of
        the technology. </p>
      <p>Since this technology was published in the Exotic Research
        Report and its subsequent demonstration at the New Energy
        Symposium in Denver this April, many developments have taken
        place. Contracts are being prepared to utilize this technology
        on locomotives and power plants in other countries and the
        future looks promising. </p>
      <p>However, I want to insure that the technology is not
        suppressed. So in the interest of humanity, 1000 units of my
        original prototypes are being made available at $2500 each. </p>
      <p>A Ford Pinto 2300 Engine has been recently converted to use the
        device and is now in the shop being tested. We are expending
        every effort to make this unit available to Ford Pinto owners
        (with the 2300 Engine) within the next 30 days. </p>
      <p>To obtain a GEET device, contact me (Paul Pantone) at (801)
        281-2462. For those who are attending the upcoming International
        Tesla Symposium (July 18-21), we hope to have the car at the
        symposium for demonstration as well as our smaller prototypes.
        We will make a full demonstration of the engine. </p>

      <p><b>Step 1</b> ~ Tools needed - pipe wrench, crescent wrench,
        spring tube benders, pipe cutter, pipe flaring tool, allen
        wrench, soldering equipment, file, and screw driver. Obtain all
        your parts and tools needed for the conversion ahead of time.
        (Parts List at bottom) </p>
      <p>Most professional plumbing supply stores stock higher quality
        parts compared to large home centers cheap plumbing parts. The
        savings aren't that much on a small project like this. The most
        crucial quality part is on the inner pipe, problems arise from
        inconsistent wall thickness, out of roundness, thick weld seams,
        etc on low quality pipe. </p>

      <p><b>Step 2</b> ~ Strip down the engine removing the gas tank,
        muffler, and carburetor. Remove the mower blade and replace with
        a 12" diameter steel disk flywheel of the same thickness as the
        blade for safety. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 3</b> ~ Take the 1"x1/2"x1/2" reducing tees and mount
        them on a 1" nipple (short pipe), and then using a lathe,
        machine the end smooth and fly cut (bore out) the hole in the
        end 27/32" (21mm) so that the 1/2" inner pipe will slide inside.
        This procedure can also be done by using a drill press to drill
        a 27/32" or 7/8" hole in the end of the tee and then use a file
        to smooth the roughness off. </p>
      <p>The 1/2" pipe connector and 1/2" tee will each need to have one
        end smoothed off as well to receive the copper washers as a
        tight seal. </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Step 3: Tee &amp; Connector ~</b> <br>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 4</b> ~ Have a plumber or plumbing center cut your
        inner reactor 1/2" pipe to 16 + 7/16" and thread both ends. Use
        Black Pipe here because galvanized pipe gives off toxic fumes if
        heated too much. File the 12" x 1/2" multi-fuel steel rod to a
        bullet point on one end only. (7 + 3/8" x 1/2" for gasoline
        only) This will keep you out of trouble later if you can't
        remember which way the rod points. The engine <u>will not run </u>if




        the rod is put in backwards after it has a magnetic signature. </p>
      <p>Assemble the parts in order as in the above picture using the
        7/8" / 22mm copper.washers used in oil drain plugs for cars. (2
        - 1"x1/2"x1/2" machined reducing tees joined by the12" long 1"
        nipple, slide the 16 + 7/16" long 1/2" reactor pipe inside, add
        a copper washer on each end and then add the 1/2" tee, 1/2" NPT
        / 1/2" Brass Male Flare Fitting, and 1 1/2" nipple, and 1/2" Air
        Mixture Valve.) </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 5</b> ~ Assemble the other valve component
        subassemblies above. The 1/2" thick steel intake / exhaust
        adapter plate above is used only on some engines like <i>"Tecumseh"



        </i>and Overhead Valve Engines (picture 9). Add a 1/2" NPT /
        1/2" Brass Male Flare Fitting to the Intake on the adapter
        plate. </p>
      <p>Some <i>"Briggs and Stratton" </i>engines, etc usually
        already have the exhaust threaded for 1/2" pipe, but the intake
        is on the other side of the engine causing longer hose runs.
        Also a compression pipe connector or a piece of rubber hose with
        clamps will need to be connected from the engine intake to the
        Bubbler pipe. </p>
      <p>(1/2" valve (Auxillary Bubbler Valve), 1 1/2" x 1/2" nipple,
        1/2" tee, 1 1/2" x 1/2" nipple, 1/2" valve (Throttle/Bubbler
        Valve), 1/2" to 1/4" pipe reducer bushing, half of 3" x 1/4"
        nipple.) and (Muffler, 1/2" ball valve (Optional - Back pressure
        valve), 3"&nbsp; x 1/2" nipple, 1/2" tee, 1/2" to 1/4" pipe
        reducer bushing, half of 3" x 1/4" nipple, 1 1/2" nipple.) </p>

      <p><b>Step 6</b> ~ Assemble the sub-assemblies onto the reaction
        chamber above making sure to install the 12" rod inside pointed
        away from the engine. Now it's time to start on the bubbler. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 7</b> ~ Take 10 3/4" x 1/2" copper pipe and solder a
        copper 1/4" NPT - 1/2" pipe adaptor on one end and a 1/2" cap on
        the other. Drill a 1/16" hole through the cap, turn 90 degrees
        and drill through again, also one up through the bottom. Take
        the other 1/4" NPT - 1/2" adaptor and cut off the thinwall
        portion to make a pipe nut and file smooth for inside the
        Anti-Freeze jug. </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 8</b> ~ Take a 1 gallon anti-freeze jug and drill a
        1/2" hole near the top of the jug and through the cap as
        illustrated. Assemble the parts together in the following order.
        (Hose, half of 3" x 1/4" nipple, 1/4" pipe connector, short 3/4"
        nipple, bushing, hole in jug, bushing, and pipe nut.) and (
        (Optional - Back Pressure Hose), half of 3" x 1/4" nipple, 1/4"
        pipe elbow, short 3/4" nipple, bushing, hole in jug cap,
        bushing, and soldered pipe.) </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 9</b> ~ The port adapter was formed by cleaning the
        intake and exhaust ports off. Then dipping a finger in the
        exhaust port to get some soot to rub on wide masking tape taped
        over the ports. This then leaves a perfect template to then tape
        into a 1/2" thick piece of steel , then drill the mounting and
        the port holes and tap the ports with a 1/2" NPT thread tap. </p>

              larger image</a> ]</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Step 10</b> ~ Use 1/2" tubing for 10 HP or less (* 5/8"
        tubing and flare fittings for 10-20 HP) with a 1/2" tubing
        spring bender and form a loop, then remove the spring. Slide the
        flare nuts on each end, and then slide the flaring tool on so
        that the pipe sticks out about 3/16", make the flared ends.
        (Air-Conditioning supply houses carry flare fittings if you have
        difficulty finding them.) </p>
      <center>
        <p><b>Step 10: Tubing Loop ~</b> <br>
          <img src="plan10s.jpg" height="204" width="280"><br>
          <b>[ <a href="plans10.jpg" ">Click here for
              larger image</a> ]</b></p>
      </center>
      <p><b>Step 11</b> ~ Assemble all the parts onto the engine, and
        then add a 1" pipe support or 1 1/4" exhaust hangar. Fill the
        bubbler up no more than 1/4 full till you get used to using it
        (up to half full later), have someone steady the jug while
        starting the engine so it doesn't spill into the hoses. If wet
        fuel gets on the reaction rod it will stop running, you'll have
        to dry your rod and hoses out. You can hang it from the mower
        handle if you like later after it's started. </p>
      <p>You must point the exhaust end of the rod due North while
        starting the engine the first time and let it run for 30 min to
        "burn in the rod". The rod will self center magnetically by
        itself after it's running or you can weld three bumps on each
        end to center the rod (file them to fit snugly). </p>
      <p>Leave the optional back pressure valve full open, open the
        throttle about halfway and crack open the mixture valve, and
        start the engine by varying the air mixture valve. If it's very
        cold you will have to choke the engine by blocking off the air
        valve with your finger. Then slowly increase the throttle wide
        open while adjusting the air mixture valve. </p>
      <p>The engine will turn over easily if you are near the right
        setting, if it's very hard to pull, readjust the throttle or air
        valves. Make sure to paint all external pipes and connectors
        with High Temperature Grill Paint or they will rust very quickly
        afterwards. (Except copper, brass or galvanized) </p>

      </center>
      <p><b>Step 12</b> ~ For an installation on a generator, you can
        also use 90 degree elbows to keep the pipes within the cage.
        Mount the <b>GEET</b> Fuel Processor as far away as possible
        from the generator magnetic field so they do not interfere with
        each other. Also be very careful with credit cards in your
        pockets or video cameras, etc from getting too close to the
        engine while it's running so they won't be erased. </p>
      <center>

      </center>
      <p><b>Finally:</b> Experiment with the optional "Back Pressure
        Valve" to run closed loop on alternative fuels, don't use
        hydrocarbon fuels, because they will be contaminated with water
        from the exhaust (Hydrogen and Oxygen combining). Different
        materials for the inner pipe and reaction rod. Different rod
        lengths and also threaded rods, engine side of the reactor
        locations for the air mixture and/or throttle valves, exhaust
        heated copper tubing from the bubbler to the throttle valve, 5
        gallon bubblers, double bubblers for non-soluble fuels, vacuum
        gages, etc, etc, and also "alternative fuels". </p>
      <p>The beauty of this design is that it can be reconfigured in
        minutes.We plan to set up a 900 number shortly for technical
        questions, no calls for technical information will be taken at
        the main number. We also set up a newsgroup and FAQ for
        experimenters to exchange information and new discoveries. Have
        fun with it and let us know how it works out! </p>
      <p><font color="#000000"><b>Additional note:</b> It has been found
          that the 1/2" reaction rod inside the pyrolitic chamber gives
          a bit too much clearance. It is recommended to use a 9/16"
          steel rod for the reaction rod.</font> </p>
