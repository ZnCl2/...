      "Power, Correctly generated, Correctly controlled, Correctly
      applied to the rear axle."<br>
      <br>
      This slogan appeared in many of the ads for Stanley Motor
      Carriages. It truly represents the design philosophy that the
      Stanley twins applied to their cars. Steam cars unitize an
      external combustion (Rankine cycle) engine where the fuel source
      is consumed external to the engine. A steam boiler generates vast
      quantities of power for later use on demand unlike the internal
      combustion (Otto cycle) engine that must develop the needed power
      on demand. A Stanley steam engine provides four power impulses per
      crankshaft rotation similar to an 8-cylinder internal combustion
      engine. However, the power is applied uniformly for a longer
      length of the stroke than the hammer-like explosions common to
      gasoline or diesel engines. This provides the steam engine an
      advantage of more torque in a smaller package over what can be
      generated with a gasoline engine of equivalent rating.<br>
      <br>
      Early Stanleys were fueled with gasoline but later models
      incorporated a two-fuel system of gasoline for the pilot and
      kerosene for the main burner. Kerosene, provided not only more
      heat energy per unit than gasoline, it was also safer and less
      expensive. Both the Stanley pilot that operates continuously as
      well as the main burner which operates on steam demand is based on
      the simple principles of the Bunsen Burner. In the Stanley the
      heat of the fire vaporizes the liquid fuel before the fuel vapor
      is fed through an orifice, mixed with air, and burned below the
      boiler. To start a Stanley a torch is used to preheat the
      vaporizing tube and light the pilot making the Stanley Steamer one
      of the few cars difficult to steal in anything less than 20
      minutes. Fuel efficiency was roughly 10-12 miles to the gallon.<br>
      <br>
      Stanley steamers generate steam in drum shaped boilers ranging
      from 14" to 30" in diameter and from 14" to 18" in height. Similar
      to a battery the Stanley boiler stores steam energy for later use
      on demand. Unique in their design, no Stanley boiler has ever been
      documented to explode. The circular boiler walls are strengthened
      with three layers of exceptionally strong piano wire to provide
      sidewall strength unequaled in boiler designs for similar ratings.
      The use of between 500 and 1,000 fire tubes not only efficiently
      transfers heat to the water, they provide a structural strength to
      the boiler ends. Operated nominally at 600 PSIG, boilers were
      factory tested to twice operating pressure before being placed in
      a car.<br>
      <br>
      Once generated, steam is released from the boiler through a driver
      controlled throttling valve. The steam is routed to the engine
      after making a final pass through the burner fire to absorb
      150-degrees or so of additional superheat energy. Upon reaching
      the engine the steam is directed through D slide valves to one of
      the double-acting, dual cylinders. Stanley Motor Carriages, while
      rated in boiler steaming capacities of 10, 20, and 30 horsepower,
      had engines capable of developing 100 horsepower and more for
      short periods of time. The engine was mounted to the rear drive
      axle at a nominal 1.5:1 gear ratio between the crankshaft and the
      differential gear. Transmissions were not required and hence there
      was no "neutral" or clutch.<br>
      <br>
      Using ball-bearing construction throughout, the Stanley car was
      capable of speeds in excess of 75 MPH for short periods of time if
      one could locate a dirt road of the period suitable for the
      exercise. Exhaust steam from the engine is first used to preheat
      the water supply to the boiler further improving operating
      efficiency. On early cars the spent steam exited the rear of the
      car along with the combustion products of the burner. For later
      cars a standard automotive radiator served as a condenser
      returning the steam to liquid and eventual reuse in the boiler.
      Non-condensing cars required about a gallon of water per mile or
      two but later condensing cars greatly improved this efficiency to
      the neighborhood 10 miles per water gallon.<br>
      <br>
      It has been said that in order to drive a Stanley one first need
      learn to drive without watching the road! Two pumps for water, a
      pump for burner fuel, and a pump for engine lubricating oil were
      driven directly from the engines on early cars or from the rear
      axle of later cars. A steam automatic throttled the burner on and
      off to meet steam demand based on driving conditions. The need to
      manually control the water level in the boiler of early Stanley
      steamers was improved with the addition of the water automatic
      which fully automated water management. Safety devices such as low
      water burner shutdowns and pressure relief valves were standard
      fare on all cars. The need to monitor fuels, water, steam, and
      lubrication brought a number of valves and gauges to the dash and
      under the coffin-nosed hoods of the earlier cars. This resulted in
      an impressive display for the passenger but required the driver to
      be a part-time engineer.<br>
      <br>
      Early Stanleys were all wooden construction followed later by more
      streamline styles of steel frames and aluminum bodies. Early
      kerosene lamps gave way to intensely bright acetylene headlamps
      and eventually electric lighting. The Stanley twins fascination
      for speed insured that the earliest models included racers and
      roadsters while later production centered on touring cars and
      their unique Mountain Wagon that was both a bus and a truck. A
      Stanley car set a land speed record of 127 MPH in 1906 and the
      following year one was clocked at nearly 150 MPH before it crashed
      near Daytona Beach.<br>
      <br>
      In its time the Stanley was truly an impressive and prestigious
      automobile. When the Stanley twins could no longer race their cars
      interest in improving the product declined. Their self-imposed
      production limits of 1000 cars per year further hindered wide
      availability. In later years the Stanleys developed heavier cars
      but without increased horsepower soon putting them at a driving
      disadvantage as well. Today, the many Stanleys, handful of Whites,
      and few Dobles, Lanes, and others are all that remains of a
      technology that had different choices been made, might have
      relegated the internal combustion engine to today's collectors and
      museums.<br>
