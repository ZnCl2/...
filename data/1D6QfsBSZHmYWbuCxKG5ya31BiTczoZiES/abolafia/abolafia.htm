            The Andrew Abolafia Company, after more than four years of
            research on an intellectual property (Static Field
            Converter) in collaboration with the University at Buffalo,
            SUNY, produced results that suggest The Andrew Abolafia
            Company’s Static Field Converter taps a new source of
            energy. ANSYS Finite Element Analysis computer simulation
            yields the data that support that interpretation. It has
            helped enable The Static Field Converter to evolve and be
            refined in conjunction with experimentation at the
            University at Buffalo. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">The Static Field Converter (patented and
            patents pending) is an invention that converts the energy in
            a static magnetic field into usable electrical energy. The
            significance of the innovation is that the energy stored in
            some permanent magnet materials can be tapped. The magnitude
            of the energy is large enough to make a significant impact
            in reducing the U.S. addiction to oil as well as mitigate
            the destruction of the environment. Large amounts of
            electricity generated by the invention can produce large
            amounts of hydrogen. Hydrogen can be used as fuel in most
            applications that now require fossil fuels. It can also be
            used to power fuel cells. The exhaust is water.</font><br>

            Buffalo) and The Andrew Abolafia Company of Hartford, NY
            initiated research on the Abolafia Company's patented
            technology (published on this web site) at the University at
            Buffalo, SUNY, electrical engineering department. The patent
            (and patents pending) are based upon a High Temperature
            Superconductor energy conversion device termed a "Static
            Field Converter" that uses a hemispherical High Temperature
            Superconductor (HTS) element as a rotor. The invention
            converts the energy in a static magnetic field into useable
            electrical power. That energy can be significant, clean and
            abundant. We applied for and received the grant because we
            were interested in knowing the feasibility of construction
            of the device. </font></p>

            and Doctoral dissertations and several scientific papers
            were produced. An analysis was done, using a Finite Element
            Analysis program, assuming perfect diamagnetic properties

            abundant, clean source of energy that can make fossil fuels
            obsolete. The substitution of an electromagnet for the
            permanent magnet would produce data that would support
            energy being consumed from the magnetic source. The
            University at Buffalo, SUNY, does not concur with this

            invention is symmetrical (which it is) a perfectly
            diamagnetic rotor will be repelled by the same magnitude of
            torque when it exits the magnetic fields of the magnet and
            output coil as when it enters them (Magnetostatic analysis
            is appropriate). No energy input is necessary upon exiting
            the magnetic fields (the rotor, a perfect diamagnet, is
            always repelled by a magnetic field). A prime mover is only
            necessary upon entering the combined magnetic fields
            of&nbsp; the magnet and coil (the rotor, a perfect
            diamagnet, is always repelled by a magnetic field). The
            torques acting on the rotor are equal and opposite resulting
            in zero net torque on the rotor. Therefore a net power of
            zero horsepower from the prime mover (minus losses) can
            drive the rotor. The energy to generate the electric power
            from the Static Field Converter can only come from the
            magnet. If there is doubt simply substitute an
            electromagnet. An FEA computer simulation of the invention
            can corroborate our observations and conclusions at any

      <p>Abstract -- A device for the conversion of a static magnetic
        field into electrical energy comprising a permanent or
        electromagnet for establishing a stationary (static) magnetic
        field, one or more coils responsive to the magnetic field, a
        switch to periodically place a load across said responsive
        coils, and a hemispherical diamagnetic insulating element to
        periodically shield the coils from the magnetic field to produce
        electrical energy in the coils. The responsive coil may be
        cylindrical and totally surround one pole (half) of a magnetic
        dipole. The insulating element is rotatable around the magnet
        and is to alternately shield and expose the coil to the field of
        the magnet. The switch periodically opens and closes the coil
        circuit corresponding of the rotation of the shield. </p>
      <p>1. Field of the Invention </p>
      <p>The present invention relates to an apparatus for producing
        electrical energy and, more particularly, to an electrical
        device for efficiently transforming the energy of a stationary
        magnetic field into useful electrical energy for use as an
        electric generator, a dc/ac converter, dc transformer, or a high
        energy density battery through the use of the diamagnetic
        properties of superconductive materials. </p>
      <p>2. Description of the related Art </p>
      <p>Various attempts have been made to use the Meissner effect of
        superconductive materials to perform useful work. The Meissner
        effect occurs when a superconductive material is cooled to a
        temperature below its transition point. In a magnetic field, the
        lines of induction are then pushed out as if the superconductor
        exhibited perfect diamagnetism. Various devices have been
        developed which bring a superconductor in or out of the
        diamagnetic state or mechanically move a superconductive element
        in relation to a magnetic field and thereby produce or control
        mechanical, magnetic or electrical energy. </p>
      <p>For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,339,062 to Donaldson et al.,
        issued on Aug. 16, 1994, discloses a system where electrical
        energy is transferred or switched to a secondary inductive
        element (a coil) through a path which contains a high
        temperature superconductive element which is capable of holding
        off the field when in its superconductive state. The
        superconductive element is driven in and out of the diamagnetic
        state by heating with a laser pulse. When in its normal state,
        the flux passes through the element and couples the field to the
        secondary, which may be connected to a load. When in a
        superconductive state, there is no coupling. A primary coil of
        superconductive material around the secondary coil can provide
        superconductive magnetic energy storage. The primary field is
        held off by its superconductive elements in the flux path to
        opposite ends of the secondary coil. These elements may be
        driven normal by laser pulses to transfer the stored magnetic
        energy to a load. A plurality of secondary coils, each with
        associated superconductive elements, may be selectively coupled
        to the load as programmed inductive elements. Similarly, Soviet
        Union Patent No. 1736016-A1 dated May 23, 1992 to Kuroedov Yu D,
        discloses a device for storing electromagnetic energy and
        generating pulsed currents using a superconductive screen
        between the windings. </p>
      <p>Japanese Patent No. 1-24474 (A) dated Jan. 26, 1989 to Sharp
        Corp., discloses a disk 11 which is driven into rotation by the
        repulsion between a permanent magnet 15 and a layer of cooled
        superconductive material 13 at the edge of disk 11 thereby
        providing rotational force. Similarly, Japanese Patent No
        1-273369 (A) dated Nov. 1, 1989 to Fuji electric Co., Ltd., also
        uses the Meissner effect to drive a rotating disk. Japanese
        Patent No. 5-268736 (A) dated Oct. 15, 1993 to Sanyo Electric
        Co., Ltd., discloses a motor driven by a dc source without
        energy loss. A disk is floated in position by means of the
        diamagnetic properties of superconductors. Thus, the function of
        the superconductive element is to suspend the rotor and
        eliminate friction. </p>
      <p>Japanese Patent No. 1-149409 (A) dated Jun. 12, 1989 to
        Mitsubishi Electric Corp., shows a static superconducting
        generator where mechanical movement of a superconductive element
        in a magnetic field acts to generate power. Japanese Patent No.
        1-138703 (A) dated May 31, 1989 to Toshio Takayama, discloses an
        electric generator using superconductive elements as a magnetic
        shield. German Patent No. DE 708986 dated Mar. 19, 1987 to
        Priebe, K.P., shows a field effected induction unit to convert
        magnetic to electric energy uses, by use of a superconducting
        material to form a screen of the induction coil. </p>
      <p>U.S. Pat. No 4,237,391 to Schur and Abolafia, discloses an
        electrical generator comprising a stationary permanent magnet
        for establishing a magnetic field, one or more sensing coils
        responsive to the magnetic field and a diamagnetic blocking
        element moveable between the magnet and sensing coil for
        periodically interrupting the magnetic field to produce
        electrical energy in the coil. In that device, the blocking
        element is a rotatable disk interposed between a magnet and a
        coil. The rotatable disk has a semicircular portion of
        magnetically inert material to alternately block and pass the
        magnetic field to the coils upon rotation of the disk. It does
        not disclose the use of a hemispherical shielding member which
        rotates around the magnetic or electromagnetic element. </p>
      <p>Most of these patents require bringing an element in and out of
        a superconductive state and as such, require the expenditure of
        substantial energy in making this transition. This prior art
        does not disclose a system in which a superconductive shielding
        element rotates around a magnetic field to alternately expose
        and shield a responsive electrical coil from the magnet. </p>

        <p><font size="+1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</font> </p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">In the present invention, a superconductive
            magnetic insulating/blocking device in the form of a
            hemisphere, rotates inside a responsive means such as a coil
            to periodically shield and unshield the responsive means
            from a magnetic field. The invention provides for the
            efficient transformation of the energy of the magnetic field
            into electrical energy and can thus be used as a dc
            transformer, a dc to ac converter, an electric generator or
            a very high energy density battery. </font></p>

            change in magnetic flux occurs. Inefficient systems can use
            large amounts of energy to change the magnetic flux and
            produce the electromotive force while more efficient methods
            for changing the flux may be used to produce the same
            electromotive force for far less energy. Thus, the
            efficiency in the production of the emf is a product of the
            efficiency in changing the magnetic flux which passes

            of superconductive materials (i.e., the diamagnetic
            properties of a superconductive material operating at a
            temperature below its transition temperature) are exploited
            to provide a device for producing electrical energy from a
            fixed magnetic field. A superconductive element maintained
            at a temperature immediately below its transition
            temperature or colder periodically acts to shield a
            responsive means such as a coil from a magnetic field

            response to the magnetic field established by the magnetic

        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">The magnetic dipole can be any source of
            magnetic field such as a permanent or electromagnet. The
            shielding means comprises a magnetic flux shielding device
            of diamagnetic material mounted for movement between the
            magnetic dipole and the responsive means, thereby
            alternately shielding and unshielding the magnet flux from
            the magnetic dipole to the responsive means. The shielding
            means of the preferred embodiment comprises a hemisphere of
            superconductive material mounted such that it rotates around
            the field of the magnetic dipole and the magnetic field,
            thereby shielding and unshielding the responsive means from

            sphere composed of two hemispherical elements, the first of
            magnetically inert material and the second of
            superconductive material. This sphere may be mounted about a
            sphere of ferromagnetic material such as transformer steel

            may be periodically opened and closed during the operating
            cycle of the present invention thereby eliminating magnetic
            resistance to rotation of the shielding means as it rotates
            around the magnetic dipole and in and out of the responsive

        <p><font size="+1">Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the
            superconductive static field converter unit 10 of the
            present invention is shown. It is adapted to be immersed in
            a low temperature vessel, e.g. a Dewar tank or refrigeration
            unit 14 diagrammatically shown in FIG. 2 to maintain the
            unit at temperatures below the transition temperature of the
            superconductive material. The static field converter 10
            includes a circular base 11 provided with four support means
            17, 18, 19 and 20 extending upward from the circular base. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">A magnet 13 is mounted on support means 17
            and 19 by rods 15 and 16 by conventional means such as
            collars 21 and 22 or alternatively a bonding method such as
            adhesives (not shown) may be used. Support means 17-20, rods
            15 and 16, collar 21 and 22, and base 1 are made from
            non-conducting, non-ferromagnetic material such as plastic
            or graphite. Magnet 13 is shown in the diagrams as an
            electromagnet having coils 23 around a core 24 of
            transformer steel or the like. Alternatively, magnet 13 may
            be in the form of a permanent magnet. Rods 15 and 16 and
            magnet 13 are in a fixed position and do not rotate. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">The coil 12 is mounted on supports 18 and 20
            by conventional means (not shown). While responsive means 12
            is shown as single coil, it may consist of several coils
            either on the same or opposite hemispheres. The coil forming
            responsive means 12 consists of a plurality of turns of
            insulated wire and includes a set of leads 26 electrically
            connective&nbsp; to the responsive means 12 to a switch 25.
            Leads 27 for attachment to a load (not shown) are connected
            to leads 26 through switch 25. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">A shielding means 30 is rotatedly mounted on
            bearing 31 and 32 of a non-conducting, non-ferromagnetic
            material which are rotatively position around rod 15 and 16,
            respectively. The shielding means 30 consists of a
            hemisphere of superconductive material 35. It may be paired
            with a hemisphere 36 of magnetically inert material such as
            Teflon to form a complete sphere for easier rotation or may
            consist solely of the hemisphere of superconductive
            material. The field of magnet 13 is totally contained within
            shielding means 30, either by the air gap between the magnet
            13 and the shielding means 30 or by a ferromagnetic flux
            guide 45. The flux guide 45 of ferromagnetic material, such
            as transformer steel, may be positioned immediately inside
            the shielding means 30 but not in contact with it. The flux
            guide 45 completely encloses the magnet 13. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">The shield is so mounted that it is freely
            rotated on bearings 31 and 32 around rods 15 and 16 so that
            the hemisphere of superconductive material can be
            periodically placed between the magnet 13,&nbsp; its field
            and the responsive means 12, thereby shielding the
            responsive means 12. An electric motor 40 is attached to
            bearing 32 through gears 41 and 42. The electric motor, when
            activated, rotates the shielding means around magnet 13,
            alternately coming between and outside of the responsive
            means 12. While an electric motor 40 is shown, other means
            can be used to rotate the shielding means. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">In starting the apparatus, the static field
            converter 10 is inserted in the refrigeration tank 14. The
            temperature is then reduced to below the transition
            temperature of the superconductive material 35. Rotation of
            the shielding means 30 is initiated by motor 40. When the
            switch 25 is in the open position, such that responsive
            means 12 does not form a complete circuit, there is nothing
            to resist the rotation of the shielding means 30 other than
            a normal friction encountered at bearings 31 and 32 and,
            accordingly, shielding means 30 freely rotates around rods
            15 and 16 as it is driven by motor 40. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">As seen in </font><font size="+1">FIG. 3</font><font
            size="+1">, at the beginning of a cycle, the superconducting
            hemisphere is totally outside the coils forming responsive
            means 12 and switch 25 is open circuited. Since switch 25 is
            open circuited, the hemisphere 35 freely rotates up into
            coil 12 when driven by motor 40. Accordingly, it can freely
            rotate to the position diagrammatically shown in </font><font
            size="+1">FIG. 4</font><font size="+1"> where the
            superconductive shielding material is positioned totally
            within the coil from the responsive means 12. At this point
            the responsive means 12 is completely shielded from the
            magnetic field and magnetic dipole 13, as diagrammatically
            shown in </font><font size="+1">FIG. 4</font><font
            size="+1">. At this point, switch means 25 is automatically
            closed and puts a load across responsive means 12. As the
            shielding means 30 continues rotation, the magnetic field
            generated by magnet 13 is exposed to the responsive means
            12. This produces a current in the responsive means 12 and a
            corresponding magnetic field. This acts to further drive the
            superconductive portion of the shielding means 35 around
            rods 15 and 16 driving it to the position shown in </font><font
            size="+1">FIG. 5</font><font size="+1"> which corresponds to
            the initiating position of </font><font size="+1">FIG. 3</font><font
            size="+1">. Once it is in the&nbsp; position shown in </font><font
            size="+1">FIG. 5,</font><font size="+1"> switch means 25
            automatically opens the circuit once again so that the flux
            does not generate a magnetic field in coil 12 that would
            repel shielding means 30. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">While the invention has been disclosed with
            the superconductive material being in the form of a

        <p><font size="+1">It has become increasingly important in
            recent years to develop sources of electrical energy which
            operate with increased efficiency. The rapidly inflating
            cost of fuel, e.g., oil and gasoline, has made the operation
            of generators utilizing these fuels increasingly expensive.
            In addition, energy consumers have become more conscious of
            the finite limits of our world-wide supply of energy. As a
            result, it has become imperative to find more efficient
            alternatives to the conventional sources of electrical
            energy previously used. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">The present invention contemplates the use of
            a magnetic blocking device, e.g., an element which exhibits
            the property of diamagnetism, to periodically interrupt a
            magnetic field to generate electrical energy in a sensing
            device responsive to changes in the magnetic field. Blocking
            devices, such as superconductive material or plasma (ionized
            gas), both of which exhibit diamagnetism, are contemplated
            as suitable mechanisms for control of the magnetic field.
            The invention provides for efficient transformation of the
            energy of the magnetic field into an electrical output which
            can be used in place of conventional sources of electrical
            energy. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">A preferred embodiment of the present
            invention relies on principles of magnetism and cryogenics
            to achieve an electrical generator of enhanced efficiency in
            comparison with prior art devices. It is well known that, at
            temperatures near absolute zero (0.degree. K.), certain
            materials, e.g., niobium, become superconductive and offer
            little or no resistance to the flow of electrical current.
            Two (2) types of superconductive materials have been
            recognized to exist. Type I or soft superconductors, usually
            very pure metals, e.g., niobium, mercury, lead, aluminum,
            vanadium, lanthanum and technetium, when maintained near
            absolute zero, have the property of perfect diamagnetism or
            negative susceptibility. This condition is represented by
            the following equation: </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">where X represents susceptibility, M is the
            magnetic moment per unit volume (dynes-cm/cm.sup.3), and B
            is the macroscopic field intensity (gauss or flux/cm.sup.2).
            In addition, Type I superconductive materials exhibit the
            Meissner effect, i.e., the tendency of magnetic flux lines
            to bounce off rather than penetrate the material. Further,
            Type I superconductors generally exhibit a low critical
            field. Type II or hard superconductors are alloys which
            exhibit superconductivity at temperatures near absolute zero
            but do not exhibit perfect diamagnetism or the Meissner
            effect. In addition, the Type II superconductive materials
            have a higher critical field than Type I superconductors. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">With respect to the critical field property
            of superconductive materials, a Type I or soft
            superconductor generally has a critical field H.sub.c
            (transition panel) at which the material abruptly becomes a
            normal conductor. At field strengths below H.sub.c, the
            material exhibits the Meissner effect, which is essentially
            perfect diamagnetism, and exhibits no hysteresis. Type II or
            hard superconductors have a number of transition points,
            i.e., H.sub.1, H.sub.c, H.sub.2 and H.sub.3. Transition
            points H.sub.c and H.sub.3 are relatively unimportant for
            purposes of the present invention. At H.sub.1, which is very
            low (usually much lower than H.sub.c for niobium), the Type
            II material behaves as a soft superconductor. Between
            H.sub.1 and H.sub.2, the Type II material is in its vortex
            state. Although the Type II material is still
            superconductive, it is threaded by areas of normal
            conductivity. The Type II material exhibits a large amount
            of hysteresis and is not perfectly diamagnetic. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">In the preferred embodiment of the present
            invention, the diamagnetic property and Meissner effect of
            soft (Type I) superconductive material are exploited to
            provide a generator for producing electrical energy from a
            magnetic field. A soft superconductive element maintained as
            a temperature near absolute zero is employed to periodically
            interrupt the magnetic field, e.g., a uniform field
            established by a stationary permanent magnet, to generate
            electrical energy in a device, e.g., a coil, responsive to
            changes in the magnetic field. The superconductive element
            is located at position in the magnetic field slightly below
            its critical field strength H.sub.c. Since, in contrast to a
            conventional conductor, no work is required to move the soft
            superconductive material across a uniform magnetic field
            less than the critical field H.sub.c due to the absence of
            hysteresis, the apparatus operates at a high level of
            efficiency. </font></p>

            of the present invention will be shown and described in
            detail, it should be understood that various changes and
            modifications may be made without departing from the scope
            of the appended claims. The scope of the present invention
            will in no way be limited to the number of constituting
            components, the materials thereof, the shapes thereof, the
            relative arrangement thereof, etc., and are disclosed simply
            as an example of an embodiment. The features and advantages
            of the present invention are illustrated in detail in the
            accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer
            to like elements throughout the drawings. </font></p>

            description, it should be noted that, as used in this

            "a", "an" and "the" include plural referents, unless the
            context clearly dictates otherwise. In the invention a
            diamagnet 200, which may be from a superconducting material,
            acts as a blocking device that moves with respect to a gap
            115 in a core 110 having a magnetic field 130 that includes
            a coil 140, wherein the diamagnet 200 periodically shields
            and unshields the magnetic field 130 inducing an EMF
            (Electro Motive Force) generating a voltage or current 195
            from the coil 140. The invention provides for the efficient
            transformation of the energy of the magnetic field 130 into
            electrical energy from movement of the diamagnet 200 with
            respect to the gap 115 in the core 110. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">[0016] Faraday's Law states that the induced
            emf around a closed mathematical path in a magnetic field is
            equal to the rate of change of magnetic flux intercepted by
            the area within the path. Inefficient systems can use large
            amounts of energy to change the magnetic flux and produce
            the electromotive force while more efficient methods for
            changing the flux may be used to produce the same
            electromotive force for far less energy. Thus, the
            efficiency in the production of the emf is a product of the
            efficiency in changing the magnetic flux which passes
            through the closed circuit. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">[0017] The blocking of the magnetic field 130
            in the core 110 occurs when a diamagnetic object passes
            through the gap 115, where the diamagnetism is caused by the
            Meissner effect of superconductive materials (i.e., the
            diamagnetic properties of a superconductive material 200 may
            occur in specific materials when operating at a temperature
            below its transition temperature) that are exploited to
            provide a device 100 for producing electrical energy from a
            magnetic field 130. A superconductive element 200, either a
            high temperature or low temperature type, is maintained at a
            temperature immediately below its transition temperature or
            colder and periodically it acts to shield a coil 140 from a
            magnetic field established by a permanent or electromagnet
            120 causing a changing flux within the coil 140 to induce
            and EMF. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">[0018] A ferromagnetic core 110 is used that
            has suitable properties to establish a magnetic field 130
            within its body with a magnet 20. The core 110 may be a
            circular or closed geometric shape, such as a square to
            allow a continuous magnetic field to be guided. The core 110
            can also be made of electrical steel, also called lamination
            steel, silicon electrical steel, silicon steel or
            transformer steel, all of which are specialty steels
            tailored to produce certain magnetic properties, such as a
            small hysteresis area (small energy dissipation per cycle,
            or low core loss) and high permeability. The core material
            110 may be manufactured in the form of cold-rolled strips
            less than 2 nm thick called laminations that may form a core
            110 when stacked together. Laminations may be cut to their
            finished shape by a punch and die, or in smaller quantities
            may be cut by a laser. The core 110 of the instant invention
            may be shaped in any manner that allows a magnetic loop 130
            to be formed within and across the gap 115. </font></p>

        <p><font size="+1">[0019] A coil 140 induces an EMF in response
            to the magnetic field 130 that passes through a gap 115
            within the core 110 that is temporarily blocked or disrupted
            when a diamagnet 200 is interposed between the field of the
            magnet 120 and the coil 140 by passing within the gap 115 of
            the core 110. The magnetic field 130 within the core 110 can
            be from either a permanent or electromagnet 120. The
            diamagnet 200 is a magnetic flux shielding device that moves
            with respect to the gap 115 in the core 110 to alternately
            shield and unshield the magnetic flux from the coil 140. The
            core 110 as discussed above may be made of a ferro-magnetic
            material such as transformer steel or the like which would
            enclose and confine the field of the magnet dipole 120 to
            ensure that it passes through the gap 115. The invention is
            not effected by the position of the coil 140 and magnet 120,
            which may be placed anywhere upon the core 110. </font></p>

            below the transition temperature of the specific
            superconducting material used, either type I or type II or
            the Meisner effect is temporarily destroyed removing the
            properties of diamagnetism and therefore preventing blocking
            of the magnetic field 130 passing through the gap 115. One
            solution to maintain diamagnetism properties of the
            superconductor is to cool the whole superconducting
            apparatus 100 including the core 110, magnet 120 and coil
            140 along with the diamagnet 200 and all attached assemblies
            below the superconducting material's critical temperature

            superconducting generator 100 further comprise, as shown in

            diamagnet 200, said dewar 225 is dimensioned to pass through

            dimensioned to pass within the gap 115 of the core 110
            allows for cooling only of the diamagnetic material 200 and
            the remaining constituents of the generator 100 remain at a
            more economically desirable temperature above the critical
            temperature of the superconductor 200 that is desirable from

        <p><font size="+1">[0022] A superconductor placed in a weak
            external magnetic field H 130 permits the field 130 to
            penetrate the superconductor a short distance called the
            London penetration depth before it decays rapidly to zero
            (blocked), which is called the Meissner effect, and is a
            defining characteristic of superconductivity. The Meissner
            effect is different than the diamagnetism in a perfect
            electrical conductor that according to Lenz's law, when a
            changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will
            induce an electrical current in the conductor that creates
            an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an
            arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting
            magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field. </font></p>
        <font size="+1"> </font>
        <p><font size="+1">[0023] The Meissner effect is distinct from
            this because a superconductor expels all magnetic fields,
            not just those that are changing. Suppose we have a material
            in its normal state, containing a constant internal magnetic
            field that when the material is cooled below the critical
            temperature (Tc), we would observe the abrupt expulsion of
            the internal magnetic field, which we would not expect based
            on Lenz's law. </font></p>
        <p><font size="+1">[0024] The Meissner effect breaks down when
            the applied magnetic field 130 is too large and thus ceases
            to be able to function as a diamagnet. Type I
            superconductors may be abruptly destroyed
            (superconductivity) when the strength of the applied field
            rises above a critical value Hc. Depending on the defects
            and flux pinning of the sample, one may obtain an
            intermediate state consisting of regions of normal material
            carrying a magnetic field mixed with regions of
            superconducting material containing no field. In Type II
            superconductors, raising the applied field past a critical
            value H.sub.c1 leads to a mixed state in which an increasing
            amount of magnetic flux penetrates the material, but there
            remains no resistance to the flow of electrical current as
            long as the current is not too large. At a second critical
            field strength Hc2, superconductivity is destroyed because
            the mixed state is actually caused by vortices in the
            electronic superfluid, sometimes called fluxons because the
            flux carried by these vortices is quantized. Therefore, the
            magnetic field 130 in the core 110 of the generator 100 must
            use a magnetic source 120 weaker than Hc with Type 1
            superconductors and weaker than H.sub.c1 for Type 2
            superconductors. </font></p>
