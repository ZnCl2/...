          </b></big></big>Brown's Gas (BG) (aka HHO and other brand
      names) has absolutely amazing and, up until recently, totally
      unknown health applications.<br>
      <br>
      I'm not qualified (government certified) to 'prove' BG can improve
      health... but I am able to pass on reports that are given to me by
      my customers (with their permission), my own testimonials and
      publicly available documentation. <br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      I think you'll quickly see ways BG can enhance YOUR health :<br>
      <br>
      This page will include the support and documentary Resources
      mentioned in (and for) the Quick and Dirty BG for Health videos.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      We will be putting together a comprehensive professional
      documentary video that will include the full details that these
      simple Q&amp;D videos allude to. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      The Q&amp;D videos are our short term solution to getting a kernel
      of this knowledge out there NOW, so the public can start to
      benefit; and to make sure there is SOMETHING out there in case we
      get suppressed (Vested Interest has lots of reason to suppress us,
      so it could happen at any time and we'll just be gone...)<br>

      <b>Video 1 </b><b>-- Q&amp;D BG for Health ~ Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      This first video pretty much speaks for itself and doesn't refer
      to any specific documentation.<br>
      <br>
      The main takeaways are:<br>
      <br>
      1. The disclaimer we legally must make.<br>
      <br>
      2. We really want you to have a practical taste of this
      information, just in case we are suppressed before we can make the
      full comprehensive documentary version.<br>
      <br>
      We feel that this application of BG is vital to the general health
      of the public... and it's something that can be built and used by
      nearly anyone, in their own home.<br>
      <br>
      While we do sell an ER50 kit (when available), we also sell plans
      so that you can build your own electrolyzer. Our projects are
      patent free, so you can build as many as you like to help your
      family, friends and/or to start a business.<br>
      <br>
      ER50 Assembly instructions are in the ER50 Resources and full
      electrolyzer plans are in the Brown's Gas Book 2 (both available
      as electronic downloads)<br>
      <br>
      3. You can subscribe to our eNews, if you aren't already
      subscribed, by clicking the 'subscribe' link in the sidebar. You
      can also just as easily unsubscribe at any time. We keep all
      customer information private, on state of art secure servers. <br>

      <b>Video 2&nbsp; </b><b>-- Q&amp;D BG for Health ~ Pain Relief</b><br>
      <br>
      The main takeaways :<br>
      <br>
      1. Human bodies are mostly hydrogen by volume.<br>
      <br>
      2. Painful inflammation, in muscles and tendons, is often caused
      by de-hydration. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      3. Brown's Gas, applied to the skin, is absorbed and hydrates the
      body, reducing or eliminating inflammation. The pain disappears
      and stays gone.<br>
      <br>
      4. Here's a link to a Patent that discusses using Brown's Gas for
      Health<br>
      <br>
      Note that the patent is 'legal' but not actually valid because
      there is nothing in it that isn't in the public domain and/or
      known to people 'skilled in the art'.<br>
      <br>
      Lots of people get patents, just to say it's 'patented' or 'we
      have the patent'. The patent offices are only a place to record
      documents, so you can use their 'certification' to fight for your
      'innovation' rights. When the information was already known
      publicly to people 'skilled in the art' the patent is actually
      worthless and is just being used for prestige or to defraud
      investors.<br>
      <br>
      Still, this patent shows much research and experimentation that's
      'officially' been done... Using Brown's Gas to treat dozens of
      diseases. These treatments can be done at home with a simple
      tabletop electrolyzer like the ER50, no need to spend thousands of
      dollars for a large machine.<br>
      <br>
      5. Note: We have discovered that treatment is more effective if
      you apply BG several times (like three or four) during the day for
      a few minutes (like ten) per application; another reason it's
      better if you have a personal machine.<br>
      <br>
      6. ER50 kits (and fully assembled chambers) are now available
      here.<br>

      <b>Video 3 </b><b>-- Q&amp;D BG for Health ~ Enhancing Water
        (click)</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The main takeaways :<br>
      <br>
      1. BG contains 6 main constituents, H, O, H2, O2, H2O (as water
      vapor) and H2O (as Electrically Expanded Water (ExW)).&nbsp; My
      theory is that ExW is the 'glue' that binds hydrogen and oxygen
      into the magnecules discovered by Santilli. ExW is still
      scientifically controversial.&nbsp; NONE of the constituents of
      pure BG are poisonous. They are the basic building blocks of
      life...<br>
      <br>
      Water absorbs some hydrogen and oxygen (the gasses stay in the
      water). These gasses help modify the water.&nbsp; Water doesn't
      absorb much hydrogen (0.0016 g/L).&nbsp; Water loves to absorb
      oxygen (0.04 g/L) and when the gasses have an electrical charge
      ORP happens.<br>
      <br>
      2. BG turns 7 pH water into 8+ pH water. This is because of the
      additional hydrogen ions.... What is pH? ... Ph scale ...
      Information about healthy pH ... Making your own pH indicator.
      &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      3. What is ORP? [ Oxidaton-Reduction Potential ] In short, you
      want lots of OH- molecules (makes water that measures alkaline pH)
      and that's what BG does to water when it bubbles through it. <br>
      <br>
      4. Wounds that are treated with the BG bubbled water heal much
      faster.<br>
      <br>
      5. Drinking the BG bubbled water seems to help maintain health.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, we should drink adequate PURE (no poisons like chlorine
      or fluoride and no other contaminates) water everyday anyway; many
      people are chronically dehydrated and less healthy than they could
      be because of it.<br>
      <br>
      ER50 kits (like you see in the videos) are now available :<br>

        Video 4&nbsp; </b><b>-- Q&amp;D BG for Health ~ Energizing
        Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The main takeaways:<br>
      <br>
      1. When you bubble BG through water, the water seems to absorb an
      'electrical' energy that is proving to be very beneficial to
      life.&nbsp; People (I'm speaking for myself) plants and animals
      that drink the water are more energetic.<br>
      <br>
      2. BG electrically enhanced water only holds the 'charge' for a
      few hours.&nbsp; Of course the water can be 're-charged' as often
      as you like.<br>
      <br>
      3. Here is a video that shows the BG is an ionized gas that can
      generate an electrical potential.<br>
      <br>
      4. Here is a PDF of Laura Jacob's plant experiment<b>...</b> The
      other 'plant projects' documentaries will be included in the
      Resources once the full professional video is done.<br>
      <br>
      5. Here is a link to my (needs to be updated) webpage (click) that
      explains my 1991 discovery that Brown's Gas contains an
      'electrically expanded' form of water (ExW); so it is still H2O
      but is NOT steam or water vapor, it will not condense to water if
      you cool it and it IS flammable.&nbsp; BG also contains monatomic
      (about 3%) and diatomic hydrogen and oxygen.&nbsp; BG is mostly
      diatomic and (for safety reasons) should be treated as an
      explosive stoichiometric mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. <br>
      <br>

      <b>Video 5 </b><b>-- Q&amp;D BG for Health ~ Programming Water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The main takeaways:<br>
      <br>
      1. BG therapy fits nicely into homeopathy knowledge.&nbsp; One
      homeopathic technique is to 'program' water with information that
      the body needs/uses to assist healing.&nbsp; This is what I'm
      talking about with the 'law of similars' (aka 'law of like cures
      like') and the 'law of infinsmalls' (aka 'law of minimum
      dose').&nbsp; Here's an overview of how it works.<br>
      <br>
      Note: Doctors often 'forget' that they were taught that ALL bodies
      heal themselves.&nbsp; Our bodies are made of 'stabilized energy'
      and usually only need a 'program' (something to properly direct
      energy) and the energy itself, to assist healing.<br>
      <br>
      2. Both water and BG are 'programmable' and both will accept and
      carry 'life energy', making them very powerful 'health'
      tools.&nbsp; I think BG gives a special type of healthy 'life
      energy' to water.<b>..<br>

      hydrogen for health :<br>

      In 'The Memory of Water', by Michel Schiff ISBN 0-7225-3534-1 ...
      the chemical information of a molecule can travel through water
      ... P12<br>
      <br>
      3. In fact (and you'll see more about this in the professional
      video) if conditions are met, water can 'transmute' into nearly
      any other material.&nbsp; One interesting fact that medical
      science usually doesn't publicize, because they don't know 'why',
      is that the body does a LOT of transmutation.&nbsp; I'm thinking
      BG would help that process.<br>
      <br>
      4. We are now making upgrade instructions so that you can SAFELY
      ignite the BG.&nbsp; It's been on our 'to do' list since 2005, but
      just haven't taken the time to write up the instructions.&nbsp;
      These instructions will be made available, for free, to anyone who
      buys our ER50 WaterTorch Kit now. <br>
      <br>
      5. There are several advantages to being able to ignite the
      BG.&nbsp; First of course, are all the things you can do with a
      micro-torch fueled by water (like welding, soldering and brazing)
      but the most important (for health) is that you can make 'new
      water'.&nbsp; New water is what I call water thats had its memory
      erased; which allows you to program it with anything you
      want.&nbsp; We'll cover the amazing aspects of new water in the
      professionally made video... but in the meantime, think
      philosopher's stone.<br>

      When a material scientist, like Patrick Flanigan, looks at water,
      he sees STRUCTURE, and says "Water has different structures, and
      based on those structures, it can affect the body in a variety of
      different ways."<br>
      <br>
      Structured water is like a liquid crystal.&nbsp; The water in your
      body is structured as well. When these two structures align...
      Magic happens.<br>

      Back in August, Clay Graner brought this article at Natural News
      to our attention, touching on the health benefits of hydrogen.
      This is a tangential application of hydroxy gas.<br>
      <br>
      Cheaply produced, homemade molecular hydrogen (H2) delivery found
      highly effective at treating illnesses <br>
      <br>
      Here's an excerpt of the story:<br>
      <br>
      Over 200 papers have been published on the ability of molecular
      hydrogen to treat over 60 disease models including cancer,
      metabolic syndrome, neurodegeneration, radiation exposure and
      aging. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Therapeutic H2 treatment restores mitochondrial function </b><br>
      <br>
      Mitochondria in multicellular life were given the role of reducing
      the toxic gas oxygen. Their membranes contain an electrochemical
      gradient controlling energy production from metabolites of food
      and the release of free radicals. The top ten causes of morbidity
      and mortality according to the CDC and WHO involve untreated
      inflammation and mitochondrial damage. Table 1 depicts the disease
      models that H2 has been shown to treat: <br>

        </b><br>
      </a><br>
      Many studies are viewed in retrospect by these findings <br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen can also be generated from intestinal bacteria by the
      consumption of several alpha-glucosidase inhibiting herbs, sugar,
      dietary fiber, and the anti-diabetic drugs Acarbose and Lactulose,
      which prolong fermentation time and fuel the process. <br>
      <br>
      Many research groups are discovering mechanisms for the observed
      efficacy of hydrogen treatment and one group states:<br>
      <br>
      "Hydrogen treatment down-regulated the expression of miR-9 and
      miR-21, which further inhibited the activation of NF-kB, and the
      down-regulation of Myd88 inhibited the expression of miR-21, which
      activated PDCD4 to inhibit the NF-kB-induced release of
      inflammatory cytokines. The down-regulation of miR-199 after
      hydrogen treatment inhibited the activation of IKKs to inhibit
      NF-kB, and the potential regulatory pathway is summarized in
      Figure 4, in which the activity of neutralizing -OH and scavenging
      ONNO- was also described. The different regulating mechanisms of
      hydrogen gas were not exclusive but associated with each other,
      such as promoting cell survival, altering gene expression, and
      regulating signaling-pathway activity. In summary, hydrogen
      treatment can inhibit inflammation through the regulation of
      miRNAs and signal-modulating activities, which suggests that
      hydrogen may act as a novel gas signaling molecule." <br>

      It may also be called Electrolyzed Reduced Water (ERW water) and

      the intestine. <br>
      <br>
      H2 can be delivered in icecubes, in the air, drank, bathed in,
      injected and given in saline eyedrops. It's the most abundant
      molecule in the universe and evolved to serve life in the ocean in
      the form of hydrogenases in oceanic bacteria and so intrinsically
      has a role like melatonin in managing the stress on cells by
      atmospheric gases. Generation is cheap, and chlorine should be
      avoided in the water and sodium sources used. Many devices
      overcome the potential problems in production and storage and are
      sold openly to the public. <br>

        <b>NEW USE OF BROWN'S GAS AND FEEDING APPARATUS OF THE BROWN'S
          GAS</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Inventor(s): &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;KANG SONG DOUG, et al.<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      Provided is a new use of Brown's gas, more particularly, to the
      use of Brown's gas for the treatment of diseases in mammals and a
      Brown's gas supply apparatus therefor. It is based on the
      assumption that the Brown's gas is a medium capable of directly
      supplying moisture (special form of water according to the third
      theory of Brown's gas) to many regions of the body via skin, etc.
      Various effects of the Brown's gas on the body have been
      demonstrated. In particular, provided is a new use of the Brown's
      gas for treatment or alleviation of the symptoms of a lesion in a
      lesional tissue, cell, or organ of a mammal. Provided is also a
      simple and inexpensive Brown's gas supply apparatus for supplying
      pure Brown's gas suitable to be applied to the human body.'<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0001] The present invention relates to a new use of Brown's gas,
      and more particularly, to the use of Brown's gas for the treatment
      of diseases in mammals and a Brown's gas supply apparatus
      therefor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND ART</b><br>
      <br>
      [0002] Brown's gas is a mixed gas of hydrogen and oxygen (2:1,
      v/v) created by electrolysis of water. It is thought that Brown's
      gas also contains considerable water vapor. Generally,
      electrolysis of water produces a hydrogen gas at cathode and an
      oxygen gas at anode. These gases are captured at the same time
      without being separated, and the captured mixed gas is generally
      known as “Brown's gas”. Brown's gas has several characteristic
      properties, unlike general gases. The most noticeable property of
      Brown's gas is implosion upon ignition. For this reason, Brown's
      gas is known to have ultra-high temperature to an extent that can
      sublimate tungsten with the highest melting point of all metals.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] According to the classic theory (the first theory), Brown's
      gas is a simple mixed gas of hydrogen and oxygen generated by
      electrolysis of water, which cannot explain the special
      characteristics of Brown's gas. Accordingly, new theories about
      the entity of Brown's gas have been recently introduced.
      Experimental results acquired to date show that a mixture of
      oxygen and hydrogen generated by a Brown's gas generator has
      remarkably larger reactivity than an equal amount of another
      mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. The second theory about Brown's
      gas is that Brown's gas is a mixture of diatomic hydrogen/oxygen
      and monatomic hydrogen/oxygen [Brown's Gas Book One;
      www.watertorch.com]. The recently published third theory is that
      electrolysis of water produces third gas bubbles between a cathode
      and an anode, in addition to a molecular hydrogen gas at the
      cathode and a molecular oxygen gas at the anode. According to the
      third theory, it is thought that Brown's gas is a special water
      gas in which the hydrogen gas, the oxygen gas, and the third gas
      bubbles are mixed, i.e., Brown's gas is not steam but
      “electrically expanded water” [Brown's Gas Book Two;
      www.watertorch.com].<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The characteristics of Brown's gas disclosed to date are as
      follows. Brown's gas contains high energy, and in particular,
      generates cold flame with tremendous energy potential upon
      ignition. Brown's gas is a special and highly efficient medium
      that transmits electrical energy to the atomic structure of a
      material and exhibits special effects that are often unobtainable
      by any other means. Brown's gas is essentially easy to handle, is
      odorless, and is harmless to the human body even when inhaled.
      Further, Brown's gas is lighter than air, diffuses rapidly in air,
      and has a high initial flammability limit, which makes it safer
      than other combustible gases. Due to these characteristics,
      Brown's gas has received interest as a next generation fuel, in
      particular, as a clean fuel that produces no pollutants, unlike a
      waste fuel producing pollutants, and thus, research into utility
      of Brown's gas as a fuel has been actively conducted.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The present inventor has approached Brown's gas from a
      different standpoint from studies conducted to date, and thus, the
      present invention provides a new use of Brown's gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Water is a material occupying the largest proportion of the
      human body among components constituting the human body and
      occupies about 50-60% by weight of the human body. The proportion
      of water in the human body significantly varies according to age
      and sex. Newborn male babies have about 80% water with females
      over the age of 60 having about 45% water. Generally, the
      proportion of water in the weight of males is larger than that of
      females. The proportion of water in the human body decreases with
      age regardless of sex. However, it is noted that even in a healthy
      person, the amount of water in the body decreases as aging
      continues. This shows that water is associated with human aging.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Water makes up body fluids and is an important component in
      various tissues and organs as well. The action of water in the
      human body currently known is as follows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0008] (A) Transfer System</b><br>
      <br>
      [0009] Blood, which is 83% water, functions as a transfer system
      in the human body and transports nutrients, hormones, enzymes,
      oxygen, and other vital material to cells. Blood also carries
      waste matters to internal organs such as the kidneys or lungs to
      discharge the waste matters from the human body. Foods are
      digested to the simplest nutrients in the stomach and intestines,
      absorbed in blood and lymph, and then transported to cells.
      Inhaled oxygen by breathing is absorbed in blood by gas exchange
      in the lungs and transported to cells. Water constitutes most of
      blood and lymph which are transport systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0010] (B) Main Component of Various Secretions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0011] Various secretions are produced in the human body to
      facilitate the metabolic action of the human body. These
      secretions are mainly made up of water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0012] (C) Lubricant</b><br>
      <br>
      [0013] Abundant water is contained in fluids surrounding various
      internal organs of the human body or mucous linings of the organs.
      These fluids or mucous linings reduce friction in the human body
      to promote the movements of internal organs. Further, joints are
      filled with synovial fluid containing a large volume of water.
      Therefore, when bones of the joints move, the synovial fluid
      reduces friction between the bones of the joints.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0014] (D) Digestion</b><br>
      <br>
      [0015] Water is a main component of viscous liquid of the
      digestive tract or saliva. The viscous liquid of the digestive
      tract and saliva assist digestion of foods and the digested foods
      are transported to tissues through the digestive tract.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0016] (E) Body Temperature Regulation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0017] Human beings are warm-blooded animals and thus must
      maintain an almost constant body temperature. Water plays a very
      important role in keeping the human body at a constant
      temperature. That is, it is known that water is a good thermal
      conductor and the specific heat of water is the highest of all
      solids and liquids except ammonia (liquid). The phrase “a
      substance has a high specific heat” indicates that the substance
      undergoes a smaller increase in temperature than another substance
      when the same amount of heat is added. Due to the high specific
      heat of water, the temperature of the human body is not easily
      increased even when much heat is given off from the human body by
      exercise, or the like. Further, when heat is given off from the
      human body, the human body promotes sweat secretion to prevent the
      increase of its body temperature. This is possible because the
      evaporation of sweat cools the human body by removing latent heat.
      Since the evaporation latent heat of water is the highest of all
      substances, a body temperature regulation by cooling of the human
      body can be efficiently achieved.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0018] (F) Chemical Reaction in the Human Body</b><br>
      <br>
      [0019] Various types of chemical reactions occur in tissues and
      cells of the human body. Water assists the occurrence of these
      chemical reactions or directly participates in these chemical
      reactions. For example, it is known that water plays a very
      important role in digestion of proteins and carbohydrates and
      assists the synthesis of hormones and enzymes that regulate
      chemical reactions occurring in the human body. In this regard,
      the absence of water cannot trigger most chemical reactions in the
      human body, thereby losing life-sustaining functions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0020] (G) Removal of Waste Matters</b><br>
      <br>
      [0021] Waste matters are produced in the human body by various
      routes. Water takes a major role in discharge of waste matters
      thus produced out of the body via the kidneys and the large
      intestine. Waste matters are also discharged out from the body
      through sweat or air to be exhaled during breathing.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0022] (H) Protection</b><br>
      <br>
      [0023] Water is elastic, and thus, serves to cushion impact
      applied to the body to decrease damage to the internal organs or
      tissues of the body. It is known that central nervous tissues are
      immersed in and protected by the cerebral spinal fluid.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0024] (I) Physiological Actions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0025] Currently recognized physiological actions of water in the
      human body are as follows.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] (a) Water assists the body in detoxification, resulting in
      a reduced burden on the liver and kidneys.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] (b) Water eliminates the viscosity of blood and prevents
      the stroke.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] (c) Water intake is effective for treatment and prevention
      of constipation.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] (d) Water increases the immunity of the nasal mucous
      membrane and thus prevents cold. “Sufficient water intake” is
      typically prescribed to relieve medical conditions such as high
      fever, cold, and diarrhea. Water has been regarded as a good
      anti-cold strategy since it makes the bronchial mucous membrane
      wet and relieves high fever and inflammation. Also, in modern
      medical science, many doctors encourage cold patients to drink
      sufficient water frequently.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] (e) Sufficient water intake before drinking liquor can
      reduce the burden on the liver and the degree of headache after
      overdrinking.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] (f) Water intake is effective for prevention or relief of
      nephritis. It is well known that sufficient water intake is a
      strategy effective in relieving the symptoms of urinary tract
      infection such as nephritis, urethritis, and cystitis, and
      preventing the recurrence of the urinary tract infection. A recent
      report shows that a person drinking more than 2.5 quarters of
      water per day (1 quarter is about 0.946 liters) has less
      likelihood of developing cystitis, relative to a person drinking
      half of the more than 2.5 quarters of water per day.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] (g) Water intake is effective in prevention of colon
      cancer. It is reported that a person drinking more than five
      glasses of water per day has a 45% less likelihood of developing
      colon cancer, relative to a person drinking less than two glasses
      of water per day.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] (h) Water intake is effective in preventing the formation
      of calculi. Sufficient water intake can prevent new calculus
      formation in a person with renal calculi.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] (i) Water dilutes toxic substances. Generally, it is known
      that damage caused by a toxic substance, including a carcinogenic
      substance, is mainly proportional to the concentration of the
      toxic substance, rather than the total amount. In this regard,

      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Technical Problem</b><br>
      <br>
      [0039] The present invention provides an effect of Brown's gas on
      the human body, i.e., a new use of Brown's gas, and is based on
      the following three facts.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] First, according to the facts disclosed to date, Brown's
      gas is harmless to the human body.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] Second, according to the recently published third theory,
      Brown's gas is a special “water gas”, i.e., “electrically expanded
      water”, which is an activated (high energy) form of water.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Third, water occupies about 50-60% by weight of the human
      body and is a material occupying the largest proportion of the
      human body among components constituting the human body. Water
      plays many important roles in the body, including many
      physiological functions.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Based on these facts, the present inventor assumed that
      Brown's gas is a medium capable of directly supplying moisture
      (special form of water according to the third theory of Brown's
      gas) to many regions of the body via skin, etc, and deduced that
      the Brown's gas can be effectively used for treatment of many
      diseases in the body. Thus, the present inventor completed the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In the present invention, many effects of Brown's gas on
      the body will be provided. It is thought that most of these
      effects are directly or indirectly associated with the action and
      efficacy of water in the body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Technical Solution</b><br>
      <br>
      [0045] In detail, the present invention provides a new use of
      Brown's gas for the treatment or alleviation of the symptoms on a
      lesional tissue, cell, or organ of a mammal.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The Brown's gas may be locally sprayed on the lesional
      tissue, cell, or organ, its related region, or its adjacent skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] At this time, the lesion may be selected from the group
      consisting of myalgia, arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, disc,
      infectious inflammation, non-infectious inflammation, allergy,
      rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, myasthenia, neuralgia, headache,
      bacterial ocular disease such as sty, viral ocular disease such as
      epidemic keratoconjunctivitis, ocular disease such as glaucoma and
      cataract, Parkinson's disease, gout, panic disorder, diabetic
      peripheral neuropathy, blood circulation dysfunction,
      cardiovascular disease such as stricture of the heart, and various
      pain such as toothache and menstrual pain.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] The present invention also provides a use of Brown's gas
      for the treatment of a disease associated with moisture deficiency
      or dehydration in a lesion tissue, cell, or organ of a mammal. At
      this time, Brown's gas may be locally sprayed on the lesion
      tissue, cell, or organ, its related region, or its adjacent skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] The present invention also provides a use of Brown's gas
      for moisture supply to a mammalian skin. At this time, Brown's gas
      may be locally sprayed on the skin.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The present invention also provides a Brown's gas supply
      apparatus for the above-described new use of Brown's gas, i.e., an
      apparatus for supplying purified Brown's gas suitable for direct
      spraying on mammals, including human beings.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A commercially available Brown's gas generator uses sodium
      hydroxide (NaOH) or potassium hydroxide (KOH) as a catalyst to
      facilitate the generation of oxygen and hydrogen by electrolysis
      of water. Therefore, Brown's gas generated by a conventional
      Brown's gas generator contains impurities such as NaOH and KOH, in
      addition to pure Brown's gas, which is not suitable for
      therapeutic use in mammals.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Therefore, the present invention provides a relatively
      simple and inexpensive apparatus for supplying purified Brown's
      gas suitable for use in the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] To this end, in the present invention, there is provided a
      Brown's gas supply apparatus, including: a Brown's gas generator
      for generating Brown's gas by electrolysis of water; at least one
      airtight gas-trapping tank for allowing the Brown's gas to pass
      through water and trapping pure Brown's gas; and a spraying nozzle
      connected to the gas-trapping tank to spray the trapped Brown's
      gas on a lesional region of a mammal.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Preferably, the Brown's gas supply apparatus comprises
      serially connected two gas-trapping tanks, wherein the generated
      Brown's gas passes through water in a gas-trapping tank and is
      primarily trapped, and wherein the primarily trapped Brown's gas
      passes through water in the other gas-trapping tank and is
      secondarily trapped.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In addition, an elastic cap is detachably installed to an
      end of the spraying nozzle to prevent inflow of ambient air.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the
      gas-trapping tank has a hermetically sealed tube structure in
      which water is contained in a tube, wherein a porous partition is
      horizontally installed in a lower part of the tube in such a way
      to be spaced predetermined distance apart from the bottom of the
      tube so that the Brown's gas and the water can pass through the
      porous partition, wherein an upper surface of the gas-trapping
      tank is formed with a gas injection pipe extended downward to
      below the porous partition to supply the Brown's gas to a lower
      part of the tube; a gas discharge port for discharging the trapped
      Brown's gas; and a water injection port for water supply, and
      wherein the Brown's gas, injected into the water below the porous
      partition via the gas injection pipe, passes through the porous
      partition and the water and is trapped in an upper part of the
      tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In another embodiment of the present invention, the
      gas-trapping tank has a hermetically sealed tube structure in
      which water is contained in a tube, wherein an upper surface of
      the gas-trapping tank is formed with a gas injection pipe extended
      downward to supply the Brown's gas to a lower part of the tube, a
      gas discharge port for discharging the trapped Brown's gas, and a
      water injection port for water supply, and wherein the Brown's
      gas, injected into the water in the lower part of the tube via the
      gas injection pipe, passes through the water and is trapped in an
      upper part of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In still another embodiment of the present invention, the
      gas-trapping tank has a hermetically sealed dual tube structure
      and comprises an inner tube, an outer tube separated from a
      sidewall and bottom of the inner tube by a predetermined distance,
      and a common upper plate covering the inner tube and the outer
      tube, the inner tube and the outer tube containing water, wherein
      the bottom of the inner tube is formed with a plurality of
      through-holes through which the Brown's gas and the water can
      pass, wherein the upper plate is formed with a gas injection pipe
      extended downward to supply the Brown's gas generated in the
      Brown's gas generator to water in the outer tube; a gas discharge
      port for discharging the trapped Brown's gas, and a water
      injection port for water supply, and wherein the Brown's gas,
      injected into the water in the outer tube via the gas injection
      pipe, passes through the water in the inner tube via the
      through-holes, and is trapped in an upper part of the inner tube.<br>

      </b><b>BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0064] Hereinafter, embodiments of the present invention will be
      described in detail with reference to the attached drawings. The
      present invention is not restricted to the following embodiments,
      and many variations are possible within the spirit and scope of
      the present invention. The embodiments of the present invention
      are provided in order to more completely explain the present
      invention to anyone skilled in the art.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] Efficacies of Brown's gas currently found by the present
      inventor are as follows.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0066] 1. Elimination or Alleviation of Myalgia</b><br>
      <br>
      [0067] When Brown's gas was sprayed on the region of the body
      where myalgia, frozen shoulder, muscular stiffness such as neck
      stiffness, or bruises is located, alleviation or elimination of
      pain by rapid relaxation of a muscle was observed. Further, a
      bruise at a bruised region disappeared and normal skin color was
      regained.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] These phenomena can be explained as follows: sprayed
      Brown's gas is absorbed in skin and hydrates the muscle where pain
      occurs to recover the tissues of the muscle, resulting in
      elimination of the pain by relaxation of the muscle.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0069] 2. Alleviation of Symptoms and Pain of Rheumatoid
        Arthritis, Degenerative Arthritis, etc</b><br>
      <br>
      [0070] When Brown's gas was sprayed onto the lesional regions of
      patients who suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, knee arthralgia,
      wrist arthralgia, and knuckle arthralgia, the patients felt less
      pain and that the joints were relaxed. Acute pain was alleviated
      by spraying occurred only once. Some patients underwent pain
      alleviation so that they had a normal life. These therapeutic
      effects continued for a considerably extended period of time.
      Furthermore, in patients who suffered from an aftereffect of knee
      joint surgery (cruciate ligament implant surgery, cartilage
      implant surgery), recovery of joint function, together with pain
      alleviation, was observed. Improvement in the symptoms of Achilles
      myositis was also observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] Like for myalgia, these phenomena can be explained as
      follows: Brown's gas is absorbed through skin and supplies
      moisture to joint synovial fluid to lubricate joints. There is
      another interpretation based on the second theory of Brown's gas
      that monatomic hydrogen contained in Brown's gas serves as active
      hydrogen in the body. That is, rheumatoid arthritis is known to be
      an autoimmune disease that spontaneously creates an inflammatory
      substance that attacks joint synovium, causing joint inflammation.
      High level of the inflammatory substance intensifies pain, whereas
      low level of the inflammatory substance alleviates pain. Even
      though the creation of the inflammatory substance is attributed to
      a genetic factor and an environmental factor, the gene of interest
      has not been identified. However, it is known that active oxygen
      plays an important role in the creation of the inflammatory
      substance. A serum test shows a remarkably reduced level of an
      antioxidative ingredient in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis,
      relative to a normal person. In this respect, many attempts have
      been made to use an antioxidant as an anti-inflammatory agent.
      Thus, it is thought that active hydrogen, known to serve as an
      antagonist to active oxygen in the body, alleviates rheumatoid
      arthritis. Further, the spraying of Brown's gas improved the node
      and inflammation by gout, which can also be explained similarly to
      that described above.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0072] 3. Alleviation of the Symptoms of Intervertebral Disc</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0073] Like for arthritis, patients with intervertebral disc
      experienced alleviation of pain and symptoms after spraying
      Brown's gas on a lesional region. The alleviation of pain and
      symptoms is attributed to hydration of the lesional tissue of
      intervertebral disc by Brown's gas absorbed through skin.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0074] 4. Elimination or Alleviation of Headache</b><br>
      <br>
      [0075] When Brown's gas was sprayed on the necks of patients with
      severe headache, including chronic headache, migraine, and acute
      headache by impact applied to the cervical vertebrae in car
      accident, the patients had a clear head and rapid alleviation or
      elimination of headaches. Further, the therapeutic effect
      continued over a prolonged period of time (six months, at present)
      after therapy with Brown's gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] These phenomena can be explained as follows: sprayed
      Brown's gas is absorbed in neck skin and hydrates neck muscles.
      Therefore, muscle tissues are relaxed and thus contracted blood
      vessels are restored to normal. As a result, blood flow increases
      and sufficient oxygen supply to the brain is achieved, resulting
      in disappearance of headache.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0077] 5. Elimination of Inflammation in Wounded Region and
        Body Region Affected by Bacterial Inflammation, or Rapid
        Recovery of the Affected Regions</b><br>
      <br>
      [0078] When Brown's gas was directly sprayed on a wounded region
      of the body, it was observed that the wound was rapidly cured.
      Furthermore, when Brown's gas was sprayed on the body region
      affected by bacterial inflammation such as laryngitis, otitis
      media, and sinus infections (ozena), alleviation or rapid
      elimination of inflammation was observed. This might be possible
      because Brown's gas destructs or prevents the growth of anaerobic
      microorganism in the wounded region and various microorganisms in
      the body region affected by inflammation, and at the same time,
      helps cell restoration in the wounded region and the body region
      affected by inflammation. The destruction and prevention of the
      growth of microorganisms can be sufficiently explained assuming
      that Brown's gas contains large amounts of reactive oxygen, in
      particular monatomic and diatomic oxygen based on the second
      theory of Brown's gas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0079] 6. Prevention of Inflammatory and Allergic Cutaneous
        Reaction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0080] When Brown's gas was sprayed on the skin where allergic
      reaction occurred, complete disappearance of allergy symptoms was
      observed. Furthermore, when Brown's gas was sprayed on the skin
      where non-infectious inflammatory reaction occurred, remarkable
      improvement of inflammation was observed by spraying occurred only
      once. It was also observed that the spraying of Brown's gas is
      effective for the treatment of eye's movement relating nerve
      disorder due to inflammation in nerve cells at the back part of
      the head. These therapeutic effects are attributed to cell
      restoration by hydration of target skin cells by Brown's gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] It is expected that the effect of Brown's gas on skin can
      be extended to skin tissue restoration, moisturizing, anti-aging,
      etc. Therefore, Brown's gas can also be used as a
      skin-moisturizing agent for cosmetic purpose.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0082] 7. Pain Removal or Alleviation</b><br>
      <br>
      [0083] When Brown's gas was applied to patients with sciatica,
      pain in right pelvis, pain by the bone fracture of ankle joint,
      pain by the bone fracture of wrist joint, pain by herpes shingles,
      toothache, menstrual pain, etc., considerable pain alleviation was
      observed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0084] 8. Ocular Disease</b><br>
      <br>
      [0085] Patients with ocular diseases such as simple ocular
      congestion and afterimage, sties, epidemic keratoconjunctivitis,
      glaucoma, and cataract experienced considerable disease
      improvement effects by spraying of Brown's gas.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0086] 9. Parkinson's Disease</b><br>
      <br>
      [0087] When Brown's gas was sprayed on patients with Parkinson's
      disease, considerable improvement in paralysis of limbs, speech
      disorder, dribbling by excessive salivation, head shaking,
      trembling of hands, etc. was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Furthermore, symptoms removal, improvement, or relief in
      insomnia by nervousness, myasthenia by muscle weakness, chilly
      hands and feet by blood circulation dysfunction, asthma, gastritis
      and gastric ulcer, panic disorder, diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
      trouble in the left chest by stricture of the heart, breathing
      discomfort, etc. was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] In addition to cure or improvement of symptoms during or
      after therapy with Brown's gas, patients experienced the following
      common effects.<br>
      <br>
      Lightness and clearness of the head.<br>
      Lightness of the body and good condition.<br>
      Disappearance of the dimness and redness in the eyes.<br>
      Warm hands and feet and perspiration.<br>
      Good sleep.<br>
      <br>
      [0095] These effects are attributed to promoted blood circulation
      by spraying of Brown's gas, resulting in smooth blood supply to
      various regions in the body.<br>
      <br>
      [0096] It is thought that the aforementioned many effects of
      Brown's gas on the body are closely related to the action and
      physiological efficacy of water in the body. Therefore, the
      present inventor thinks that a basic mechanism that can explain
      the effect of Brown' gas on the body is absorption of Brown's gas
      through skin, moisture supply and hydration for target tissues,
      cells, or organs.<br>
      <br>
      [0097] However, the effect of Brown's gas on the aforementioned
      various diseases cannot be explained only by simple hydration.
      Therefore, the present inventor thinks that there will be a more
      complicated therapeutic mechanism model of Brown's gas. Thus, the
      present inventor presumes that basic therapeutic mechanism of
      Brown's gas is strong immunity and activation of the body by
      smooth blood circulation which are induced by transfer of high
      energy to a lesional region. In summary, from microscopic points
      of view, it is thought that high energy transformed into a water
      gas form called Brown's gas hydrates cell tissues, which activates
      cells, resulting in cure of lesions.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] A Brown's gas generator that can be used herein may be a
      commonly known Brown's gas generator with a capacity appropriate
      to be used in the body. A commercially available common Brown's
      gas generator includes a “mixed gas generator” for generating a
      highly pure mixed gas of oxygen, hydrogen, and water vapor by
      electrolysis of water and a “spraying nozzle” connected to the
      mixed gas generator to spray the mixed gas. The spraying nozzle of
      the common Brown's gas generator can be used according to the
      present invention to directly spray Brown's gas to a lesional
      region of the body or its adjacent region. However, since the
      common Brown's gas generator uses a catalyst (NaOH, KOH etc.),
      considerable amounts of impurities such as NaOH or KOH, together
      with pure Brown's gas, are contained in Brown's gas to be
      supplied. In this respect, to use Brown's gas according to the
      present invention, it is preferable to use a Brown's gas supply
      apparatus equipped with a purification unit capable of removing
      these impurities. It is particularly preferable to use a Brown's
      gas supply apparatus according to the present invention as will be
      described later.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] The present invention includes all embodiments that use
      Brown's gas for the purpose of the present invention regardless of
      the type or shape of a Brown's gas supply apparatus. Therefore,
      Brown's gas of the present invention cannot be construed to be
      limited to that supplied by the following apparatus. Also, Brown's
      gas supplied by various types of Brown's gas supply apparatuses
      that will be developed for use in the body in future must be
      construed to fall within the scope of the present invention
      provided that it is used for the purpose of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of Brown's gas supply
      apparatuses according to the present invention will be described
      with reference to the accompanying drawings. The detailed
      description of the same constitutional elements as in a common
      Brown's gas generator will be omitted without departing from the
      technical points of the present invention. Further, even though
      constitutional elements in the accompanying drawings are
      represented by reference numerals to assist the understanding of
      the present invention, the present invention is not limited to or
      by them.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a Brown's gas supply
      apparatus according to an exemplary embodiment of the present
      invention. Referring to FIG. 1, the Brown's gas supply apparatus
      according to the embodiment of the present invention includes a
      Brown's gas generator 10 for generating Brown's gas by
      electrolysis of water; at least one airtight gas-trapping tank 20
      for allowing the Brown's gas to pass through water and trapping
      pure Brown's gas; and a spraying nozzle 25 connected to the
      gas-trapping tank to spray the trapped Brown's gas on a target
      region.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] A commonly known Brown's gas generator may be used as the
      Brown's gas generator 10. The capacity of the Brown's gas
      generator 10 is determined according to the number of patients to
      be treated at the same time. When patients are individually
      treated, the capacity of the Brown's gas generator 10 is
      sufficient to be 1,200/hr. In illustrative examples of the present
      invention as will be described later, ER1200 model (Water Torch,
      U.S.A.) was used.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The spraying nozzle 25 may be a commonly known nozzle such
      as a convergent nozzle and a divergent nozzle. It is preferable
      that the spraying nozzle 25 has a continuous spraying function.
      When needed, a nozzle with various pulsing functions may be used.
      An elastic cap 26 made of silicon rubber to prevent the inflow of
      ambient air may be detachably installed to an end of the nozzle
      25.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] As to the gas-trapping tank, it is preferable that two
      gas-trapping tanks are serially connected, as shown in FIG. 1.
      Brown's gas trapped in a first gas-trapping tank 20 is supplied to
      a second gas-trapping tank 20′ and passes through water in the
      second gas-trapping tank 20′ to thereby trap pure Brown's gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] FIG. 2 is a sectional view of an example of the
      gas-trapping tank 20 of FIG. 1. The gas-trapping tank according to
      the embodiment of the present invention has a hermetically sealed
      tube structure in which water is contained in a tube 30.
      Generally, water 34 occupies 40-90% of the tube 30, preferably
      50-60%. The water 34 may be clear room-temperature water or tepid
      water. When two gas-trapping tanks are used, it is preferable that
      distilled water is contained in a second gas-trapping tank. A
      porous partition 40 is horizontally installed in a lower part of
      the tube 30 in such a way to be spaced predetermined distance
      apart from the bottom of the tube 30 so that Brown's gas and the
      water 34 can pass through the porous partition 40. The porous
      partition 40 is responsible for dispersion of Brown's gas. An
      upper surface (upper plate) 38 of the tube 30 is formed with a gas
      injection pipe 21 extended downward to below the porous partition
      40 to supply Brown's gas to a lower part of the tube 30; a gas
      discharge port 22 for discharging trapped Brown's gas; and a water
      injection port 23 for water supply. Further, a lower surface
      (lower plate) of the tube 30 may be formed with a water discharge
      port 27 for easy water change. A handle 37 may be attached to the
      upper surface 38 of the tube 30 to facilitate the movement of the
      gas-trapping tank. Even though there is no particular limitation
      on the material for the tube 30, the tube 30 may be made of
      anticorrosive stainless steel.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, Brown's gas generated by the
      Brown's gas generator 10 is injected into the water 34 below the
      porous partition 40 in the first gas-trapping tank 20 via the gas
      injection pipe 21. The injected Brown's gas is trapped in an upper
      part 36 of the tube 30 after passing through the porous partition
      40 and the water 34. Primarily purified Brown's gas thus trapped
      is injected into water below a porous partition in the second
      gas-trapping tank 20′ via a gas injection pipe 21′ and the same
      procedure as in the first gas-trapping tank 20 is performed to
      trap pure Brown's gas for therapeutic purpose.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The porous partition 40 in the embodiment shown in FIG. 2
      may be omitted. Therefore, the absence of the porous partition 40
      constitutes another embodiment (not shown) of the present
      invention. According to the embodiment of the present invention
      including no porous partitions, the diffusion effect of Brown's
      gas may be reduced relative to the embodiment of FIG. 2 but there
      is an advantage that the construction of a gas-trapping tank can
      be more simplified. The embodiment of the present invention
      including no porous partitions is the same as in the embodiment of
      FIG. 2 except the absence of the porous partition 40. Brown's gas
      is injected into water in a lower part of a tube via a gas
      injection pipe 21 extended downward, passes through the water, and
      then is trapped in an upper part of the tube. At this time, it is
      preferable that the gas injection pipe 21 is extended downward to
      an extent that nearly contacts with the bottom of the tube.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] FIG. 3 is a sectional view of another example of the
      gas-trapping tank 20 of FIG. 1. The gas-trapping tank according to
      the embodiment of the present invention has a dual tube structure
      including an inner tube 31; an outer tube 30 separated from a
      sidewall and bottom of the inner tube 31 by a predetermined
      distance; and a common upper plate 38 covering the inner tube 31
      and the outer tube 30. The inner tube 31 and the outer tube 30
      contain water. The bottom of the inner tube 31 is formed with a
      plurality of through-holes 32 through which Brown's gas and water
      can pass. The upper plate 38 is formed with a gas injection pipe
      21 extended downward to supply Brown's gas supplied from outside
      to water in the outer tube 30; a gas discharge port 22 for
      discharging trapped Brown's gas; and a water injection port 23 for
      water supply. At this time, to allow almost 100% of injected
      Brown's gas to pass through water, it is preferable that the gas
      injection pipe 21 is extended downward to an extent that nearly
      contacts with the bottom of the outer tube 30. The inner tube 31
      can be more firmly fixed to the outer tube 30 by installing a bolt
      33 between the bottom of the inner tube 31 and the bottom of the
      outer tube 30.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] FIG. 4 is a partial sectional view of a Brown's gas supply
      apparatus according to the embodiment shown in FIG. 3.
      Specifically, FIG. 4 illustrates that Brown's gas generated by a
      Brown's gas generator 10 is injected in gas-trapping tanks 20 and
      20′ and then pure Brown's gas is discharged from gas-trapping
      tanks 20 and 20′. Brown's gas generated by the Brown's gas
      generator 10 is supplied to a gas injection pipe 21 of a first
      gas-trapping tank 20 via a discharge port 11 and a discharge pipe
      12. The supplied Brown's gas is injected into water 34 in an outer
      tube 30 of the first gas-trapping tank 20. Then, the Brown's gas
      passes through water 35 in an inner tube via through-holes 32 of
      the bottom of the inner tube and then is trapped in an upper part
      36 of the inner tube. The trapped Brown's gas is discharged
      through a gas discharge port 22. The Brown's gas discharged after
      the primary purification is supplied into a gas injection pipe 21′
      of a second gas-trapping tank 20′ via a discharge pipe 24 and then
      injected into water 34′ in an outer tube. The injected Brown's gas
      passes through water 35′ in an inner tube via through-holes 32′ of
      the bottom of the inner tube and then is trapped in an upper part
      36′ of the inner tube. The Brown's gas trapped after the secondary
      purification is directly sprayed onto skin or lesional regions of
      mammals, including human beings, via a spraying nozzle 25, for
      therapeutic purpose.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] The aforementioned embodiments have been described in terms
      of serially connected two gas-trapping tanks. However, serially
      connected three or more gas-trapping tanks may also be used. As
      more gas-trapping tanks are used, purer Brown's gas can be
      obtained. However, to obtain Brown's gas suitable for treatment
      considering cost and complexity, it is preferable to use two
      gas-trapping tanks. Further, to obtain pure Brown's gas, it is
      preferable to periodically change water in a gas-trapping tank.<br>
      <br>
      [0111] Hereinafter, the present invention related to a new use of
      Brown's gas will be described more specifically by Examples.
      However, the following Examples are provided only for
      illustrations and thus the present invention is not limited to or
      by them.<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0112] Brown's Gas Generator</b><br>
      <br>
      [0113] In the following Examples, a Brown's gas supply apparatus
      as shown in FIG. 1 was used. At this time, ER1200 model (Water
      Torch, U.S.A.) was used as a Brown's gas generator (10 of FIG. 1).

      <b>Symptoms and Results in Examples</b><br>
      <br>
      [0120] In the following all Examples, symptoms of diseases and
      therapeutic results thereof were provided based on the subjective
      symptoms of patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 1</b><br>
      <br>
      [0121] Subject: female with the age of 72<br>
      <br>
      [0122] Symptoms: degenerative arthritis of two knees; severe pain
      and stiffness in standing and walking, and numbness.<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0124] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the right knee joint for 30
      minutes and on the left knee joint for 30 minutes with a 20-minute
      pause between the two spraying. Immediately after the spraying,
      the joints were relaxed and the pain completely disappeared. The
      patient could walk at a brisk pace on a flat ground with no
      assistance and did not feel severe pain when she went up and down
      the stairs.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] (2) At the next day after the treatment, the patient felt
      pain in the knee joints in walking even though the level of the
      pain was remarkably slight, showing that the therapeutic effect
      was maintained during the post-treatment period.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] (3) At three days after the treatment, a secondary
      treatment was performed in the same manner as in the section (1).<br>
      <br>
      [0127] (4) At two weeks after the secondary treatment, the
      therapeutic effects were maintained to an extent that the knee
      joints were relaxed and almost no pain was felt.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] The therapeutic effects were identified by X-ray images
      before and after the treatment with Brown's gas. FIG. 5A is an
      X-ray image before the primary treatment of the section (1) (Nov.
      21, 2003) and FIG. 5B is an X-ray image at two weeks after the

      [0129] Subject: female with the age of 54<br>
      <br>
      [0130] Symptoms: disc symptoms: numbness in the left hand (usual),
      continued loss of sensation (often) and the fifth and sixth
      cervical disc fusion (according to the orthopedic diagnosis);
      severe pain in the left shoulder and arm and stiffness in movement
      of the arm.<br>
      <br>
      [0131] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0132] 1. Primary Treatment and Effect<br>
      <br>
      [0133] (1) First, Brown's gas was sprayed on the fifth and sixth
      cervical vertebrae for about 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] (2) After 5 minutes of the spraying, knuckles were relaxed
      and the numbness of the hands was gradually alleviated. Pain of
      the left shoulder disappeared so that the patient could raise her
      left hand and draw a circle.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] (3) Additionally, the spraying of Brown's gas was performed
      for 45 minutes three times (15 minutes for each). The numbness of
      the hands completely disappeared within one hour after the
      treatment. Sensation of the tips of the left knuckles was
      recovered.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] (4) At the next day after the treatment, the improved
      symptoms were maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0137] 2. Secondary Treatment and Effect<br>
      <br>
      [0138] (5) At one week after the primary treatment, the patient
      complained of similar pain before the primary treatment. Brown's
      gas was sprayed on the shoulder and the fifth and sixth cervical
      vertebrae for about 15 minutes. During the spraying, the hand
      numbness completely disappeared and the arm pain started to
      disappear. After a 20-minute pause of the spraying, Brown's gas
      was again sprayed on the shoulder and arm for 15 minutes. The
      shoulder and arm pain was remarkably alleviated so that the arm
      could move freely. After 45 minutes, Brown's gas was again sprayed
      on the shoulder and the disc regions for 15 minutes. The pain
      completely disappeared and color was regained.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] (6) At the next day after the treatment, the shoulder was
      remarkably relaxed but there was slight pain in the movement of
      the arm.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Example 3</b><b><br>

      <br>
      [0142] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0143] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the right knee joint for 15
      minutes and then on the left knee joint for 15 minutes.
      Immediately after the spraying, the patient could walk at a brisk
      pace and the pain completely disappeared. The patient could walk
      on a flat ground with no assistance and felt no pain when she went
      up and down the stairs.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] (2) After a 20-minute pause of the spraying, Brown's gas
      was additionally sprayed on the right and left knee joints (5
      minutes for each).<br>
      <br>
      [0145] (3) At the next day of the treatment, there was no pain in
      the left knee joint but pain was felt in the right knee joint.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] (4) At four weeks after the treatment, the therapeutic
      effects were maintained to an extent that the left knee joint was
      relaxed and no pain was felt.<br>
      <br>

      remarkably swollen knee joint. In particular, severe pain due to
      contact between the two bones of the knee joint in walking at
      stairs or a slope.<br>
      <br>
      [0149] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0150] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the left knee joint
      remarkably swollen by inflammation for 15 minutes. Immediately
      after the spraying, the knee joint was relaxed and the pain
      completely disappeared, and the patient could walk at a brisk
      pace. The patient could walk on a flat ground with no assistance
      and did not feel severe pain when she went up and down the stairs.
      Also, it was visually observed that the swelling subsided at the
      knee joint swollen by inflammation.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] (2) After a 20-minute pause of the spraying, Brown's gas
      was again sprayed on the knee joint for 15 minutes. Additionally,
      the spraying of Brown's gas was repeated twice in the same manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0152] (3) At the next day after the treatment, the pain of the
      knee joint in walking was remarkably alleviated, showing that the
      therapeutic effect was maintained during the post-treatment
      period.<br>

      for 15 minutes and on the both shoulders for 10 minutes (for
      each). During the spraying, the back part of the neck was relaxed
      and disappearance of headache was felt. After the spraying, the
      headache disappeared. In addition, the dimness and redness in the
      bloodshot eyes were removed.<br>
      <br>
      [0157] (2) At the next day after the treatment, slight headache
      was felt.<br>
      <br>
      [0158] (3) At two weeks after the treatment, only slight headache
      was felt.<br>

      [0167] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0168] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the shoulder and neck for 15
      minutes. The pain completely disappeared. Brown's gas was again
      sprayed on the feet for 5 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0169] (2) Immediately after the spraying, the patient stood up
      and walked and felt no pain. In addition, the allergic symptoms at
      the neck skin completely disappeared and thus the neck skin was
      restored to normal color.<br>
      <br>
      [0170] (3) At the next day after the treatment, no pain was felt
      and the neck and shoulder was restored to a normal condition.<br>

      [0195] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0196] (1) Brown's gas was intensively sprayed on the waist pain
      region for 25 minutes. At the night of the even day (at 6 hours
      after the spraying), the spraying of Brown's gas on the same
      region was additionally performed for 15 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0197] (2) Until the next day after the treatment, the patient
      felt no pain during sleeping and had a sound sleep. No waist pain

      the muscles and ligaments that support the spine for about 10
      minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0203] (3) Immediately after the spraying, the lumbago was
      alleviated and the myalgia was cured so that the head could be
      freely shaken. After the treatment, the symptoms were continuously
      improved with time. At six hours after the treatment, no pain was
      felt.<br>

      of the bloodshot eyes before the spraying disappeared, like in use
      of an eye lotion. The shoulder and neck were remarkably relaxed so
      that the patient could behave naturally, and the pain almost
      completely disappeared. Further, the patient became energetic so
      that he did not feel fatigue.<br>

      the spraying, the patient could go up and down the stairs with no
      trouble. Brown's gas was sprayed on the left knee joint for 15
      minutes. The left foot became warm and the pain of the knee joint
      disappeared. After 20 minutes, Brown's gas was continuously
      sprayed on the waist (lumbar vertebrae) for 15 minutes. After the
      spraying, the patient could easily go up and down the stairs. The
      color of the patient was regained and the body became warm. The

      [0241] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the knee for 15 minutes.
      After the spraying, the knee pain completely disappeared. The
      patient could rise from his seat and go up and down the stairs
      with no assistance. After a 20-minute pause of the spraying,
      Brown's gas was sprayed on the waist for 20 minutes. After the
      spraying, the legs were relaxed and little stiffness in walking
      was felt.<br>
      <br>
      [0242] (2) At the next day of the treatment, the therapeutic
      effects were maintained and thus no pain was felt.<br>

      incurable disease: no muscular growth, muscle weakness, and lying
      down through life.<br>
      <br>
      [0245] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0246] (1) Spraying of Brown's gas was focused on stretching of
      the contracted ligament of the heels inhibiting walking to achieve
      muscle relaxation. Primarily, Brown's gas was sprayed on the
      ligament of the right heel for about 20 minutes. During the
      spraying, to correct a bouncy walk, the ankles were allowed to be
      bent forward. After a 20-minute pause of the spraying, the same
      treatment was applied to the ligament of the left heel. The
      patient could stand up only for less than three seconds before the
      spraying, whereas he could stand up for more than 50 seconds after
      the spraying. The two arms, which had been usually cold before the
      spraying, became warm. The patient felt energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0247] (2) At the next day of the treatment, it was reported that
      the patient had a sound sleep. However, unlike on the day of the
      treatment, the patient could not stand up for a long time.
      However, rehabilitation could be made easier.<br>
      <br>
      [0248] (3) At two days after the treatment, a secondary treatment
      was performed in the same manner as in the primary treatment. The
      patient could stand up for more than 50-60 seconds after the
      spraying, like in the primary treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0249] (4) At four days after the secondary treatment,
      rehabilitation could be made much easier.<br>

      The patient was under paralysis therapeutic drug intake (4-5 times
      per day).<br>
      <br>
      [0252] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0253] 1. Primary Treatment<br>
      <br>
      [0254] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the neck (cervical
      vertebrae) and the head for 10 minutes and then on the right
      shoulder for 20 minutes. During the spraying, the paralysis
      symptoms of the right shoulder and arm started to disappear. Also,
      the paralysis symptoms of the right leg almost completely
      disappeared (85% recovery rate). The patient could stand up and
      walk and spin the shoulder, like a normal person. After a
      30-minute pause of the spraying, Brown's gas was again sprayed on
      the same regions for 20 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      [0255] (2) During a 1.5-hour pause of the spraying, slight
      paralysis symptom appeared. After initiating an exercise, the
      paralysis disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      [0256] 2. Secondary Treatment<br>
      <br>
      [0257] (1) At five hours after the primary treatment, Brown's gas
      was sprayed on the same regions for 30 minutes. At five minutes
      after initiation of the spraying, the paralysis symptom of the arm
      completely disappeared. At 10 minutes after initiation of the
      spraying, the paralysis symptom of the leg also completely
      disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      [0258] (2) In comparison between the primary and secondary
      treatments, the patient condition after the secondary treatment
      was much improved, relative to that after the primary treatment.
      The paralysis completely disappeared and 100% normal condition was
      recovered.<br>
      <br>
      [0259] (3) At four hours after the secondary treatment, the normal
      condition was maintained.<br>

      <br>
      [0262] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0263] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the left shoulder for 30
      minutes. At 10 minutes after initiation of the spraying, the left
      shoulder was relaxed. During the continued spraying, the migraine
      disappeared and the left head was relaxed. At 30 minutes after
      initiation of the spraying, the pain completely disappeared and
      the head became clear.<br>
      <br>
      [0264] (2) At the next day of the treatment, the head became
      clear, the migraine disappeared, and the left shoulder was
      relaxed.<br>
      <br>
      [0265] (3) At the three days of the treatment, slight pain was
      felt but the patient condition was improved by 70% or more.<br>

      of the bottom of the foot, and severe pain; diabetic peripheral
      neuropathy; pain in the right shoulder: difficulty in arm spinning
      and movement, and severe pain; and rheumatoid arthritis in the
      both hands.<br>
      <br>
      [0268] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0269] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the shoulder and cervical
      vertebrae (fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae) for 25 minutes and
      5 minutes, respectively. During the spraying, the frozen shoulder
      completely disappeared. Also, the finger pain of the both hands
      disappeared and the both hands were relaxed.<br>
      <br>
      [0270] (2) Brown's gas was sprayed on the top side of the left
      foot for about 30 minutes. At 2-3 minutes after initiation of the
      spraying, the swelling of the swollen top side of the foot
      subsided remarkably and the dark blue skin color was also changed
      to a normal skin color. The severe pain was alleviated and the
      paralysis disappeared. Immediately after the spraying, the patient
      could rise from his seat and walk with no pain.<br>
      <br>
      [0271] (3) At the next day (at 15 hours) after the treatment, it
      was reported that the patient had a sound sleep, the right frozen
      shoulder completely disappeared, and the swollen left foot was
      restored to a normal condition. Pain was felt at an upper part of
      the leg joint but was at a remarkably alleviated level relative to
      the pain before the treatment. These effects are attributed to the
      function of Brown's gas as an antioxidant reducing the level of
      uric acid which is a causative substance of gout.<br>
      <br>
      [0272] (4) At three hours, no frozen shoulder was felt and the
      shoulder was significantly relaxed. The right foot was also
      maintained at normal condition. With respect to the right leg on
      which Brown's gas had not been sprayed, the pain was alleviated
      and the swelling disappeared. Even though Brown's gas was sprayed
      on only the shoulder and neck, the pain of the both hands
      disappeared. Even though Brown's gas was sprayed on only the left
      leg, the therapeutic effect was also observed on the right leg.
      The phenomena might be possible because Brown's gas does not stay
      in its application region but is absorbed in the body and then
      circulated through the blood stream in the body.<br>

      30 minutes. The pain was remarkably alleviated.<br>
      <br>
      [0278] (3) Brown's gas was again sprayed on the back. The pain was
      considerably alleviated so that little pain was felt, as compared
      to the primary and secondary spraying. Next, Brown's gas was
      sprayed on the left chest. The right chest pain completely
      disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      [0279] (4) The hands and feet became warm by improved blood
      circulation of the body. Further, unlike before the treatment, a
      light body condition was maintained.<br>

      Because the patient took medicine on the morning of the day of the
      treatment, to identify the therapeutic effects of the Brown's gas
      took much time.<br>
      <br>
      [0302] (2) At the next day after the treatment, the head still
      maintained a clear condition and no headache was felt.<br>
      <br>
      [0303] (3) At two days after the treatment, even though drug
      intake was discontinued except the morning of the first day of the
      treatment, the therapeutic effects of a clear head and no headache
      were still maintained and panic disorder was not observed. During
      the post-treatment period, disorder symptoms were slightly
      observed for about 10 minutes but the patient was rapidly
      recovered from the disorder symptoms. As can also be seen in
      another Examples, the increase in the recovery power of the body
      might be possible because Brown's gas does not transiently
      alleviate symptoms but returns a lesional region of interest,
      i.e., lesional tissue or organ, to a normal condition. Therefore,
      it is thought that the tissue or organ itself has a self-recovery
      power.<br>
      <br>
      [0304] (4) At three days after the treatment, no headache or panic
      disorder was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0305] (5) In the morning of the fourth day after the treatment,
      slight headache was observed but almost completely disappeared
      after sound sleep for one hour.<br>
      <br>
      [0306] 2. Secondary Treatment<br>
      <br>
      [0307] (1) In the evening of the fourth day after the primary
      treatment, Brown's gas was sprayed on the back part of the neck
      for 25 minutes. The slight pain completely disappeared. After
      about one hour, Brown's gas was again sprayed on the same region
      for 10 minutes. The condition of the patient was completely
      recovered.<br>
      <br>
      [0308] (2) At the next day after the treatment, all the disorder
      symptoms disappeared to become normal like a healthy person. In
      the afternoon of the day, slight headache was felt. However, it
      was considered not to be associated with the panic disorder. It
      might be the aftereffect of the discontinuation of the drug
      intake.<br>
      <br>
      [0309] (3) At three days after the secondary treatment, according
      to the doctor's diagnosis, the feeling of slight headache might be
      the aftereffect of the disconnection of the drug intake and would
      disappear after about 10 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0310] 3. Tertiary Treatment<br>
      <br>
      [0311] (1) At 23 days after the secondary treatment, Brown's gas
      was sprayed on the back side of the head for 30 minutes. Like in
      the primary and secondary treatments, the head became clear and
      the body became energetic.<br>
      <br>
      [0312] (2) At the next day after the treatment, no headache was
      felt and a good condition was maintained. The patient felt like a
      healthy person.<br>
      <br>
      [0313] (3) It was judged that if the patient would be subjected to
      continued treatment at least once a month, he could be returned to
      a normal condition.<br>

      [0316] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0317] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the neck for 10 minutes.
      During the spraying, the throat felt itchy and prickly.<br>
      <br>
      [0318] (2) At the next day after the treatment, the soreness of
      the throat and phlegm disappeared and the neck was relaxed.<br>

      [0321] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0322] (1) Brown's gas was directly sprayed into the nose for five
      minutes. The nose was no longer blocked and the concentrated nasal
      mucus was continuously swallowed.<br>
      <br>
      [0323] (2) At the next day after the treatment, Brown's gas was
      sprayed into the nose for five minutes. The same effect as in the
      previous day was observed. It was judged that if the patient might
      be subjected to continued treatment, remarkable improvements or
      therapeutic effects would be achieved.<br>

      was subjected to oriental medicinal treatment and orthopedic
      treatment, remarkable therapeutic effects were not obtained. The
      patient walked with a limp and felt severe pain.<br>
      <br>
      [0326] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0327] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the Achilles' tendon for
      about 10 minutes. At 2-3 minutes after the spraying, severe pain
      started to disappear and the swelling subsided. After the spraying
      was completed, the pain almost completely disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      [0328] (2) At three days after the treatment, the disorder
      symptoms were again observed. It might be thought that the
      therapeutic effects were not maintained due to overwork after the
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0329] (3) Brown's gas was again sprayed on the same region for 10
      minutes. Immediately after the spraying, the pain disappeared. The
      improved therapeutic effects relative to the primary treatment
      were felt.<br>
      <br>
      [0330] (4) At the next day after the treatment, the pain
      completely disappeared and the therapeutic effects were
      maintained.<br>

      severe pain in the top side of the left foot (the pain was too
      severe to put on her shoes due to an injury caused by falling down
      10 years ago); and burning feeling due to gastritis (usual).<br>
      <br>
      [0333] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0334] (1) First, to alleviate the frozen shoulder due to the
      cervical disc, Brown's gas was sprayed on the neck for 20 minutes.
      During the spraying, stiffness and the feeling of pain in the
      joints were felt. The hand numbness and the frozen shoulder
      disappeared.<br>
      <br>
      [0335] (2) After a 30-minute pause of the spraying, Brown's gas
      was sprayed on the top side of the left foot for 20 minutes.
      During the spraying, pain transiently appeared in the toes but
      disappeared. The patient could stand up and walk with no pain and
      discomfort.<br>
      <br>
      [0336] (3) Brown's gas was sprayed on the abdomen (the stomach
      region) for 15 minutes. During the spraying, slight pain was felt
      in the stomach. The pain gradually became worse but disappeared.
      Gas was incessantly generated in the stomach.<br>
      <br>
      [0337] (4) At the next day after the treatment, the pain in the
      top side of the left foot completely disappeared so that the left
      foot was restored to a normal condition. The frozen shoulder was
      remarkably alleviated but was not completely cured. However, the
      patient could have a sound sleep. Judging from the observation
      that gas was incessantly generated in the stomach, the gastritis
      was not improved.<br>
      <br>
      [0338] (5) At three days after the treatment, the body condition
      was remarkably improved and no pain in the top side of the left
      foot and the shoulder was felt. With respect to the gastritis, gas
      generation did not occur. The patient had a comfort feeling in the
      stomach and did not feel other disorder symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      [0339] (6) At seven days after the treatment, other disorder
      symptoms were not felt and thus the patient felt that the body was
      completely restored to a normal condition. Also, the patient had
      the feeling of comfort in the stomach and had no trouble in
      digestion. In addition, it was felt that constipation was removed.<br>

      <br>
      [0348] (1) Brown's gas was sprayed on the eyes for about 20
      minutes. During the spraying, the eyes were gradually relaxed and
      small characters at far distance were vividly viewed and the
      therapeutic effects were maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0349] (2) During two days after the treatment, Brown's gas was
      additionally sprayed on the eyes once a day. Continued improvement

      10 minutes. During the spraying, the ocular disease symptoms
      gradually disappeared and the therapeutic effects were maintained.<br>
      <br>
      [0354] (2) At 10 hours after the spraying, a secondary spraying
      was performed. Residual redness in the bloodshot eyes disappeared
      and the eyes of the patient were restored to a normal condition.<br>

      therapeutic effect was maintained for more than 12 hours after the
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      [0364] (2) Whenever the itchy symptom was felt, Brown's gas was
      sprayed on the affected region. It was observed that wound
      recovery was accelerated.<br>
      <br>
      [0365] (3) Brown's gas was also sprayed on an affected region with
      similar symptoms to a burn, which had been caused after laser
      therapy for elimination of points on the face, in the same manner
      as in sections (1) and (2). In this case, the itchy symptom
      completely disappeared and the wound was healed without leaving
      scars.<br>

      hurdle race; casting and frequent numbness in the hands.<br>
      <br>
      [0368] Treatment and Effect:<br>
      <br>
      [0369] (1) Whenever the numbness in the hands occurred, Brown's
      gas was sprayed on the tips of the fingers and the elbow for about
      10 minutes. During the spraying, the numbness symptom disappeared
      and the wrist was relaxed. The therapeutic effects were maintained
      during a prolonged period of time after the spraying.<br>
      <br>
      [0370] (2) At three months after the treatment, the casting was
      removed. However, since the fingers and wrist were not used for a
      long time, stiffness and pain were felt. Brown's gas was again
      sprayed on the knuckles and the affected wrist for three days
      three times. Even though the doctor in charge diagnosed that
      rehabilitation had to be made for about one month for recovery,
      the stiffened wrist was easily relaxed only by the three times
      spraying of Brown's gas and almost completely restored to a normal
      condition.<br>

      <br>
      [0373] Treatment:<br>
      <br>
      [0374] Brown's gas was 30 times (total) sprayed on the affected
      regions for 27 days ranging from Jun. 15, 2004 to Jul. 11, 2004.
      The treatment with Brown's gas was performed together with drug
      intake. As a result, initial and primary symptoms of the
      Parkinson's disease and its secondary symptoms including
      complications could be cured. In this regard, it was judged that
      the patient could have a normal life.<br>
      <br>
      [0375] Effects: following post-treatment symptoms in the patient
      were provided based on the subjective symptoms of the patient.<br>
      <br>
      Reduction in the number of drug intake and dosage: reduction from
      6 times to 3-4 times.<br>
      Improvement in bradykinesia (slow motion).<br>
      Improvement in stiffness: pain in the neck, shoulder, and joints
      disappeared and were relaxed.<br>
      Improvement in walking disorder: the maximum therapeutic effect
      was that the patient was restored to a normal condition so that he
      could jump about.<br>
      Improvement in sense of equilibrium: no falling down in walking.<br>
      Clear and bright face, loud voice, and clear pronunciation.<br>
      Improvement in swallowing: tongue or neck muscles were activated.<br>
      Improvement in saliva swallowing: the autonomic nerve was
      recovered and the neck muscle was activated.<br>
      Recovery of the disorder of urination: the urinary color was
      normal and the disorder of urination was remarkably improved.<br>
      Constipation alleviation: the motion of the intestinal tract was
      remarkably improved even though there was a difference in the
      degree of the motion of the intestinal tract according to the type
      of a food.<br>
      Sexual dysfunction recovery.<br>
      Improvement in eyesight: eyesight was regained so that the reading
      of small characters was possible.<br>
      Removal of perspiration: much sweating in the upper part of the
      body was improved.<br>
      Recovery of dementia disorder: the failure of the memory was
      improved.<br>
      Removal of depression: good feeling.<br>
      Recovery of the disorder of foot sensation: the sensation of the
      right foot was recovered.<br>
      Sound sleep: sleeping for 6 to 9 hours.<br>
      Headache removal: clear and light head.<br>
      Recovery of the sense of taste: good appetite and weight gain.<br>
      <br>
      [0395] Most results from the above Examples were based on
      short-term observations. Sufficient follow-up tests and additional
      treatments have not yet been conducted. However, in the short-term
      experiments, most patients experienced complete removal of
      symptoms or remarkable improvements during spraying, immediately
      after spraying, or within 24 hours. These results demonstrate
      direct action of Brown's gas on the body, as described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0396] Furthermore, according to the examination results for the
      Examples, with respect to a disease with severe symptoms (in
      particular, for myalgia) with a short onset period, the severe
      symptoms were almost completely cured by spraying occurred only
      once. However, with respect to a disease with mild symptoms with a
      long onset period, the improvement of the symptoms after the
      treatment was transiently observed, but with time, some symptoms
      were slightly again observed and some symptoms reached the same
      level as the original severe symptoms, which will now be
      described. For the former, lesional tissues, cells, or organs are
      easily restored to normal conditions by treatment with Brown's gas
      and the restored conditions are maintained during the
      post-treatment period. On the other hand, for the latter, even
      though lesional tissues, cells, or organs exhibit recovered
      conditions such as alleviation or disappearance of the symptoms,
      the recovered conditions are transient and thus return to the
      conditions before the treatments.<br>
      <br>
      [0397] However, some diseases with a long onset period were
      remarkably improved by repeated treatment with Brown's gas, and
      remarkable increase in the recovery power of the body was observed
      in some of the Examples. The increase in the recovery power of the
      body might be possible because Brown's gas does not transiently
      alleviate symptoms but returns a lesional region of interest,
      i.e., lesional tissue or organ, to a normal condition, whereby the
      tissue or organ itself has a self-recovery power. These results
      show that diseases with severe symptoms and a long onset period
      can also be completely cured by repeated treatment with Brown's
      gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0398] The therapeutic effects of Brown's gas are also observed on
      non-application regions of the body, in addition to application
      regions. This might be possible because Brown's gas does not stay
      in its application region but is absorbed in the body and then
      circulated through the blood stream in the body.<br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0399] Through the above-described various Examples, it can be
      seen that application of Brown's gas to the body induces various
      therapeutic effects such as muscle relaxation and pain removal in
      myalgia, alleviation of symptoms and pain in arthritis, symptom
      alleviation in intervertebral disc, inflammation prevention and
      cure in wounded regions, prevention of inflammatory and allergic
      cutaneous reaction, recovery of headache and numbness, etc. These
      various effects of Brown's gas on the body, which have been
      demonstrated by illustrative examples, are essentially associated
      with the action and efficacy of water in the body. According to
      the present invention, various diseases of mammals can be treated
      or alleviated using Brown's gas. Furthermore, a Brown's gas supply
      apparatus according to the present invention can more easily
      supply Brown's gas for a therapeutic purpose.<br>

      generated by the reaction of the hydrogen generating agent and
      reaction water 2. The hydrogen gas generator has a feature that a
      part or whole of a phase part 4 thereof is covered with a hydrogen
      gas permeable membrane 5.; The hydrogen gas supply apparatus
      supplies a mixed gas containing the hydrogen gas of 0.1 vol% or
      more but less than 18.3 vol% to the living body with a ventilation
      amount of 1 mL/min or more, by mixing the dilution gas supplied
      from the dilution gas supply unit or the vacuum pump with the
      hydrogen gas, and even when the supply of the dilution gas has
      been stopped, maintains the concentration of the hydrogen gas to
      less than 18.3 vol% at a position separated from the hydrogen
      generating agent or the water surface of the reaction water at the
      generation of hydrogen at a distance of 7 cm.<br>

        <b>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MAKING HYDROGEN-DISSOLVED WATER</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a method and apparatus for
      readily and economically making a safety hydrogen-dissolved water
      having highly dissolved hydrogen concentration to enable drinking
      of a plurality of persons at health-promotion facilities such as
      gym. SOLUTION: The hydrogen-dissolved water is made by introducing
      hydrogen in a several L to several-tens L airtight container
      filled with a drinking water, and pressurizing a container inside
      to dissolve hydrogen into the drinking water. The generated
      hydrogen-dissolved water is discharged from the container for use,
      but at the time when the drinking water in the container is almost
      exhausted, the drinking water is pressure-filled in the container
      again, and the container inside is pressurized with the hydrogen
      remaining in the container. Even in a second filling of water, the
      hydrogen-dissolved water is generated by dissolution of the
      pressurized hydrogen in water. Because of low solubility of
      hydrogen in water, even if the above operation is repeated several
      times without filling the container with fresh hydrogen, a
      high-concentration hydrogen-dissolved water can be obtained.;
      Besides, an apparatus or the like, on which a spray nozzle is
      mounted so that the high-concentration hydrogen-dissolved water
      can be obtained in a short time, is provided. Further, a simple
      and convenient method using a hydrogen-generating agent without
      using a steel cylinder as the supply source thereof is also
      provided. <br>

        <b>Water dispenser device capable of generating negative
          hydrogen ion water</b><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      The utility model relates to a water dispenser device capable of
      generating negative hydrogen ion water. The water dispenser device
      is mainly characterized in that a water dispenser is provided with
      a negative hydrogen ion water tank, wherein a mixing and reducing
      tank is arranged between the water outlet end of the negative
      hydrogen ion water tank and the water outlet end of each of a hot
      water barrel, an ice water barrel and a normal temperature water
      passage. After clean water of the water dispenser enters the hot
      water barrel, the ice water barrel, the negative hydrogen ion
      water tank and the normal temperature water passage respectively,
      when hot water or ice water or normal temperature water in the
      water dispenser is drunk and a corresponding water outlet valve is
      opened, the water can be simultaneously discharged through the
      negative hydrogen ion water tank and mixed with the corresponding
      water in the mixing and reducing tank, so that the drinking water
      discharged by the water outlet valve immediately forms reductive
      negative potential water rich in hydrogen ions, and the expected
      effects of facilitating human absorption and promoting human
      health are achieved.<br>
