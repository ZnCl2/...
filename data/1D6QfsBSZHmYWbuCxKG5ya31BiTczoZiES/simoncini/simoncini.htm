    <blockquote style="text-align: center;"><b>SIMONCINI CANCER THERAPY
        -- DR. TULLIO SIMONCINI WRITES</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>My idea is that cancer doesn’t depend on mysterious
      causes (genetic, immunological or auto&nbsp; immunological as the
      official oncology proposes), but it comes down from a simple
      fungal infection, whose destroying power in the deep tissues is
      actually under estimated. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Premise</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The present work is based on the conviction, supported
      by many years of observations, comparisons and experiences, that
      the necessary and sufficient cause of the tumour is to be sought
      in the vast world of the fungi, the most adaptable, aggressive and
      evolved micro-organisms known in nature. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>I have tried many times to explain this theory to
      leading institutions involved in cancer issues (the Ministry of
      Health, the Italian Medical Oncological Association, etc.)
      elaborating on my thinking, but I have been brushed aside because
      of the impossibility of setting my idea in a conventional context.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A different, international audience represents the
      possibility of sharing a view about health, which differs, from
      what is widely accepted by today's medical community, either
      officially or from the sidelines. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>There is an opposition between the allopathic and the
      Hippocratic medical ideal. The former has the disadvantage of its
      inability to consider the individual as a whole. Therefore it
      brings with it all the distortions and aberrations which such a
      point of view entails (excessive specialisation, therapeutic
      aggressiveness, superficiality, harmfulness etc.). The latter
      approach instead tends in the direction of being too generic,
      non-scientific, and devoid of therapeutic incisiveness. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The position that I promote represents instead a meeting
      point of these two conceptions of health, since, from the
      conceptual point of view, it sublimates and adds value to both,
      while highlighting how they both are victims of a common
      conformist language. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The hypothesis of a fungal aetiology in
      chronic-degenerative illness, able to connect the ethical
      qualities of the individual with the development of specific
      pathologies, reconciles the two orientations (allopathic and
      holistic) of medicine. The hypothesis is a strong candidate for
      being that missing element of psychosomatics that has been sought
      but never found by one of the fathers of psychosomatics, Wiktor
      Von Weiszäcker. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In considering the biological dimensions of the fungi,
      for instance, it is possible to compare the different degrees of
      pathogenicity in relation to the condition of organs, tissues and
      cells of a guest organism, which in turn also and especially
      depend on the behaviour of the individual. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Each time the recuperative abilities of a known
      psycho-physic structure are exceeded, there is an inevitable
      exposure, even considering possible accidental cofounders, to the
      aggression -- even at the smallest dimensions -- of those external
      agents that otherwise would be harmless. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the presence of an indubitable connection between
      patient morale and disease it is no longer legitimate to separate
      the two domains (allopathic and naturopathic) which are both
      indispensable for improving the health of individuals. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Platonic separation of the human mind from the human
      body, responsible for the present mechanistic and materialistic
      character of today's medicine, is outdated. So is the pessimistic
      Kantian position concerning integration of the rational and
      emotional sides of man ("the starred sky above me, the moral law
      within me"), which generates the present myopia of today's medical
      epistemology. With such outdated cognitive frameworks inevitably
      come all the mindsets that carry similar restrictive and limiting
      presuppositions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Candida Albicans: Necessary and Sufficient Cause of
        Cancer</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When facing the most pressing contemporary medical
      problem, cancer, the first thing to do is to admit that we still
      do not know its real cause. However treated in different ways by
      both official and alternative medicine, an aural of mystery still
      exists around its real generative process. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The attempt to overcome the present impasse must
      therefore and necessarily go through two separate phases: a
      critical one that exposes the present limitations of oncology, and
      a constructive one capable of proposing a therapeutic system based
      on a new theoretical point of departure. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In agreement with the most recent formulation of
      scientific philosophy, which suggests a counter-inductive approach
      where it is impossible to find a solution with the conceptual
      tools that are commonly accepted, only one logical formulation
      emerges; that is, to refuse the oncological principle which
      assumes cancer is generated by a cellular reproductive anomaly. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>However, if the fundamental hypothesis of cellular
      reproductive anomaly is questioned, it becomes clear that all the
      theories based on this hypothesis are inevitably flawed. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It follows that both an auto-immunological process, in
      which the body's defence mechanisms against external agents turn
      their destructive capacity against internal constituents of the
      body, and an anomaly of the genetic structure implicated in the
      development of auto-destruction, are inevitably disqualified. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Moreover, the common attempt to construct theories about
      multiple causes that have an oncogenic effect on cellular
      reproduction sometimes seems like a concealing screen, behind
      which there is nothing but a wall. These theories propose endless
      causes that are more or less associated with each other; and this
      means in reality that no valid causes are found. The invocation in
      turn of smoking, alcohol, toxic substances, diet, stress,
      psychological factors, etc., without a properly defined context,
      causes confusion and resignation, and creates even more
      mystification around a disease which may turn out to be simpler
      than it is depicted to be. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>As background information, it is important to review the
      picture of presumed genetic influences in the development of
      cancer processes as they are depicted by molecular biologists.
      These are the scientists who perform research on infinitesimally
      small cellular mechanisms, but who in real life never see a
      patient. All present medical systems are based on this research,
      and thus, unfortunately, all therapies currently performed. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The main hypothesis of a genetic neoplastic causality is
      essentially reduced to the fact that the structures and the
      mechanism in charge of normal reproductive cellular activity
      become, for undefined causes, capable of an autonomous behaviour
      that is disjointed from the overall tissular economy. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The genes that normally have a positive role in cellular
      reproduction are, then, imprecisely referred to as
      proto-oncogenes; those which inhibit cellular reproduction are
      called suppressor genes or recessive oncogenes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Both endogenous (never demonstrated) and exogenous
      cellular factors -- that is, those carcinogenic elements that are
      usually invoked -- are held responsible for the neoplastic
      degeneration of the tissues. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In J.H. Stein (<i>Medicina Interna - Internal Medicine,</i>
      Mosby Year Book inc.1994, St. Louis, Missouri, 4th edition,
      Milano, 1995, page 1186 -1187) the following is reported: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The mitogenic signals, from the microenvironment or from
      more distant areas of influence, are transmitted to the cells
      through numerous receptive structures that are associated to the
      plasmatic membrane. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Among these structures, the ones that have been studied
      most exhaustively are receptors with an external domain for the
      binder, a transmembranic domain and a cytoplasmatic domain with a
      thyrosinkinase activity. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Besides these, it is thought that at least seven
      distinct classes of molecules participate in the transmission of
      the mutagenic signal: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>1) receptors coupled to G proteins </blockquote>
    <blockquote>2) ionic channels </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3) receptors with intrinsic activity guanil cyclase </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4) receptors for many lymphofokines, cytokines and
      growth factors (interleukine, eritropoietine, etc.) </blockquote>
    <blockquote>5) receptors for the phosphothyrosine phosphorilase
      activity </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6) nuclear receptors belonging to the supergenic family
      of the receptor for steroidal estrogenic and thyroidal hormones </blockquote>
    <blockquote>7) Finally, increasing numbers of tests suggest that the
      adhesion molecules expressed on the surface of the cells
      communicate with the microenvironment in ways that produce very
      important consequences for cellular growth and differentiation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From a very superficial analysis of this presumed
      oncological picture, however, it seems to be clear how the
      assertion of all this unstoppable genetic hyperactivity, generated
      by elements that almost seem to lurk in the realms of the sinister
      and the monstrous, and that therefore suggest the existence of
      God-knows-what abysmal mechanisms that can only be deciphered with
      equally abysmal conceptual mechanisms -- all this can do nothing
      more that unveil the abysmal stupidity that is at the basis of
      this way of conceiving things. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>What is even more serious is the fact that nobody in the
      present health establishment seems to question the above-mentioned
      stupidities. All those who work in the field do nothing but repeat
      the stale litany of reproductive cellular anomalies on a genetic
      basis. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Since in this state of affairs the present medical
      theory shows an impoverishment and a superficiality that are
      indeed abysmal, it is better to look for new horizons and
      conceptual instruments that are capable of unearthing a real and
      unique neoplastic aetiology. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>After so many years of failure and suffering it is time
      to rejuvenate minds with new and productive juices. Arguments for
      mysterious and complex genetic factors, a monstrous reproductive
      capacity by a pathologic entity capable of tearing apart any
      tissue, the idea that there is an implicit and ancestral tendency
      of the human organism to deviate in an auto-destructive sense --
      these and other similar arguments, spiced with exponentially
      multiplying numbers of "ifs" and "maybes" -- it all has the
      flavour more of raving free-association than of a healthy
      scientific discourse. <br>
      Once the present oncological perspectives have been refuted,
      however, it is legitimate to ask how the successes achieved by
      official medicine and by alternative medicine have to be
      classified. <br>
      To this end, it is useful to remember that contemporary
      epistemology has demonstrated how the contributions to causality
      of contextual and co-textual elements of a theory, if they cannot
      be defined, are therefore chancy, especially in ultra-dimensional
      space, that is, in the microscopic dimension. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In practical terms, this means that data or positive
      facts that are considered proof when concerning a basic principle
      (for example, the above-mentioned cellular reproductive
      anomalies), and therefore obtained by utilising a limited number
      of variables next to the complexity of human disease, cannot be
      trusted, since they work only from the initial hypothetical
      functions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Where, in fact, we admit the possibility of improvements
      or cures, it is not admissible from the logical point of view
      attribute them to this or that method of cure that is more of less
      official, since it is not possible to specify and include all or
      the majority of the components that are at play in the object man,
      in whom conditions of certainty cannot exist. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Paradoxically, the possible positive effect of each
      therapeutic system could derive from elements that are not
      foreseen and are unknown to all. Those elements, however, could be
      influenced by or determined to some extent by one another. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We may find ourselves in a position in which everybody
      rightfully has the right to promote his point of view, without
      knowing the real reasons for his successes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In this case, then, even the most rigorous
      experimentation takes on a fictional character rather than the
      function of a true correspondence with reality, and the end result
      is a continuous sterile petitio principii. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we then put aside completely the conceptual frame of
      contemporary oncology with all its interpretative variables of
      genetic, immuncological and toxicological character, what is left
      as the only logical, practicable way is the domain of the
      infectious diseases, to be seen and reconsidered with different
      eyes that has been the case so far. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Two considerations support such a conclusion. One is of
      a historical nature, and the other is of an epidemiological
      nature. The former derives from the fact that, in the
      therapeutical approach to the patient, the improvement in quality,
      that is the possibility of a real cure for the patient, has been
      determined almost exclusively by the development of microbiology.
      The latter derives from the analysis of life expectancy that has
      taken place in the last decades which, since it is associated with
      an inevitable change of the sthenicity of individuals, can be
      hypothesised as a determining factor in the development atypical
      infectious pathologies. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In order to find the possible carcinogenic ens morbi on
      the horizon of microbiology, it appears useful to return to the
      basic taxonomical concepts of biology, where we can see,
      incidentally, the existence of a noticeable amount of indecision
      and indetermination. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Already in the last century, a German biologist, Ernest
      Haeckele (1834-1919), departing from the Linnaeian concept that
      makes for two great kingdoms of living things (vegetable and
      animal) denounced the difficulties of categorising all those
      microscopic organisms which, because of their characteristics and
      properties, could not be attributed to either the vegetable or
      animal kingdom. For these organisms, he proposed a third kingdom,
      called Protists. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>"This vast and complex world includes a range of
      entities beginning with those that have sub-cellular structure --
      existing at the limits of life -- such as viroids and viruses,
      moving through the mycoplasms, to finally, organisms of greater
      organisation: bacteria, actinomycetes, mixomycetes, fungi,
      protozoa, and perhaps even some microscopic algae." (2). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The common element of these organisms is the feeding
      system, which, being implemented (with very few exceptions) by
      direct absorption of soluble organic compounds, differentiates
      them both from animals and vegetables. Animals also feed as above,
      but especially by ingesting solid organic materials that are then
      transformed through the digestive process. Vegetables are capable,
      by utilising mineral compounds and light energy, to feed by
      synthesising the organic substances. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The contemporary tendency of biologists is to once again
      pick up, though in a more sophisticated way, the concept of the
      third kingdom. One goes even further, however, arguing that within
      that kingdom, fungi must be classified in a distinct category. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>O. Verona (3) says that if we put multicellular
      organisms provided with photosynthetic capabilities (plants) in
      the first kingdom, and the organisms not provided with
      photosynthetic pigmentation (animals) in the second kingdom, and
      organisms from both these kingdoms are made of cells provided with
      a distinct nucleus (eukaryotes); and, furthermore, if we put in
      another kingdom (protists) those monocellular organisms that have
      no chlorophyll and have cells that are without a distinct nucleus
      (prokaryotes), the fungi can well have their own kingdom because
      of the absence of photosynthetic pigmentation, the ability to be
      mono-cellular, and multi-cellular, and, finally, their possession
      of a distinct nucleus. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Additionally, fungi possess a property that is strange
      when compared to all other micro-organisms: the ability to have a
      basic microscopic structure (hypha) with a simultaneous tendency
      to grow to remarkable dimensions (up to several kilograms),
      keeping unchanged the capacity to adapt and reproduce at any size.
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From this point of view, therefore, fungi cannot be
      considered true organisms, but cellular aggregates sui generis
      with an organismic behaviour, since each cell maintains its
      survival and reproductive potential intact regardless of the
      structure in which it exists. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is therefore clear how difficult it is to identify
      all the biological processes in such complex living realities. In
      fact, even today, there are huge voids and taxonomical
      approximations in mycology. <br>
      It is worthwhile to examine more deeply this strange world, with
      such peculiar characteristics, and try to highlight those elements
      that somehow may be pertinent to the problems of oncology. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>1) Fungi are heterotrophic organisms and therefore need,
      as far as nitrogen and carbon are concerned, pre-formed compounds.
      Of these compounds, simple carbohydrates, for example
      monosaccarides (glucose, fructose, and mannose) are among the most
      utilised sugars. This means that fungi, during their life cycle,
      depend on other living beings, which must be exploited in
      different degrees for their feeding. This occurs both in a
      saprophytic way (that is, by feeding on organic waste) and in a
      parasitic way (that is, by attacking the tissue of the host
      directly). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>2) Fungi show a great variety of reproductive
      manifestations (sexual, asexual, gemmation; these manifestations
      can often be observed simultaneously in the same mycete), combined
      with a great morphostructural variety of organs. All of this is
      directed toward the end of spore formation, to which the
      continuity and propagation of the species is entrusted. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3) In mycology, it is often possible to observe a
      particular phenomenon called heterocarion, characterised by the
      coexistence of normal and mutant nuclei in cells that have
      undergone a hyphal fusion. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Nowadays, phitopathologists are quite worried about the
      creation of individuals that are genetically quite different even
      from the parents. This difference has taken place by means of
      those reproductive cycles, which are called parasexual. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The indiscriminate use of phitopharmaceuticals has in
      fact often determined mutations of the nuclei of many parasite
      fungi with the consequent creation of heterocarion -- and this is
      sometimes particularly virulent in its pathogenicity (4). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4) In the parasitic dimension, fungi can develop from
      the hyphas more or less beak-shaped specialised structures that
      allow the penetration of the host. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>5) The production of spores can be so abundant as to
      always include, at every cycle, tens, hundreds, and even thousands
      of millions of elements that can be dispersed at a remarkable
      distance from the point of origin (a small movement is sufficient,
      for example, to implement immediate diffusion). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6) Spores have an immense resistance to external
      aggression, for they are capable of staying dormant in adverse
      conditions for many years, while preserving unaltered their
      regenerative potentialities. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>7) The development coefficient of the hyphal apexes
      after the germination is extremely fast (100 microns per minute
      under ideal conditions) with ramification capacity, thus with the
      appearance of a new apex region that in some cases is in the
      neighbourhood of 40-60 seconds (6). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>8) The shape of the fungus is never defined, for it is
      imposed by the environment in which the fungus develops. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is possible to observe, for example, the same
      mycelium in the simple isolated hyphas status in a liquid
      environment or in the form of aggregates that are increasingly
      solid and compact up to the formation of pseudoparenchymas and of
      filaments and mycelial strings (7). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>9) By the same token, it is possible to observe in
      different fungi the same shape whenever they must adapt to the
      same environment (this is called dimorphism). <br>
      The partial or total substitution of nourishing substances induces
      frequent mutations in fungi, and this is further proof of their
      high adaptability to any sub-strata. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>10) When the nutritional conditions are precarious, many
      fungi react with hyphal fusion (among nearby fungi) which allows
      them to explore the available material more easily, using more
      complete physiological processes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This property, which substitutes co-operation for
      competition, makes them distinct from any other microorganism, and
      for this reason Buller calls them social organisms (8). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>11) When a cell gets old or becomes damaged (i.e. by a
      toxic substance or by a pharmaceutical) many fungi whose
      intercellular septums are provided with a pore react by
      implementing of a defence process called protoplasmic flux through
      which they transfer the nucleus and cytoplasm of the damaged cell
      into a healthy one, thus conserving unaltered all their biological
      potential. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>12) The phenomena regulating the development of hyphal
      ramification are unknown to date (9). They consist either of a
      rhythmic development, or in the appearance of sectors which,
      though they originate from the hyphal system, are self-regulating
      (10), that is, independent of the regulating action and behaviour
      of the rest of the colony. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>13) Fungi are capable of implementing an infinite number
      of modifications to their own metabolism in order to overcome the
      defence mechanism of the host. These modifications are implemented
      through plasmatic and biochemical actions as well as by a
      volumetric increase (hypertrophy) and numerical hyperplasy of the
      cells that have been attacked (11). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>14) Fungi are so aggressive as to attack not only
      plants, animal tissue, food supplies and other fungi, but even
      protozoa, amoebas and nematodes. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Fungi hunt nematodes, for example, with peculiar hyphal
      modifications that constitute real mycelial criss-cross, viscose,
      or ring traps that achieve the immobilisation of the worms, as a
      precursor their hyphal invasion. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In some cases, the aggressive power of fungi is so great
      as to allow it, with only a cellular ring made up of three units,
      to tighten in its grip, capture and kill its prey in a short time
      notwithstanding the prey's desperate struggling. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From the short notations above, therefore, it seems fair
      to dedicate a greater attention to the world of fungi, especially
      considering the fact that biologists and microbiologists
      constantly highlight large deficiencies and voids in all their
      descriptions and interpretations of the fungi's shape, physiology
      and reproduction. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>So the fungus, which is the most powerful and the most
      organised micro-organism known, seems to be an extremely logical
      candidate as a cause of neoplastic proliferation. Imperfect Fungi
      (so called because of the lack of knowledge and understanding of
      their biological processes) deserve particular attention since
      their essential prerogative sits in their fermentative capacity. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The greatest disease of mankind may therefore hide
      within the small cluster of pathogenic fungi, and may be after all
      be located with just some simple deductions able to close the
      circle and providing the solution. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Considering that, among the human parasite species, the
      Dermatophytes and Sporotrichum demonstrate an excessively specific
      morbidity, and that experience shows that Actinomycetes,
      Toluropsis and Hystoplasma rarely enter the context of pathology,
      the Candid Albicans clearly emerges as the sole candidate for
      tumoral proliferation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we stop for a second and reflect on its
      characteristics, we can observe many analogies with neoplastic
      disease. The most evident are: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>1) Ubiquitous attachment: no organ or tissue is spared </blockquote>
    <blockquote>2) The constant absence of hyperpyrexia </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3) Sporadic and indirect involvement of the differential
      tissues </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4) Invasiveness that is almost exclusively of the focal
      type </blockquote>
    <blockquote>5) Progressive debilitation </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6) Refractivity to any type of treatment </blockquote>
    <blockquote>7) Proliferation facilitated by multiplicity of
      indifferent cofounders </blockquote>
    <blockquote>8) Symptomatological basic configuration with structure
      tending to the chronic </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Therefore an exceptionally high and diversified
      pathogenic potentiality exists in this mycete of just a few
      microns in size, which, even though it cannot be traced with the
      present experimental instruments, cannot be neglected from the
      clinical point of view. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Certainly, its present nosological classification cannot
      be satisfactory, because if we do not keep the possibly endless
      parasitic configurations in mind, that classification is too
      simplistic and constraining. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We therefore have to hypothesise that Candida, in the
      moment it is attacked by the immunological system of the host or
      by a conventional antimycotic treatment, does not react in the
      usual, predicted way, but defends itself by transforming itself
      into ever-smaller and non-differentiated elements that maintain
      their fecundity intact to the point of hiding their presence both
      to the host organism and to possible diagnostic investigations. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The Candida's behaviour may be considered to be almost
      elastic: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When favourable conditions exist, it thrives on an
      epithelium; as soon as the tissue reaction is engaged, it
      massively transforms itself into a form that is less productive
      but impervious to attack -- the spore. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If then continuous sub-epithelial solutions take place
      coupled with a greater a-reactivity in that very moment the spore
      gets deeper in the lower connective tissue in such an impervious
      state, it is irreversible. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact, the Candida takes advantage of a structural
      interchangeability utilising, according to the difficulties to
      overcome its biological niche. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In this way, Candida is free to expand to maturation in
      the soil, air, water, vegetation, etc., that is, wherever there is
      no antibody reaction. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the epithelium, instead, it takes a mixed form, that
      is reduced to the sole spore component when it penetrates in the
      lower epithelial levels, where it tends to expand again in the
      presence of conditions tissular a-reactivity. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The initial mandatory step of an in-depth research
      endeavour would be to understand if and in which dimensions the
      spore transcends; what mechanisms it engages to hide itself or,
      again, if it preserves its parasitical characteristic, or if it
      has available a neutral quiescent position, which is difficult or
      even impossible to detect by the immunological system. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Unfortunately today we do not have the appropriate
      means, either theoretical or technical, to answer these and
      similar questions, so that the only valid suggestions can come
      solely from clinical observation and experience. While not
      providing immediate solutions, these sources can at stimulate
      further questions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Assuming that Candida Albicans is the agent responsible
      for tumoral development, a targeted therapy would keep into
      account not just its static and macroscopic manifestations, but
      even the ultramicroscopic ones especially in their dynamic
      valence, that is, the reproductive. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is very probable that the targets to attack are the
      fungi's dimensional transition points in order to perform a
      decontamination with such a scope as to include the whole spectrum
      of the biological expression: parasitic, vegetative, sporal, and
      even ultra-dimensional and, to the limit, viral. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we stop at the most evident phenomena, we risk
      administering salves and unguents forever (in the case of
      dermatomycosis or in psoriasis), or to clumsily attack (with
      surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy) enigmatic tumoral masses
      with the sole result of facilitating their propagation, which is
      already heightened in the mycelial forms. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Why, one may ask, should we assume a different and
      heightened activity of Candida Albicans since it has been
      abundantly described in its pathological manifestations? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The answer lies in the fact that it has been studied
      only in a pathogenic context, that is, only in relation to the
      epithelial tissues. In reality Candida possesses an aggressive
      valence that is diversified in function of the target tissue. It
      is just in the connective or in the connective environment, in
      fact, and not in the differentiated tissues, that Candida may find
      conditions favourable to an unlimited expansion. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This emerges if we stop and reflect for a moment on the
      main function of connective tissue, which is to convey and supply
      nourishing substances to the cells of the whole organism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This is to be considered as an environment external to
      the more differentiated cells such as nervous, muscular, etc. It
      is in this context, in fact, that the alimentary competition takes
      place. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>On one hand we have the organism's cellular elements
      trying to defeat all forms of invasion; on the other hand, we have
      fungal cells trying to absorb ever-growing quantities of
      nourishing substances, for they have to obey the species'
      biological imperative to form ever-larger and diffused masses and
      colonies. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From the combination of various factors pertinent both
      to the host and the aggressor, it is possible to hypothesise the
      evolution of a candidosis; </blockquote>
    <blockquote>First stage Integer epitheliums, absence of the
      debilitating factors. Candida can only exist as saprophyte </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Second Non-integer epitheliums (erosions, abrasions,
      etc.), absence of stage debilitating factors, unusual transitory
      conditions (acidosis, metabolic disorder, and microbial disorder).
      Candida expands superficially (classic mycosis, both exogenous and
      endogenous). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Third Non-integer epitheliums, presence of debilitating
      factors (toxic, stage radiant, traumatic, neuropsychic, etc.).
      Candida goes deeper into the sub-epithelial levels from which it
      can be carried to the whole organism through the blood and lymph
      (intimate mycosis). (12) </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Stages one and two are the most studied and known, while
      stage three, though it has been described in its morphological
      diversity, is reduced to a silent form of saprophytism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This is not acceptable from a logical point of view,
      because no one can demonstrate the harmlessness of the fungal
      cells in the deepest parts of the organism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact, the assumption that Candida can behave in the
      same saprophytic manner that is observed on integer epitheliums
      when it has successfully penetrated the lower levels is at least
      risky, because the assumption would have to be sustained by
      concepts that are totally aleatory. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In fact, we asked not only to accept a priori that the
      connective environment is (a) not suitable to nourish the Candida,
      but also at the same time to accept (b) the omnipotence of the
      body's defence system towards an organic structure that is
      invasive but that then becomes vulnerable once lodged in the
      deeper tissues. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>As to point a), it is difficult to imagine that a
      micro-organism so able to adapt itself to any sub-strata cannot
      find elements to support itself in the human organic substance; by
      the same token, it seems risky to hypothesise that the human
      organism's defence system is totally efficient at every moment of
      its existence. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Finally, the assumption that there is a tendency to a
      state of quiescence and vulnerability in the case of a pathogenic
      agent such as fungus -- the most invasive and aggressive
      microorganism existing in nature -- seems to carry a whiff of
      irresponsible. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is therefore urgent, on the basis of the
      above-mentioned considerations, to recognise the hazardous nature
      of such a pathogenic agent, which is capable of easily taking the
      most various biological configurations, both biochemical and
      structural, in function of the condition of the host organism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The fungal expansion gradient in fact becomes steeper as
      the tissue that is the host of the mycotic invasion becomes less
      eutrophic, and thus less reactive. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To that end, it seems useful to briefly consider the
      "benign tumour" nosological entity. This is an issue that always
      appears in general pathology but that indeed is brushed aside most
      of the time too easily, and it is overlooked, since it usually
      doesn't create either problems or worries. It constitutes one of
      those underestimated grey areas seldom subjected to rational,
      fresh consideration. <br>
      If the benign tumour, however, is not considered a full-fledged
      tumour, it would be advantageous, for clarity, to categorise it in
      an appropriate nosological scheme. If, instead, it is thought that
      it fully belongs to neoplastic pathology, then it is necessary to
      consider its non-invasive character and consequently to consider
      the reasons for this. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is in fact evident how in this second scenario, the
      thesis based on a presumed predisposition of the organism to
      auto-phagocytosis, having to admit an expressive graduation, would
      stumble into such additional difficulties such as to become
      extremely improbable. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>By contrast, in the fungal scenario, the mystery of why
      there are benign and malignant tumours is exhaustively solved,
      since they can be recognised as having same etiological genesis. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The benignity or malignancy of a cancer in fact depends
      on the capability of tissular reaction of a specific organ
      expressing itself ultimately in the ability to encyst fungal
      cells, and to prevent them from developing in ever-larger
      colonies. This can be achieved more easily where the ratio between
      differentiated cells and connective tissue is in favour of the
      former. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Situated between the impervious noble tissues, then, and
      the defenceless connective, the differentiated connective
      structures (the glandular structures in particular) represent that
      medium term which is only somewhat vulnerable to attack, because
      of an ability to offer a certain type of defence. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>And it is in these conditions that benign tumours are
      formed, that is, where the glandular connective tissue is
      successful in forming hypertrophic and hyperplastic cellular
      embankments against the parasites. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the stomach and in the lung, instead, since there are
      no specific glandular units, the target organ, provided with a
      small defensive capability, is at the mercy of the invader.
      Furthermore, it is worth mentioning how several types of intimate
      fungal invasion do not determine the appearance of malignant or
      benign tumours, but a type of particular benign tumour (specific
      degenerative alterations) as is the case of some organs or
      apparatuses that do not have peculiar glandular structures, but
      nevertheless are attacked in their connective tissue, but in a
      limited way. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we consider, in fact, multiple sclerosis, SLA,
      psoriasis, nodular panartherite, etc. the possible development of
      the fungus in a three-dimensional sense is actually limited by the
      anatomic configuration of the invaded tissues, so that only a
      longitudinal expansion is allowed. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Going back to the precondition of a-reactivity that is
      necessary for neoplastic development in a specific individual, it
      is permissible to affirm how in the human body each external or
      internal element that determines a reduction of well-being in an
      organism, organ or tissue, possesses oncogenic potentiality. This
      is not so much because of an intrinsic damaging capability as much
      as for a generic property of favouring the fungal (that is,
      tumoral) flourishing. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Then the causal network so much invoked in contemporary
      oncology, which involves toxic, genetic, immunological,
      psychological, geographical, moral, social, and other factors,
      finds a correct classification only in a mycotic infectious
      perspective where the arithmetical and diachronic summation of
      harmful elements works as a cofactor to the external aggression. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Having theoretically demonstrated the equivalency tumour
      = fungus, it is clear how this interpretative key offers a long
      series of questions concerning the contemporary therapies both
      oncological (used without reference indexes) and antimycotic
      (utilised only at a superficial level). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Which path is best to walk today, then, when faced with
      a cancer patient, since the conventional oncological treatment,
      not being etiological, can only occasionally have positive effects
      and most of the time produces damage? </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In the fungal perspective in fact, the effectiveness of
      surgery is noticeably reduced because of the extreme diffusibility
      and invasiveness characteristic of a mycelial conglomerate.
      Surgery's to solve the problem is therefore tied to the case -- to
      conditions, that is, in which one has the luck to completely
      remove the entire colony (which is often possible in the presence
      of a sufficient encystment; but here we are in the case of benign
      tumours). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Chemotherapy and radiotherapy produce almost exclusively
      negative effects, both for their specific ineffectiveness, and for
      their high toxicity and harmfulness to the tissues, which in the
      last analysis favours mycotic aggressiveness. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>By contrast, an anti-fungal, anti-tumour specific
      therapy would keep into account the importance of the connective
      tissue, together with the reproductive complexity of fungi. Only
      by attacking the fungi across the spectrum of all its forms, at
      points where it is most vulnerable from the nutritional point of
      view, would it be possible to hope to eradicate them from the
      human organism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The first step to take, therefore, would be to reinforce
      the cancer patient with generic reconstituent measures (nutrition,
      tonics, regulation of rhythms and vital functions), that are able
      to enhance, by themselves, the general defences of the organism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Concerning the possibility of having available
      pharmaceutical cures which unfortunately do not exist today, it
      seems useful, in the attempt to find an anti-fungal substance that
      is quite diffusible and therefore effective, to consider the
      extreme sensitivity of Candida towards sodium bicarbonate (i.e. in
      the oral candidosis of breasted babies). This is consistent with
      the fact that Candida has an accentuated ability to reproduce in
      an acid environment. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Theoretically, therefore, if treatments that put the
      fungus in direct contact with high bicarbonate concentrations
      could be found, we should be able to see a regression of the
      tumoral masses. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>And this is what happens in many types of tumour, such
      as colon, liver -- and especially stomach and lung -- the former
      susceptible to regression just because of its "external" anatomic
      position, the latter because of the high diffusibility of sodium
      bicarbonate in the bronchial system and for its high
      responsiveness to general reconstituent measures. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>By applying a similar therapeutic approach, it has been
      possible in some patients (about 30 in the last 15 years) to
      achieve complete remission of the symptomatology and normalisation
      of the instrumental data. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Following are the reports of seven cases of patients,
      some of whom survived more than 10 years. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is important to emphasise that these cases are
      presented just as an example of what could be a new way of
      perceiving the complexity of medical problems, especially in
      oncology. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is clear, in fact, that because of the very limited
      number of cases, the lack of documentation showing rigid, orthodox
      experimental methodology, and the long time that has elapsed since
      these cases were treated, that the evidence required for strong
      support of this theory on cancer is lacking. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>I will not indicate in this paper the personal, cultural
      and professional reasons that were responsible for the
      interruption of the study and cure of cancer patients until
      recently (that is, until two or three years ago, when I resumed
      the treatment of cancer cases). I am however convinced that the
      important fact that some patients have been able to heal and
      survive for several years with therapies that are different from
      the common, deadly therapeutic methods, must be divulged. This is
      especially because these results come from a new way of thinking
      which, as opposed to groping in the dark as official and various
      alternative medicines do, has a well-defined subject -- fungi --
      in a theory which of course is still to be proven and validated. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>One may ask why more recent cases are not shown below.
      This is because insufficient time has elapsed since treatment for
      a demonstration of long-term well being of the patients, and
      therefore these cases are not included. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>It is also important to highlight that nowadays it is
      very difficult to have a large number of cases, since it is not
      easy to obtain a large number of cancer patients -- they are
      addressed by the current system almost exclusively toward the
      official channels of medicine, even if in many cases those have
      been proven ineffective or deadly. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Keeping the above in mind, I consider it useful to
      describe these cases as follows: </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 1: A 70-year old female patient with diagnosis of
      stomach adenocarcinoma confirmed by commonly accepted oncological
      tests (TAK, biopsy, etc.). Two days before the scheduled
      operation, she accepts the suggestion of trying a less sanguinary
      approach, and leaves the hospital. For the period of a month, she
      is administered sodium bicarbonate (one teaspoon in a glass of
      water) to ingest half an hour before breakfast (that is, on an
      empty stomach) for the purpose of maximising the effect. After
      about two months normalisation of the gastric function takes place
      with attenuation at first, and eventual loss of all the
      symptomatology related to neoplastic pathology (lack of appetite,
      digestion troubles, fatigue, lipothymic events, etc.). After an
      endoscopic examination performed one year after the beginning of
      therapy, the total remission of neoplastic formation is
      ascertained and the patient refuses further investigation. <br>
      The patient is still alive today, 15 years after the treatment. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 2: A 67-year-old patient with a long history of
      gastric ulcer is diagnosed with stomach cancer and a gastrectomy
      is suggested. The patient, believing his disease is just an
      exacerbation of the ulcer, wants to find an alternative to
      surgery. He therefore accepted a therapy with sodium bicarbonate
      as in case 1. The therapy determines in a few months the
      regression of the neoplastic symptomatology. After about 18
      months, during which no check-up is performed, upon the return of
      symptomatology, treatment is resumed as above. Gastric
      functionality is quickly re-established and maintained for about
      eight years, after which contact with the patient is lost. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 3: A 58-year-old patient with stomach carcinoma is
      diagnosed through histological examination performed on
      endoscopical sample. The patient chooses not to undergo the
      conventional therapies and he decides to accept a therapy similar
      to that in the two preceding cases. The resulting effect is a
      normalisation of symptomatology for about three years, that is,
      until there are no further medical check-ups. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 4: In September, 1983, a 71-year-old patient
      undergoes a hospital check-up in a serious condition of emaciation
      caused by a large weight loss (about 15 Kgs.) which occurred over
      the prior few months. Once a stomach neoplastic condition has been
      diagnosed, and after the layout of a combined oncological
      therapeutic scheme, the relatives are informed. The relatives are
      also informed of the difficulties and risks of such treatment, to
      be administered to such a debilitated patient. The wife decides to
      refuse the conventional approach and decides to bring the husband
      home and try the "harmless" therapy of baking soda, which is
      administered in a lower dosage than in the preceding cases. That
      restores appetite and a satisfactory digestive functionality. <br>
      For about eight months the patient has difficulty regaining
      weight. After this, the improvement is more and more evident, with
      the almost complete regaining of the lost weight (within 24
      months) and a considerable improvement of the patient's general
      condition. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 5: A 51-year-old patient diagnosed at the end of
      1983 with bronchial carcinoma in the lower right lobe has the
      diagnosis confirmed by routine oncological tests (distinctively
      positive TAK but negative bronchial residue. Surgery is
      proposed.The family decides to delay surgery and try the
      bicarbonate treatment. Radiological examination is performed 18
      months after the treatment. During these months there are no
      emophtoic episodes as occurred at the beginning of the disease.
      The radiological examination still indicates the presence of a
      nodular mass in the lower part of the right lobe, but its
      dimensions appear to be smaller and the contours of the mass more
      regular. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 6: A 48-year-old patient with tumour in the middle
      lobe of the lung that has been confirmed by all oncological
      examinations is put on a waiting list for surgery at the beginning
      of 1983. Incidentally, the execution modality does not seem to be
      completely defined because the neoplastic mass exceeds the limits.
      The patient leaves the hospital against the advice of doctors - to
      the point that the doctors look for him for several months. He
      then submits to a bicarbonate therapy which is able to
      re-establish healthy conditions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>A radiological examination performed after nine months
      reveals that the neoplastic mass has been replaced by a tenuous
      transversal line located at the base of the medium lobe that can
      be interpreted as a residual scar. The patient is still living. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Case 7: In 1981, a 55-year-old patient is affected by
      rectal neoplasy that has been evidentiated through symptoms such
      as problems with evacuation and bleeding, and, instrumentally,
      through endoscopic examination. Doctors suggest rectal resection
      and consequent surgical construction of a preternatural anus. In
      the attempt to avoid this mutilation, the patient submits to a
      local therapy with bicarbonate performed with enemas containing a
      high bicarbonate solution -- 8 teaspoons per litre. Three years
      after the treatment, the patient was still living. </blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>Critical considerations</b> </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Having explained the theory and having briefly
      illustrated the cases, it seems appropriate to analyse, in a
      critical and self-critical spirit, what may emerge in neoplastic
      pathology that is new and concrete. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If we closely observe the proposed therapeutic approach
      it is possible to see that, independently of its real
      effectiveness, it has value as an innovative theory. First, it
      challenges the present methodology and especially its assumptions.
      Second, it offers a concrete alternative proposal to a mountain of
      conjectures and postures that sound authoritative but are too
      generic and therefore ineffective. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The identification of one tumoral cause, even with all
      the possible general provisos, would represent a step forward that
      is indispensable for escaping that passivity determined by a lack
      of results, and which is responsible for medical behaviours that
      are based too much on faith and not enough on real confidence. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Given, therefore, that an unconventional medical
      approach can benefit some patients better - from any point of view
      - than the official treatments, and since valuable results can be
      demonstrated, this should stimulate us to pursue further research
      while avoiding patronising postures that are both limiting and
      non-productive. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We can therefore discuss whether or not sodium
      bicarbonate is the real reason for the recoveries or if, instead,
      those recoveries are due to the interaction of a number of
      conditions that have been created, the results of unidentified
      neuro-psychical factors, or maybe the results of something totally
      unknown. What is beyond question, however, is the fact that a
      certain number of people, by not following conventional methods,
      have been able to go back to normality without suffering and
      without mutilation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The message of this experience is therefore a call to
      search for those solutions that are in accord with the simple
      Hippocratic premise of man's "well-being"; that is, we must be a
      stimulated to a critical evaluation of our contemporary
      oncological therapies which indubitably can guarantee suffering. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>One thing is certain: nowadays it is no longer
      legitimate (for we are the prey of panic and of the "tumoral
      syndrome"), to tolerate the slaughtering of patients in the name
      of a "compassionate" obligation to help and be helped, without the
      support of solid etiological foundations. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If, for a moment, we take a different point of view and
      try to look at the world of the tumour with new eyes, that is, by
      hypothesising a simpler genesis of neoplastic proliferation, even
      the fungal one, we may be appalled and frightened by the ignorant
      hand of official medicine - a hand that is armed, however, with
      great cynicism and profound superficiality. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>One could argue that the failures represent the
      inevitable price to pay to save people's lives. But when the
      suffering and the "authorised deaths" overwhelm the patient
      recoveries (that seem, indeed, to be random or due to factors not
      related to the therapies performed), then it is no longer
      acceptable to operate at all costs and regardless of the
      consequences, for in doing so, we are destined only to hurt
      people. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>One can rebut that the recoveries obtained by using
      present oncological protocols are not so few, and that in certain
      types of tumour recoveries are a high percentage. It is easy to
      see, however, that these results are nothing but the outcome of
      propaganda sustained by surreptitious argumentation shedding false
      light on the subject of tumoral nosological entities. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>When we group together both malignant tumours that are
      occasionally or never healed (such as lung and stomach), tumours
      that border with benignity (such as the majority of thyroid and
      prostatic tumours, etc.) or put them together with those that have
      an autonomous positive outcome notwithstanding chemotherapy (i.e.
      infantile leukaemia) - all of this appears to be devious and
      misleading, having only the purpose of forging a consensus that
      would otherwise be impossible to obtain with intellectually
      ethical behaviour. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If, for example, out of a certain number of tumour
      species only one is susceptible to regression, it is not
      legitimate to create a nosologic diagram reporting on the global
      incidence of applied therapeutics regardless of the total
      neoplasm's. In fact, it would be more appropriate to report the
      uselessness, even the harmfulness of doing so, and leave an open
      field for alternative hypotheses as far as the demonstration of
      positive behaviour by the heteroplasm is concerned. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>If, for example, we go back for a moment to infantile
      leukaemia, the frequent positive outcomes can be correlated with
      elements that are extraneous to the therapies administered. For
      example, they can be correlated with those common supportive
      therapies, which are considered particularly effective in young
      organisms. They can be correlated with the ability of the
      connective tissue to acquire, in a particular stage of growth and
      development, that maturity which is necessary to the strengthening
      of an immunological activity that is, at a certain point in life,
      intrinsically insufficient. <br>
      It is in fact frequent in medicine that some diseases disappear
      spontaneously, without apparent reason, but in correlation with
      certain transitions of organic maturation. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>On the oncological-mycological issue, it is known how
      psoriasis and some chronic and recurrent mycoses of infancy that
      reject any treatment suddenly, at a certain stage of the body's
      development, disappear completely without a trace. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>From the examples noted, which could be uselessly
      multiplied ad infinitum, it is evident that the full panorama of
      tumoral disease is extremely varied and complex. It follows that,
      taking postures that are exclusive or preclusive, whether they are
      conventional or unconventional, may indicate a lack of vision.
      This is especially so since the terrain we are exploring is
      largely unknown, and therefore cannot be charted in a way that is
      uniform or standardised. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Wherever we consider an environment occupied by
      invisible ultra-microscopic elements, and since the structure of
      knowledge must inevitably rest on the construction of a
      multiplicity of theoretical entities, there is a risk of slipping
      from a perception that reflects reality to one that is merely
      fictional. The acceptance of such a fictional construct may become
      a pernicious reality. <br>
      The fact that modern medicine not only cannot offer sufficient
      interpretative criteria but even uses dangerous methodologies that
      are also harmful and meaningless - even if carried out with good
      faith - is something which must push us all to search for humane
      and logical alternatives. At the same time, it is necessary to
      carefully, open-mindedly, and logically consider any theory or
      point of view that is dared to be advanced in the battle against
      that monstrous and inhuman yoke that is the tumour. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>To this end, a note of acknowledgement is to go to all
      those who are aware of the harmfulness of conventional therapeutic
      methods and constantly try to find alternative solutions. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>People like Di Bella, Govallo and others, though guilty
      of utilising the same inauspicious principles of official medicine
      (thus showing an excessively conformist mindset) are actually
      using common sense by trying to relieve the suffering of cancer
      patients through the use of painless methodologies and, in some
      cases, are able to achieve remissions even though in the dark
      about the real causes of cancer. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In an alternative perspective, then, it would be
      necessary to conceive a new approach to experimentation in the
      oncological field, setting epidemiological, etiological,
      pathogenical, clinical and therapeutical research in line with a
      renewed microbiology and mycology that would probably drive to the
      conclusion already illustrated; that is, the tumour is a fungus -
      the Candida Albicans. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>The possible discovery that not only tumours but also
      the majority of chronic degenerative disease could be reconciled
      to mycotic causality would represent a qualitative quantum leap,
      which, by revolutionising medical thinking, could greatly improve
      life expectancy and quality of life. Such reconciliation might
      include a wider spectrum of fungal parasites (for example, in
      diseases of the connective tissues, multiple sclerosis, psoriasis,
      some epileptic forms, diabetes II, etc.). </blockquote>
    <blockquote>In closing, if the world of fungi - those most complex
      and aggressive micro-organisms - has until now too often been
      bypassed and left unobserved, the hope of this work is that we
      will quickly become aware of the hazards of these micro-organisms
      so that medical resources can be channelled not up blind alleys
      but toward the real enemies of the human organism: external
      infectious agents. </blockquote>

        SIMONCINI CANCER THERAPY - THE TREATMENT BY SODIUM BICARBONATE</b></blockquote>
    <blockquote>A logical solution to the cancer problem, based on the
      arguments put forward so far, seems to stem from the world of
      fungi against which, at the moment, there is no useful remedy
      other than, in my opinion, sodium bicarbonate. The anti-fungins
      that are currently on the market, in fact, do not have the ability
      to penetrate the masses (except perhaps early administrations of
      azoli or of amfotercina B delivered parenterally), since they are
      conceived to act only at a stratified level of the epithelial
      type. They are therefore unable to affect mycelial aggregations
      that are set volumetrically and also when masked by the
      connectival reaction that attempts to circumscribe them. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We have seen that fungi are also able to quickly mutate
      their genetic structure. That means that after an initial phase of
      sensitivity to fungicides, in a short time they are able to codify
      them and to metabolize them without being damaged by them –
      rather, paradoxically, they extract a benefit from their high
      toxicity on the organism. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>This happens, for example, in the prostate invasive
      carcinoma with congealed pelvis. There is a therapy with
      anti-fungins for this affliction, which at first is very effective
      at the symptomatological level but consistently loses its
      effectiveness with time. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Sodium bicarbonate, instead, as it is extremely
      diffusible and without that structural complexity that fungi can
      easily codify, retains its ability to penetrate the masses for a
      long time. This is also and especially due to the speed at which
      it disintegrates them, which makes it impossible for the fungi to
      adapt so that it cannot defend itself. A therapy with bicarbonate
      should therefore be set up using a strong dosage, continuously,
      and in cycles without pauses in a work of destruction which should
      proceed from the beginning to the end without interruption for at
      least 7-8 days for the first cycle, keeping in mind that a mass of
      2-3-4 centimeters begins to regress consistently from the third to
      the fourth day, and collapses from the fourth to the fifth. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>Generally speaking, the maximum limit of the dosage that
      can be administered in a session gravitates around 500 cm3 of
      sodium bicarbonate at five per cent solution, with the possibility
      of increasing or decreasing the dosage by 20 per cent as a
      function of the body mass of the individual to be treated and in
      the presence of multiple localizations upon which to apportion a
      greater quantity of salts. </blockquote>
    <blockquote>We must underline that the dosages indicated, as they
      are harmless, are the very same that have already been utilized
      without any problem for more than 30 years in a myriad of other
      morbid situations such as: </blockquote>

    <p style="margin-left: 0.48in;"><!--BEGIN ABSTRACT-->Tullio
      Simoncini claims that cancer is caused by a fungus and can be
      cured with the administration of sodium bicarbonate. There is no
      scientific evidence to support this claim, and there is good
      reason to believe that the treatment is dangerous.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.48in;">In October 2007, a charge was
      brought against the Clinic for Preventive Medicine (CPM) in
      Bilthoven, the Netherlands. This clinic houses a mixture of small
      enterprises, where physicians and nonphysicians offer a great
      variety of "alternative" treatments. A 50-year- old patient with
      breast cancer who was treated at this clinic was admitted to the
      emergency department of the University Medical Center of the Free
      University of Amsterdam, where she died within a few days. The
      attending physician refused to sign a death certificate, because
      the patient had died from a non-natural cause. It appeared that
      Simoncini had treated treated her at the Bilthoven clinic with
      injections and infusions of sodium bicarbonate. The clinic medical
      director denied any involvement, but two tenacious journalists of
      the Dutch newspaper <em>de Volkskrant</em> succeeded in finding
      out what had happened. The Public Prosecutor and the Netherlands
      Health Care Inspectorate have opened an investigation of the case.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.48in;">Because one of us (SJJ) is fluent in
      Italian, we could extensively search Italian Web sites for
      information on Simoncini's background. Currently living in Rome,
      he has been using unsubstantiated cancer treatments for 15 years.
      He calls himself a specialist in diabetes and metabolic diseases,
      but in 2003, his license to practice medicine was withdrawn, and
      in 2006 he was convicted by an Italian judge for wrongful death
      and swindling. This has not stopped him from continuing to provide
      his controversial treatments, not only in Italy, but apparently
      also in foreign countries, such as the Netherlands. He has
      appealed his conviction, but we could not find information on the
      status of this appeal on Italian Web sites.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.48in;">Simoncini claims that cancer is
      “simply” an infection (<em>il cancro è un fungo</em>) caused by <em>Candida





        albicans</em>, an opportunistic fungus. He claims that this
      intruder causes formation of cysts and an uncontrolled cell
      division in several organs, such as the liver and lungs. To
      eliminate fungal colonies, he administers sodium bicarbonate by
      intravenous infusion, by mouth, or even with intra-arterial
      catheters close to the tumor site. Simoncini claims that the
      tumors will become smaller and subsequently disappear completely
      in half of patients thus treated. He does not give any proof for
      this and has never published any data in a scientific journal. He
      also claims that the treatment is not dangerous, because sodium
      bicarbonate is also used in standard medical procedures. He fails
      to mention that this treatment is applied only in patients with
      definite disturbances of water and mineral metabolism and under
      meticulous clinical supervision. The highly concentrated solutions
      that he administers within a short period can disturb the mineral
      balance in the body and lead to serious and even fatal
      complications.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.48in;">Based on expert reports of two
      physicians, the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate has concluded that
      Simoncini's treatment is dangerous and should not be administered.
      Here is a translation of its news release:<br style="font-weight:

    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><strong>News from the
        Netherlands Health Inspectorate</strong><br>
      February 4, 2008 </p>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;" align="center"><strong>The
        Administration of Sodium Bicarbonate to Cancer Patients is
        Hazardous.</strong></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The infusion of sodium bicarbonate to
      vulnerable patients is hazardous and ineffective. This is the
      conclusion of two expert physicians who wrote reports on request
      of The Netherlands Health Inspectorate (Inspectie voor de
      Gezondheidszorg, IGZ). The IGZ asked them for advice when in 2007
      a patient with cancer died in the Free University Medical Centre
      in Amsterdam after she had received sodium bicarbonate in a clinic
      in Bilthoven. Currently, the clinic has, under the pressure of the
      IGZ, stopped administering this therapy and will not restart it.
      In the meantime it has not been firmly established that the
      patient has died as a consequence of the sodium bicarbonate
      administration. The Public Prosecutor is still investigating this.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Based on the expert report, the IGZ
      has first of all reached the conclusion that there are no
      scientific data that justify the administration of sodium
      bicarbonate to patients with cancer for other indications than
      described in the official prescription information. There is no
      scientific proof whatsoever showing that this therapy cures or can
      slow its progress. </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">The IGZ concludes that the
      administration of sodium bicarbonate even has risks for patients
      with high blood pressure, patients with diseases of lungs, heart,
      or kidneys and for patients with cancer. This is certainly the
      case if a number of specific blood levels are not monitored daily
      before, during and after the treatment. The balance of the body
      can become completely disturbed when large amounts are
      administered. In severely ill patients, this may lead to organ
      damage. In sick people, there is in fact irresponsible health care
      if this product is administered without monitoring.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 0.5in;">Given these risks and because there
      is no scientific basis for the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate
      apart from the registered indications, the IGZ concludes that
      physicians should not apply this treatment. If physicians
