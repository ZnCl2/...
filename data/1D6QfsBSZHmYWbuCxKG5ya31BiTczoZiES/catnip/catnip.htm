      <br>
      <i><b>Nepeta cataria</b></i> (also known as <b>catnip</b>, <b>catswort</b>,
      or <b>catmint</b>) is a plant in the Lamiaceae family. The common
      names can also be used to refer to the Nepeta genus as a whole.<br>
      <p><i>Nepeta cataria</i> is mostly used as a recreational
        substance for feline enjoyment. Roughly 50% of cats will be
        affected by the plant [2],<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catnip#cite_note-1"><span></span><span></span></a></sup>
        whether it is growing in the wild or harvested and dried.
        Approximately two hours after an exposure, the feline will be
        sensitive to another dose. The common behaviors that are
        observed are: rubbing on the plant, rolling on the ground,
        drooling, or consuming much of the plant. The plant terpenoid
        nepetalactone is the main chemical constituent of the essential
        oil of <i>Nepeta cataria</i> and acts as a feline attractant.
        This chemical enters the feline's nose, and produces effects on
        the cat. [3]<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catnip#cite_note-2"><span></span><span></span></a></sup></p>
      <p>Catnip has a history of human medicinal use for its soothing
        properties. It has also been known to have a slightly numbing
        effect. The plant has been consumed as a tea, juice, tincture,
        infusion or poultice, and has also been smoked. [4]&nbsp;<sup

      <p>NEW ORLEANS, LA - Known for its intoxicating effects on
        felines, catnip oil may also have a future in termite control.
        Recent experiments by USDA Forest Service researcher Chris
        Peterson show that catnip oil repels and even kills termites in
        a laboratory setting. </p>
      <p>Peterson, a researcher with the Forest Service Southern
        Research Station (SRS), and fellow researcher Janice Ems-Wilson,
        a chemist at Valencia Community College in Orlando, FL,
        presented the results of their research at the national meeting
        of the American Chemical Society held March 23 - 27 in New
        Orleans. </p>
      <p>An entomologist with the SRS Wood Products Insect Research unit
        in Starkville, MS, Peterson has been testing essential catnip
        oil as a possible replacement for the more toxic pesticides
        presently used to control termites. Probably the most common
        termite control method is treating the soil next to wood
        structures with chemical compounds: some of the active
        ingredients of traditional termiticides, such as chlordane and
        chlorpyrifos, have lost their registrations in the U.S. due to
        their toxicity. New, more eco-friendly compounds are being
        sought to fill the void. </p>
      <p>The search for new termiticidal products is active. "The USDA
        Forest Service routinely tests about three new termite
        formulations for effectiveness every year, with a new active
        ingredient tested about once in every two years," said Peterson.
        "Natural compounds from plants, bacteria, and fungi could
        provide new commercial products that are less toxic to humans
        and the environment." </p>
      <p>For their termite study, Peterson and Ems-Wilson infused sand
        with catnip essential oil--the kind routinely sold in pet
        stores--to test the effectiveness of the oil as a barrier to
        termite tunneling. To test vertical tunneling, the researchers
        placed yellow pine sapwood in the bottom of a test tube filled
        with sand. A two-inch barrier of catnip-treated sand separated
        the termites in the top layer of untreated sand from the pine.
        To test horizontal tunneling, the researchers constructed a
        barrier of treated sand across the middle of a transparent box
        of sand, again with the tempting pine placed across the barrier
        from the termites. In both tests, catnip oil reduced or
        eliminated termite tunneling. </p>
      <p>Peterson and Ems-Wilson also tested the catnip oil for its
        toxicity to termites by treating them directly with a dilution
        of the oil, fumigating them, and exposing them to catnip-infused
        soil. The researchers carefully counted the termites in the
        multiple tests on barriers to make sure the barrier-effect they
        found was not due to termite mortality. </p>
      <p>"At higher concentrations, the oil does kill termites, but not
        as effectively as the commercial compounds currently used in
        soil treatments," said Peterson. "Our results show that catnip
        oil is a very effective deterrent to termite tunneling, with the
        effective doses tested much lower than those reported for
        similar natural products." </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, catnip oil breaks down quickly in the
        environment. The chemicals now used to prevent termite
        infestation must remain effective for more than five years in
        government testing. "There is the inevitable tradeoff," said
        Peterson. "Chemicals that last a long time also have greater
        potential for environmental damage. We hope that the active
        ingredients in catnip oil can eventually be modified to last
        longer." </p>
      <p>Peterson emphasizes that his experiments are preliminary:
        catnip oil has not been officially tested for safety and
        effectiveness in the field. "The other factor is cost," said
        Peterson. "Catnip oil is much too expensive to use at effective
        rates when compared to other compounds. Until a way is found to
        produce the oil competitively and formulate it for long-term
        use, its only practical use would be for controlling isolated
        populations of termites." </p>
      <p>The mission of the SRS Wood Products Insect Research unit is to
        improve the protection of wood products from subterranean
        termite damage, define the role of termites in forest
        ecosystems, and understand their impact on forest health. For

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- The purpose of
      my invention is to find a more effective insect repellent that is
      safe for the environment and people. Catnip is an herb that was
      once used for medicinal purposes such as colic in babies, and skin
      irritations. Lemon juice is found in most refrigerators across the
      country. This is the combination I have used to develop my insect
      repellent, BUGNIP. DEET, the most common insect repellent, can
      have serious adverse side effects from overuse, and use on small
      children. BUGNIP is made from ingredients that have been used
      medicinally through the centuries, and will not have adverse side
      effects. This is especially important today, while West Nile is a
      threat. People are concerned about the adverse effects of
      chemically based repellents, and do not want to use them. This is
      where my invention, BUGNIP, is different from other repellents. It
      is safe, and it repels insects.<br>

      is from a biorational source, such as a plant volatile. In a
      particular embodiment, the plant volatile is a monoterpenoid, such
      as "nepetalactone" (or the individual nepetalactone isomers)
      derived from catnip (Nepeta cataria). In another embodiment, the
      plant volatile is any one or a combination of sesquiterpenoids
      derived from the fruit of the Osage orange tree (Maclura

      [0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional

      incorporated in its entirety as a part hereof for all purposes.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TECHNICAL FIELD</span><br>
      <br>
      [0002] The present invention provides processes for improved
      recovery of essential oils from the catmint (catnip) plant Nepeta
      cataria.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br>
      <br>
      [0003] It has been recently demonstrated that dihydronepetalactone
      exhibits insect repellency (see, for example, U.S. Ser. No.
      05/112,166). Dihydronepetalactone can be obtained from the
      essential oil of the catmint plant, Nepeta cataria. Essential oil
      from N. cataria, herein referred to as catmint oil, has been
      obtained by various isolation processes, including steam
      distillation, organic solvent extraction, microwave-assisted
      organic solvent extraction, supercritical fluid extraction,
      mechanical extraction and enfleurage (initial cold extraction into
      fats followed by organic solvent extraction). Steam distillation
      [such as described by Regnier, F. E. et al, Phytochemistry (1967)
      6:1281-1289] is the most economically viable method for obtaining
      catmint oil.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Yields of catmint oil obtained using standard distillation
      techniques are likely insufficient, however, for commercial
      production of the insect repellent dihydronepetalactone as derived
      from catmint oil. A need thus remains for improved techniques for
      the recovery of catmint oil from catmint plants.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</span><br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</span><br>
      <br>
      [0016] This invention provides improved processes for steam
      distilling plant material from Nepeta cataria, thereby achieving a
      greater yield of the essential oil thereof, herein referred to as
      catmint oil ("CMO").<br>
      <br>
      [0017] Catmint oil from N. cataria is comprised predominantly of
      trans-cis and/or cis-trans isomers of nepetalactone, but also may
      comprise extraneous components including unsaturated components
      such as caryophyllenes, carvones, limonenes and other
      sesquiterpenes, and other unidentified impurities. CMO can be
      hydrogenated to prepare hydrogenated CMO, which contains
      dihydronepetalactone.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] Catmint oil exhibits several characteristics that lead to
      low recovery of the oil from plant material using standard steam
      distillation techniques commonly employed for the isolation of
      essential oils from plant material. Catmint oil has significant
      solubility in water, and does not readily coalesce to form a
      separate oil phase from the condensed water used in the steam
      distillation process. Additionally, nepetalactone, the principal
      constituent of catmint oil, hydrates at high temperatures to
      non-volatile and unwanted side products. The present invention
      overcomes these disadvantages of the isolation of catmint oil from
      plant material to provide an economical method for recovering the
      oil in high yield at moderate temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In one embodiment of the invention, the solubility of
      catmint oil in water is reduced by the addition of salt to the
      aqueous phase during the distillation process. As a result, the
      amount of catmint oil in the wastewater leaving the process is
      reduced, resulting in a greater yield of catmint oil. The use of a
      salt to reduce the solubility of catmint oil in water has a
      further advantage in that it allows the oil to be less dense than
      the water phase. This allows the use of traditional oil collection
      equipment, wherein the catmint. oil is collected as an upper
      phase, which can easily be recovered by decantation. An additional
      advantage is that the rate at which the oil coalesces may be
      increased through the use of various salts.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] According to conventional distillation processes for
      recovering catmint oil, plant material from N. cataria (herein
      also called catmint plant material) is contacted with steam to
      form a vapor phase heterogeneous mixture comprising predominantly
      catmint oil and water. This mixture is then condensed to form a
      heterogeneous liquid condensed mixture comprising a catmint oil
      phase and a water phase, and the catmint oil phase is recovered
      from this mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] A traditional steam distillation apparatus is shown
      schematically in FIG. 1. Plant material is packed into a retort
      over a set of steam injectors, a suitable retort that may be used
      for such purpose being that which is available from Juniper Mfg.
      (Redmond, Oreg.). The lid of the retort is closed and sealed to
      both the retort and to a condenser. Steam is injected through the
      injection manifold (or steam injector) and into the packed plant
      material. The steam provides two functions: 1) energy to disrupt
      the glandular (or secretory) trichomes on the plant and release
      the oil, and 2) formation of a heteroazeotrope with the oil and
      thus volatizes it sufficiently as to allow it to be transported
      into the vapor phase. The steam and volatized oil are ducted to a
      condenser.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] Cooling water, from any suitable water source, flows
      through the condenser. Its cooling effect allows the steam and
      catmint oil vapor to condense. The condenser is configured in such
      a way as to allow gravity to drain the condensed water and catmint
      oil out of the condenser and into a collection can. The water and
      catmint oil are ducted into the collection can optionally using
      internal baffles in such a way as to produce a quiescent zone to
      allow the oil and water to effectively separate. The quiescent
      zone is the zone where the superficial velocity of the condensate
      is less than the disengagement velocity of the oil from the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Essential oils that are produced in large commercial
      quantities, i.e. spearmint and peppermint oils, are generally less
      dense than water, and when using a standard collection can, these
      essential oils would form a phase above the water. Catmint oil,
      however, is heavier (more dense) than water, and thus conventional
      collection equipment does not offer the same advantage in the case
      of catmint oil. As shown in FIG. 1, the water forms an aqueous
      phase above the heavier catmint oil. The water is thus generally
      removed as wastewater, for example by decantation. Typically, the
      temperature of the condensate is controlled at a modest
      temperature, approximately 40-60[deg.] C., to allow the oil and
      water to effectively separate in the quiescent zone of the
      separation can.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The use of a steam distillation apparatus similar to that
      shown in FIG. 1 in a conventional distillation process may be
      illustrated as follows: A glass resin kettle (as the retort) is
      outfitted with a steam injector plate, a condenser head and a
      graduated cylinder attached to the condenser as a simple
      collection can. The graduated cylinder is sized to have a
      condensate residence time of 20 to 30 minutes. Dried catmint plant
      material (100 grams) is packed into the resin kettle above the
      steam injector. The resin kettle is sealed and made leak tight.
      Live saturated steam is injected into the bottom of the resin
      kettle at a rate of approximately 40 g/min of steam per Kg of
      dried catmint plant material. The pressure of the steam is
      slightly above atmospheric pressure to allow for a pressure drop
      across the plant material and the condenser. The cooling water
      flow is adjusted to the condenser so that the condensate
      temperature is about 50[deg.] C. After the graduated cylinder is
      filled, with condensate, it overflows into a wastewater drain.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The still is operated in this fashion for 4.5 hours.
      Dichloromethane is added to the graduated cylinder. The resulting
      mixture of solvent and oil is removed. from the graduated cylinder
      and a portion is analyzed by GC. The GC analysis provides a
      measure of the total amount of oil collected in the cylinder
      without having to weigh the sample. The oil collected in the
      receiver is expected to be less than 0.15 wt. % of the original
      dry weight of the catmint plant material.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] One aspect of this invention relates to the discovery that,
      after contacting the catmint plant material with steam, and
      cooling the volatilized mixture comprising catmint oil and water
      to form a heterogeneous condensed mixture, the catmint oil can be
      separated from the heterogeneous condensed mixture in greater
      yield than observed with conventional distillation techniques by
      contacting the condensed mixture with a salt that decreases the
      solubility of catmint oil in water. In a preferred embodiment, the
      salt will also increase the rate at which the oil coalesces and
      disengages from the aqueous phase, thus reducing oil loss as fine
      droplets in the aqueous phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] More specifically, one embodiment of the processes hereof
      provides a process for obtaining catmint oil from Nepeta cataria
      by (a) contacting Nepeta cataria plant material with steam to form
      a volatilized mixture comprising catmint oil and water; (b)
      condensing the volatilized mixture formed in step (a) to form a
      liquid mixture comprising catmint oil and water in which catmint
      oil is dissolved in water; (c) contacting the liquid mixture
      formed in step (b) with salt to provide a mixture in which catmint
      oil and salt are both dissolved in water, and in which<br>
      <br>
      (i) the solubility of catmint oil in the solution of water and
      salt is at least about 50% less than the solubility of catmint oil
      in water, and/or <br>
      <br>
      (ii) the ratio [([rho]catmint oil-[rho]aqueous
      solution)/[mu]aqueous solution], where [rho] is density, [mu] is
      viscosity and the aqueous solution is the solution of water and
      salt, is less than or equal to about -0.05, to provide in the
      mixture a catmint oil phase that is separated from an aqueous salt
      solution phase; and (d) recovering the catmint oil phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] This process can be carried out in a distillation apparatus
      as shown in FIG. 2. Plant material is packed into a retort. The
      lid of the retort is closed and sealed to both the retort and to a
      condenser. Steam for the distillation of the catmint plant
      material can be provided by any suitable means such as by direct
      injection through an injection manifold as illustrated in FIG. 2.
      In an alternative embodiment, the steam can be obtained by adding
      water to the retort, and boiling the water in the presence of the
      plant material. The latter method is referred to as using a direct
      fired retort.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The volatized oil that is produced when steam contacts the
      plant material is ducted, along with the steam, to a condenser.
      Cooling water, from any suitable water source, flows through the
      condenser. Its cooling effect allows the steam and catmint oil
      vapor to condense to form the heterogeneous liquid condensed
      mixture. The condenser is configured in such a way as to allow
      gravity to drain the condensed water and catmint oil out of the
      condenser and into a collection can. The water and catmint oil are
      ducted into the collection can, optionally using internal baffles
      in such a way as to produce a quiescent zone to allow the oil and
      water to effectively separate. Typically, the temperature of the
      condensate is controlled at a modest temperature, approximately
      40-60[deg.] C., to allow the oil and water to effectively separate
      in the quiescent zone of the separation can.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The heterogeneous liquid condensed mixture comprising
      catmint oil and water can be contacted with salt by any suitable
      means, and it is preferable that the entire mixture comes into
      contact with salt. In one embodiment of the processes hereof, a
      porous material, such as burlap, filter paper, filter cloth (e.g.
      cheesecloth), or a fine mesh screen, is placed in a funnel, and
      the salt is placed on the porous material. The mixture catmint oil
      and water contacts the salt, and flows through the funnel into the
      collection can. In an alternative embodiment, the chosen salt can
      be preloaded in the collection can to allow the aqueous CMO
      mixture to directly contact the chosen salt. In yet another
      embodiment, a concentrated salt solution may be used, and the
      aqueous CMO mixture is brought into contact with the concentrated
      salt solution. For steam distillation systems described below
      wherein vacuum is used, the contacting of the aqueous CMO mixture
      with salt would be carried out in. a closed system.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In addition to its effects on solubility, the addition of
      salt to the aqueous CMO mixture also increases the disengagement
      rate of catmint oil from water. At a particular temperature, the
      ratio of the difference in the density ([rho]) of catmint oil
      (CMO) and the density of the aqueous solution (aq. sol.) to the
      viscosity ([mu]) of the aqueous solution [([rho]CMO-[rho]aq.
      sol.)/[mu]aq. sol] is indicative of the ease for disengaging oil
      droplets from the water. In the above ratio, the aqueous solution
      is water with or without salt, as the case may be. This ratio can
      be modified through the addition of salt to the water since the
      added salt changes both the water density and viscosity. The ratio
      can also be modified by changing the temperature of the mixture;
      temperatures of from about room temperature (about 25[deg.] C.) to
      about 75[deg.] C. are preferred, and temperatures of about
      40[deg.] C. to about 60[deg.] C. are more preferred.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] It is expected that the wastewater from the steam
      distillation process can be used as a fertilizer, and thus
      preferred salts include the sulfate, nitrate and phosphate salts
      of Groups 1 and 2 of the Periodic Table of the Elements.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] By modifying the water density and viscosity, the position
      of the catmint oil layer in the collection can may be modified.
      Using conventional distillation techniques without salt addition,
      the catmint oil would be recovered as the bottom layer in the
      collecting can. By modifying the water density and viscosity, the
      catmint oil can be recovered from the top of the collecting can
      (for example, by decantation of the catmint oil phase), thereby
      allowing the use of conventional collecting equipment. In
      addition, corrosion products that may be formed in the condenser
      or collection can collect at the bottom of the collecting can,
      contaminating the liquid phase that is at the bottom of the can.
      Therefore, an additional advantage to having the oil phase as the
      top phase is that it is separated from any corrosion products that
      may be present.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] Steam distillation of catmint oil according to a process of
      this invention may be carried out in a distillation apparatus as
      shown in as FIG. 2, and may be illustrated as follows: The
      distillation apparatus includes a retort (available from Juniper
      Mfg. (Redmond, Oreg.) with a steam injector plate, a condenser,
      and a conical collection can optionally with internal baffling in
      the collection can. The collection can is sized to have a
      condensate residence time of about 30 minutes. This residence time
      is high enough to provide a quiescent zone for the oil droplets to
      coalescence into a single continuous phase. This will occur when
      the superficial velocity of the water in the collection can is
      less than the settling velocities of the catmint oil droplets
      suspended in the water phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The distillation apparatus is modified such that the
      incoming catmint oil distillate is passed through a bed of a salt
      such as Epsom salts (hydrated magnesium sulfate) before entering
      the can. This is done by plugging the inlet funnel of the
      collection can with a piece of burlap to retain undissolved salt.
      The salt is dissolved by the incoming condensate stream, thus
      yielding a nearly salt-saturated water solution entering the can.
      Salt is replenished manually during the course of the run to
      maintain the presence of undissolved salt at all times.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Dried catmint plant material (13 kg) is packed into the
      retort above the steam injector so that the retort is full and the
      plant material is sealed securely to the sides of the retort so
      that channeling of the steam along the inside walls of the retort
      is minimized. The retort is sealed and made leak tight. Live steam
      produced in a separate boiler is injected into the bottom of the
      retort at a rate of 480 g/min for a total of 60 minutes. The
      pressure of the steam is slightly above atmospheric pressure to
      allow for pressure drop across the plant material and the
      condenser. The cooling water flow is adjusted to the condenser so
      that the condensate temperature is between 45[deg.] C. and
      55[deg.] C. during the distillation. After the collection can is
      filled with condensate, the water phase condensate is drawn off
      the bottom of the collection can into a wastewater drain.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] The still is operated in this fashion for 1 hour. A total
      of approximately 2.2 Kg of steam is used per Kg of dried catmint
      plant material. Approximately 50 mL or 52 grams of catmint oil is
      collected in the bottom of the collection can. This corresponds to
      approximately 0.40 wt % of the original dry weight of the catmint
      plant. The water effluent coming out is collected and later
      analyzed for dissolved oil by GC analysis. The GC analysis is
      expected to indicate an oil content of about 0.05 wt % of catmint
      oil in this water. This lower solubility corresponds to a yield
      improvement of 0.22 wt % of catmint oil relative to the dried
      plant weight. There is an additional yield gain of about 0.06 wt %
      of oil relative to the dried plant weight due to improved
      disengagement of the oil from the water.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The loss of catmint oil to wastewater can be reduced by
      reducing the amount of water used during the distillation process.
      It has thus been found, in another embodiment hereof, that, in
      direct fired retorts, the amount of water used in the process can
      be reduced by recycling the water after it is condensed. Thus, by
      modifying the conventional distillation apparatus such that water
      flows from the collection can back to the retort (see FIG. 3), the
      amount of water used in the process can be reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] More specifically, the processes hereof further provide a
      process for obtaining catmint oil from Nepeta cataria by (a)
      contacting Nepeta cataria plant material with steam in a direct
      fired retort to form a volatilized mixture comprising catmint oil
      and water; (b) condensing the volatilized mixture formed in step
      (a) to form a liquid mixture comprising catmint oil and water; (c)
      separating the liquid mixture formed in step (b) into a catmint
      oil phase and a water phase; (d) recycling the water phase back to
      the direct fired retort of step (a); and (e) recovering the
      catmint oil phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The placement of the line that directs water from the
      collection can to the retort will depend on the position of the
      water in the collection can, i.e. whether the water phase is on
      top of the catmint oil or below the catmint oil. Water recycle
      from the collection can to the retort will function in
      distillation systems where no salt is used, but will also function
      in those distillation systems where salt is used to alter catmint
      oil solubility or the disengagement rate from water.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] In a further embodiment of the processes hereof, the rate
      of hydrolysis of catmint oil to undesirable by-products (such as
      nepetalic acid) during the steam distillation process may be
      reduced.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] It has been found that, at higher temperatures,
      nepetalactone isomers in catmint oil hydrate to undesirable
      products (such as nepetalic acid), and that the rate of formation
      of nepetalic acid increases with increasing temperature.
      Performing the distillation of catmint plant material at a lower
      temperature, such as a temperature of from about room temperature
      (about 25[deg.] C.) to about 75[deg.] C., preferably about
      40[deg.] C. to about 60[deg.] C., will thus reduce the tendency
      for the hydration of nepetalactone to occur. The temperature can
      be reduced by operating the distillation apparatus under vacuum;
      and an example of such a system is shown in FIG. 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] The amount of vacuum applied to the system will depend on
      the system components, however achieving an absolute pressure of
      about 13 kPa to about 70 kPa is preferred. An absolute pressure of
      about 20 kPa to about 45 kPa is more preferred. The application of
      vacuum can be used in distillation systems where no salt is used,
      but will also function in those distillation systems where salt is
      used to alter catmint oil solubility or the disengagement rate
      from water. In addition, the application of vacuum can be used in
      systems where water is recycled from the collection can back to
      the retort.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      [0050] Mixtures of CMO with water, and with various solutions of
      salt in water, were equilibrated and the aqueous phase was
      analyzed by GC to measure CMO concentration (Table 1). A sample of
      CMO in pure water was used as control and yielded a solubility of
      0.15 weight percent. Upon addition of salt, the catmint oil phase
      floated on top of the aqueous phase at equilibrium for most
      compositions. GC analysis revealed that the CMO solubility in the
      water was dependent on the type of salt used. In general, the CMO
      concentration in water decreased with increasing salt content
      except for urea. In addition, CMO solubility was significantly
      reduced in MgSO4 solutions relative to other salt solutions.<br>

      [0051] Typical steam distillations use 1 to 4 Kg of water per Kg
      of dried plant material. Without salt addition, there is a yield
      loss of 0.11 to 0.88 wt % catmint oil based on dried plant weight.
      However, with magnesium sulfate salt addition [see Table 1], this
      yield loss decreased to 0.04 to 0.16 wt. % oil based on dried
      plant weight. This resulted in a yield increase of 0.07 to 0.72
      wt. % catmint oil based on dried plant weight.<br>

      <br>
      [0052] The ratio of the difference in density of catmint oil and
      aqueous solution (i.e. water with or without the addition of salt)
      to the viscosity of the aqueous solution [([rho]CMO-[rho]aq.
      sol)/[mu]aq. sol.] (wherein "aq. sol." is the abbreviation for
      aqueous solution) was evaluated for mixtures of catmint oil and
      aqueous solutions at various temperatures. The density of catmint
      oil was measured using standard techniques. The density and
      viscosity of the salt solutions are available in the literature
      [Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook, 6thEdition, 1984;
      International Critical Tables of Numerical Data, Physics,
      Chemistry and Technology (1st Electronic Edition), Knovel Co.,
      2003]. The values for mixtures of water/catmint oil and various
      salt water solutions with catmint oil were plotted at 25[deg.] C.
      and 50[deg.] C. in FIGS. 4 and 5, respectively. A mixture of water
      and peppermint oil was used as a comparison.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] The greater the extent to which the calculated ratios
      depart from zero, the faster will be the oil disengagement rate
      from the water or salt water solution. A negative ratio indicates
      that the catmint oil phase will be lighter than the aqueous phase.
      The oil will float on top of the water. A positive ratio indicates
      that the catmint oil is heavier than the water or salt water
      solution, and thus the oil will sink below the aqueous phase.
      Aqueous solutions of magnesium sulfate and calcium nitrate were
      particularly effective in improving the separation of catmint oil
      from the water. In addition, the addition of aqueous solutions of
      magnesium sulfate and calcium nitrate to the water made the water
      heavier than catmint oil, which permitted the collection of the
      distilled catmint oil as the top phase in the collecting can. A
      temperature of 50[deg.] C. is preferred over 25[deg.] C.<br>

        Addition</span><br>
      <br>
      [0054] Steam distillation of catmint oil was carried out in a
      distillation apparatus similar to that shown in FIG. 1 for a
      conventional steam distillation [retort available from Juniper
      Mfg. (Redmond, Oreg.)]. The distillation apparatus included a
      retort with a steam injector plate, a condenser, and a conical
      collection can, wherein said conical collection optionally had
      internal baffling. The collection can was sized to have a
      condensate residence time of about 30 minutes. This residence time
      was high enough to provide a quiescent zone for the oil droplets
      to coalesce into a single continuous phase.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] Dried catmint plant material (13 Kg) was packed into the
      retort above the steam injector so that the retort was full and
      the plant material was sealed securely to the sides of the retort
      so that channeling of the steam along the inside walls of the
      retort was minimized. The retort was sealed and made leak tight.
      Live steam produced in a separate boiler (not shown in FIG. 1) was
      injected into the bottom of the retort at a rate of 480 g/min for
      a total of 60 minutes. The pressure of the steam was slightly
      above atmospheric pressure to allow for a pressure drop across the
      plant material and the condenser. The cooling water flow was
      adjusted to the condenser so that the condensate temperature was
      between about 45[deg.] C. and 55[deg.] C. during the distillation.
      After the collection can was filled with condensate, the
      condensate overflowed into a wastewater drain. The distillation
      apparatus was operated in this fashion for 1 hour. A total of
      approximately 2.2 Kg of steam was used per Kg of dried catmint
      plant material.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Approximately 15.6 mL (16.2 grams) of catmint oil was
      collected in the bottom of the collection can. This corresponds to
      approximately 0.12 wt % of the original dry weight of the catmint
      plant. The water effluent coming out was collected and later
      analyzed for dissolved oil by GC analysis. The GC analysis
      indicated an oil content of about 0.15 wt % of catmint oil in this
      water. This is near the solubility limit of the catmint oil in
      water and constitutes a substantial yield loss of 0.33 wt % of
      catmint oil relative to the dried plant weight. This yield loss
      does not include losses due to poor disengagement of the oil from
      the water.<br>

      <br>
      [0057] A steam distillation apparatus similar to that shown in
      FIG. 1 is used. A glass resin kettle (as the retort) is outfitted
      with a steam injector plate, a condenser head and a graduated
      cylinder attached to the condenser as a simple collection can. The
      graduated cylinder is sized to have a condensate residence time of
      20 to 30 minutes. The apparatus was modified from that shown in
      FIG. 1 to be able to directly boil water in the base of the retort
      and to be able to recycle the water back to the retort from the
      oil collector (FIG. 2). A 10 mL graduated cylinder was used as the
      condensate collector. Deionized water (500 grams) was loaded in
      the heal of the resin kettle. Dried catmint plant material (100
      grams) was packed into the resin kettle above the water.
      Electrical heating mantels were used to supply heat directly to
      the water and to maintain the plant bed temperature sufficient to
      not allow excessive condensation of water in the plant material.
      The heat input was adjusted so that the condensation residence
      time in the 10 mL graduated cylinder was between 10 and 20
      minutes. Cooling water was supplied to the condenser to allow the
      condensate temperature to be about 30[deg.] C. Water from the
      condenser was periodically drained back to the retort.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The distillation apparatus was operated in this fashion for
      about 4.5 hours. Dichloromethane was added to the graduated
      cylinder. The resulting mixture of solvent and oil was removed
      from the graduated cylinder and a portion was analyzed by GC. The
      GC analysis provided a measure of the total amount of oil
      collected in the cylinder without having to weigh the sample. The
      oil collected in the receiver was about 0.17 wt % of the original
      dry weight of the catmint plant material. This shows a yield
      increase of at least 13% relative to that observed when the
      experiment is performed without recycle.<br>

        Catmint Plant Material with Water Recycle</span><br>
      <br>
      [0059] The steam distillation apparatus described in Example 4 was
      modified to allow vacuum operation of the retort and condenser
      (FIG. 3). A 10 mL graduated cylinder was used as the condensate
      collector. Deionized water (500 grams) was loaded in the heal of
      the resin kettle. Dried catmint material (84 grams) was packed
      into the resin kettle above the water. Electrical heating mantels
      were used to supply heat directly to the water and to maintain the
      plant bed temperature sufficient to not allow excessive
      condensation of water in the plant material. The vacuum was
      adjusted so that the retort was running at an absolute pressure of
      31 kPa (4.5 psia) and a boiling temperature of about 70[deg.] C.
      The condensation residence time in the 10 mL graduated cylinder
      was between 10 and 20 minutes. Cooling water was supplied to the
      condenser to allow the condensate temperature to be about 30[deg.]
      C. Water from the condenser was periodically drained back to the
      retort.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] This still was operated in this fashion for about 7 hours.
      Dichloromethane was added to the graduated cylinder. The resulting
      mixture of solvent and oil was removed from the graduated cylinder
      and a portion was analyzed by GC. The GC analysis provided a
      measure of the total amount of oil collected. in the cylinder
      without having to weigh the sample. The oil collected in the
      receiver was about 0.3 wt. % of the original dry weight of the
      catmint plant material. This shows a significant increase in yield
      at a lower temperature of distillation.<br>

      [0061] Where a range of numerical values is recited is herein, the
      range includes the endpoints thereof and all the individual
      integers and fractions within the range, and also includes each of
      the narrower ranges therein formed by all the various possible
      combinations of those endpoints and internal integers and
      fractions to form subgroups of the larger group of values within
      the stated range to the same extent as if each of those narrower
      ranges was explicitly recited. Where a range of numerical values
      is stated herein as being greater than a stated value, the range
      is nevertheless finite and is bounded on its upper end by a value
      that is operable within the context of the invention as described
      herein. Where a range of numerical values is stated herein as
      being less than a stated value, the range is nevertheless bounded
      on its lower end by a non-zero value.<br>
