      <p>Robert W. Bussard is an American physicist working primarily in
        nuclear fusion energy research. </p>
      <p>In 1960, Bussard famously conceived the Bussard ramjet, an
        interstellar space drive powered by hydrogen fusion using
        hydrogen collected using a magnetic field from the interstellar
        gas. Due to the presence of high-energy particles throughout
        space, most interstellar hydrogen exists in an ionized state
        that can be manipulated by magnetic or electric fields. Bussard
        proposed using a large magnet to "scoop" up the ionized hydrogen
        and funnel it into a fusion reactor, using the exhaust from the
        reactor as a rocket engine. Since it picked up its fuel from
        space, there was no apparent upper limit to the speed such a
        craft could achieve. However it appears the "energy gain" in the
        reactor must be extremely high for the ramjet to work at all;
        any hydrogen picked up by the scoop must be sped up to the same
        speed as the ship in order to provide thrust, and the energy
        required to do so increases with the ship's speed. </p>
      <p>In the early 1970s, Bussard joined the director of the, then,
        Atomic Energy Commission's Controlled Thermonuclear Reaction
        Division, Robert Hirsch, as Assistant Director. They founded the
        mainline fusion program for the United States: the Tokamak.
        Later, Bussard in a June 6, 1995 letter to all fusion
        laboratories as well as to key members of US Congress regarding
        his role in the founding of the US fusion program, claimed that
        he, along with the other founders of that that program,
        supported the Tokamak not out of conviction that it was the best
        technical approach but rather that it would provide a vehicle
        via which political support for fusion development could be
        generated, thereby allowing them to pursue "all the hopeful new
        things the mainline labs would not try".[1] </p>
      <p>With fellow researcher Bruno Coppi, Bussard later founded
        Inesco, a private firm funded in part by Penthouse Magazine
        publisher Bob Guccione. Inesco set out to build small
        power-producing Tokamak fusion reactors called Riggatrons using
        methods developed from the MIT Alcator research tokamaks. The
        method they were trying to use in order to initiate fusion
        proved vastly more difficult to achieve than they had
        anticipated and Inesco eventually shut down when its funds ran
        out. </p>
      <p>Bussard later founded another company, Energy Matter Conversion
        Corporation (EMC2), which has engaged in research on variants of
        the Farnsworth-Hirsch fusor. In an article entitled "The World's
        Simplest Fusion Reactor: How To Make It Work" in the December
        12, 1998 issue of Analog magazine, fusion researcher Tom Ligon
        described an easily-built demonstration fusor system, and some
        of Bussard's ideas for fusion reactors and incredibly efficient
        spacecraft propulsion systems, which could enable single-stage
        spacecraft to travel anywhere in the Solar System in short times
        compared to chemical rockets. </p>
      <p>On March 29, 2006, Bussard claimed on the fusor.net forum that
        EMC2 had developed an inertial electrostatic confinement fusion
        process that was 100,000 times more efficient than previous
        designs. However, the company's funding ran out, and Bussard is
        looking for additional funding to develop a full-scale fusion
        power plant. On June 23, 2006 Bussard provided more details of
        the breakthrough and the circumstances of the shutdown of this
        work by the government. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Dear Sir Philip: </p>
      <p>I have read the threads on the Randi forum, and they are all
        intent and I am sure well-menaing. However, I have not been able
        to "log in" on this forum so am writing to you instead. Perhaps
        you can post this note as a reply and commentary to some of the
        issues raised by your forum correspondents. </p>
      <p>First, what we have achieved in our rather unexpectedly good
        tests of last November 9 and 10th was an output of DD fusion at
        about 10 kV, at B fields of 1300 G, in a 30 cm diam device
        (WB-6) run in a pulsed mode from big capacitors, with a fusion
        rate of about 1E9 /sec. This works out to be about 100,000 x
        higher than the data of Hirsch/Farnsworth at similar well depth
        and drive conditions. The test duration was only about 0.4
        masec, but since the electron lifetime is ca 0.1 microsec this
        is steady-state to the plasma particles. We had neither the
        money, nor the cooling, nor the power supplies, nor the controls
        to run this small device steady-state, which is what we need to
        do, and what requires us to build the full-scale device. </p>
      <p>This was a direct result of discovering something during late
        Spring/ early summer tests of WB-5, which was a closed boc
        machine, like the early HEPS of 1989. What we discovered was --
        in hindsight -- elementary; it was that indeed God is in the
        details, and the detail of particular importance is that no
        metal surface penetrated by B fields must occupy more than about
        1E-4 to 1E-5 of the total surface available to the recirculating
        electrons. If this dead fraction is larger, there is NO hope of
        net power from any such machine. AND, it is essential that the
        device be recirculating, i.e. that the electrons can circulate
        out and back through the cusps all over the machine. Of course,
        this is obvious; but in 15 years no one saw it, not Hirsch, not
        our consultants not our opponents, not our staff, and not me. </p>
      <p>It is consistent with the need for electrons to recirculate
        about 100,000 times before being lost to collisions with
        structure, to yield net power. </p>
      <p>Please remember that our device has the property that the
        electron flow and losses are decoupled from the ion flow and
        fusion generation. Power balance depends on suppresssion of the
        electron losses, which are derived from the energetic electron
        injection that forms the gridless negative potential well that
        traps the ions. </p>
      <p>When we figured this thing out, in summer 2005, we quickly
        designed and quickly built WB-6, using only conformal (with the
        B fields produced) coil cans, so that no B field uniquely
        penetrated the cans, and then placed the coils in a special
        array so that no corners touched (this latter is a long topic
        having to do with local B fields, and loss of WiffleBall
        trapping due to line cusp effects at the corners, etc, etc, and
        is the baisis of our final patents on this thing). It IS the
        details that make or break the device. And this particular set
        of details absolutely dominates the performance. </p>
      <p>Anyway, we ran the device in October, for beta=one tests, to
        confirm transport scaling laws, and then in early November to
        test for fusion output. And, happiness, indeed, three tests on 9
        November and one on 10 Novem,ber gave the results mentioned
        above. The next day, 11 November, we tried it again, but magnet
        coil motions induced by repeated testing had moved the coils
        enough that an insulation spot had worn away inside the cans,
        and the device shorted and blew up one leg, with the full cap
        discharge. Having no further funding, we had to start shutting
        doen the lab the following Monday!!! Irony? </p>
      <p>As to our funding -- our USN contract still exists, and still
        has about $ 2M authorized in it. However, year-by-year funding
        was NOT provide for FY 2006, so that we knew we had to close
        down early in 2006.. What saved us was Adm Cohen (CNR) who put
        another 900 K into the program to try to get us down the road to
        where we DID go, and then we had to quit. It was not a cutoff of
        OUR funding, but the entire Navy Energy Program was cut to zero
        in FY 2006, and we were a part of this cut. The funds were
        clearly needed for the more important War in Iraq. </p>
      <p>So, as we cut down, we managed to save the lab equipment, by
        transfer to SpaceDev, which hired our three best lab people as
        well, and we are still trying to get the missing $ 2M restored
        and put into our existing but unfunded contract. IF this happens
        - which is improhable, given the politics of this election year,
        and the non-visionary people in Congress - we will redo WB-6
        with an improved and better version (WB-7) which should give 5x
        more output, and run about 50 tests to quiet dissent. AND we
        will convene a review panel of very high-level and
        internationally distinguished people to spend about 6 weeks
        going over this to recommend for or against proceeding sith a
        full scale demo. </p>
      <p>This may or may not happen. If it does, I have little doubt as
        to the panel recommendation, as the data and insight from WB-5/6
        is just too clear. We really have solved the last engineering
        physics problem that has plagued our work for 12 year s or so.
        Yes, there is much left to do, iespecially in controls and
        diagnostics, but these are predictable things not dependent on
        beating the Paschen curve. </p>
      <p>And we still have to develop some reliable e-guns and
        i-sources, again predictable enginering that costs both time and
        money, but not new physics. </p>
      <p>Why a full-scale demo? Because the system scales oddly: Fusion
        output goes as the 7th power of the size and Gain goes as the
        5th power. Thus there is very little to be gained by building a
        half-size model; it is too weak to give anything definitive
        about power production or gain. And our tests were always at
        about 1/8 to 1/10 scale of the full scale demo. We told the DoD
        from the beginning that the real program would cost about
        150-200 M, since 1987, and they all knew this. However, since
        the DoD has no charter to do such work, and the political
        realities were that a big DoD program would attract the ire and
        power of the DoE to kill it, it was never funded beyond about
        1/8 the level required. </p>
      <p>So we did what we could and finally DID prove the physics and
        associated engineering physics constraints, scaling laws, etc,
        albeit at 1/8-1/10 scale. So what? Doubling the size will not
        tell us anything we don't already know. The next intelligent and
        logical step is to build a machine big enough to make net power.
        And THAT is the same 200 M we have quoted to the DoD since the
        beginning. </p>
      <p>As for energy companies "stampeding" to support us -- It is
        clear that a view like this is ignorant of the reality of energy
        companies. There is only one thing the oil cvompanies want, and
        that is to sell oil, and more oil. So long as the fields pump,
        the oil companies will squeeze. They have NO, absolutely NO
        interest in anything new, ins spite of all their foolish ads in
        magazines for wind mills and solar-PV roofs. It is all just show
        and tell. I know these guys, and there is no way they would
        support anything that might get in the way of oil. The only way
        to stop oil, from their view, is when it does run out. And then
        they''ll go for deeper drilling, new fields, Gulf geopressure
        gas, LNG, etc, etc, and keep raising the price, until finally
        foolish solar and windmills become competitive. </p>
      <p>And we are paying the equivalent of $ 500/bbl oil costs. But
        Exxon and Halliburton are getting richer all the time. </p>
      <p>Yes, we would like to build the demo plant, and yes, it will
        cost about 150 (DD) to 200 M (pB11), and who knows if any
        investor singly or a group can or will come up with the money.
        One of the biggest obstacle is the world-wide tokamak lobby,
        which perpetuates the fraud that Hirsch, Trivelpiece and I
        foisted on the country in the 1970's when we started the big
        tokamak ball rolling. </p>
      <p>Magnetic confinement fusion is a misnomer, as magnetic fields
        can NOT confine a plasma, only constrain its motion towards
        walls. The entire history of the MagConf program has been to
        reduce transport to neo-classical (not turbulent or
        instability-driven) losses. And THEN the machines are all
        inherently and inevitably huge and cost too much and make too
        much power to ever be economically useful --- as the utilities
        have been telling the AEC/DoE for 30 years. No matter, the
        global tokamak program provides jobs for hudreds of thousands of
        people in many countries, and is a safe place to put political
        pork funding, simply because it IS NO THREAT TO OIL - it won't
        ever work, but it sounds good to the untutored public.. </p>
      <p>As for us; our company still exists, but we will not likely run
        any demo program - that will be up to others to carry it on, if
        we all get the chance. Meanwhile, my objective is very simple. I
        detest the energy stranglehold of our companies on our people,
        and am going to try to give our idea away at the soonest
        possible moment. To anyone, anywhere, who might want to
        undertake its development. And we'll be happy to help in any way
        we can, if a serious interest develops anywhere in the world. </p>
      <p>I think the US, UK, France, et al are lost causes, because of
        theri commitment to the failed tokamak effort, as is probably
        Germany, and maybe others, too. China may be a possibility, as
        it is quite independent even though part of the ITER mess,
        Russia may be considererd, and countries like Spain, Brazil,
        Italy, Argentina, and others may logically have an interest. </p>
      <p>I believe that the survival of our high-tech civilizations
        depends on getting off of fossile fuels ASAP, and - if we do not
        - we will descend into a growing series of "oil wars" and energy
        confrontations that can lead only to a huge cataclysim. Which
        CAN be circumvented if only we build the clean fuison machines
        in time. Our patents are in final form, and I am giving a paper
        in the Fall, and trying to get a large technical description
        together for a major paper by summer. We shall see. </p>
      <p>One final word: Actually our device is really not a variant of
        Farnwworth/Hirsch, but of Elmore/Tuck/Watson who propeosed the
        inversion of Farnsworth/Hirsch long ago (ca. 1967). Their
        problem was the interception of circulating electrons by grids -
        we removed the grids and replaced them by B field insulated
        coils - thus our "grids" are the coils themselves.. And we do
        know how these work, at last. </p>
      <p>Good luck to all of us. </p>
      <p>Cheers, RW Bussard </p>

      <p>Baldrson writes "One of the founders of the US Tokamak fusion
        program, Dr. Robert W. Bussard, gave a lecture at Google
        recently now appearing as a Google video titled 'Should Google
        Go Nuclear?'. In it, he presents his recent breakthrough
        electrostatic confinement fusion device which, he claims,
        produced several orders of magnitude higher fusion power than
        earlier electrostatic confinement devices. According to Bussard,
        it did so repeatably during several runs until it blew up due to
        mechanical stress degradation. He's looking for $200M funding,
        the first million or so of which goes to rebuilding a more
        robust demonstrator within the first year. He claims the scaling
        laws are so favorable that the initial full scale reactor would
        burn boron-11 — the cleanest fusion reaction otherwise
        unattainable. He has some fairly disturbing things to say in
        this video, as well as elsewhere, about the US fusion program
        which he co-founded." </p>

      <p>ABSTRACT --- This is not your father's fusion reactor! Forget
        everything you know about conventional&nbsp; ... all thinking on
        nuclear fusion: high-temperature plasmas, steam turbines,
        neutron radiation and even nuclear waste are a thing of the
        past. Goodbye thermonuclear fusion; hello inertial electrostatic
        confinement fusion (IEC), an old idea that's been made new.
        While the international community debates the fate of the
        politically-turmoiled $12 billion ITER (an experimental
        thermonuclear reactor), simple IEC reactors are being built as
        high-school science fair projects. </p>
      <p>Dr. Robert Bussard, former Asst. Director of the Atomic Energy
        Commission and founder of Energy Matter Conversion Corporation
        (EMC2), has spent 17 years perfecting IEC, a fusion process that
        converts hydrogen and boron directly into electricity producing
        helium as the only waste product. Most of this work was funded
        by the Department of Defense, the details of which have been
        under seal... until now. </p>
      <p>Dr. Bussard will discuss his recent results and details of this
        potentially world-altering technology, whose conception dates
        back as far as 1924, and even includes a reactor design by Philo
        T. Farnsworth (inventor of the scanning television). </p>
      <p>Can a 100 MW fusion reactor be built for less than Google's
        annual electricity bill? Come see what's possible when you think
        outside the thermonuclear box and ignore the herd. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract </b>-- An apparatus and method of enhancing
        nuclear fusion reactions utilizes a plasma, made up of ions and
        electrons, contained within a region, and enhances the density
        of the plasma using a collision-diffusion compressional
        enchantment process. Ion acoustic wave generated within a
        central region of the system permits increased reflection and
        scattering of ions and thereby reduces their mean free path
        within the core region to permit greatly increased ions density
        sufficient to enhance nuclear fusion reactions within the core.

      <p><b>Abstract</b> -- A fusion power generating device is
        disclosed having a relatively small and inexpensive core region
        which may be contained within an energy absorbing blanket
        region. The fusion power core region contains apparatus of the
        toroidal type for confining a high density plasma. The fusion
        power core is removable from the blanket region and may be
        disposed and/or recycled for subsequent use within the same
        blanket region. Thermonuclear ignition of the plasma is obtained
        by feeding neutral fusible gas into the plasma in a controlled
        manner such that charged particle heating produced by the fusion
        reaction is utilized to boot-strap the device to a region of
        high temperatures and high densitities wherein charged particle
        heating is sufficient to overcome radiation and thermal
        conductivity losses. The high density plasma produces a large
        radiation and particle flux on the first wall of the plasma core
        region thereby necessitating replacement of the core from the
        blanket region from time to time. A series of potentially
        disposable and replaceable central core regions are disclosed
        for a large-scale economical electrical power generating plant.

        <p><b>Robert W. Bussard</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Our company, EMC2, has been working since 1987 on the R&amp;D
        of Iour polyhedral IEF concept for fusion; mostly under DoD
        support. Final tests were made last Oct/Nov on a unique new
        design, based on unexpected discoveries made in Spring/Summer
        2005. This final machine, WB-6, showed 10x lower e- losses than
        any predecessor and produced DD fusions at a rate over 100,000x
        times higher than the data of Farnsworth-Hirsch in the 1960's
        for same drive conditions. </p>
      <p>We have now proven the engineering and physics scaling laws
        that allow design of full-scale net-power systems, whether on DD
        or pB11. USNavy budget line item that supported our work was
        zero-funded in FY2006, and our lab had to shut down and close
        one week after achieving these results! We are probably the only
        people on the planet who know how to make a real net power clean
        fusion system, and we are out of support! Somewhat ironical! </p>
      <p>The next logical step MUST be a full-scale net-power demo
        system, simply because there is not much left to do at small
        scale; when it is realized that the fusion output of these
        devices scales as the 7th power of the size, and the gain scales
        as the 5th power. </p>
      <p>These outlandish scalings (inherent in the engineering physics
        of the thing) make it useless to build half-scale systems (for
        example). Unless you are AT the net-power size, you are nowhere
        in power and gain, even though the physics IS relevant. We have
        always been limited to about 0.1 scale, and have learned nearly
        all there is to know about the system's basic operation. </p>
      <p>Thus, we have the ability to do away with oil (and other fossil
        fuels) but it will take 4-6 years and ca. 100-200 M$ to build
        the full-scale plant and demonstrate it. Anyone care? </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> --- A new Inertial Electrostatic Confinement
        reactor (IEC) based Fusion Ash Impact Propulsion (FAIP) unit
        devoid of magnetic fields is proposed in this paper.&nbsp;
        Theoretically, this system yields extremely high specific
        impulse ~ 5.5 x 106s, higher than any other advanced propulsion
        concepts available at this time.&nbsp; Besides, a very high
        specific power 100 kW/kg, and a relatively high thrust-to-weight
        ratio of ~0.031 can be obtained. The present design produces a
        continuous thrust of ~0.9N over the entire duration of the
        journey. FAIP system can be used to propel spaceships during
        interstellar missions such as mission to Heliopause, which is at
        a distance of around 120 to 150 A.U. in a period of&nbsp;
        ~30yrs.&nbsp; The concept is also suitable for missions beyond
        Heliopause, since calculations show that the FAIP system does
        not burn all its fuel when it reaches Heliopause,(at the end of
        the mission this system would have consumed only 3.55 kg of its
        fuel.&nbsp; Hence if the system continues its trajectory much
        higher terminal velocities (depending on the mission time) could
        be achieved eventually, leading to the accomplishment of even
        longer-range missions. </p>
      <p>The double gridded IEC device can be used to realize extremely
        high ion densities in the core region of the inner grid, which
        in turn results in an extremely high fusion power density
        there.&nbsp; Recent experiments at University of Wisconsin,
        Madison (U.W. Madison) have demonstrated the feasibility of
        using advanced fusion fuel D – 3He for steady state operation of
        the device e.g., producing ~3 x107 (14.7MeV) protons/sec steady
        state.&nbsp; Research group at U.W. Madison, are the first to
        realize D – 3He reactions on a steady state basis. </p>

      <p><i>THE TECHNOLOGY</i> </p>
      <p>Dr. Bussard and his team at Energy/Matter Conversion
        Corporation, after close to 20 years of hard work, have
        developed a revolutionary radiation-free fusion process that
        could change the world as we know it today. </p>
      <p>Fusion is the energy that powers everything in the universe.
        The sun's energy comes from fusion. Alternatively, fission is
        the process whereby heavy atoms, which are nearly unstable, are
        split into two radioactive atoms. Fusion, on the other hand, is
        when two light atoms merge. </p>
      <p>The ultimate fuels for fusion include hydrogen and other light
        atoms such as lithium, boron, and helium isotopes. Some of these
        reactions are radiation free, others are not. </p>
      <p>The fusion process recommended by Dr. Bussard takes boron-11
        and fuses a proton to it, producing, in its excited state, a
        carbon-12 atom. This excited carbon-12 atom decays to
        beryllium-8 and helium-4. Beryllium-8 very quickly (in 10-13 s)
        decays into two more helium-4 atoms. This is the only
        nuclear-energy releasing process in the whole world that
        releases fusion energy and three helium atoms -- and no
        neutrons. This reaction is completely radiation free. </p>
      <p>The most commonly studied fusion process today is the reaction
        that occurs between deuterium and tritium, the so-called DT
        reaction, that produces helium and a radioactive neutron.
        Various magnetic confinement vessels have been designed and
        developed over the years to contain the high-energy DT fusion
        reaction. The Tokamak is one such magnetic confinement vessel,
        30 m across by 110 feet tall. </p>
      <p>The majority of fusion processes being investigated today are
        very expensive, costing billions of U.S. dollars; require giant
        machines; and offer no predictability. Nonetheless, we know that
        fusion works because every star is a fusion reactor. The fusion
        reactors of the stars and the sun are held together by a direct
        force field. This works very well and efficiently -- this force
        field is gravity. </p>
      <p>Gravitational forces between particles draw them directly
        together. Only one other force is known to be like gravity: this
        is the electric field force or "coulomb" force, between
        electrically-charged particles. </p>
      <p>Charged particles of opposite signs attract each other with
        direct forces; charged particles in electric fields feel forces
        directly along field gradients. Thus, fusion fuel plasmas could
        be held together efficiently by electric forces and electric
        fields. This is called "Electric Fusion". </p>
      <p>Dr. Bussard was not the first to try to create such a field.
        One notable technique utilized a spherical screen grid that was
        biased to a positive potential, thereby attracting electrons
        through the screen, producing a negative potential well. As the
        electrons passed through the screen, they slowed down as their
        kinetic energy was transformed into potential energy in the
        potential well, and ions could then be dropped into it at the
        edge, fall down, and be recirculated back and forth. Any
        particles not reacting went back into the well. The only problem
        with this method was that the grid was not transparent. Because
        of the high interception rate on the grid, essentially all of
        the energy put into the electron acceleration went into the
        grid. Energy was lost and the grid melted. This technique just
        didn't work. </p>
      <p>Dr. Bussard's invention, however, removes the fore-mentioned
        grid and replaces it with a magnetic field. It is known that
        magnetic fields do not contain neutral plasmas very well (as
        illustrated in the case of the Tokamak). Magnetic fields,
        however, contain electrons very easily because electrons are
        extremely light. </p>
      <p>The basic approach of electric fusion is the following: </p>
      <p>Quasi-spherical magnetic fields trap injected energetic
        electrons to form spherical negative potential well. <br>
        Fusion ions trapped in this spherical well focused through
        central region oscillate across the "core" until they are
        reacted. <br>
        The system acts like a spherical colliding beam device. <br>
        Fuel gas is input at the potential well edge. Fusion products
        escape to system walls. <br>
        Ion fusion power generation occurs in a central region. <br>
        Electron drive power is decoupled from the fusion process. <br>
        Power balance is set by injected electron losses; the main
        losses occurring through the magnetic cusps and to walls. <br>
        Magnetic confinement of electrons is critical. <br>
        "Wiffle Ball" (WB) effect insures cusp sealing. <br>
        Magnetic insulation of the walls is important. <br>
        "Magrid" (MG) effect reduces power and raises gain. </p>
      <p>In 1994, Dr. Bussard successfully demonstrated a wiffle ball,
        achieving a beta-1 condition. In 2005, he was able to
        magnetically insulate the electrons from the walls via his
        "Magrid" transporter. </p>
      <p>Early prototypes experienced some losses because the original
        coils touched one another, resulting in intersecting magnetic
        fields. This made the magnetic field lines run into the metal
        vessel walls resulting in electron losses. Dr. Bussard realized
        that all the coil containers had to be conformal to the magnetic
        fields they produced. If he utilized circular torroidal coils
        spaced at the corners, the magnetic fields could be allowed to
        go out between the coils. Using such a device, that offered both
        the wiffle ball effect and the magrid transporter, Dr. Bussard
        was able to achieve 1x109 fusions/second for .25 milliseconds. </p>
      <p>In summary, Dr. Bussard's Inertial Electrostatic Fusion offers
      </p>
      <p>Small, efficient power reactors, 1-3% the size of current
        magnetic confinement reactors. <br>
        Clean, radiation-free energy utilizing p B-11. <br>
        Relatively simple engineering with commercial viability in 6-10
        years. <br>
        Low cost ($150-200 million from program inception to
        demonstration of clean power.) </p>
