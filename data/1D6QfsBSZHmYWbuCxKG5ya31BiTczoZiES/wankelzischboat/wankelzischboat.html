      <br>
      A sliding boat having supporting members respectively connected to
      opposite sides of the hull and projecting therefrom in cantilever
      fashion while carrying a plurality of water sliding foils at the
      free end of said supporting members. Each of the sliding foils
      comprises a plurality of relatively long and narrow strips
      extending in the longitudinal direction of the boat and being
      spaced from each other in the transverse direction of the strips
      so as to form a gap therebetween.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a water foil for boats with
      sliding foils. The purpose of such water foils consists in lifting
      the boat out of the water during its drive and to carry it above
      the water surface in order to reduce the displacement work and the
      water resistance of the hull of the boat. The sliding surfaces or
      water foils may be formed by surfaces of the hull itself or may be
      fin-shaped or wing-shaped parts spaced from the hull. Such fin or
      wing-like parts, in contrast to supporting wings around which the
      water flows on all sides, have only their bottom side resting on
      the water. These water foils in addition to having a reduced water
      resistance have the advantage that they are not subjected to the
      danger of cavitation, inasmuch as they do not have an
      underpressure area. Therefore, very high driving speeds are
      possible. However, the drawback is encountered that even slight
      waves may cause such hard shocks that they will be intolerable at
      high speeds for the boat occupants. This drawback is particularly
      great when sliding surfaces of wide span and short extension in
      the driving direction are involved. Also, the inversed form of the
      sliding surfaces in the driving direction as it is employed, for
      instance, with water skis in which the extension in the driving
      direction is great and the width transverse to the driving
      direction is short still brings about shock stresses although to a
      lesser extent when driving upon waves.<br>
      <br>
      There has furthermore become known a hull with longitudinally
      extending sliding surfaces or water foils of V-shaped cross
      section which in transverse direction to the driving direction are
      located adjacent to each other while forming a step with each
      other. While such boats are markedly less sensitive than sliding
      boats with flat hull cross sections with regard to shocks caused
      by waves, also this type of boat will at higher speed and when
      encountering waves quickly reach the limit where the shocks become
      unbearable.<br>
      <br>
      It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a
      boat with water foils in which the sensitivity with regard to the
      height of the waves will be considerably reduced.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
      appear more clearly from the following specification, in
      connection with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
      <br>
      <div align="left"><b>FIG. 1 is a top view of a boat according to
          the present invention.</b><b><br>
        </b><b>FIG. 2 is the front view of the boat according to FIG. 1.</b><b><br>
        </b><b>FIG. 3 is a side view of a modified boat according to the
          invention.</b><b><br>
        </b><b>FIG. 4 shows the stern of the boat according to FIG. 3.</b><b><br>
        </b><b>FIG. 5 shows the bow of the boat according to FIG. 3.</b><b><br>
        </b></div>
      <br>
      The water foil according to the present invention is characterized
      in that its sliding surface stands off and that it is composed of
      a plurality of narrow sliding strips which extend with their
      longitudinal axes in the driving direction while likewise standing
      off, said sliding strips leaving gaps between each other in the
      driving direction so that a grate-like structure is formed. This
      arrangement makes it possible when shock waves occur to permit the
      water quickly to flow off laterally and also makes possible a
      quick reduction of the water pressure which causes the hard
      shocks.<br>
      <br>
      The sliding strips may be resiliently designed. It is furthermore
      suggested to interconnect the sliding strips by means of a short
      supporting part extending in the driving direction, while the
      connection of the sliding strips to the supporting part is
      effected by means of spacer webs which are narrow in driving
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      These features bring about that each sliding strip will adapt
      itself to the movement of the waves and can swing freely and that
      the connections between the sliding strips and with the hull of
      the boat will when flooding the sliding strips offer the water a
      minimum of resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to the drawings in detail, and FIGS. 1 and 2 thereof
      in particular, the four sliding foils or sliding surfaces 1 of the
      boat 2 are arranged in a grate-like manner and divided in driving
      direction into individual sliding strips 3, 4, 5 between which
      longitudinal gaps 6, 7 remain. Each sliding strip forms a
      relatively long and narrow strip having its longitudinal axis
      extending in the driving direction of the boat. The sliding strips
      are supported at their center portion by means of short spacer
      webs 8, 9, 10 connected to a supporting member 11. Each supporting
      member is rigid or in order to adjust the angle of inclination of
      said sliding surfaces is connected to the supporting arm 12 so as
      to be pivotable about its longitudinal axis, said supporting arm
      12 carrying the hull of the boat 2.<br>
      <br>
      The sliding strips are made of elastic material. Their connection
      at the central portion of the said strips brings about that they
      can spring along their entire extension. This brings about an
      additional softness of the driving behavior of the boat when waves
      impact upon the boat or the sliding foils or when the sliding
      foils enter a relatively deep wave valley. The sliding strips 3,
      4, 5 will in this way be able to adapt themselves to the surface
      of the waves independently of each other and the sliding surface
      thus no longer represents a rigid structure. Furthermore, when
      impacting upon the water surface, the sliding strips by bending
      temporarily form a steeper angle of attack whereby the strips are
      prevented from, so-to-speak, boring themselves into the water
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      For an unimpeded action, as far as possible, of the longitudinal
      gaps 6, 7 as well as for the spring behavior of the individual
      sliding strips 3, 4, 5, it is advantageous to connect the sliding
      strips with each other by means of a supporting member 11 which is
      short in the driving direction. Furthermore, it is advantageous to
      effect the connection between said supporting member and the
      sliding strips only by means of narrow spacer webs 8, 9, 10 which
      offer only slight resistance in the driving direction of the boat.<br>
      <br>
      Merely by way of example, it may be mentioned that with a boat of
      the above mentioned type designed for driving 100 km per hour, the
      sliding strips 3, 4, 5 may have a length of from 1 to 1.5 meters
      and may have a width of from 80 to 100 milimeters, preferably 90
      millimeters if on the boat a foil or slide surface arrangement is
      provided at the bow and at the stern in conformity with the
      showing in FIG. 1. A boat of the just mentioned type has been
      tested at waves having a height up to 1 meter and following
      closely each other, at the above mentioned speed of 100 km per
      hour. During this test, no material vibrations and other
      intolerable hard shock heretofore common with heretofore known
      sliding boats of corresponding size have been encountered, but the
      boat has only carried out soft movements.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 3 to 5, the modified boat shown therein has
      its hull 13 which has a V-shaped cross section provided with three
      groups 14, 15, 16 of sliding strips. The group 14 which is closest
      to the bow has an inner sliding strip 17 and an outer strip 18 on
      each side of the bow. The intermediate series 15 comprises two
      inner sliding strips 17 and on both sides thereof two outer
      sliding strips 18. The series 16 at the stern has two inner
      sliding strips 17 and on both sides thereof two outer sliding
      strips 18. The series 16 lacks the intermediate sliding surface in
      order to leave space for the propeller 19. All sliding strips 17
      and 18 are so located that the transverse axis of the sliding
      surface is parallel to the water surface. The sliding strips 17
      and 18 are by means of short spacer webs 20 directly connected to
      the wall of the hull 13 and its construction. The cross section of
      these spacer webs is in the driving direction of the boat as
      narrow as possible in order to offer a minimum flow resistance.
      Between the sliding strips 17, 18 narrow gaps are open through
      which the water when being impacted upon by the sliding surface
      can quickly escape and without causing hard shocks.<br>
      <br>
      The outer sliding surfaces 18 may, according to another embodiment
      of the invention, have the transverse axis of their sliding
      surface extend parallel to the inclination of the cross section of
      the hull 13. All sliding surfaces 17 and 18 have a small angle of
      attack relative to the water surface plane and are resilient in
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      When the boat starts, it quickly rises onto the lowermost, which
      means substantially onto the inner sliding strip 17, in conformity
      with the dash line 21 of FIG. 3 which represents the water surface
      at full speed of the boat. When the boat drives straightforwardly,
      the boat rests on the water with the surface required for the
      total speed while the sliding strips softly equalize uneveness in
      the waves and at the same time dampen shocks without the boat
      being able to rock itself up with regard to encountered shocks.
      When the boat passes through a curve, the boat will lie on one of
      its sides while due to the stepped sliding strip arrangement, the
      necessary impacting surface remains. The stepwise arrangement of
      the outer sliding strips permits a stable drive through curves at
      which the boat, similar to heretofore known customary boats with
      stepped V-cross section will due to the screw lift adapt itself to
      the curve and will thus retain the same favorable driving
      properties as with the straightforward drive.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the multiple arrangement of the sliding strip series one
      behind the other, also shorter as well as longer wave intervals
      can be equalized with the boat being unable to rock itself up
      concerning the shocks encountered thereby. The sliding surface
      arrangement according to FIGS. 3-5 likewise affords a very
      satisfactory shock absorption while the boat drives softly.<br>
      <br>
      It is, of course, to be understood that the present invention is,
      by no means, limited to the specific showing in the drawings, but
      also comprises any modifications within the scope of the appended
      claims.<br>

      Dry air ventilation for speed boat - closes air inlet before water

      &nbsp;<br>
      A sliding boat having supporting members respectively connected to
      opposite sides of the hull and projecting therefrom in cantilever
      fashion while carrying a plurality of water sliding foils at the
      free end of said supporting members. Each of the sliding foils
      comprises a plurality of relatively long and narrow strips
      extending in the longitudinal direction of the boat and being
      spaced from each other in the transverse direction of the strips
      so as to form a gap there between.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to a water foil for boats with
      sliding foils. The purpose of such water foils consists in lifting
      the boat out of the water during its drive to carry it above the
      water surface in order to reduce the displacement work and the
      water resistance of the hull of the boat. The sliding surfaces or
      water foils may be formed by surfaces of the hull itself or may be
      fin-shaped or wing-shaped parts spaced from the hull. Such fin or
      wing-like parts, in contrasts to supporting wings around which the
      water flows on all sides, have only their bottom side resting on
      the water. These water foils in addition to having a reduced water
      resistance have the advantage that they are not subjected to the
      danger of cavitation, inasmuch as they do not have an
      underpressure area. Therefore, very high driving speeds are
      possible. However, the drawback is encountered that even slight
      waves may cause such hard shocks that they will be intolerable at
      high speeds for the boat's occupants. This drawback is
      particularly great when sliding surfaces of wide span and short
      extension in the driving direction are involved. Also, the
      inversed form of the sliding surfaces in the driving direction as
      it is employed, for instance, with water skis in which the
      extension in the driving direction is great and the width
      transverse to the driving direction is short still brings about
      shock stresses although to a lesser extent when driving upon
      waves.<br>
      <br>
      There has furthermore become known a hull with longitudinally
      extending sliding surfaces or water foils of V-shaped cross
      section which in transverse direction to the driving direction are
      located adjacent to each other while forming a step with each
      other. While such boats are markedly less sensitive than sliding
      boats with flat hull cross sections with regard to shocks caused
      by waves, also this type of boat will at higher speed and when
      encountering waves quickly reach the limit where the shocks become

      <br>
      It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a
      boat with water foils in which the sensitivity with regard to the
      height of the waves will be considerably reduced.<br>
      <br>
      These and other objects and advantages of the invention will
      appear more clearly from the following specification, in

      suggested to interconnect the sliding strips by means of a short
      supporting part extending in the driving direction, while the
      connection of the sliding strips to the supporting part is
      effected by means of spacer webs which are narrow in driving
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      These features bring about that each sliding strip will adapt
      itself to the movement of the waves and can swing freely and that
      the connections between the sliding strips and with the hull of
      the boat will when flooding the sliding strips offer the water a
      minimum of resistance.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to the drawings in detail, and FIGS. 1 and 2 thereof
      in particular, the four sliding foils or sliding surfaces 1 of the
      boat 2 are arranged in a grate-like manner and divided in driving
      direction into individual sliding strips 3, 4, 5 between which
      longitudinal gaps 6, 7 remain. Each sliding strip forms a
      relatively long and narrow strip having its longitudinal axis
      extending in the driving direction of the boat. The sliding strips
      are at their center portion by means of short spacer webs 8, 9, 10
      connected to a supporting member 11. Each supporting member is
      rigid or in order to adjust the angle in inclination of said
      sliding surfaces is connected to the supporting arm 12 so as to be
      pivotable about its longitudinal axis, said supporting arm 12
      carrying the hull of the boat 2.<br>
      <br>
      The sliding strips are made of elastic material. Their connection
      at the central portion of the said strips brings about that they
      can spring along their entire extension. This brings about an
      additional softness of the driving behavior of the boat when waves
      impact upon the boat or the sliding foils or when the sliding
      foils enter a relatively deep wave valley. The sliding strips 3,
      4, 5 will in this way be able to adapt themselves to the surface
      of the waves independently of each other and the sliding surface
      thus no longer represents a rigid structure. Furthermore when
      impacting upon the water surface, the sliding strips, by bending,
      temporarily form a steeper angle of attack whereby the strips are
      prevented from, so-to-speak, boring themselves into the water
      surface.<br>
      <br>
      For an unimpeded action, as far as possible, of the longitudinal
      gaps 6, 7 as well as for the spring behavior of the individual
      sliding strips 3, 4, 5, it is advantageous to connect the sliding
      strips with each other by means of a supporting member 11 which is
      short in the driving direction. Furthermore, it is advantageous to
      effect the connection between said supporting member and the
      sliding strips only by means of narrow spacer webs 8, 9, 10 which
      offer only slight resistance in the driving direction of the boat.
      Merely by way of example, it may be mentioned that with a boat of
      the above mentioned type designed for driving 100 km per hour, the
      sliding strips 3, 4, 5 may have a length of from 1 to 1-1.5 meter
      and may have a width of from 80 to 100 millimeters, preferable 90
      millimeters if on the boat a foil or slide surface arrangement is
      provided at the bow and at the stern in conformity with the
      showing in FIG. 1. A boat of the just mentioned type has been
      tested at waves having a height up to 1 meter and following
      closely each other, at the above mentioned speed of 100 km per
      hour. During this test, no material vibrations and other
      intolerable hard shocks heretofore common with heretofore known
      sliding boats of corresponding size have been encountered, but the
      boat has only carried out soft movements.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the above test as well as other tests have proved that a
      boat of the type involved and equipped with the sliding surfaces
      or sliding foils according to the invention is able to drive at
      the full speed for which it has been designed without causing
      inconvenience to the occupants of the boat and without affecting
      the construction of the boat.<br>
      <br>
      Referring now to FIGS. 3 to 5, the modified boat shown therein has
      its hull 13 which has a V-shaped cross section provided with three
      groups 14, 15, 16 of sliding strips. The group 14 which is closest
      to the bow has an inner sliding strip 17 and an outer strip 18 on
      each side of the bow. The intermediate series 15 comprises two
      inner sliding strips 17 and on both sides thereof two outer
      sliding strips 18. The series 16 at the stern has two inner
      sliding strips 17 and on both sides thereof two outer sliding
      strips 18. The series 16 lack the intermediate sliding surface in
      order to leave space for the propeller 19. All sliding strips 17
      and 18 are so located that the transverse axis of the sliding
      surface is parallel to the water surface. The sliding strips 17
      and 18 are by means of short spacer webs 20 directly connected to
      the wall of the hull 13 and its construction. The cross section of
      these spacer webs is in the driving direction of the boat as
      narrow as possible in order to offer a minimum flow resistance.
      Between the sliding strips 17, 18 narrow gaps are open through
      which the water when being impacted upon the sliding surface can
      quickly escape and without causing hard shocks.<br>
      <br>
      Sliding foils on each side are longitudinally spaced and aligned
      longitudinally below the hull.<br>
      <br>
      The outer sliding surfaces 18 may, according to another embodiment
      of the invention, have the transverse axis of their sliding
      surface extend parallel to the inclination of the cross section of
      the hull 13. All sliding surfaces 17 and 18 have a small angle of
      attack relative to the water surface plane and are resilient in
      themselves.<br>
      <br>
      When the boat starts, it quickly rises onto the lowermost, which
      means substantially onto the inner sliding strip 17, in conformity
      with the dash line 21 of FIG. 3 which represents the water surface
      at full speed of the boat. When the boat drives straightforwardly,
      the boat rests on the water with the surface required for the
      total speed while the sliding strips softly equalize unevenness in
      the waves and at the same time dampen shocks without the boat
      being able to rock itself up with regard to encountered shocks.
      When the boat passes through a curve, the boat will lie on one of
      its sides while due to the stepped sliding strip arrangement, the
      necessary impacting surface remains. The stepwise arrangement of
      the outer sliding strips permits a stable drive through curves at
      which the boat, similar to heretofore known customary boats with
      stepped V-cross section will due to the screw lift adapt itself to
      the curve and will thus retain the same favorable driving
      properties as with the straightforward drive.<br>
      <br>
      Due to the multiple arrangement of the sliding strip series one
      behind the other, also shorter as well as longer wave intervals
      can be equalized with the boat being unable to rock itself up
      concerning the shocks encountered thereby. The sliding surface
      arrangements according to FIGS. 3-5 likewise affords a very
      satisfactory shock absorption while the boat drives softly.<br>
      <br>
      The features of the present invention are directed to a slide
      surface rather than a sliding boat. The boat formations per se
      should not be considered to be the subject of the present
      invention. The water slide surfaces per se are involved with the
      present invention. Furthermore, the fastening of the individual
      slide surfaces on boom arms according to FIGS. 1 and 2 should not
      be considered to pertain to the crux of the present invention. In
      FIGS. 3-5 there are individual fastenings of the slide surface
      strips illustrated which would differ from the features shown in
      FIGS. 1 and 2. The essence of the present invention, however, does
      not involve such fastenings. Emphasis for the present invention is
      directed not to the boat but rather the water sliding surface.<br>
      <br>
      It is indifferent and unimportant whether the strips dissolve into
      the slide surfaces or the slide surfaces dissolve into the strips
      individually or in groups being connected with the boat body. The
      inventive concept exists particularly solely in the relationship
      between the water upper surface and the slide strips. Also, there
      is without meaning as to the present invention which type of boat
      is used whether open or closed when becoming supported by the
      inventive slide surfaces divided into strips. Only the following
      features are necessary:<br>
      1. That the slide surface or slide surfaces stand free or in other
      words do not form part of the upper surface of the boat body as is
      the case with conventional slide boats;<br>
      2. that the slide surface or slide surfaces would be subdivided
      into a multiplicity of narrow slide strips lying in travel
      direction in the longitudinal axis thereof;<br>
      3. that these slide strips themselves stand free which means that
      the same do not engage against a slide surface or against the boat
      body and that the same can be surrounded by water in the entire
      extent thereof. This is necessary so that water displaced by the
      strips can flow unhindered laterally thereof;<br>
      4. that the slide strips among themselves leave open gaps
      extending in a grill or grate manner among themselves extending in
      travel direction. The slide surface or slide surfaces are
      dissolved according in a grate or grill of parallel strips so that
      the water displayed by the strips can escape laterally and
      upwardly through the grill or grate gap. The slide surfaces need
      not lie in a plane as illustrated in FIGS. 1-2, but rather the
      same can be staggered as arranged in different levels according to
      FIGS. 3-5. This is, however, not dependent upon the form of the
      boat body. The staggering, however, can occur in accordance with
      the form of the boat body.<br>
      <br>
      The slide strips can be arranged in groups or individually on
      support arms or booms of the boat body. However, also this is
      basically not dependent upon the boat form. The illustrated boat
      forms and supports or suspensions of the slide strips are only
      purposeful embodiments which should not restrict or limit the
      utilization range of the possible embodiments of the features of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      The form of the boat must be considered to be completely without
      meaning for the function of the inventive slide surface since this
      boat configuration during travel upon the slide strips must be
      considered to be located completely outside of the water. There is
      purposeful only to select a boat form according to FIGS. 1 and 2
      with such slide surfaces because such would be more suitable to
      plow through greater waves in a frontal manner because minimum
      resistance would be offered thereby as to greater lateral
      attacking waves and steep seas. Such a boat would be seaworthy
      under all conditions.<br>
      <br>
      The slide surfaces described by U.S. Pat. No. 1,630,623-Ludasy
      issued May 31, 1927, have a width of an estimated 61/2 feet (about
      2 meters) as can be calculated from a comparison between the
      machinist illustrated in FIG. 14 and the propeller or tractor (air
      screw) reproduced therewith that must have a diameter of
      approximately an estimated 13 feet (about 4 meters). Such a slide
      surface accordingly would be approximately so large as that of a
      motor boat or larger. Corresponding thereto also would be the
      construction shown in FIG. 9 of the cited patent consisting of two
      Double-T and two U-carriers or supports. Meaningful is also the
      nominal relationship of length and width of the slide surface
      illustrated in FIGS. 7 and 8 (approximately 3:1). Such a surface
      is not comparable with the narrow longitudinal extending
      individual surface as represented and described with the present
      invention. It is particularly the essential inventive concept to
      divide up such wide slide surfaces into narrow individual surfaces
      in order to make possible an immediate lateral diverting of water
      upon engagement of the water against the surface. The dangerous
      and hard impacts which arise with slide boats at high speed and
      which even make possible higher speed at all during the
      encountering of waves can be based thereon that underneath the
      slide surface the water located therebelow at higher speed no
      longer can be displaced laterally with wide surfaces particularly
      with the nominal time involved but rather such water becomes
      caught or trapped under the slide surface and represents an
      extremely hard resistance. With sufficiently nominal width of the
      individual slide surfaces, the water can divert laterally so
      quickly under the slide surface that the hard impacts become
      avoided. Tests have shown that the width of the slide surfaces
      cannot be permitted to be greater than approximately 8 inches
      (20.33 centimeters). Preferably, the same should be about 4"
      (10.14 centimeters) without consideration as to size or mass of
      the boat. With larger boats, there are to be arranged therewith
      correspondingly more slide surfaces of this size or magnitude. The
      lateral spacing between the slide surfaces cannot be permitted to
      be too small in order not to hinder a diverting of the water.
      There has been shown that this spacing should not be greater than
      approximately 6 inches (15.25 centimeters) and preferably 2" (5.08
      centimeters).<br>
      <br>
      The teaching of the cited patent of Ludasy differs from the
      teaching of the present invention not only by way of the
      measurement relationship of the slide surfaces. The reduction in
      size to the aforementioned maximum widths of the partial slide
      surfaces and the spacing thereof results in an essentially novel
      effect which previously could not be attained in a different
      manner. By way of this inventive effect there becomes possible
      first with the slide boats to travel free of danger and subject to
      avoiding impacts that cannot be withstood at high speeds of for
      instance (100 km/Std 0.62 miles per hour) and moreover also to
      travel when waves are encountered. Thus there exists not only a
      difference as to magnitude but rather qualitatively and
      essentially representing a novel invention and greater technical
      advance.<br>
      <br>
      A further difference of the teaching of the present invention
      compared with the disclosure of Ludasy consists therein that the
      slide surfaces thereof must be rigid as proven by the fastening
      thereof at the forward and rear ends whereas fastenings of the
      features of the present invention can and should be elastic which
      can be attained by a middle fastening. Thereby the wave shocks
      additionally can be absorbed or encountered resiliently.<br>
      <br>
      The vehicle of Ludasy is practically hardly in a position during
      encountering of waves of high speeds for instance, more than 50
      km/Std (31 miles per hour) to travel satisfactorily. The wave
      shocks or impacts would shatter the linkage or rods which carry
      the slide surfaces and destroy or bend the moving mechanism
      thereof.<br>
      <br>
      Upon fastening of the individual surfaces on the boat body, there
      is of no importance for the present invention whether such would
      be provided according to FIGS. 1 and 2 or according to FIGS. 3 and
      4. The concern involves only that a sufficient spacing exists
      which means a spacing relative to the boat outer surface in order
      to provide the water with space to escape laterally. Also, the
      teaching of U.S. Pat. No. 3,381,920-Berringer issued May 7, 1968,
      is not comparable with the teaching of the present invention. Only
      the rear of the under side of the described body 10, 25 should be
      effective as a water slide surface (column 2, lines 60-63). The
      same has a greater width therewith than the width of half of the
      aircraft and would accordingly exist completely contrary to the
      suggestions of the disclosure of the present invention. The
      preceding lateral surfaces 20 are narrow only at the rear end
      thereof but should run in the water and should not serve as slide
      surfaces. The middle surface 13, however, as shown by FIG. 1 again
      is too wide so that this would make ineffective the result
      according to the present invention with which lateral more narrow
      surfaces are to be provided for effectiveness when such result
      should arise. Additionally, there is not provided any space for
      escape of the water in lateral direction since the passages 21 are
      either filled with water or would fill immediately with water. The
      requirements of the teaching of the present invention accordingly
      would not be provided in any event with the disclosure of Ludasy.<br>
      <br>
      The length measurement of the strips or sliding surfaces does not
      involve the most important consideration, but rather the width of
      the strips or sliding surfaces must be considered important
      because the width value is correctly stated in the range of 80-100
      millimeters, and this specific value is that which is being
      emphasized. There cannot be permitted any exceeding width
      measurement beyond the stated amount within the speed limits
      obtainable by the boat since otherwise a striking or impacting of
      the strips occurs when waves are encountered. The specific
      measured length of the strip surface engaging upon the water is
      determined according to the weight of the boat and the speed of
      the boat automatically; such determinative length lies
      considerably below the stated corrective length of the strip at a
      value of 1-1.5 meters.<br>
      <br>
      <b>The correct length must be 1-1.5 meters</b> as apparent from
      the drawings in the case. For example, if the boat is 5 meters
      long in FIG. 3, accordingly the slide strips are 1.4 meters long.
      If the boat is 7 meters long in FIG. 1, accordingly the slide
      strips are 1.5 meters long. The drawings in the case support the
      relationship of values as disclosed.<br>
      <br>
      There is the narrow cross section perpendicular to the water
      section and a longer cross section parallel to the water surface.<br>
      <br>
      Neither of the disclosures of Ludasy or U.S. Pat. No. 1,805,184
      Donaldson issued May 12, 1930, recognize decisively that<b> the
        slide strips must be very narrow in order to preclude a hard
        striking or impacting of the boat upon waves of the water.</b>
      The springiness or resilience recognized by Donaldson shows that
      Donaldson did not recognize any way for attaining the success and
      improvements of the present invention. There is clearly apparent
      that Donaldson did not have or recognize the features of the
      present invention, and moreover the Donaldson solution leads away
      from the features of the present invention. The surfaces of Ludsay
      are not any slide strips, but rather these slide surfaces are
      wider than the slide surfaces of normal boats. There is no way
      obvious from the disclosure of this reference with the size and
      weight of the boat involved to provide any basis at all for
      providing a grate or grill of narrow slide strips. Since
      previously the average man skilled in the art always proceeded on
      the basis of the question of the possible uplift or buoyancy
      during calculation of the slide strip surfaces, it must be
      considered surprising that such strips are not suitable at all to
      carry or support a boat. The questions of dynamics, especially
      with respect to the escape of water below the impacting surface
      previously had been basically neglected. In the creation of the
      possibility of quick, lateral escape of water there exists the
      crux of the teaching of the present invention and the cited
      references do not provide any showing or suggestion pertinent
      thereto.<br>
      <br>
      There has been conducted continuous tests over a period of many
      years proceeding from transversely placed wing-typed surfaces and
      finally developing the inventive strips.<br>
      <br>
      Even at very high speeds far above 50 km per hour, during
      comparison test demonstration, there is noted that the boat
      equipped with the inventive slide surfaces travelled smoothly,
      quietly, and without shocks and impacts while the comparison boat
      at the same speeds encountered shocks and impacts that could not
      be withstood. There was shown also that the inventive effect
      through the lateral discharge or escape of the water under the
      slide strips was accomplished during engagement thereof in the
      water. The water can escape or flow away essentially at right
      angles to the direction of travel with such narrow slide strips
      and the water can spray up between the slide strips so that during
      engagement of the strips in the water no essential resistance is
      encountered. As soon as the slide strips are provided with a
      greater width, the water can no longer escape or flow away at the
      higher speeds so that the previously known impacts occur.<br>
      <br>
      It is important that the slide surfaces consist of plural narrow
      slide strips and the form of the hull of the boat itself is
      unimportant for the effectiveness of the narrow slide strips and
      high speed when travelling through water.<br>
      <br>
      The Ludasy reference is over 50 years old and discloses no water
      surface for sliding boat to travel above 100 km per hour speed
      capable of encountering hard shocks previously intolerable at high
      speed for boats occupants. The features of the present invention
      for the first time made such speeds attainable and tolerable for
      boat occupants. The supporting members have a free end portion
      projecting in a cantilever fashion and a plurality of water
      sliding foils collectively form the sliding surface that stands
      off leaving gaps between each other in driving direction so that a
      grate-like structure is formed making it possible when shock waves
      occur to permit water quickly to flow off laterally and also
      making possible quick reduction of water pressure which causes the
      hard shocks. The strips are pivotable about the longitudinal axis
      and such feature clearly cannot be found in the 50 year old Ludasy
      and also cannot be found in the 46 year old disclosure of
      Donaldson. The Donaldson disclosure has been reviewed but nowhere
      can there be found the specific 80-100 millimeter wide dimension.
      No basis in fact seems to exist to find 80-100 millimeter wide
      dimensioning in the 46 year old disclosure.<br>
      <br>
      It is, of course, to be understood that the present invention is,
      by no means, limited to the specific showing in the drawings, but
      also comprises any modifications within the scope of the appended
      claims.<br>
