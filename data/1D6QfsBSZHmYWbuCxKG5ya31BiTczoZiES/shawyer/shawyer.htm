      <p>Satellite Propulsion Research Ltd (SPR Ltd) was formed in
        October 2000 as the corporate vehicle for progressing the
        development of a new form of electric propulsion. This
        electromagnetic “EmDrive” technology provides direct conversion
        of electrical energy to thrust, using radiation pressure at
        microwave frequencies in a tapered, high Q, resonant cavity. </p>
      <p>The first UK government funded programme was a feasibility
        study completed in 2002. This work confirmed the theoretical
        predictions in a large series of tests using an experimental
        thruster. In addition, the huge potential savings for the space
        industry were identified during the preparation of a business
        model. </p>
      <p>Following an independent review of the feasibility study
        report, a Demonstrator programme was authorised. This covered
        the design, manufacture and test of an S Band Demonstrator
        Engine. The Engine successfully demonstrated viable performance
        in both Static and Dynamic test programmes, and provided the
        basic knowledge to design the Flight Model Thruster. Once again
        a full technical report was prepared and reviewed before
        acceptance by the UK government. </p>
      <p>A feasibility study is currently underway to investigate second
        generation superconducting technology. This includes the design,
        build and test of an experimental thruster operating at liquid
        nitrogen temperature. </p>
      <p>A flight model development programme has started on a 300W, C
        band thruster, specified to produce 85mN thrust. <br>

      <p><b>Principle of Operation</b> </p>
      <p>At first sight the idea of propulsion without propellant seems
        impossible. However the technology is firmly anchored in the
        basic laws of physics and following an extensive review process,
        no transgressions of these laws have been identified. </p>
      <p>The principle of operation is based on the well-known
        phenomenon of radiation pressure. This relies on Newton’s Second
        Law where force is defined as the rate of change of momentum.
        Thus an electromagnetic (EM) wave, travelling at the speed of
        light has a certain momentum which it will transfer to a
        reflector, resulting in a tiny force. </p>
      <p>If the same EM wave is travelling at a fraction of the speed of
        light, the rate of change of momentum, and hence force, is
        reduced by that fraction. The propagation velocity of an EM
        wave, and the resulting force it exerts, can be varied depending
        on the geometry of a waveguide within which it travels. This was
        demonstrated by work carried out in the 1950’s. (CULLEN, A.L.
        ‘Absolute Power Measurements at Microwave Frequencies’ IEE
        Proceedings Vol 99 Part 1V 1952 P.100) </p>
      <p>Thus if the EM wave travelling in a tapered waveguide is
        bounced between two reflectors, with a large velocity difference
        at the reflector surfaces, the force difference will give a
        resultant thrust to the waveguide linking the two reflectors. If
        the reflectors are separated by a multiple of half the effective
        wavelength of the EM wave, this thrust will be multiplied by the
        Q of the resulting resonant cavity, as illustrated in fig 1. </p>
      <p><b>Fig 1. Diagram of an engine concept.</b> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="fig01.jpg" height="384" width="512"></p>
      </center>
      <p>The inevitable objection raised, is that the apparently closed
        system produced by this arrangement cannot result in an output
        force, but will merely produce strain within the waveguide
        walls. However, this ignores Einstein’s Special Law of
        Relativity in which separate frames of reference have to be
        applied at velocities approaching the speed of light. Thus the
        system of EM wave and waveguide can be regarded as an open
        system, with the EM wave and the waveguide having separate
        frames of reference. </p>
      <p>A similar approach is necessary to explain the principle of the
        laser gyroscope, where open system attitude information is
        obtained from an apparently closed system device. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Development of a Demonstrator Engine</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>Although the experimental thruster had verified the static
        thrust equation, it became apparent that the concept would not
        become generally accepted until a viable engine could be
        demonstrated. Accordingly, a proposal for the design,
        manufacture and test of a complete demonstrator engine was
        submitted to DTI. A Research and Development grant was awarded
        in September 2003 and the work started with a mission analysis
        phase. </p>
      <p>This work enabled the specification of the demonstrator engine
        to be optimised against the requirements of a typical commsat
        mission. Unlike the experimental thruster, the engine would be
        rated for continuous operation and extensive design work was
        required to increase the specific thrust by raising the design
        factor and unloaded Q. </p>
      <p>The engine was built with a design factor of 0.844 and has a
        measured Q of 45,000 for an overall diameter of 280 mm. The
        microwave source is a water cooled magnetron with a variable
        output power up to a maximum of 1.2 kW. </p>
      <p>To obtain the predicted thrust the engine must maintain stable
        resonance at this high Q value. Major design challenges have
        included thermal compensation, tuning control and source
        matching. </p>
      <p>The engine was tested in a large static test rig employing a
        calibrated composite balance to measure thrust in 3 directions,
        up, down and horizontal. A total of 134 test runs were carried
        out over the full performance envelope, with a maximum specific
        thrust of 214mN/kW being measured. </p>

      <p><b>Cost Performance Improvement</b> </p>
      <p>The EmDrive makes possible a big improvement in the cost
        performance of the Next Generation of Satellites. </p>
      <p>The EmDrive offers a more elegant solution to satellite
        propulsion than any other form that exists today. </p>
      <p>Satellites are not burdened with heavy propellant subsystems.
        The satellite platform configuration can dispense with the
        tanks, pipes and valves and the propellant itself. </p>
      <p>Launch site and programme costs are reduced as propellant
        procurement and handling costs are eliminated. </p>
      <p><b>LEO to GEO Security and more effective Mission Control</b> </p>
      <p>Satellites launched into LEO can then be positioned into their
        allocated orbit using the existing solar array generated
        electrical power in 30 days. </p>
      <p>The satellite is more maneuverable and errors in positioning
        can be corrected from Mission Control without damage or loss to
        the satellite. </p>
      <p>Launch mass savings of 60% plus can be made per satellite
        launch. </p>
      <p>Overall cost savings in fuel, orbit management and satellite
        design can save up to 70% of the total mission cost. </p>
      <p>At least two satellites can be launched using the same launch
        vehicle. </p>
      <p>Further satellite redesign can take advantage of the reduction
        in hardware required, which could enable three satellites of
        similar mission to replace the one satellite using conventional
        thruster combinations. </p>
      <p><b>Longer Satellite Lifetime</b> </p>
      <p>The specified operating life of the most critical component,
        the microwave source cathode is 15 years. </p>
      <p>Standard space industry cathode technology can be employed. </p>
      <p>Test cathodes have given an accelerated lifetime of up to 30
        years. </p>
      <p>With the increased deployment of space stations, a satellite
        can be moved from its orbit to a space station for both
        scheduled and unscheduled maintenance. </p>
      <p>The simpler satellite platform layout will enable maintenance
        as well as upgrades to the payload to be made more quickly and
        efficiently. </p>
      <p>A typical satellite using such maintenance procedures could
        have an effective lifetime of as much as 30 to 45 years. </p>
      <p><b>Flexible repositioning of Orbits</b> </p>
      <p>An almost unlimited energy source from the solar panels, via
        the onboard batteries, offers unlimited orbit adjustment. </p>
      <p>Orbit adjustment can be made at any time and can be made on a
        continuous basis as required. </p>
      <p><b>Payloads and Missions can be Enhanced</b> </p>
      <p>Existing launchers can be used to launch larger satellites into
        Geostationary orbit. </p>
      <p>Satellites of 20 tonnes per launch will not be uncommon. </p>
      <p>Deep space probes can be made to go deeper into the outer
        reaches of space. </p>
      <p>Scientific Missions can stay in operation longer and can be
        manipulated to view ad hoc situations without fear of loss of
        fuel for the thruster. </p>
      <p><b>The Commercial and Social Benefits of Lower Satellite Costs</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lower satellite launch and operational costs can be used to
        reduce transponder prices to satellite service providers
        typically by 50-70%. </p>
      <p>1. Increased use of satellites for two way broadband
        communications for data, image and phone will open up new
        markets. </p>
      <p>2. New markets and lower costs will provide more competition
        amongst SSPs and increase technology investment in new
        applications. </p>
      <p>3. Technological innovation, which to date has been slower in
        space related endeavours will now be accelerated. </p>
      <p>4. This will lead to new markets for satellite data
        transmission. </p>
      <p>5. It will provide a more universal coverage of information for
        all countries and regions on this planet. </p>
      <p>Lower all-round costs and longer effective satellite lifetimes
        will ease budgetary pressures on governments in the race in
        space. </p>
      <p>In the emerging countries new social services can be opened up
        on a wider scale than are currently available. </p>
      <p>1. Broadband multimedia can be used for education, health
        awareness, field hospitals and instruction on the maintenance of
        consumer goods. </p>
      <p>2. It will enable schools and communities in different
        countries to talk to each other and share their cultures and
        ideas. </p>
      <p>3. Wildlife can be monitored more cost effectively on a wider
        scale. </p>
      <p>4. Weather monitoring and mineral prospecting, to name two
        examples can be employed more cost effectively and on a more
        timely basis. </p>
      <p>5. Global emergency planning in the event of natural disasters
        can have a wider more cost effective coverage. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">EM Drive Thrust Technology Will Dominate
              Space</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>&nbsp;China's space attempt may be fueled by the newly-emerging
        technology that the majority of scientists are now contesting.
        Chinese researchers are currently trying to build the "Emdrive"
        (electromagnetic drive), which would change all space propulsion
        systems in case it becomes functional. </p>
      <p>Basically, the technology relies on converting electricity into
        thrust by means of microwaves, without contradicting the laws of
        physics. The original idea belongs to British scientist Roger
        Shawyer and, after the British government seemed to have lost
        interest in it, it has been bought (read financed) by a Chinese
        company. Currently, the project is undergoing at the
        Northwestern Polytechnical University (NPU) in Xi'an, China,
        under the command of Professor Yang Juan who has gathered a lot
        of experience in the field of microwave plasma thrusters, a
        similar hardware technology based on a different theory. </p>
      <p>The engines built by Shawyer's company (Satellite Propulsion
        Research – SPR) for demonstrative purposes produce thrust by
        means of a microwave-filled tapering resonant cavity. Australian
        physicist John Costella says: "It is well known that Roger
        Shawyer's 'electromagnetic relativity drive' violates the law of
        conservation of momentum, making it simply the latest in a long
        line of 'perpetuum mobiles' that have been proposed and
        disproved for centuries. His analysis is rubbish and his 'drive'
        impossible." That's an example of how Shawyer's theory is
        perceived by other experts. But no great idea came to happening
        without a strong public disbelief and opposition. Some even
        claim that, although SPR's work is based entirely on Einstein's
        principles, this particular theory and device type violates
        Einsteinian physics laws and, as such, it must be false or wrong
        at some point. </p>
      <p>In reply, Shawyer told Danger Room that "NPU started their
        research program in June 2007, under the supervision of
        Professor Yang Juan. They have independently developed a
        mathematical simulation which shows unequivocally that a net
        force can be produced from a simple resonant tapered cavity. The
        thrust levels predicted by this simulation are similar to those
        resulting from the SPR design software, and the SPR test
        results." </p>
      <p>This kind of thrust is sought to be replaced. </p>
      <p>Comparisons between the C-Band Emdrive and NASA's NSTAR ion
        thruster clearly demonstrate the superiority of the former:
        Emdrive obtains 85 mN of thrust using about 25% of the power
        that NSTAR uses to produce 92 mN (about a third of an ounce or 9
        grams). It also weighs only 7 kg, compared to NSTAR's 30, not to
        mention the propellant: while NSTAR uses only 10 grams an hour,
        Emdrive uses... well, none whatsoever, as it relies on energy. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;If the technology is proved to work, its applications are
        fantastic. The endurance of satellites would be enhanced, as
        well as their maneuverability, eliminating the toxic risk factor
        along the way. The probes sent into the deep space would exhibit
        faster speed, longer trek abilities, and they would be able to
        stop at any time, like when they reach their target or meet
        something interesting along their journey. Based on Shawyer's
        calculations, a solar-powered Emdrive thrust would be capable,
        in theory, to carry a manned mission to Mars in 41 days' time. </p>

      <p>Tom Shelley reports on progress with the controversial Emdrive
        and its potential applications in space and on the ground </p>
      <p>The Emdrive – originally revealed in Eureka’s December 2002
        edition as a way of driving satellites and spacecraft using
        microwaves – is now demonstrating its ability to produce thrust
        on a consistent basis and is scheduled to be ready for space use
        by May 2009. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile studies are underway into the design of a
        superconducting version, with a possible thrust of more than
        30kN/kW. While it couldn’t be used to accelerate a rocket, it
        might well be able to provide enough static lift for a flying
        vehicle propelled forward by other means. <br>
        Despite massive controversy, the project continues to be backed
        by DTI and private investors, and has now been shown to work.
        Roger Shawyer, who spent 20 years at Marconi Space Systems (now
        EADS Astrium), revealed details of the prototype engine and its
        development plans to an IEE chapter meeting in Portsmouth, where
        the audience included many ex-colleagues from his former
        company. </p>
      <p>Shawyer stated that many of the claims he is alleged to have
        made about the Emdrive are untrue, particularly suggestions that
        it defies the principles of conservation of momentum, or
        Newton’s Laws of Motion. </p>
      <p>The crucial part, as he explained, is that it is a relativistic
        effect that arises because the waves being reflected at the two
        ends of the conical cavity into which the microwaves are
        injected have different effective velocities, and thus different
        frames of reference, and that a closed microwave wave guide is
        an ‘open system’ in terms of relativity. According to Einstein,
        all moving frames of reference are equivalent. Why this should
        be so, whether one is standing still or going at half the speed
        of light, nobody knows, and in effect Shawyer’s engine could be
        chucking Dark Energy out of the back of it and functioning as a
        conventional rocket. On the other hand, there may be no such
        thing as Dark Energy, and Shawyer may have stumbled on what is
        really driving the galaxies apart. </p>
      <p>But as he pointed out: “I am just a microwave engineer and all
        that matters is that it works.” <br>
        In the present experimental engine and its immediate
        predecessor, the cavity is made in the form of a copper cone
        closed off by flat plates at the wide and narrow ends. The net
        thrust is proportional to the Q value of the cavity, where Q is
        the ratio of the amount of stored energy to the amount of energy
        lost per cycle. Acceleration extracts energy from the system and
        Q decreases. The development engine has a Q value of 50,000 and
        produces a specific thrust of 0.315N/kW. The original engine
        produced a thrust of 1.6 grammes, but could only run for tens of
        seconds at a time before the magnetron overheated and burned
        out. The present engine produces 9 grammes of thrust from 300W
        of microwave power and is continually water-cooled. The internal
        power density is about 17MW. </p>
      <p>A video of the demonstration of the engine in its test cell
        involved mounting the engine and its cooling system on a beam,
        and supporting it on an air bearing. The test was undertaken in
        October last year, producing a thrust of 9.8 grammes, maximum
        speed of 2 cm/s and a movement distance of 185cm. According to
        Shawyer, the tests had involved accelerating from rest,
        deceleration to rest, forward and reverse engine mounting,
        energising at different start angles and using different input
        powers. </p>
      <p>While 9.8 grammes of thrust from a 100kg of machinery may not
        sound very much, it is a much better power-to-weight ratio than
        the best competitive satellite and spacecraft propulsion
        technology, which involves using an ion engine. </p>
      <p>For a 1500W DC input power, an ion drive produces 92mN thrust,
        whereas an Emdrive, based on current technology, should produce
        330mN thrust. Furthermore, an ion engine of this size would
        weigh 112.5kg plus propellant, whereas an Emdrive would weigh
        9kg. And while life under power for an ion engine is about six
        months, an Emdrive should run for 15 years – or virtually
        forever, if the microwaves were generated by some solid state
        device. </p>
      <p>The big application is for commercial communication satellites
        – where ‘Hotbirds’ have a take-off weight of 3 tonnes, of which
        1.7 tonnes is propellant – both to get them from Low Earth Orbit
        to Geostationary and to keep them pointing the right way once
        they get there. Using Emdrives, says Shawyer, should save £15
        billion in launch costs over 10 years. While the thrust from the
        Emdrive would be small, it should get the satellite from Low
        Earth to Geostationary orbit in 36 days. Power would be from 6kW
        of solar cells fed to Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers. </p>
      <p>But what really captivated the audience was Shawyer’s proposal
        for the next stage, which would be to use a superconducting
        cavity with a Q value of 5 billion and a thrust of 3 tonnes/kW.
        Unfortunately, one could not use the device accelerate without
        “causing the Q value to collapse, losing thrust in that vector”,
        he conceded. </p>
      <p>One serious consideration is to develop the technology so that
        it could be used gently to divert a large asteroid in danger of
        colliding with the Earth. In fact, prior to Shawyer’s address,
        David Hall from EADS Astrium had discussed the use of microwave
        technology to study the internals of Near Earth Object
        asteroids. He said blowing up such a threat, Hollywood-style,
        was not really practical – the parts would still be likely to
        hit the Earth. Current ideas were mostly about finding ways of
        nudging asteroids into a safe trajectory. As acceleration would
        be so low, a superconducting Emdrive would be a possible option.
        A 1kW engine would require 24kW to keep it cool and shifting the
        asteroid would take somewhere in the order of 10 years,
        depending on its size. </p>
      <p>Shawyer said his team was thinking of using superconducting
        cavities of a type already being developed and manufactured for
        a major accelerator project, and cooling them with hydrogen. If
        applied to lifting a vehicle, the boiling off hydrogen could be
        used to provide horizontal motion by feeding it to conventional
        turbofan engines, if in the atmosphere, or to rocket engines for
        use in space. Whether the technology will ever be used to
        produce hydrogen-propelled air cars or other wonders, only time
        will tell. </p>
      <p><b>Pointers</b> </p>
      <p>Novel non-propellant microwave drive has reached the point
        where it can be run continuously </p>
      <p>Demonstration engine and cooling system weighs about 100kg and
        produces just under 10 grammes of thrust </p>
      <p>Next engine for satellite propulsion should weigh a little less
        than 10kg and produce 330mN thrust </p>
      <p>A superconducting design able to deliver tonnes of lift thrust
        (but no acceleration) is being studied </p>

      <p>"Why Shawyer’s Electromagnetic Relativity Drive is a Fraud" ---
        John P. Costella: "It is well known that Roger Shawyer’s
        ‘electromagnetic relativity drive’ violates the law of
        conservation of momentum, making it simply the latest in a long
        line of ‘perpetuum mobiles’ that have been proposed and
        disproved for centuries." </p>

      </p>
      <p><i>Roger Shawyer&nbsp; replies --</i> </p>
      <p>"The momentum exchange is between the electromagnetic wave and
        the engine, which is attached to the spacecraft. As the engine
        accelerates, momentum is lost by the electromagnetic wave and
        gained by the spacecraft, thus satisfying the conservation of
        momentum. In this process, energy is lost within the resonator,
        thus satisfying the conservation of energy. </p>
      <p>"The emdrive concept is clearly difficult to comprehend without
        a rigorous study of the theory paper, which is available via
        emdrive.com or the New Scientist website. This paper, which has
        been subjected to a long and detailed review process by industry
        and government experts, derives two equations: the static thrust
        equation and the dynamic thrust equation. </p>
      <p>"The law of the conservation of momentum is the basis of the
        static thrust equation, the law of the conservation of energy is
        the basis of the dynamic thrust equation. Provided these two
        fundamental laws of physics are satisfied, there is no reason
        why the forces inside the resonator should sum to zero. </p>
      <p>"The equations used to calculate the guide wavelengths in the
        static thrust equation are very non-linear. This is exploited in
        the design of the resonator to maximise the ratio of end plate
        forces, while minimising the axial component of the side wall
        force. This results in a net force that produces motion in
        accordance with Newton’s laws." </p>
      <p><i>Penny Gruber</i> ( 20:23, 29 September 2008 (PDT) --&nbsp;
        AFAIK COM has to apply in any inertial frame of reference.
        Assuming that the microwave cavity is well sealed as it must be
        for the high Q's Shawyer's system needs, then no microwaves
        escape. The magnetron, the waveguide to the cavity, the cavity
        and all the waves that bounce around inside of it are
        intrinsically in the same frame of reference, with no ejected
        mass or energy other than heating from the dielectric and
        conduction losses of the cavity materials. The thruster ejects
        nothing and so by COM cannot experience any accelerating force
        in an external FOR. </p>

      <p><b>Description</b> </p>
      <p><b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>The invention relates to a digitally controlled beam former for
        a spacecraft. </p>
      <p>There is a requirement in spacecraft for active arrays for both
        beam forming and null operation. The key component of these
        active array subsystems is a digitally controlled beam former in
        which variation of amplitude and phase of the individual antenna
        elements of the spacecraft's antenna array is effected under
        digital control. </p>
      <p>Experience gained from existing spacecraft highlights the
        difficulties of maintaining phase and amplitude calibration over
        the life and temperature of x-band digitally controlled beam
        formers. The requirements of null generation gives rise to a
        tight specification for these parameters and thereby temperature
        control within the limits .+-.2.degree. C. </p>
      <p>With a relatively large number of antenna array elements and
        spot beams, thermal control of the beam formers will be
        difficult to attain and will probably not, therefore, be an
        acceptable method of controlling phase and amplitude calibration
        of the beam forming elements. </p>
      <p><b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>It is an object of the present invention to provide a digitally
        controlled beam former for a spacecraft in which each of the
        N-paths of the beam former for each element of the spacecraft's
        receive and transmit antenna arrays is periodically calibrated
        against a secure tracking telemetry and command (TT&amp;C)
        uplink. This calibration process not only addresses the major
        design problem of amplitude and drift in the antenna element
        feed paths but can also provide the spacecraft with a secure
        pointing reference which can be utilised to provide back up
        attitude and orbit control system (AOCS) data in the event that
        the main optical sensors are disabled for any reason. </p>
      <p>The invention provides a digitally controlled beam former for a
        spacecraft having a multi-element antenna array and a control
        processor for the antenna array, the beam former including means
        for periodically calibrating the feed paths of the spacecraft's
        antenna array by measuring the apparent movement of the centre
        of a reference signal and a nominal signal and utilising the
        measured data to compensate for phase drift in the antenna feed
        paths. The measured data may also be used to compensate for
        amplitude and phase drift in the antenna feed paths. </p>
      <p>According to one embodiment of the invention a digitally
        controlled beam former is provided wherein the spacecraft has
        N-paths containing amplitude and phase control elements for each
        element of the spacecraft's antenna array, wherein the antenna
        array processor has a number of outputs, each one of which is
        connected to a separate one of the N-paths for controlling the
        weighting applied to the amplitude and phase signals of the
        respective paths; and wherein the beam former includes N-beam
        former channels, each one of which is connected to a
        corresponding one of the N-paths of each of the antenna
        elements; and means for sequentially selecting and calibrating
        each of the N-channels while the other channels are operational,
        the weightings of the signals applied to the amplitude and phase
        elements of the corresponding one of the N-paths of each of the
        antenna elements being varied in dependence upon the difference
        between the initial weightings and the weightings required for a
        reference beam. </p>
      <p>According to a further embodiment of the present invention a
        digitally controlled beam former is provided wherein the antenna
        array is a receive array and wherein each of the sequentially
        selected N-channels is calibrated in response to the receipt of
        a reference uplink signal from a ground transmitter of known
        location, the reference signal being applied to the
        corresponding one of the N-paths of each of the antenna elements
        and causes reference amplitude and phase signals indicative of
        the location of the source of the reference signal, to be
        applied thereto, any offset in both the X and Y phases of the
        reference beam relative to a nominal beam position being
        detected and applied to the antenna array processor for causing
        the weightings of the output signals thereof to be varied in
        dependence upon the level of the detected offset. </p>
      <p>The calibration procedure for the receive array is a two stage
        process, wherein the reference beam for the first stage is a
        spread spectrum uplink signal which is received by sweeping a
        wide receive beam in both X and Y co-ordinates by the receive
        antenna to establish a coarse boresight for nominal signal
        weightings, and wherein the same reference beam is used for the
        second stage and is received by sweeping a narrow beam in both X
        and Y co-ordinates by the receive antenna to obtain
        characteristic slopes and offsets for storage by the antenna
        array processor and thereby variation of the corresponding
        signal weightings. The narrow beam may incorporate a coarse
        fixed offset corresponding to the offset in the X and Y phases
        for the coarse boresight. </p>
      <p>According to another embodiment of the present invention a
        digitally controlled beam former is provided wherein the antenna
        array is a transmit array, wherein a reference channel is
        established to provide nominal coverage over a ground station,
        wherein a reference signal is transmitted from the spacecraft,
        through the reference channel, to the ground station, the
        reference signal being modulated by a recognition code, wherein
        the reference signal is swept over the ground station by the
        application of control signals to the amplitude and phase
        control elements of the N-paths of the reference channel by the
        antenna array processor, and wherein the signal level data
        received by a calibration beacon of the ground station is
        uplinked to, and stored by, the antenna array processor for
        effecting optimisation of the signal weightings applied to the
        reference channel and the sequential calibration of the other
        channels of the transmit array utilising the calibration beacon.
      </p>
      <p>The calibration means for the receive and transmit arrays
        include switching means for each of the N-beam former channels,
        the switching means being adapted under the control of the
        antenna array processor to sequentially connect each of the
        channels to the reference uplink signal for calibration while
        the other channels are operational. The switching means for the
        operational channels are change over switches and the switching
        means for the calibration channel is a n-way switch. The
        switching means can be provided by high speed switch diodes,
        preferably in the form of monolithic microwave integrated
        circuits. </p>
      <p>According to another embodiment of the present invention a

        means for switching operation of the attitude and orbit control
        system (AOCS) for the spacecraft to the receive antenna array
        calibration means in the event of failure of the AOCS sensors,
        the reference channel of the calibration means being used as the
        AOCS channel, wherein the correlator ensures that only a spread
        spectrum tracking telemetry and command uplink signal from the
        ground station is monitored by the detector and wherein the X
        and Y co-ordinate data for the AOCS is provided by the antenna
        array processor. </p>

      <p><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b> </p>
      <p>As is diagrammatically illustrated in FIG. 1 of the drawings, a
        digital beam former includes a beam forming network 1 having
        N-paths (1,2,3 . . . N) for each element (A, B and C) of the
        antenna array 2 of the spacecraft. Corresponding ones of the
        N-paths of each of the antenna elements (A,B,C) are connected to
        separate ones of a number of beam former channels 6. Each of the
        N-paths is connected to a separate one of the outputs (A.sub.1 .
        . . A.sub.N, B.sub.1 . . . B.sub.N, C.sub.1 . . . C.sub.N) of an
        antenna array processor 3 for controlling the weighting of the
        signals applied to the amplitude (4) and phase (5) control
        elements of the respective paths (A1,A2 . . . AN, B1,B.sub.2 . .
        . BN, C1,C.sub.2 . . . CN). The signal weightings for each
        element of a beam are indicative of the location on the Earth to
        which the antenna array is pointing. Hence, calibration of the
        N-paths can be effected using these weightings for a specific
        location or region of the Earth. Only three paths are
        illustrated for each of the antenna elements A, B and C but, it
        will be directly evident to persons skilled in the art, that any
        number of paths, channels and antenna elements could be employed
        in dependence upon the specific requirements of the spacecraft's
        antenna array. </p>
      <p>The antenna elements (A,B and C) include either low noise
        amplifiers (LNA's) for the receive arrays, or solid state power
        amplifiers (SSPA's) for the transmit arrays. The phase and gain
        of each of these elements together with their connecting cables
        must be calibrated. </p>
      <p>The antenna array elements (A, B and C) are adapted to
        establish beams or nulls for each of the channels 6 which may
        then be allocated to particular uplink, or downlink, users by
        the on board switching subsystem (not illustrated). The
        beamwidths, or null depths, and their position on the Earth are
        generated by the different weightings applied to the amplitude
        and phase control signals. </p>
      <p>Thus, a reference uplink will require reference weightings to
        be applied to achieve maximum received signal level. Variation
        of these weightings in a calibration routine will enable the
        reference beam on the spacecraft to be shifted in both X and Y
        phases. The variation in signal level will then enable on-board
        software to establish any offset from the nominal beam position
        that is required to counter drift in the amplitude and phase of
        the elements in the reference path. </p>
      <p>These offsets can then be applied to any other beam or null
        requirements, either as a fixed offset, or as a function derived
        from the slope of the characteristic obtained during the
        calibration routine. </p>
      <p>As, and when, one `reference` channel is calibrated, it can be
        switched, in turn, to carry the traffic on each of the
        operational channels, whilst the elements of that channel are
        calibrated. </p>
      <p>The calibration process referred to above is continuous with
        each channel being cycled through the calibration routine
        periodically, enabling short term temperature variations to be
        compensated. </p>
      <p>The periodic calibration arrangement for a receive array 2A is
        diagrammatically illustrated, in the form of a block diagram, in
        FIG. 2 of the drawings. The basic structure of the beam forming
        network 7 of FIG. 2 is the same as the beam forming network 1 of
        FIG. 1 but, for the purposes of the description, only some of
        the connections are illustrated. In addition, one of the three
        channels is designated as a reference channel `R`. </p>
      <p>As with FIG. 1, the receive array beam former is, for the sake
        of simplicity, shown with three N-path channels and three
        corresponding antenna array elements (A, B and C) only. </p>
      <p>As is illustrated in FIG. 2, the operational channels 1 and 2
        respectively include change over switches SW1 and SW2 for
        connecting the channel output terminals 8 and 9 either to the
        N-paths (AR, BR and CR) of the reference channel `R`, or one of
        the other channels. In the case of channel 1, the N-paths are
        (A1, B1 and C1) and in the case of channel 2, the N-paths are
        (A2, B2 and C2). </p>
      <p>In practice, the change over switches SW1 and SW2 can be
        provided by high speed switch diodes, i.e. PIN diodes, in the
        form of monolithic microwave integrated circuits (MMIC). </p>
      <p>The reference channel R is switched through an n-way selector
        switch SWR to a simple correlation/detector unit 10 comprising a
        filter 10A, correlation circuit 10B and detector circuit 10C
        connected in series between the reference channel R and an input
        of an antenna array processor 12. The correlation circuit 10B is
        connected to an input terminal 11 and the switches SW1, SW2 and
        SWR are each connected to separate outputs of the processor 12.
      </p>
      <p>In operation, a synchronised key code from a secure processing
        system (not illustrated) is applied to the unit 10 via the input
        terminal 11 to enable correlation with the x-band command signal
        to be effected. The output of the detector circuit 10C is
        applied to the processor 12 which controls the calibration
        routines and the application of control signals AR, A1, BR, B1
        etc to respective ones of the amplitude (13) and phase (14)
        control elements of the N-paths of each of the antenna elements
        (A, B and C). </p>
      <p>The processor 12 also controls the calibration cycle by
        providing switching signals to the switches SW1, SW2 . . . SWR.
      </p>
      <p>In practice, the processor 12 will, as part of the onboard
        autonomy of the spacecraft, contain stored data for beam forming
        and null pattern generation in the form of sets of control words
        for each channel, for example, A1, B1, C1 etc for channel 1. The
        control word values are varied according to the null or beam
        required. </p>
      <p>In operation, the initial calibration of the reference channel
        R is carried out by processor 12 causing switch SWR to be set to
        position R, SW1 to be set to position 1, SW2 to be set to
        position 2 etc. </p>
      <p>A coarse measurement is made at the commencement of the
        calibration routine using a spread spectrum uplink signal
        centred on the nominal position of the control ground station. A
        wide receive beam is swept in both X and Y co-ordinates by the
        receive antenna and a coarse boresight is established for the
        nominal control words, i.e. nominal signal weightings. A narrow
        beam is then set up incorporating, if necessary, a coarse fixed
        offset. The X and Y sweeps by the receive antenna are then
        repeated and characteristic slopes and offsets are stored.
        Control word offsets are then determined for each beam, or null,
        and are designated .DELTA.AR .DELTA.BR etc. The control words
        for the reference channel would, therefore, become: </p>
      <p>On completion of the reference channel calibration process, the
        calibration of the first operational channel, i.e. channel 1 of
        FIG. 2, is then started by changing the reference channel
        control words for those used for the nominal channel 1 i.e. A1
        B1 C1 etc. </p>
      <p>Thus, having set up the reference path to Channel 1, the
        processor 12 causes switch SW1 to be switched to position R to
        maintain traffic, whilst switch SWR is switched to position 1 to
        enable channel 1 calibration to take place. The calibration
        procedure for channel 1 is exactly the same as the procedure
        used for the calibration of the reference channel R. The
        resulting offsets and slopes are stored in the array processor
        12. </p>
      <p>Based on this stored data, the corrections needed for the
        actual channel 1 operational settings are then determined and
        the control words are set up as follows: </p>
      <p>The switch SW1 is then returned to position 1 by the processor
        12 with traffic now being allowed to flow through the calibrated
        pathway whilst channel 2 is set up and calibrated in a similar
        manner. </p>
      <p>The calibration procedures outlined above can be used to
        calibrate beam forming networks with any number of channels and
        antenna elements. The cycle time of the calibration process
        increasing with system complexity. </p>
      <p>The periodic calibration arrangement for a transmit antenna
        array 2B is diagrammatically illustrated, in the form of a block
        diagram, in FIG. 3 of the drawings. The basic structure of the
        beam forming network 15 of FIG. 3 is the same as the beam
        forming network 7 of FIG. 2 and, as with FIGS. 1 and 2, only
        three N-path channels and three corresponding antenna array
        elements (A, B and C) are shown for the sake of simplicity. </p>
      <p>The transmit beam former calibration procedures are basically
        the same as the calibration procedures for the receive beam
        former, but involve active participation of the control ground
        station (not illustrated) and the detector is part of the ground
        station equipment. </p>
      <p>The transmit antenna array processor 16 is used to effect
        operation of the switches SW1, SW2 and SWR and to apply the
        weighted signals (AR, A1 . . . etc) to the corresponding
        amplitude (17) and phase (18) control elements of the N-paths of
        each antenna element (A, B and C). </p>
      <p>A reference channel R is first set up to provide nominal
        coverage over the ground station. A beacon signal is then
        transmitted from the spacecraft to the ground station. This
        signal which is transmitted through the reference channel is
        modulated by a simple recognition code. The beam is swept by
        on-board generated control signals to the amplitude (17) and the
        phase (18) control elements, with detection data being measured
        on the ground. The received signal level data is then uplinked
        over the secure command link 19 to the processor 16 and the
        reference channel is optimised. </p>
      <p>As with the receive beam former of FIG. 2, the reference
        channel path is then cycled, in turn, through the operational
        channels (1, 2, . . . etc). The operational channel paths are
        then calibrated using the calibration beacon with the resulting
        slope and offset data being calculated and stored in the array
        processor 16. As the required beams are selected, the
        appropriate offsets are calculated for the control words and the
        beams set up accordingly. </p>
      <p>The transmit calibration routine will of necessity be slower
        than the receive calibration routine, due to the time delay
        inherent in transmitting signal level data from the ground
        station. Since a spot transmit beam can be used, the total
        transmit power required for the calibration beacon will be
        minimal, the control ground station will have a good
        Gain/Temperature performance and the beacon is narrow band. </p>
      <p>The AOCS, referred to above, normally relies on input data from
        optical sensors, typically infra red sensors, to provide a
        reference to establish the attitude of the spacecraft. With
        infra red sensors, the edge of the Earth is detected and used as
        a reference point for the AOCS. </p>
      <p>However, in the event that such sensors are disabled for any
        reason, then control of the spacecraft would be seriously
        impaired, if not, totally lost. It is, for these reasons, that
        much effort is being directed towards overcoming these problems.
      </p>
      <p>It has been recognised that it may not be possible to make
        spacecraft completely immune from laser attack and alternative
        spacecraft altitude and orbit control systems have been
        proposed. </p>
      <p>Since the calibration procedure of the present invention
        effectively measures the movement of boresight from the uplink
        transmitter position, for whatever reason, it can, therefore, be
        used to continuously update the AOCS with X and Y co-ordinate
        data. The beamwidth of this control beam can be extended to
        beyond Earth cover for coarse positioning data, or reduced to
        the minimum spot size for fine position control. </p>
      <p>Thus, the periodically calibrated receive beam former of FIG. 2
        can be modified in the manner diagrammatically illustrated, in
        the form of a block diagram, in FIG. 4 of the drawings for
        operation in the AOCS mode. The reference channel R is used as
        the AOCS channel. </p>
      <p>As stated above, the basic application of the periodically
        calibrated beam former of FIG. 2 is to compensate for amplitude
        and phase drift in the antenna feed paths by measuring the
        apparent movement of the centre of the TT&amp;C uplink beam from
        its transmitter position on the Earth. This movement could
        equally be caused by a change in the altitude of the spacecraft
        if the normal AOCS sensors are subject to interference. </p>
      <p>Thus, in the event that the AOCS sensors are disables for any
        reason, the apparent shift resulting from the calibration
        routine being applied to the designated AOCS channel of FIG. 4,
        would provide the X and Y co-ordinate data for the AOCS system
        at the X and Y outputs of the processor 12. During this period,
        the accuracy of the spacecraft altitude will be dependent upon
        the stability of the amplitude (13) and phase (14) control
        elements which form part of the antenna array feed paths for the
        designated channel. </p>
      <p>In order to cater for extended AOCS mode, some of the control
        elements of the designated AOCS beam would be temperature
        controlled. The number of such elements would be limited to a
        sub-set of those required to solely place the AOCS spacecraft
        receive beam over the transmitter position on Earth. </p>
      <p>With the arrangement of FIG. 4, the use of the correlation
        circuit 10B of the unit 10 will ensure that only the spread
        spectrum TT&amp;C uplink is monitored by the detector because
        any interfering signal will be reduced to insignificant levels
        by the narrow bandwidth of the detector. </p>
      <p>Whilst the calibration procedures outlined above effect
        compensation for both amplitudes and phase drift in the antenna
        feed path, it may, with some systems, only be necessary to
        compensate for phase drift. </p>
      <p>The primary objective of periodic calibration is to compensate
        temperature and life drifts of the active and passive elements
        in each beam forming path. As stated above, the achievement of
        the required stability for the paths on existing spacecraft
        gives rise to a temperature control requirement of .+-.2.degree.
        C. </p>
      <p>Assuming that there will be a continuing requirement for
        similar phase and amplitude stabilities and using a maximum rate
        of change of temperature for payload equipments of 2.degree.
        C./Min, it is considered that a minimum calibration cycle time
        of one minute will be required. </p>
      <p>It should be noted that 2.degree. C./Min is the normal design
        restraint applied to a thermal subsystem for an eclipse/sunlight
        change and therefore represents a worst case condition. </p>
      <p>For a 12 channel beam former feeding a 200 element antenna
        array, each Complete calibration cycle represents less than 200
        KBits of data, or a data processing rate of 3.3 KBits/sec for
        the array processor. </p>
      <p>The transmit beam former calibration requires less than 20
        KBits of signal level data per cycle. This leads to a maximum
        uplink data rate of 333 bits per sec on the secure command link.
      </p>
      <p>For most of the operational life of the system, rates of change
        of temperature will be very much lower than the maximum, and
        hence calibration cycle times can be significantly extended. The
        calibration procedure could also make use of variable cycle time
        dependent on measured drift rates or orbital timing.<br>
