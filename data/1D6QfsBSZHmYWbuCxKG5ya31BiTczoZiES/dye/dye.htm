              <big>New Engine to Slash 50% Off Emissions</big></font></b>

      <p>A Cambridgeshire firm’s new engine technology, reportedly
        capable of reducing CO2 emissions by 50 per cent, could become a
        commercial reality following a £40k award to develop a
        prototype. </p>
      <p><i>Dexpress delivery: Tony Dye, MD of Epicam, shows the
          revolutionary dexpressor technology to Peter Howarth of
          specialist consultancy Technology Business Development</i> </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="dye-dxprsr.jpg" height="604" width="580"></p>
      </center>
      <p>Epicam has broken cover after winning a national competition,
        ‘Springboard,’ set up by Shell to reward the most innovative and
        commercially viable ways of reducing CO2 output. </p>
      <p>Current engine technology only takes advantage of approximately
        20 per cent of the energy potentially made available by burning
        fossil fuels, with 30 per cent of the valuable energy being
        wasted as heat. </p>
      <p>Epicam believes its ‘dexpressor’, which harvests this wasted
        heat, could improve the efficiency of the engine, thus
        decreasing the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere by up
        to 50 per cent. </p>
      <p>The dexpressor works on a similar principal to a turbocharger,
        harnessing energy associated with the engine’s exhaust and
        translating it into mechanical energy. </p>
      <p>But where a turbo uses an impeller inside the exhaust manifold
        to drive a pump, Epicam’s technology collects the waste heat
        emitted by the exhaust and uses it to drive a pump-like rotor. </p>
      <p>As a combustion engine runs, it produces hot exhaust gases
        which leave the engine system via the exhaust pipe. Engineers
        regard the heat produced by the engine as ‘low-grade,’ i.e. not
        sufficiently intense to be productive. </p>
      <p>The unique technology, currently a computer model pending the
        development of a working prototype, accumulates and utilises
        this ‘low-grade’ energy in a closed system, heating water via a
        heat exchange coil around the exhaust manifold of the engine. </p>
      <p>The water in this system is super-heated to around 370°C, past
        the stage of steam, becoming ‘super-critical water’ and building
        up 1000 bar of pressure. The pressure is used to turn two
        rotors, via an innovative pressure retention system, a pair of
        “low friction rotating devices.” </p>
      <p>One of these rotors feeds into the crankshaft of the engine,
        lending its power to turn the wheels of the car. </p>
      <p>It is the method of keeping the high pressure created in the
        system and using it to turn the crank that is the secret behind
        Epicam’s invention. The help given to the engine in turning the
        crank could translate into being able to reduce the capacity of
        the engine by up to 50 per cent; so less capacity equals less
        fuel burnt which in turn would create lower carbon dioxide
        emissions. </p>
      <p>The £40k award will now give Epicam the financial capability to
        translate its dexpressor idea from a computer model into a
        working example of the technology, which the firm expects to
        complete in four to six months. </p>
      <p>“This award is a strong endorsement of Epicam’s innovative
        approach to CO2 reduction and will help the company to fund the
        development of a working prototype for demonstration to engine
        manufacturers later this year,” said Tony Dye, Epicam’s MD. </p>
      <p>The automotive industry is the entry point for the technology,
        according to Peter Howarth, who is working with Epicam on its
        business strategy. “But the technology could also be employed on
        a powerplant, or any system similar to an automotive engine
        which generates heat, and runs a driveshaft,” said Howarth. </p>
      <p>The company is extremely hopeful about the potential of the
        innovative design, but doesn’t yet have any offers from the
        automotive industry --- “not at this early stage,” Howarth said.

      <p><b>Abstract ---</b> A method for adjusting the fuel:air ratio
        supplied to an internal combustion engine comprises measuring
        cylinder pressure during each of a sample of engine cycles and
        obtaining a measure of the extent of variation of the combustion
        process, e.g. the extent of intercycle variation in said
        pressure at a corresponding stage in each cycle, comparing the
        said measure to a corresponding standard and adjusting the
        fuel:air ratio to cause said measure to approach the standard.
        Carried out continuously the method may be used for the
        management of the fuel supply to an engine. Alternatively, the
