      Below text moved from "Baltzar von Platen (1898-1984" (sic):<br>
      <br>
      I worked with Baltzar in the late 70's (looking for finance) on
      many projects which included :<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      1) A device to manufacture gem size diamonds.<br>
      2) A "water" driven car engine the patent of which he sold to
      Volvo. <br>
      3) A space engine that worked best at -273 degrees, rejected by
      the German Patent office because they said there was no such
      temperature ( 1925 or so ). Note the Nobel Prize in Physics
      awarded this week (10th October 2003). <br>
      4) A near "perpetual motion " device based on the fact that he
      proved that very close to absolute zero, resistance disappeared.
      Again refer to this years Nobel prize winners. <br>
      5) Curing a facial melanoma by catching some shark in front of the
      Saltsjebad Hotel , drying the fins and applying the powder to his
      face<br>
      <br>
      The above was all current in the 80's but of course in the 30's he
      produced the first synthetic industrial diamonds with ASEA and the
      first commercial refrigerator with a Swedish refrigerator
      company.( He called it "ice from a flame" ),<br>
      <br>
      He of course wrote a book explaining that he learned his science (
      100 years ahead of anyone else ) from two visits and meetings with
      visitors from space !!!!!!!!!<br>

      </div>
      <br>
      A Swedish scientist has revived a centuries-old controversy with
      contentions that he has discovered the theoretical basis for a
      perpetual-motion machine.<br>
      <br>
      Most foreign scientists dismiss the notion of such a device as
      contravening fundamental laws of thermodynamics, but the Swedish
      claim has created much excitement among scientific circles in
      Stockholm.<br>
      <br>
      The man making the claim is Professor Baltzar von Platen, 77,
      regarded in Sweden as the inventor of the modern refrigerator and
      the first person to produce synthetic diamonds.<br>
      <br>
      His theories involve the production of energy through a complex
      process involving air, ammonia, and salt in an apparatus rotating
      at very high speed, but scientific sources said the system was
      difficult to explain in layman's language.<br>
      <br>
      Professor von Platen has said in newspaper interviews that unless
      his ideas are invalidated by some natural law, the energy could be
      harnessed to run cars, warm houses, or power aircraft. He is
      expected to file a patent application soon and the secretary of
      the Royal Academy of Science, Professor Sam Nilsson, said he had
      gone through the 50-page documents and could find no basic flaw.
      He said the theory put Professor von&nbsp; Platen in a class with
      Thomas Edison, who perfected the electric light bulb, and Marconi,
      who developed the modern radio.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      But other scientists were more skeptical. One physicist said the
      theory ran counter to all known laws.<br>
      <br>
      "There is only a limited amount of energy around, if you use
      energy up and don't replace it, you run out", he said.<br>
      <br>
      The physicist was asked if it was possible that Professor von
      Platen had hit upon an entirely new law&nbsp; of
      thermodynamics&nbsp; that could explain his ideas.<br>
      <br>
      "Every day there are millions of processes going on and they all
      obey the laws as we know them", he said.<br>
      <br>
      At the heart of Professor von Platen's idea is a spontaneous
      heating process which is continuous.<br>
      <br>
      It begins with the air-water-ammonia process in the centrifuge. As
      it spins faster and&nbsp; faster, the pressure at the&nbsp;
      extremities increases up to 1,000 times that of the atmosphere
      (14.7 x 1000 = 14,700 PSI), generating heat which could be used to
      drive a turbine.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Sven Brohult, director of the National Academy of
      Engineering Sciences, said that even if the theory was only partly
      correct, the practical applications could be enormous.<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Vangard Note -- We understand that heat pumps are routinely
      claimed to have excess energy outputs in the range of 2 to 5 times
      what it take to operate the heat pump. An engineer we met here in
      Dallas named Mike Eskely also claimed to have a turbine which
      generated overunity by high velocity rotation of gases. Although
      we never saw a&nbsp; working model, he is convinced he is onto
      something&nbsp; and has over 50 patents to his name. Mr. Eskely
      told us that in Texas, there were laws that protected the power
      companies from having to purchase energy that was not produced
      using "acceptable" co-generation sources.<br>
      <br>
      One of the methods that is forbidden is HEAT PUMPS. If you try to
      sell your excess power (generated through a Heat&nbsp; Pump&nbsp;
      cogenerator) back to the power company, they are NOT REQUIRED to
      buy it. As we understand it, they ARE REQUIRED&nbsp; to&nbsp;
      purchase excess power generated from Solar, Wind, Fossil Fuel,
      Geothermal or Hydro co-generated systems.<br>
      <br>
      We would greatly appreciate further information relating to this
      subject, especially details of Professor von Platen's work. <br>

      1979-06-28<br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to a method whereby a cyclic thermodynamic
      process may be induced. By a method according to the invention a
      steam engine , a refrigeration plant and a heat pump (to name
      three relevant devices) of improved efficiency may be constructed.
      The invention is based upon the combination of two processes, one
      giving out, and the other absorbing work.<br>
      <br>
      In 1850 the German physicist Clausius formulated a proposition
      which has become known as the second law of thermodynamics. we
      shall call this Clausius' theory, or the theory.<br>
      <br>
      According to this theory (as is well known) heat cannot of itself
      pass from a lower to a higher temperature, nor can it transform
      itself into useful work. The theory implies a negation by
      exclusion, namely that perpetual motion of the second order is not
      possible.<br>
      <br>
      It is now known and accepted that entropy-reducing processes, i. e
      perpetual motion processes, exist not only in imaginary
      experiments but also in reality. According to Clausius' theory,
      however, such a process must,by nature, always be combined with or
      join an entropy-increasing, destructive process which (again
      according to the theory) must dominate and so undo that which the
      former process would achieve.<br>
      <br>
      The destructive process has (according to the aforementioned
      theory) always shown itself to be dominant, for otherwise the two
      processes in combination could constitute second-order perpetual
      motion - which is unknown.<br>
      <br>
      The following description will show how two such processes may be
      combined in accordance with the invention and that it will appear
      likely, at least theoretically, that the destructive
      entropy-increasing process is also dominant in this case, and for
      that reason second-order perpetual motion will not occur.<br>
      <br>
      It has been established with certainty, however, that the present
      invention makes possible the construction of a steam engine,
      refrigeration plant or heat pump of significantly greater
      efficiency than any such machine at present known, since the
      entropy-reducing process assists the entropy-increasing process.<br>
      <br>
      The destructive entropy-increasing process is carried out by known
      mechanical means such as pistons, cylinders, et al. To describe
      and illustrate these devices more than absolutely necessary would
      tend only to obscure the most interesting part of the invention,
      namely thaf which is related to the second law of thermodynamics.
      The following description will, therefore, be confined mostly to
      the latter. The well known devices already mentioned will merely
      be indicated schematically.<br>
      <br>
      They are not shown at all in fig. 15, which represents a practical
      adaptation, since it is assumed there that the second law of
      thermodynamics is dominant - an assumption which may be allowed to
      stand until the theoretical description accompanied by the
      extremely important figs 7 and 8 can be shown to be faulty. The
      theoretical description relating to the first five figures is also
      an important proof that the proposition upon which the invention
      is based, is correct. Nevertheless, the description relating to
      figs 7 and 8 may, if so desired, be studied without reference to
      figs 1 - 5.<br>
      <br>
      In the physics of entropy-reducing second law of thermodynamics
      processes giving out work, one important detail may be noted,
      namely that diffusion between two or more substances always
      occurs. In a process such as that represented by the first five
      figures the path of diffusion is extremely short, or in the order
      of a fraction of a millimeter. In a process such as that
      represented by any of the other figures it is many times longer,
      and in that of fig. 6 for example, is conveniently about 1 cm.<br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method for transferring energy by means
      of a cyclic thermodynamic process which is induced y means of a
      medium comprising at least two substances or two groups of
      substances A and B, characterized in that A is caused to diffuse
      out of B at a location point u' and to diffuse into B at a
      location point u"; the sum of the individual pressures of A and D
      i. e. the total pressure, is so regulated that a difference arises
      between the total pressures at points u' and u", the sign and
      magnitude of t' s difference being so chosen that the said cyclic
      process, in theory at least, tends to indicate a quality of a
      perpetual motion of the second order.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with the invention there is provided a method for
      transferring heat energy by means of a cyclic thermodynamic
      process which method comprises providing a medium comprising a
      substance (A), which passes through liquid and vapour states
      during the process, and a substance (B) different from substance
      (A) , separating (A) from (B) at a first location point by
      inducing a change of state in substance (A) , reversing the change
      of state of (A) at a second location point, maintaining a pressure
      differential between said two points by subjecting the medium to a
      force greater than that of gravity, combining (A) with (B), and
      allowing (A) to return to said first point from the location point
      of combination hy diffusion through substance (B). whereby heat is
      transferred from the one of said points at which (A) vapourises to
      the other of said points at which (A) condenses.<br>
      <br>
      The invention will new be described with reference to figs. 1 -
      16. For reasons already stated the first 14 figures are schematic,
      while Figs 15 and 16 show in principle how a practical realization
      of the invention ray be constructed.<br>

      Assume that I have a sealed, vessel or cylinder 1 in fig. 1. A
      small quantity of liquid 2 suck as, ammonia lies at the bottom of
      this vessel. The space above this liquid in the vessel 1 contains
      only gaseous ammonia. Ammonia molecules in the gaseous state are
      designated a-molecules. Of course molecules constantly change
      places between the gaseous and liquid states, but in the present
      consideration this is not a significant phenomenon and it may be
      disregarded.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine now that a thin gold foil (for example ) is made to cover
      the free surface of the liquid. One then pumps into the system an
      inert gas, for example nitrogen. Only a relatively low nitrogen
      pressure is required, say 20 atmospheres, but partly in order that
      the effect I will describe shall be clearly discernible and partly
      for reasons which will arise in connection with fig. 2, I shall
      assume a final pressure of the order of several hundred or circa
      1000 atmospheres. The temperature of the system remains unaltered,
      i.e. room temperature. Now imagine that I remove the foil. At once
      I observe a fall in pressure within the system as a result of the
      evaporation of fluid ammonia into the nitrogen. At this pressure
      then, the nitrogen behaves as a solvent for gaseous ammonia.<br>
      <br>
      The volume of fluid ammonia decreases by a certain amount which we
      shall call Av, and the gas-occupied volume increases by the same
      amount. The nitrogen therefore expands and its pressure falls.
      Since the nitrogen pressure is dominant, the pressure in the whole
      system falls in spite of a rise in the partial pressure of the
      gaseous ammonia. Those ammonia molecules, which have now found
      their way into the gaseous state, are designated B-molecules. The
      solubility of nitrogen in fluid ammonia can be assumed to be nil,
      or alternatively we may assume, that the remaining quantity of
      fluid ammonia is infinitesimal.<br>
      <br>
      It is fully in accord with Le Chateliers principle that
      evaporation of the fluid ammonia in the nitrogen should be
      accompanied by a fall in pressure. This- fall in pressure takes
      place so that the total rise in pressure as the nitrogen is pumped
      into the system shall remain as little as possible.<br>
      <br>
      If, when the foil has been removed from the surface of the fluid,
      the total pressure in the system is maintained at a constant value
      by means of (for example) a piston, the volume will decrease and
      the specific weight of the system will rise correspondingly. If in
      some way the B- molecules are forced back into the fluid state,
      the volume will increase and the specific weight fall.<br>
      <br>
      One should now apply the above to the physical sequence of a
      machine whose construction is shown schematically in fig. 2. Each
      continuous line in this figure represents a channel. I-I is an
      axis about which the machine rotates at high speed. Thus the
      contents of the machine lie in an extremely intense force-field.<br>
      <br>
      It shall be assumed that this is of the order of 100,000 g at the
      farthest distance from the axis. No energy is required to keep the
      machine rotating, if one discounts a small loss through friction.
      One may assume that channels 6 and 7 are approximately the same
      distance radially from the said axis of rotation, and channels 8
      and 10 also.<br>
      <br>
      The machine contains the said substances A and B.<br>
      <br>
      Assume that A is ammonia and B an inert gas of suitable mean
      molecular weight. A mixture of nitrogen and sulphur hexafluoride
      will be satisfactory. Also assume (for reasons to be shown
      shortly) that the contents of the machine flow in the directions
      indicated by the arrows in fig. 2. The pressure near the axis of
      rotation is assumed to be about 200 atm., and at the periphery
      about 1000 atm. One assumes that the inert gas B plus some ammonia
      A passes through channel 4 towards the center of rotation and that
      fluid ammonia flows through channel 5 in the same direction. The
      gas mixture continues along channel 6 which is parallel to the
      axis of rotation. From here it passes into channel 7<br>
      <br>
      There it meets the fluid ammonia, which has entered channel 7 from
      channel 5. Here the ammonia evaporates in the inert gas, wherewith
      ambient heat is absorbed and cooling occurs. The contact surface
      here between liquid and gas is the point u" mentioned previously.<br>
      <br>
      The inert gas and gaseous ammonia now pass outwards from the
      center of rotation through channel 3. accompanied by a rise in
      pressure and temperature. The change of state is adiabatic if
      channels 3 and 4 are thermally insulated from each other. It will
      be assumed for the time bein that they are also insulated. The gas
      mixture passes from channel into channel 8. Moving towards a point
      9, the temperature of the gas mixture falls in consequence of
      close thermal contact between channel 8 and channel 10, From point
      9 to point 11 the temperature falls in consequence of heat loss to
      the surroundings which are at a lower temperature. At point 9 the
      ammonia begins to condense. The heat released by condensation is
      emitted between said points 9 and 11.<br>
      <br>
      This contact surface between liquid and gas is the point u', also
      previously mentioned. At point 11 the fluid ammonia separates off.
      Since it is lighter than the inert gas, it flows towards the axis
      of rotation I-I through channel 5. The temperature at point 11 may
      be assumed to be equal to or slightly higher than that of the
      surroundings, while at point 9 it is a good deal higher. The inert
      gas, now impoverished of ammonia, continues through channel 10
      where it is reheated, channels 8 and 10 functioning together as a
      heat-exchanger. The gas having been reheated, it passes into
      channel 4 and so moves in towards- the axis of rotation I-I,
      cooling adiabatically as it does so.<br>
      <br>
      It passes thence through channel 6 (as already described) and
      comes together with the ammonia once again in channel 7.<br>
      <br>
      Channel 5 can be placed in thermal contact with channels 8 and 3 a
      1 also with channel 7, this arrangement winning certain
      advantages. This is not relevant to the present consideration,
      however, and is merely mentioned in passing.<br>
      <br>
      It shall now show how circulation in the machine, as described,
      can occur spontaneously. A number of lines II-II are drawn in fig.
      2, all parallel the axis of rotation I-I and cutting channels 3
      and 5. At the point where the first line II-II cuts channel 3 (the
      first line II-11 being nearest the axis of rotation I-I) we
      observe a very small, though not infinitesimal mass q of the
      gas-mixture, Its volume is v and thus its specific weight is q/vl,
      When this mass of gas-mixture passes through channel 8; fluid
      ammonia separates off and flows in through channel 5 towards the
      axis of rotation. This mass of fluid ammonia we shall cell q' and
      the remaining mass of gas-mixture q". Thus q = q' + q". At points
      where any of the lines II-II cut channels 5 and 4 we find masses
      q' and q" respectively. And at the points where any of the lines
      II-II cut channel 3 one finds masses q which, taken in order
      outwards from the axis of rotation, occupy volumes vl, v2, v3,
      etc. out to the periphery where we have marked the volume v 10, At
      the corresponding points in channel 5 the masses q" occupy volumes
      v' . v'2,&nbsp; v'3 etc. out to v"10. at the periphery, and at the
      corresponding points in channel 4 the masses q" occupy volumes v"
      , v'2 , v" etc. out to<br>
      1 v" 10 at the periphery.<br>
      <br>
      It clearly follows from the description relating to fig. 1 that
      v'10 + v"10 &gt; v10<br>
      <br>
      v"10 in fact contains no 3-molecules at all. These have separated
      in liquid state at point 11 and thus comprise the volume v' 10 .
      The above expression holds true even if some a-molecules accompany
      the condensate, that is to say if there is a shortage of
      a-molecules in v" , since the pressure of the inert gas is of a
      higher order of magnitude than the independent pressure of the
      ammonia. On the other hand, conditions close to the axis of
      rotation I-I are quite different. At the temperature which obtains
      here, the independent pressure of the inert gas is of the same
      order as that of the saturated ammonia vapor. Thus in the
      proximity of the axis of rotation 1-1 the shortage of a-molecules
      in the channel 4 brings about a substantial decrease in volume,
      giving<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;vi1 + V"1 &lt; vl<br>
      <br>
      Thus a force capable of propelling the gasses through channels
      3,8, 10, 4,6 and 7 is generated in the peripheral parts of the
      system. This force decreases towards the center and as a general
      rule changes sign somewhere between the periphery and the center.
      If this takes place, it is a function of the pressure and
      molecular weight of the inert gas. Pressure at the periphery
      however must not rise above a certain value or the ammonia will
      not condense. The system is thus fairly complex. The following is
      a simpler exposition.<br>
      <br>
      Let us now suppose the machine in fig. 2 contains only a
      convenient quantity of ammonia. As before, the machine rotates at
      high speed. We now pump into it an inert gas-mixture of suitable
      mean molecular weight. What is meant here by "suitable" will
      appear shortly. We pump in a certain quantity of gas until we
      observe that the liquid ammonia has climbed up channel 5 as far as
      channel 7, when we stop pumping. Now the centrifugal force on the
      columns of gas in channels 3 and 4 are equal to or slightly
      greater than the centrifugal force on the column of liquid in
      channel 5. Since we have chosen a suitable value for the mean
      molecular weight of the inert gas-mixture, we will further note
      that the centrifugal force on the gas column in channel 3 is just
      a trifle greater than that on channel 4. Yet it is enough to
      overcome flow resistance in the system. The difference between the
      two forces is identical to the propelling force that overcomes
      fractional and flow resistance. Thus the lower the chosen
      molecular weight, the greater this force will Be. But since the
      centrifugal forces are enormous compared to the flow resistance,
      the mean molecular weight must be fairly accurately fixed. By
      means of the process just described, heat passes from a lower
      temperature near the axis of rotation, to a higher temperature at
      the periphery.<br>
      <br>
      It may also be of great interest to study what occurs if the
      process is carried on isothermally, or to be more precise, at the
      ambient temperature. In this case a fine mist of fluid ammonia
      will form in channel 3 as the gases come under increasing pressure
      on their way out towards the periphery. It may be assumed that
      this mist is carried along in the gas stream beyond the point
      where the specific weight of the inert gas equals that of the
      fluid ammonia. Beyond that point of course (that is to say nearer
      the periphery) the specific weight of the gas-mixture is greater
      than that of the fluid ammonia. So it may be further assumed that
      the fluid ammonia, as before, separates off at point 11 and flows
      through channel 5 towards the center. The ammonia- impoverished
      inert gas passes through channel 4 towards the center for the same
      reasons as before. Thus the events described previously also take
      place at ambient temperature. In this instance the only benefit
      derived from such a machine is mechanical work. The machine can
      produce work in two distinct ways, or in both ways at. once. In
      one case the mean molecular weight of the gas mixture is so chosen
      that the amount of mechanical work apportioned to the gas is just
      sufficient to maintain circulation. The mean density of the gas is
      high so that the centrifugal force on the gas columns in channels
      3 and 4 is significantly greater than that on the liquid column in
      channel 5. The liquid is thus propelled in towards the center with
      great force and therefore, can transmit work to a piston pump or
      turbine. In the other case an inert gas is chosen with the lowest
      possible mean molecular weight. Its density, however, must be
      great enough to enable the liquid in channel 5 to reach up to
      channel 7. The gas column in channel 4 will be significantly
      lighter than that in channel 3, so that the gas will circulate
      with great force and can transmit mechanical work to a pump or
      turbine.<br>
      <br>
      Suppose the temperature continues, as before, to be the same
      throughout the machine. In channel 7 where the pressure of the
      inert gas is low, ambient heat is absorbed as the fluid ammonia
      evaporates. In channel 3 (channel 8 may be disregarded in this
      instance) gaseous ammonia condenses in the presence of inert gas
      which is at considerably greater pressure than in channel 7.<br>
      <br>
      With condensation, heat is emitted to the surroundings.<br>
      <br>
      Disregard the absorption and emission of heat taking place in the
      inert gas alone, since the process was assumed to be isothermal,
      and at ambient temperature. It is expected that condensation heat
      emitted in the presence of an inert gas becomes less, the greater
      the independent pressure of the gas. More heat&nbsp; then be
      absorbed when the ammonia evaporates in channel 7 , than is
      emitted when it condenses in channel 3. This difference is
      identical with the work done, expressed in units of heat, by the
      piston machinery or turbine.<br>
      <br>
      It is now known that condensation heat diminishes as the pressure
      of the inert gas increases . This seems to be an encouraging sign
      for the value of the hypothesis. Also relevant to this theme is
      another isothermal process, which will be described.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 3 represents a cylinder 1 closed by a movable piston 15. In
      the lower part of the cylinder is a small amount of liquid
      ammonia. The cylinder also contains inert gas. So that the liquid
      ammonia will remain at the bottom of the cylinder and not flow
      upward* when the pressure increases, we assume that the inert gas
      is light - say helium. The total pressure in the cylinder, when
      the piston is in the position shown in fig. 3, can be 200 atm.
      This state is represented by point a in the PV-graph fig. 4. The
      gas volume contains both helium molecules and ammonia molecules,
      the latter being differentiated as before into a-molecules- and
      B-molecules.<br>
      <br>
      Now drive the piston into the cylinder, keeping the temperature
      constant. The ensuing ch PV=graph fig. 4 by the curve abc. At c
      the mass of fluid ammonia at the bottom of cylinder 1 is greater
      than at a, ammonia having condensed out under the increased
      pressure.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine now that one can cover the free surface of the liquid with
      a gold foil. This done, allow the piston 15 to move out. At c, of
      course, B-molecules were also present in the gas, and since the
      foil now prevents any evaporation of the liquid, these B-molecules
      quickly become a-molecules as expansion takes place. At d on the
      curve ?? the B-molecules have been transformed. Here then, one has
      the same number of ammonia vapor at the same temperature. In this
      state, point d, imagine that one pricks a small hole in the foil
      which wi11 permit diffusion of just sufficient molecules to ensure
      that the mass per unit volume of gaseous ammonia remains constant,
      as the piston continues to move out. Thus during the change of
      state d - e in fig. 4 there is a full complement of a-molecules
      present in the gaseous state but no B-molecules at all. As in the
      case of fig. 1, the total pressure during the change of state d -
      a is higher than during B - a. For the same reason it is also
      higher during c - d than during c - b.<br>
      <br>
      When the state has reached e in fig. 4 remove the foil. A quantity
      of liquid then evaporates, that is to say gaseous ammonia
      dissolves in the helium, i.e. B-molecules find their way into it.
      The change of state here will be e - a in fig. 4, i.e. a fall in
      pressure at constant total volume. The perpetual motion work
      released is then equal to the area a-b-c-d-e-a . This work implies
      that there is an absorption of heat from the surroundings. It is
      easy to understand how this occurs. When the volume diminishes, a
      - b - c, ammonia condenses all the while. When the volume
      increases, c - d - e, only some of the ammonia evaporates. During
      c - d of course, there is no evaporation at all and during d - e
      only so much that the number of a-molecules per unit volume
      remains constant. The pressure in the inert gas is thus greater
      during condensation than during evaporation and , therefore, (as
      we know) the heat lost to the surroundings in condensation must be
      less than the heat gained in evaporation. In fig. 5 the abscissa v
      shows the volume of liquid 2 in the cyclic process described with
      reference to fig. 4 and as before, the ordinate p is the total
      pressure, i. e. the liquid pressure. In fig. S points a', B', c',
      d', e' correspond to a, b, c, d, e in fig. 4.<br>
      <br>
      It is worthy to note that a perpetual motion process such as that
      indicated by the graph, in fig. 4 could theoretically be possible
      at the lowest pressure one cares to choose for the inert gas. The
      lower this pressure is, however, the more difficult it is to make
      the process function. On the other hand, the pressure may not
      exceed a certain value or the ammonia will not condense. We have,
      of course, only chosen ammonia as an example.<br>
      <br>
      The processes represented in figs. 3 and 4 can also be explained
      in another, perhaps simpler way.<br>
      <br>
      Begin the process at point e in fig. 4 and have the cylinder 1 and
      piston 15 (fig. 3). At the Bottom of the cylinder 1 is a small
      quantity qx of fluid ammonia 2. Thus the volume between liquid and
      piston contains only a-molecules. Lay a thin gold foil over the
      surface of the liquid. Then pump helium ( for example ) into the
      chamber, the total pressure rising to e.g. 200 atm. Escape of
      B-molecules into the gaseous state is prevented by the gold foil.
      All this takes place at constant - e.g. room - temperature. Now we
      remove the gold foil. B-molecules immediately disperse into the
      gaseous state. The quantity of liquid q is so chosen that when
      equilibrium has been reached almost all the liquid has evaporated,
      there remaining only a vanishingly small though, not infinitesimal
      quantity at the bottom of the chamber. The position of the piston
      has until now regained unchanged. As instanced previously in
      connection with Le Chatelier's principle, when evaporation takes
      place total pressure falls. When equilibrium is reached, total
      volume having remained constant, total pressure will have fallen
      from e to a in fig. 4.<br>
      <br>
      Now drive in piston 15. Note that in accordance with what has
      previously been said, this may be done at any total pressure
      chosen within wide limits. The ammonia condenses. Point c in fig.
      4 is so chosen that when it is reached, the exact quantity qx of
      ammonia has condensed. Now lay the gold foil once more over the
      surface of the liquid, and then allow the piston to return to its
      original position. Clearly we have now reached point e where we
      started the process. Once again remove the foil, wherewith
      B-molecules immediately disperse into the gaseous state. When
      equilibrium has been reached, and only a vanishingly small though
      not infinitesimal quantity of liquid remains (in accord with what
      has just been said), we have arrived at point a.<br>
      <br>
      Perpetual motion work e - a - c - e has been released.<br>
      <br>
      Returning now to fig. 2. If the pressure in this machine is below
      a certain value or if the mean molecular weight of the inert gas
      is chosen wrongly one may still get perpetual motion work from the
      machine if the circulation is maintained by the sacrifice of
      external work, i. e. if it is kept going by force. This will be
      less than the perpetual motion work than is obtainable
      theoretically. In these circumstances then, the useful work
      produced is equal to the difference between the other quantities
      of work. This conclusion, can only be of theoretical interest
      since it is simpler to choose the said pressure and mean molecular
      weight so that the process as described earlier shall occur
      spontaneously. In saying this of course, one presupposes that no
      destructive, entropy increasing process causes sacrifice work in
      maintaining the circulation. Thus in circumstances where losses
      exceed a certain value, the final advantage of the invention is
      only that it enables one to construct, for example, a refrigerator
      or heat pump of greater efficiency than any yet known, but not so
      great that the second law, which holds that it is impossible to
      achieve second order perpetual motion, should still hold true.<br>
      <br>
      When liquid e. g. fluid ammonia forms in the presence of the inert
      gas or gas mixture, a diffusion of the condensing medium A takes
      place close to and in the direction of the liquid. The path of
      this diffusion through the gas is extremely short, but exists
      nevertheless.<br>
      <br>
      In the course of the cyclic thermodynamic process just described,
      it is supposed that substance A, which oscillates between the gas
      and liquid state, be ammonia. But there are many other substances
      to choose from. Propane CC3[18) is one at these. Its
      pressure-temperature function, i.e. PT-curve, approximately
      coincides with that of ammonia. Its molecular weight as well as
      vapour density is higher, and its specific weight in the liquid
      state lower than that of ammonia, and these characteristics
      contribute to a considerable lowering of total pressure in the
      machine. ( Other suitable substances A as well as other inert
      gasses B can easily be found with the aid of physical tables ).<br>
      <br>
      The machine could have many such channels 6, 7, 8 and 10 ( fig 2 )
      placed about the axis of rotation. Alternatively ( as will be
      shown 6 analogy in fig. 2 ) each channel may be a geometrically
      circular ring with rectangular cross-section. Each such geometric
      ring is defined by or formed from two concentric circles whose
      centers lie in the geometry axis I-I. The channels 6, 7, 8 and 10
      thus take the form of concentric cylinders. Channels 3 and 4 may
      be formed from discs whose center is also in I-I. All the channels
      participating in the heat exchange function, whatever geometric
      form they may have in cross-section, should be narrow enough to
      achieve a high coefficient of heat transmission between gas - or
      vapor- stream and solid wall. <br>
      <br>
      Even if circulation in the system occurs spontaneously ( perhaps
      against expectations, according to Clausius' theory ) it may he
      useful to control the circulation through two pumps, one each for
      liquid and gas. The pumps are built into the hermetically sealed
      system and so absorb no work except that lost to friction. They
      are conveniently driven by three-phase induction motors whose
      armatures are also built in. If circulation does occur
      spontaneously "against expectations" we will have (as mentioned.)
      a second order perpetual motion in reality, which as yet the
      second law does not permit us to believe. In whichever case, this
      machine also will be more efficient than any existing refrigerator
      or heat pump.<br>
      <br>
      Heat may be taken to and from the hermetically sealed machine with
      the aid of another system (presented in greater detail in
      connection with fig. 14) which is fixed to the machine and rotates
      with it. If these rotate in very, low air-pressure, unnecessary
      losses through friction can be avoided. This second system, whose
      technology is familiar, need not be hermetically sealed. A fluid
      oil is driven or circulates within it.<br>
      <br>
      If heat is to be transferred from the high temperature of the
      hermetically sealed system to its low temperature, this may be
      done by means of an ordinary steam engine which will release
      useful work.<br>
      <br>
      In the entropy-reducing perpetual motion processes described
      above, mentioned the path of diffusion of substance A through, out
      of and into substance B was very short. Other such processes were
      mentioned, in which the path of diffusion was many times greater.<br>
      <br>
      These we will now describe with reference to figs. 6 - 16.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 6 represents a hermetically sealed vessel 21 of convenient
      material e. g. steel. The vessel contains a beaker 22 of other
      suitable material such as glass which has low thermal
      conductivity. We suppose that the bottom 22a of beaker 22 is
      porous glass, china clay or other such suitable material. The
      beaker stands on a thin porous tile 23 which covers the bottom of
      the vessel 21.There is thus contact between bodies 22a and 23. We
      also suppose that the beaker 22 is filled nearly to the brim 22b
      with a suitable liquid 24 substance A. The upper surface of this
      liquid 24 is marked y", which also designates a level. The brim
      22b of the beaker and the surface y" lie very close to the ceiling
      21a of vessel 21. The substance A may be propane (C3H8 ), ammonia
      (NH3) water, et al. The remaining volume 25 of vessel 21 contains
      of course, gas or vapor of substance A. It also contains substance
      B in gaseous state. A mixture of the heavy inert gases sulfur
      hexafluoride SF6 and xenon X is suitable. The whole device is at
      room temperature o and is subject to a force field expressed as
      ng, where g is earth gravity and n a variable factor. Assume that
      heat Q can leave the device only through, the porous tile 23 and
      enter it only through the liquid surface y". We choose the partial
      pressure of B so that the mean specific weight of the gas mixture
      in chamber 25 equals the specific weight of the liquid 24. When B
      is composed of said substances SF and X, the said partial pressure
      is of the order of 100 atm.<br>
      <br>
      Suppose that the value of n is between 60,000 and 100,000, which
      is easily achieved centrifugally.<br>
      <br>
      Assume for practical purposes that force-field ng is the same
      throughout the inner volume of vessel 21. Suppose finally that
      substance A is propane ( C3H3 ), which happens to have a fairly
      high molecular weight or vapor density and fairly low specific
      weight in liquid state.<br>
      <br>
      For reasons which will be clarified shortly, when we consider fig.
      7 and 8 , we have the right to assume that the following can take
      place. The propane evaporates under partial pressure p" from the
      surface y" , whose temperature in dynamic equilibrium is T2.<br>
      <br>
      Force field n causes propane vapor to diffuse downward through the
      inert gas ( SF and X ) in chamber 25, following which it condenses
      under partial pressure p' at the floor 23, whose temperature in
      dynamic equilibrium is T1. One then has p'&gt; p" and T1 &gt; T .
      In this process, then, heat passes of itself from a lower to a
      higher temperature, since no work is requires to maintain
      force-field ng if small fractional losses are discounted.<br>
      <br>
      As has just Been said, this is merely yet an assumption.<br>
      <br>
      But in considering figs. 7 and 8 we will begin to see how great
      the possibility is that the assumption accords with reality.<br>
      <br>
      Now designate a fraction of the pressure pl as p'6, and a fraction
      of p" as p" . The existence of these fractional pressures is
      analogous to conditions already described in conjunction with
      figs. 1 to 5, that is to say that B-molecules of propane are
      forced from the liquid into the gaseous state by the inert gas.
      Clearly p'B&gt;p"B, since the pressure of the Inert gas due to the
      action of force-field ng is greater at the floor 23 than at the
      surface y". This difference, P'B3 - P"B, tends to lower the
      temperature T immediately above the floor 23 or, expressed another
      way, the propane molecules coming down from surface y" have
      difficulty penetrating the zone immediately above the floor 23
      because some of the space is already taken by the B-molecules that
      are generating pressure p'. This phenomenon appears to indicate
      that the molecular weights of substances A and B could be chosen
      relative each other so as to eliminate the perpetual motion effect
      attempted to be obtained.<br>
      <br>
      As an example of substance A was named propane was mentioned its
      relatively high molecular weight. It is, however, considerably
      less than that of sulfur hexafluoride and xenon, which mixture was
      named an example of substance 13. Now exchange the latter mixture
      for hydrogen, or hydrogen plus nitrogen (H,N2). The pressure in
      the device, which was previously of the order of 100 atm, will now
      of course be several times greater since the weight of the gas
      column in chamber 25 must equal that of the liquid column in
      Beaker 22.<br>
      <br>
      It is now easier to visualize that the propane vapor diffuses
      downwards through the inert gas to the floor 23 and there
      condenses at a higher temperature T1 than the temperature T2 at
      which it evaporated from surface y".<br>
      <br>
      One can believe this because both hydrogen and nitrogen are
      considerably lighter than propane. For analogous reasons one could
      visualize diffusion of A against the direction of force-field ng
      instead of with it; that the floor 23 and condensation at higher
      temperature at the surface y", if one simply exchanged the propane
      for ammonia (H3N) which has a low molecular weight, and used SF 6
      and X as previously mentioned for the inert medium B.<br>
      <br>
      In this case the force engendered by the B-molecules is acting in
      the same direction as diffusion.<br>
      <br>
      That said about fig. 6, further detailed explanation is not
      possible due to lack of experimental data. A formula exists for
      deriving values of p'B and p"B, but it cannot serve, partly
      because it is based on the assumption that Clausius' theory is
      generally applicable and partly because of lack of data. Fig. 6
      will, however, emerge clearly after discussion of fig. 7 and 8,,
      partly because it is closely related to them and partly because a
      description of then is not hindered by any lack of experimental
      and theoretical data in the case where diffusion of A through B
      takes place against the direction of the force-field ng.<br>
      <br>
      The vessel 30 in fig. 7 corresponds to vessel 21 in fig. 6 above.
      In this vessel 30 is a beaker 31. A partition 34 divides the
      interior of the beaker into two parts, 35a and 35b. These spaces
      communicate with each other through the opening 36 at the bottom
      of partition 34 and through. the opening 37 over the top of
      partition 34, which, does not reach, fully to the brim of Beaker
      31. Out of the bottom of beaker 31 runs a short channel 38
      reaching almost to the bottom 30' of vessel 30. Chambers or
      channels 35a and 35b together with the partition 34 can form a
      heat exchanger 35. The interior of the vessel 30 outside beaker 31
      is divided by a wall 40 into two parts, an upper chamber 30a and a
      lower 30b, which chambers are connected only by the gas pump or
      compressor 41. The bottom of beaker 31 is covered by a porous tile
      42 whose upper surface is itself covered by a semi-permeable
      coating or membrane 44 which is hermetically sealed to the
      interior surface of beaker 31. In this connection it may be
      mentioned that it is known that a liquid which is not or is very
      little soluble in the liquid with which it is in contact, can
      function as a semi-permeable member. However, at least for the
      time being one assumes that membrane 44 is a common membrane of
      the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      Beaker 31 is almost entirely filled with a suitable liquid whose
      free surface y" (which also denotes a level) lies between the
      upper edge of partition 34 and the brim of said beaker. This
      liquid also occupies the pore of the semi-permeable membrane 44
      and the tile 42, channel 38 and, as a thin layer, the bottom of
      chamber 30b up to the level y' which may also be described as the
      free surface of the liquid in that chamber. One presupposes that
      the two said free surfaces of the liquid are maintained by
      convenient means at the constant levels y' and y". Apart from that
      occupied by the liquid, the entire remaining volume of vessel 30
      contains gas or the liquid vapor. Assume (only for example) that
      the liquid is ammonia.<br>
      <br>
      Temperature of the upper part of the vessel 30 may be denoted T2,
      of the lower part T1, and of the surroundings T0. The whole
      apparatus is subject to a force-field ng .<br>
      <br>
      Assume n =- 1, i. e. the apparatus is subject only to gravity,
      with ambient temperature throughout, T1 = T2 = Ta. Now let T1 rise
      to e.g. 50 C and let T2 sink to e. g. -10 C and in doing so the
      force field n must be raised from 1 to a value designated n0,
      which is precisely enough to keep the liquid levels y' and y"
      unaltered.<br>
      <br>
      Vapor pressure p' of the ammonia in chamber 30b is that which,
      obtains at the exemplary temperature T1, i.e. 50 C, and this value
      for p' will remain constant during the argument which follows. On
      the other hand, as will soon show, vapor pressure p" above surface
      y" will vary.<br>
      <br>
      At this stage of course, p" is the vapor pressure of fluid ammonia
      at the exemplary temperature T2, i. e. -10 C.<br>
      <br>
      In order to maintain the value of T and T start up the pump or
      compressor 41. Ammonia vapor is pumped from chamber 30a and
      pressure p" to chamber 30b and pressure p' .<br>
      <br>
      The ammonia boils away from the liquid surface y", absorbing heat,
      and condenses at liquid surface y' emitting heat. The liquid
      formed from condensation at temperature T flows against the
      force-field ng through channel 38, the porous bodies 42 and 44 and
      the channels 35a and 35b, finally reaching the low temperature T
      where it changes to vapor. The arrangement functions just like an
      ordinary compressor refrigerator. It will be supposed that the
      cycle takes place without loss and that the work required,
      delivered only to compressor 41, has consequently the minimum
      value given by Carnot's equation, which work will be [ illegible ]
      d Lc . It should be mentioned that, for the cycle to take place
      without loss, liquid must pass from<br>
      T1 to T by means of a reversible process which, delivers a little
      work to compressor 41. This consideration is elementary and so
      need not be amplified. The gas compressor 41 could be exchanged
      for a liquid pump by which, liquid ammonia in chamber 30b would be
      pumped into beaker 31, and in this case the gas pressure p' would
      be generated solely by the force-field ng acting on the gas in
      chamber 30a and, if T2 is constant, T1 would clearly be a function
      of n.<br>
      <br>
      Now shall be investigated how one may minimize the work
      sacrificed, or arrange that it is less than Lc without, of course,
      reducing the quantity of heat that is to be transferred from the
      lower temperature T2 to the higher T1 . In the fluid ammonia in
      beaker 31 now dissolve a substance such as a salt or a mixture of
      two salts e.g. LiNO 3 ,&nbsp; NaI, KI, NH4N03 , KN03 or KNO2. Said
      substance may of course also be a liquid which is wholly or
      partially soluble in the substance A (e.g. NH3 ). All these
      substances have considerably greater molecular weight than
      ammonia. One must of course take care that the addition of the
      salts does not give too great a volume of liquid in beaker 51.
      Thus arrange in some way that the liquid circulates through
      heat-exchanger 35 in the direction indicated, and it shall be
      assumed that no heat losses occur, i.e. that it is completely
      efficient.<br>
      <br>
      The dissolved salt has a high osmotic pressure which seeks to draw
      liquid from the chamber 30b through the membrane 44.<br>
      <br>
      In order to maintain equilibrium so that the liquid level in
      chamber 30b will remain unaltered at y' and similarly the liquid
      level in beaker 31 unaltered at y", one must increase the value of
      factor n, say from n0 to n .<br>
      <br>
      Now, work will be released in the heat exchanger 35 since the
      liquid flowing upwards through channel 35a contains a little more
      ammonia and, therefore,, Ray a lower specific weight than the
      liquid flowing downwards in channel 356. But theoretically this
      work can be retained and passed on to the compressor 41.<br>
      <br>
      For this and other physical reasons which need not be described,
      one may disregard this phenomenon; that is, may fairly assume that
      the work dissipated by the heat-exchanger is nil or, in the case
      of combinations other than ammonia and a salt, that the work
      consumed by it is likewise nil. The apparatus described here
      functions in , a manner equivalent to an ordinary so-called
      resorption refrigerator, and it follows that since no irreversible
      losses occur, the work that must be transferred to the compressor
      41 remains constant or equal to Lc. Since the vapor pressure p' of
      the pure ammonia above surface y' remains unaltered, T being
      constant, and since the work required by the process according to
      Carnot also remains unchanged, and the quantity of heat to be
      transferred from T to T both likewise being constant, then the
      pressure immediately above the compressor, P , and with it the
      factor p' - p which is proportional to the work, must also remain
      unaltered in spite of the increase of factor n from no to nl. All
      these conditions follow from Carnot's equation, hence a
      physical-chemical proof is not required. Further, no perpetual
      motion process exists in this case.<br>
      <br>
      Now stop circulation of the liquid in the heat exchanger 35 and
      keep factor n unchanged at the value n1. The salt concentration
      immediately above the membrane 44 now rises due to diffusion of
      the salt downwards under the influence of force-field ng. The
      small amount of fluid ammonia at the bottom of chamber 306, in
      channel 38 and in the porous tile 42 now drawn up through the
      membrane 44 into the beaker 31. Ammonia gas makes contact with the
      underside of membrane 44 and the liquid filling each pore in the
      membrane acquires a concave surface facing downwards towards
      chamber 306. These surfaces are concave since, if menisci were to
      form in the downward-facing pores of the membrane 44 in the
      absence of diffusion, they would be plane; surface y' being plane.
      When diffusion takes place osmotic pressure builds up, and the
      menisci must become concave to withstand it. The gas pressure p'
      sinks in consequence. Salt concentration in the upper part of the
      beaker falls due to diffusion downwards of the salt under the
      influence of force-field ng. As a result gas pressure p" increase?
      and with it gas pressure Px. Thus the difference between the
      pressure p' and px has been reduced and in consequence less work
      needs to be supplied to the compressor for it to move the same
      quantity of heat from T2 to T .<br>
      <br>
      This work which we will call L is thus less than Lc, which (
      according to what has already been stated ) implies<br>
      that the process is perpetual motion of the second order.<br>
      <br>
      When Lp is greater than zero but less than Lc ( L c &gt; 1, &gt;0
      ) the process may be described as incomplete second order
      perpetual motion. When L is equal to or less than zero ( L&lt;0 )
      the process may be called complete.<br>
      <br>
      When T2 is equal to T1 , px is greater than p' and the compressor
      then functions as a rotor, delivering mechanical work. This also
      means that Lp&lt;0 . It will been seen from this that, at a
      certain difference between T1 and T2, Lp will equal zero. This
      condition will now be illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      Assume that the machine is functioning as a resorption
      refrigerator. The liquid is circulating in the heat exchanger 35.
      Suppose T1 = T2. The machine is pumping heat from T- to T1 but
      since T1 - T2 and thus Delta T = 0 the work required by the pump
      equals zero, in accord with the ordinary laws of thermodynamics.<br>
      <br>
      Thus px = p'. We now stop the circulation of liquid in the
      heat-exchanger 35. Diffusion of the salt causes p' to fall and p",
      also px , to rise. Thus px&gt; p' and the compressor 41 now
      functions as a motor or steam engine. At a certain value for T1,
      Px = p'. The machine then delivers no work, that is, the
      compressor 41 no longer functions as a motor, and the machine
      becomes merely a refrigerator - a perpetual motion refrigerator.<br>
      <br>
      In a case where there is no circulation in the heat-exchanger (a,
      in the preceding paragraph ) the partition 34 can be removed and
      the beaker 31 could contain, instead of the ammonia, a mixture of
      two liquids of limited solubility. This could be advantageous in
      certain circumstances which will not be described in further
      detail. Suffice it to say that a perpetual motion process could
      also be induced in this case.<br>
      <br>
      In Fig.7 the previously mentioned point u" is formed at the upper
      surface of membrane 44 while u' while u' clearly coincides with
      surface y".<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 8 differs only slightly from fig. 7. Two channels 52 and 53
      lead out of the bottom of beaker 31 down to the bottom of vessel
      30. In each is a liquid pump 52a and 53a. One of these, say 52a,
      pumps out liquid from beaker 31 while the other pumps liquid into
      it so that the liquid is an ammonia-salt solution.<br>
      <br>
      Liquid is circulating in the heat-exchanger 3S, compressor 41 is
      functioning and force-field ng is operative.<br>
      <br>
      The ammonia is absorbed at surface y' and is then pumped into
      beaker 31 by liquid pump 53a. Heat is emitted at the higher
      temperature T1 and absorbed at the lower temperature T2. The
      process is assumed to be reversible, and so the work sacrificed is
      the same as the value given by Carnot, Lc , i.e. the difference
      between work demanded by 53a and work delivered by 52a, plus work
      demanded by compressor 41. The said difference is almost exactly
      equal to the work required (we will call it LA) to pump the amount
      of ammonia in question (substance A) in fluid state, from surface
      y' to the bottom of beaker 31. It is exactly equal to LA - Delta'L
      where Delta'L is a correction term dependent upon a certain
      shrinkage of volume which takes place when the fluid ammonia mixes
      with the fluid salt solution. The mean concentration of the latter
      may be called C' . We now stop the circulation in heat exchanger
      35 and diffusion begins. The salt concentration of mean value C'
      now increases at the bottom of beaker<br>
      31 to z", decreases at the zip, and of course also increases to C"
      at the bottom of vessel 30 through pump 52a. Suppose now that one
      keeps pressure p' unaltered.<br>
      <br>
      Then the difference between work supplied to pump 53a and work
      delivered by pump 52a also remains virtually unchanged at LA
      since, the force-field being constant uniform, the hydraulic
      pressure at the bottom of beaker 31 is independent of diffusion.
      In other words (as is self evident) a salt molecule weight the
      same whether it is at the top or the bottom of the beaker or, the
      weight of liquid in the beaker is not dependent on the
      distribution of salt in it. The exact value of the difference
      between work, demanded and supplied by the two pumps is LA - Delta
      "L". The correction term Delta "L is somewhat larger than the
      previous term Delta'L, since C" is larger than C'. The work
      required from the pumps is now a little less than before, so it is
      fair to take it as constant. This allows us to disregard the pumps
      53a and 52a altogether in the argument which follows.<br>
      <br>
      Now if the gas pressure p' is to remain unaltered as suggested, in
      spite of increased salt concentration at the bottom of beaker 31
      caused by diffusion, the temperature T1 must be raised, say to phi
      T1 where phi &gt; 1.<br>
      <br>
      But if T2 is held constant at, say, ambient temperature, the gas
      pressure p" will rise because of the decreased salt concentration
      in the upper part of beaker 31 similarly caused by diffusion. As
      p" rises, px also rises and it follows that, since p' remains
      unaltered, the compressor 41 demands less work. Before diffusion
      began the work demanded by the process was that given by Carnot,
      Lc . Now the demand is less than Lc, and this in spite of an
      increase in temperature T1 to phi T1.<br>
      <br>
      This clearly shows the process to be second-order perpetual
      motion. If it does not to lead to a practical useful perpetual
      motion machine there must be present, according to Clausius, a
      destructive process of sufficient intensity. One such is that the
      diffusion resistance in a liquid is so great that in all
      probability no difference between T1 and T2 will be discernible,
      in which case our experiment becomes merely imaginary. But not let
      T1 and T2 equal. On the basis of our imaginary experiment and the
      argument presented with fig. 7 it is now seen that the compressor
      or machine 41 will deliver a quantity of work.<br>
      <br>
      It should be added that the temperature T1 at the bottom of vessel
      30 ought strictly speaking to be given T1 + Delta T on the left
      side and T1 - Delta T on the right side of the vessel, where Delta
      T is a very small correction depending on the fact that salt
      concentration is a little higher on the left than on the right.
      During absorption the salt concentration decreases from left to
      right, since it was assumed that liquid was flowing out of the
      lower end of channel 52. This variation, however, was of no
      concern in the theoretical argument accompanying fig. 8.<br>
      <br>
      In figs. 7 and 8 it was noted that the molecular weight of the
      dissolved substance B ( one, or a couple of salts ) was
      considerably greater than that of the solvent A, ammonia. The salt
      B therefore diffuses downwards in the beaker 31 under the action
      of force-field ng and then comes to rest, so that the salt
      concentration at the bottom of the beaker remains gleaner than at
      the surface y" of the liquid, while at the same time ammonia
      diffuses upwards against the force-field ng and evaporates at the
      said surface. This is clearly what occurs - the cycle having its
      causes in simple and well-known natural phenomena.<br>
      <br>
      But suppose that the soluble substance B arranged in place of the
      salts has a considerably lower molecular weight than the solvent,
      substance A. The concentration B will not be greater at the
      surface y" than at the bottom of beaker 31. So it is probable that
      the process will work in the opposite direction with A evaporating
      below at surface y" and condensing or being absorbed at surface y"
      at a higher temperature, and therefor diffusing down in the
      direction of force-field ng through substance B in beaker 31.<br>
      <br>
      Considering the similarity between the process illustrated in fig.
      6 and those illustrated Figs. 7 and 8, it is probable that a
      perpetual motion process could be achieved in accordance with the
      first-named fig. 6. In figs. 10, 11, 12 and 13, which are closely
      related to fig. 6, diffusion of A through B occurs in the
      direction of the force-field, although ( as mentioned ) it might
      be convenient to reverse the direction. One has only to select the
      substances A and B according to requirements.<br>
      <br>
      A process according to fig. 7 could be combined with one according
      to fig. 6. Suppose for example that the liquid in fig. 7 is
      ammonia and a salt, and that in chamber 30a there is a light inert
      gas such as a mixture of nitrogen and hydrogen. Suppose also that
      the wall 40 and compressor 41 are taken away. Judging from
      previous considerations, it is probable that the process now
      induced in the liquid in beaker 31 will abet the process induced
      in the gas mixture in chamber 30a.<br>
      <br>
      It is well known that a gas diffuses through another gas ( as in
      fig. 6, it is closely related other figs. and also figs. 1 - 5 )
      with vastly less resistance than a liquid or salt through another
      liquid ( as in figs. 7 and 8 ). For this reason a perpetual motion
      process employing diffusion between gases must be considered to be
      technically highly viable.<br>
      <br>
      The theoretical arguments put forward in connection with figs. 7
      and 8 appear to be incontrovertible, at least when diffusion of A
      occurs in the opposite direction to force-field ng. This cannot be
      said, however, for the realization illustrated by fig. 9, probably
      because here the diffusion of substance A through substance B
      occurs in the same direction as the force-field, and in this case
      I am not sufficiently familiar with the physical phenomena
      involved. Nevertheless, the figure shall be described. It shows an
      hermetically sealed vessel 49.<br>
      <br>
      In this vessel is a pillar 5O of e.g. porous active coal, suitably
      encased in a gas-tight envelope or skin 50' which, however, does
      not reach all the way to the base of the pillar, nor cover its top
      surface. Volume 51 in vessel 49 contains (for example) gaseous
      ammonia.<br>
      <br>
      As is well known, ammonia is forcefully absorbed by active coal.
      Absorption increases as the temperature falls, which means there
      are more ammonia molecules crowded onto a unit surface of coal at
      a lower temperature than at a higher. The whole is subject to
      force-field ng. Assume first that n - 1, that is to say the force
      field is equal to the earths gravity. Temperature throughout is
      equal to the ambient temperature T0. The specific weight per unit
      volume of ammonia within the coal pillar is significantly greater
      than that of the gas in chamber 51. The ammonia in the coal pillar
      may be considered as a liquid. When factor n is increased
      significantly over the value of 1, we may suppose that the
      concentrated ( or perhaps liquid ) ammonia in the coal pillar
      travels downwards. Thus equilibrium is disturbed In the force
      field. There is reason to believe that evaporation occurs at the
      bottom part of the pillar accompanied by a fall in temperature can
      be expected at the pillars upper surface, such a phenomenon has
      not been observable, however, in spite of a value for n or over
      2000. Undoubtedly the ammonia molecules are too strongly bound to
      the coal. It is quite conceivable that ultra sound could act as a
      lubricant between the ammonia molecules and the coal pillar, but
      this experiment has not yet been performed, It might be an
      advantage to replace the coal with fine fibers such as glass, for
      example, since the ammonia molecules would then travel over
      smooth, surfaces instead of in the mass surfaces of coal. In the
      event that this phenomenon could be induced using combinations of
      substances other than those named, it is strikingly similar to the
      phenomena described in connection with figs. 6, 7 and 3. The
      points u" and u' mentioned previously coincide respectively with
      the upper and lower ends of the coal pillar. As well as gas A,
      chamber 51 may contain heavy gas of lesser density than liquid A.<br>
      <br>
      Return now to fig. 6. The specific weight of the inert gas in the
      lower part of chamber 25, i. e. in the vicinity of tile 23, is
      greater than that of the liquid.<br>
      <br>
      There is thus a risk that liquid can gather in a layer at some
      level between the ceiling 21a and the tile or floor 23. One could
      then arrange, as fig. 10 shows, a porous rod 62 whose upper tip
      62a extends into a tiny chamber 63 which occupies a very small
      part of chamber 25.<br>
      <br>
      This part 63 is thermally isolated from the remaining larger
      portion of chamber 25 by a screen 64. A small quantity of heat may
      be supplied electrically to the tip 62a of rod 62, by which means
      the liquid in the said layer 15 taken up in the rod and eventually
      evaporates off, the vapor then being carried by the force-field ng
      towards the floor 23 where it condenses. It is simpler, however,
      to do as shown in principle in fig. 11. The interior 25 of vessel
      21 contains (for example) propane, sulphur, hexafluoride and
      xenon. The pressure of the inert gas mixture is great enough -
      something up to 100 atm. at room temperature -- that a thin layer
      55 of propane is always at the ceiling of chamber 25. Under the
      influence of force-field ng propane evaporates from this layer at
      a certain partial pressure, p and temperature T2. Propane vapor
      condenses at the floor of chamber 2 at a certain pressure P1 and
      temperature T1.<br>
      <br>
      When a drop has formed on the floor and grown large enough for its
      buoyancy to overcome adhesion, it floats up and joins the liquid
      layer 55. To facilitate heat transfer from condensing vapor to the
      floor, the latter may be provided with a large number of small
      studs 56 of a heat conducting material. They are shown as being
      pointed upwards, in which case the drops will be fairly small. If
      the drops are to become larger before detaching themselves, the
      studs must be made blunt or given other appropriate configuration.
      Of course the ceiling may be similarly studded to facilitate heat
      transfer to the liquid layer 55.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 12 shows a porous tile 57 of e.g. porcelain covering the
      bottom of the vessel 21. Standing out of this tile 57 is a porous
      pillar 58 of porcelain or other material having low thermal
      conductivity. A layer of fluid propane at the ceiling of the
      chamber 25 is marked 55 as in fig. 11. Fluid propane travels out
      of tile 57, where plane vapor has condensed, through pillar 58 up
      to the ceiling where it rejoins the layer of liquid 55. The
      movement occurs because the liquid is lighter than the gas.<br>
      <br>
      In figs. 11 and 12 temperature T1 is higher than T2 since pressure
      p1 is greater than p2. Heat thus passes of itself from a lower to
      a higher temperature, as long as the force-field ng is operative.
      We have not yet touched on the destructive entropy-increasing
      process which, if Clausius' theory is generally applicable, must
      reveal itself if the processes illustrated in figs. 6, 10, 11 and
      12 are not to be second-order perpetual motion. Suppose that a
      symptom of such destructive process is that the pressure and there
      with the specific weight of the inert gas (eg. SF6 and X ) may not
      be great enough to float the fluid propane all the way up to the
      ceiling of chamber 25 by itself. The liquid must then be pumped up
      the last part of the way by pump 70, shown schematically in fig.
      13. Pump 70 is thus both suction and pressure pump. The liquid,
      now somewhat heavier than the gas in the upper part of chamber 25,
      flows out of the pipe 71 into the trough 72, of which many such
      can be placed at this level. From trough 72 the liquid evaporates
      at the lower temperature T2. The vapor diffuses downwards and
      condenses on the porous tile 57 at the higher temperature T1. It
      is possible that this destructive process could be intense enough
      to make Clausius' theory valid in this case also. But it cannot be
      so intense, that significantly improved efficiency over an
      ordinary compressor refrigerator cannot be won. Because
      condensation at the floor takes place in a higher partial pressure
      of the gas mixture than evaporation at the ceiling, less heat is
      emitted at the higher temperature T1 in the course of the
      thermodynamic cycle - it having been stated that heat released by
      condensation diminishes under increased pressure of an inert gas.
      This carries the inescapable conclusion, according to the first
      law, that to keep the process in function now requires less work.<br>
      <br>
      It may be interesting to note that the inert gas or gas mixture,
      substance B, behaves as a semi-permeable body which, transports
      substance A when that is a vapor or gas but not when it is a
      liquid ( figs. 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12 and 13).<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with previous observations, liquid of A ( e.g . NH3,
      H2O ) have higher specific weight than gas of B (e.g. SF , X ) but
      lower molecular weight.<br>
      <br>
      Diffusion will then occur in the opposite direction to force-field
      ng. In fig. 11 for example, the liquid 55 would lie at the floor
      instead of the ceiling in vessel 21. Substances A and B are chosen
      to suit requirements. In the following figs. 14 and 15, A and B
      are assumed to be so chosen that diffusion occurs in the direction
      of the force-field.<br>
      <br>
      Fig. 14 shows, in principle, a practical realization of the
      invention. Several containers 21-1, 21-2 &amp;c are grouped
      together so that the floor of one is the ceiling of the next. The
      force-field ng is produced by rotation as before. The geometric
      axis of the axis of rotation is marked C-C. Each container
      encloses a circular chamber 25 , 25 &amp;c Whose geometric axis is
      the same as the above. The chambers contain propane and inert gas.
      The force-field ng is proportional to the mean radius of each
      chamber and thus the temperature difference between floor and
      ceiling, if all the chambers are the same height, will be least in
      chamber 251 and greatest in the chamber on the periphery. 25 in
      the drawing. The temperature differences are additive. Heat is
      supplied to a low temperature T2 by means of the liquid flowing
      through channel R2, and drawn off from the higher temperature T1
      through channel R. The channels are shown only by dotted lines.
      The inflow and outflow ends of these channels lie in the immediate
      proximity of the axis of rotation C-C. To avoid unnecessary energy
      losses the whole rotates in a high-vacuum chamber, whose housing
      has not bean illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      In fig. 15 the axis of rotation. is marked C-C as before. Only
      three chambers are shown, 25-1 - 25-3, though of course the number
      may be greater. The geometric axis of each chamber coincides with
      said axis C-C. The material of the wall 81 enclosing each chamber
      is suitably steel of the highest possible tensile strength.<br>
      <br>
      Parts 81a to left and right of the drawing are suitably joined to
      the rest of walls 81 by a seam weld 82 (fig. 16).<br>
      <br>
      The inner wall 81 of chamber 25-1, i.e. that nearest to axis C-C,
      rests on or is shrunk onto an axle 83. The inner wall of 25-2 lies
      against the outer wall of 25-1 etc. To the left and right in each
      such chamber is a plug 84 of glass, porcelain or other material of
      low thermal conductivity. Each such plug may be divided in sectors
      to prevent random breakage and destruction (not shown in the
      drawings). The axle 83 is fitted at its ends 83a and 83b in a
      static housing 85. This consists of a part on the right with a
      similar part on the left, 85b and 85a, and a central part 85c
      which is hermetically sealed to the said two parts by soldered
      seams 86a and 86b. The whole housing is thus hermetically sealed.
      It communicates with the surroundings only by removal of a screw
      87. The extremities of the housing to left and right are marked
      85a' and 85b'. The axle 83 contains a circular chamber 83c whose
      geometric axis coincides with axis C-C. The diameter of this
      chamber increases from the center outwards towards the ends of the
      axle, giving conical inner surfaces to a part to the left and a
      part to the right in this chamber. The chamber communicates with
      its surroundings only by removal of screw 88. The chamber contains
      a small quantity of a liquid and its vapor, which can be ammonia,
      propane or any other suitable substance.<br>
      <br>
      That wall 81 having the greatest diameter rests in a cylinder 89.
      The wall of this cylinder is thicker and stronger than said wall
      81. The ends of axle 83 have a very slightly smaller diameter than
      the inner diameter of the ends 85a' and 85b' of housing 85. 7The
      gaps 90 are this very narrow, preferably only a fraction of a
      millimeter. Similarly the gap between housing 85c and cylinder 89
      is very small. The volume between the static housing and the body
      composed of components 83, 81 and 89 rotating about axis C-C, is
      suitably filled with hydrogen. The pressure of this gas is low but
      not so low that its thermal conductivity is markedly less than at
      atmospheric pressure. A fraction of a torr is the right order of
      magnitude. The chambers 251, 252 &amp;c, contain the same
      substances A and B as previously named in connection with figs. 6,
      10, 11, 12 and 13.<br>
      <br>
      Substance A can then appropriately be propane and substance B a
      mixture of xenon and sulfur hexafluoride at the stated pressure.
      These substances are pumped into each chamber through, a short
      channel 82' (fig. 16) which is afterwards closed by welding or
      soldering. A pillar 58 and pump 70 such as shown in fig. 13 may be
      used here but is not shown since it is similar. assume, new, for
      the sake of clarity that the thermodynamic process taking place in
      a machine such as that in fig. 15, is a complete second-order
      perpetual motion. Reinforced by the previous arguments, and
      knowing that the general applicability of Clausius' theory has not
      been proved, this assumption, which is in the interests of
      simplifying the description to follow, may be made.<br>
      <br>
      The axle 83 and its constituent bodies 31, 84 and 89 may be set in
      rotation by the same mean as the rotor&nbsp; in an ordinary
      three-phase induction motor. The stator is fixed round part 85a"
      or 85b", In every chamber 25-1 25-2 &amp;c. vapor of substance A (
      e.g. propane ) condenses on the floor, that is to say the surface
      in the chamber furthest from the axis of rotation C-C, while
      liquid of the same substance evaporates from the ceiling of the
      chamber, or the surface nearest the axis of rotation. If the
      centrifugal force in the outer chamber (253 in fig. 15) is in the
      region of 10^5 g and the distance between floor and ceiling is 1
      cm, there can be a temperature difference between them of 5 to 10
      C. This value is dependent upon the mean temperature in the
      chamber. If it is too little, another substance other than propane
      may be chosen for that particular chamber. Since the mean
      temperature is higher in the outer chambers it will often be
      advisable to have different substances A in the different
      chambers.<br>
      <br>
      A quantity of heat, e.g. Q/2, enters through each part 85a' and
      85b', passes easily through the hydrogen in gaps 90 and makes its
      way in through both ends of the axle 83. here it causes the liquid
      of an appropriate substance e.g. ammonia, to boil. The ammonia
      condenses on the central parts or the wall of chambers 83c,
      wherewith heat at, say, temperature T2, is transferred to the
      ceiling of the innermost chamber 25-1. Ammonia - the condensate -
      flows back under the action of centrifugal force to the two ends
      of chamber 83c. These could be appropriately joined by a channel,
      preferably straight and so formed that no more condensate could
      accumulate in one end of chamber 83c than in the other. ( Such a
      channel is not shown in the drawing ). The quanta of heat 2x
      Q/2.., i.e. Q, passes from cylinder 89 through gap 91 to the
      housing 85c, and on to where it will be used. The incoming heat
      has a lower temperature than the outgoing.<br>
      <br>
      Heat conduction from floor to ceiling within each. chamber (251,
      252 &amp;c.) is retarded by the presence of bodies 84, whose low
      thermal conductivity requires the heat to travel tie long way
      round through, the metal parts 81a.<br>
      <br>
      Suppose that work must be sacrificed to pump liquid A from floor
      to ceiling in each of the chambers 25. Such a device can be
      constructed with known means in several ways, all simple, for
      which reason none are shown in the drawing. It should be added
      that if work is required it must be introduced into chambers 25 in
      such a way that they remain hermetically sealed. This could be
      done electrically, magnetically or with the aid of an elastically
      resilient membrane. As previously shown, if such work must be
      sacrificed, the machine at the very best will only show an
      incomplete second-order perpetual notion contrary to Clausius'
      theory, otherwise it will constitute a refrigeration plant or heat
      pump of greater efficiency than any such known, but not in
      contravention with the theory.<br>
      <br>
      It may be mentioned that there is advantage to be gained in
      choosing substance A so that its critical temperature is not too
      much greater than the temperature in which it will be used, but is
      of a technically optimum value above the latter. In this way total
      pressure in the chambers 25 will be minimized, whereby the
      temperature difference between floor and ceiling will be
      maximized.<br>
      <br>
      When substance B is an inert gas such as SF6 and X, it is very
      slightly soluble in the liquid substance A, and to a small, extent
      will share in A 's cycle, oscillating between two states of
      matter, but in the main, the state of matter of substance B is
      constant.<br>
      <br>
      The temperature difference won by the process can of course be
      used to drive a steam engine which delivers work. If the process
      takes place at a very low temperature, say -100 C or lower, and
      work is delivered at that mean temperature, heat passes to it from
      the ambient temperature T0. This transfer of heat can take place
      via another steam engine which will thus also deliver work.<br>
      <br>
      Finally it must be said that as a matter of course losses occur in
      the system, such as through vibration in the centrifuge and
      friction in its bearings. There are also conduction losses in the
      material. These, and perhaps others could be (as suggested) so
      great that the second law of thermodynamics still stands, in spite
      of the invention being theoretically correct. The technical
      usefulness of the invention will then lie only in the increased
      efficiency it can bring to an ordinary refrigerator, heat pump or
      thermal power machine. Nevertheless the invention is highly
      significant.<br>
