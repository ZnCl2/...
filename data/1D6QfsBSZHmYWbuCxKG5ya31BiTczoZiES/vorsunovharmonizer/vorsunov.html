      SUPER-INNOVATION PROJECT FOR ENSURING ROBUST HEALTH AND ACTIVE
      LONGEVITY FOR MOST OF THE POPULATION.<br>
      <br>
      WHAT IS BAF: BAF is fundamentally new, real, highly effective,
      easy-to-use, inexpensive, accessible to everyone, many options for
      practical implementation, <br>
      technique for maintaining good physiological and mental health,
      ensuring a long and harmonious Life in many of its manifestations.
      In many ways, the effectiveness of BAF already exceeds all
      existing methods of maintaining health and a harmonious life and
      has no counterparts.&nbsp; The mechanism of action is simple and
      easily understood by people who are open to innovations; the
      closed minded can stop reading here and end their acquaintance
      with BAF. All your objections are already known, but you have a
      right to your opinion. Sorry, but please remember that the
      processes of perceiving the world and evolution are continuous,
      and that is why many things that seemed unreal or fantastic
      yesterday, that have broken known laws and have been persecuted
      have become a reality today. A classic example is the development
      of the laser, described by the Russian science fiction writer A.
      Belyaev. It is also pertinent to remember that there was a time
      when the sun was believed to revolve around the earth, and the
      Inquisition burned those who refuted it at the stake.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In our time Pope John Paul II apologized for these deeds.&nbsp;
      Great Honor and praise to him and Eternal Memory!<br>
      <br>
      Today BAF is an objective reality, i.e., a reality that does not
      depend on subjective Human opinion, EASILY confirmable by
      practical experience, bearing great benefit for people and needing
      large-scale implementation.<br>
      <br>
      <b>1. PURPOSE AND MECHANISM OF ACTION OF BAF ON THE ORGANISM.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Biologically active films have been developed to harmonize all
      processes that make up Life itself, as a whole and in part, to
      ensure good physiological and mental health and active longevity.
      (One of the ideas used in creating BAF has been patented by G.V.
      Vorsunov in Germany). <br>
      <br>
      In essence, BAF are a source of a biologically active field that
      arises and propagates in space when BAF are transmitted on any
      screen (movie theater, television, computer, cell phone screens
      and so on) and carry a message of harmony, love, beauty and
      renewal with a specific formulation of the task to be accomplished
      using the fields of a specific film. (For example, to harmonize
      the condition of the heart or liver, etc.). A BAF field acts on
      the biological field of a live organism (the existence of fields
      in biosystems was discovered in 1940) and shifts it from a
      disharmonious state corresponding to a sick organism to a
      harmonious one corresponding to a healthy organism, and just like
      a thread in a needle follows the needle, so the organism changes
      its state from sick to healthy, tracking the change of state of
      its own biological field.<br>
      <br>
      This mechanism of action of fields generated by BAF on live
      organisms agrees well with the results of wave genetics
      experiments of Dr. Peter Garjaev (Assistant Science Director of
      the University of Toronto, Canada) and with many other experiments
      of well-known scientists. For example, the experiments of Dr. K.G.
      Korotkov, D. Eng., St. Petersburg State Technical University,
      Russia, studying the effect of human consciousness on the
      structure of water have shown that water changes its structure
      under the influence of the consciousness of a person up to 8000 km
      away from the water samples.<br>
      &nbsp; <br>
      Experiments of Professor M. Emoto of Japan studying the effect on
      information on the state of water prove that water changes its
      structure under the influence of information proportional to its
      content. Since the human organism consists mainly of water,
      Professor Emoto worked out an ingeniously simple scheme describing
      the principle of the effect of information on live
      organisms.&nbsp; It looks this this: information acts on water
      contained in an organism.<br>
      <br>
      Then, under the influence of the information, the water changes
      its structure proportional to the content of the information and
      as a natural consequence of this, changes its state and the entire
      organism. (You can find out about the work of the above-mentioned
      scientists by entering their last names and initials in any
      Internet search engine).<br>
      <br>
      All of the foregoing shows that there is nothing supernatural or
      miraculous about the fact that BAF can be created and used to
      effectively influence the state of health and maintain it at a
      good level.&nbsp; On the contrary, it’s all amazingly simple. The
      most important and difficult task in the process of creating BAF
      is to give the BAF fields effective power sufficient to reliably
      shift the organism of MOST !!! users from a disharmonious state
      (sickness) to a harmonious state (health) for the widest possible
      range of problems. Vorsunov’s BAF are up to this task, but there
      is no limit to perfection and work on improving the effectiveness
      of BAF has been going on continuously for many years.&nbsp;
      Therefore, Vorsunov’s BAF made only a year or two ago are less
      effective that those made in 2010.&nbsp; And naturally, over time,
      even more effective BAF versions than those available today will
      appear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>2. MOST IMPORTANT RESULTS OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF G.V.
        VORSUNOV’S BAF. </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      (The numbers of the films employed by the user are shown in
      brackets).<br>
      <br>
      Practical use of Vorsunov’s BAF began in 2000, and since then
      hundreds of BAF versions have been created, the range of problems
      they are aimed at solving has expanded, their effectiveness has
      been constantly improving and practical experience has been
      accumulated.&nbsp; Volunteers living in Russia, Israel, China and
      other countries are BAF users. Almost 100% of BAF users are people
      who have or have had difficult chronic or acute health problems
      and who have not been helped by any kind of medicine. <br>
      <br>
      Practice has shown that BAF are amazingly effective at helping
      children in many ways and people of all age groups with diverse
      cardiovascular problems, including rehabilitation after heart
      attacks. Nearly 100% of BAF users were able to fully or partially
      rid themselves of cardiovascular problems (BAF2+5+21+1). One user
      no longer needed a pacemaker (a woman over 70 who had already
      survived two heart attacks in a row). This is a very important
      case, because it gives hope that some people who need a pacemaker
      today will no longer need one after using BAF. It is also very
      possible that BAF will help some patients avoid the need for a
      heart transplant. The overall effectiveness of BAF in solving
      heart problems is so high that we can predict that large-scale
      implementation of BAF for this purpose, starting with ambulances
      and intensive care units and ending with use at home and at work,
      will free the heart from its sad legacy as the number one killer.
      At the same time, of course, users completely stop or greatly
      reduce their intake of the medications they have been taking
      regularly for many years and which in themselves are harmful to
      the organism, are expensive and generally do not make a person
      feel completely healthy. For most users, BAF resolve heart
      problems within 3-12 months. <br>
      <br>
      In one Siberian city in 2009, the lives of 5 children suffering
      from stage 4 cancers were saved when the children already had no
      chance of survival. This very important result allows us to
      predict with a high degree of probability that if BAF are used to
      provide the required help for children with complex forms of
      cancer, i.e., are distributed everywhere, starting with intensive
      care units in clinics and ending at home, 60-70% of the children
      who die today could be saved. (According to statistics, at
      present, 20% of children with cancer die). In the next few years,
      the effectiveness of BAF in this area is expected to increase to
      the level where the death of children from cancers will be a rare
      occurrence. <br>
      <br>
      (This objective is quite realistic and not in the realm of
      fantasy. The deciding factor in accomplishing it is the
      availability of sufficient cash resources).<br>
      <br>
      There are obvious positive effects for adults suffering from
      cancer, including cases of recovery of hopelessly ill patients,
      but the overall effectiveness of using BAF on adults is less than
      for children. The most likely cause of this phenomenon, but not
      the only one, is the difference in blood composition between
      adults and children. Very good results have been achieved from
      small-scale application of BAF in rehabilitating patients after
      strokes in intensive care units (BAF No.1+5+11+5). In 70% of
      patients using BAF, the process of regaining speech, digestive
      functions and mobility was considerably faster than under the
      standard action of drugs only.&nbsp; In the same place, the use of
      BAF restored kidney function after acute renal failure
      (BAFNo.4+5+11+20) in situations where standard methods produced no
      results and the patient was doomed to death. <br>
      <br>
      This experience shows that the implementation of BAF in
      resuscitation practice will help shorten rehabilitation periods
      after strokes and rehabilitation value (and costs, of course),
      reduce the number of fatalities from acute renal and heart
      failure, and in many other situations. Moreover, there is no doubt
      that the use of BAF will eliminate the demand for kidney
      transplants for many people in need of them today. Given the
      existing positive experience in individual areas, we are fully
      justified in predicting that the use of Vorsunov’s BAF will also
      be highly effective in many other areas of operation of intensive
      care units. Incidentally, it was noted long ago that in most
      cases, the worse a patient’s condition, the more effective the
      application of BAF. <br>
      <br>
      Still another pattern: the older the BAF user and the more
      problems in the organism, the more slowly the processes of
      harmonization of the organism proceed. But the important thing is
      that they proceed. In 2010, 3 months after starting the
      application of BAF one user (BAFNo.2+7+5) had almost no need for
      her heart medications; the outstanding feature of this case is
      that the user was 84 years old and did not remember exactly how
      many decades she had been taking daily medication for heart
      conditions. A leg ulcer that had troubled this user for many years
      also cleared up. BAF are very effective in eliminating chronic
      headaches (BAFNo.1+5+11) and weather dependence and improving the
      health of diabetics (BAFNo.6+16+21) (dizziness almost completely
      disappeared or was reduced, and feeling in the legs was restored).
      In those who followed a diet for 6-8 months and used BAF, the need
      to take medication disappeared and the illness receded. <br>
      <br>
      One user aged 91 recognized her son who had come to visit her,
      although for 2 years before this meeting she had not recognized
      him and could not remember him&nbsp; (BAFNo.1+2+21). Restoring
      memory, improving the psychoemotional state and overall health and
      increasing the ability to work in elderly people using BAF are
      unique effects of BAF (BAFNo.1+5+12). Therefore, there is a high
      probability that many incurable illnesses associated with brain
      dysfunction may become curable with the help of BAF, including
      age-related memory loss, multiple sclerosis, etc. This experience
      allows BAF to be marketed as an absolutely safe means of extending
      active longevity and renewing the organism. Another important
      example is a woman who had been using BAF for 2.5 years when she
      was detained at border control in Domodedovo International Airport
      because “Your appearance doesn’t match your passport photo”
      (BAFNo.21+6). The passport photo had been taken 5 years before,
      and the user looked much younger, appearing to be 45-47 years old,
      when her actual age was 62. She had not had plastic surgery. Most
      BAF users start looking younger (the speed and degree of
      rejuvenation are different for everyone), and the process can be
      recorded by means of photos taken by one or another method.
      Friends and acquaintances who have not seen the user for 6 months
      or more also notice the rejuvenation. One user aged 58, who had a
      problem with her hip joint, was visited by relatives who had not
      seen her for 10 years. When they saw her, they were amazed at how
      much younger she looked than 10 years before. <br>
      <br>
      Rejuvenation and improved condition very often happen suddenly;
      i.e., weeks or months pass without any major changes, and then
      there is a sharp improvement in the organism’s condition. For
      about 15-20% of users, the organism’s condition at first is
      sometimes better and sometimes worse, with a gradual reduction of
      changes for the worse. This usually happens if there are many
      anomalies in the organism or they are very complex.<br>
      <br>
      Rehabilitation after strokes that occurred many years before the
      start of BAF use is very slow. <br>
      <br>
      There are 2 cases of two clearly positive effects of using BAF in
      treating patients with hepatitis C. (Both were outside Russia)
      (BAFNo.3+15+21). Very slowly, 6-12 months or more after starting
      to use BAF, the condition of the joints and spine improve
      (BAFNo.7+20+13). There are several cases of improvement in the
      condition of hip joints, where no other methods of modern medicine
      helped and the users were recommended to walk with crutches in the
      short term and then get a hip replacement.<br>
      <br>
      One user (BAFNo.6+4+21) passed a kidney stone 4.5 mm in diameter
      without blood or pain. Ten years before this, he had had major
      surgery to remove the same sized stone.<br>
      <br>
      At present, the use of BAF cannot solve all the problems of
      everyone in need (but can solve most problems of most people) and
      is not a magic wand, although the effectiveness of BAF quite often
      resembles one. However, even today, based on available practical
      experience, we can state that if you take a certain hypothetical
      integral indicator that includes comfort and ease of use,
      effectiveness, cost and negative side effects to compare the
      effectiveness of medical methods with the effectiveness of BAF and
      compare these indicators with one another, BAF will be far
      superior in many areas of application. This is especially true
      when dealing with problems of the heart (BAFNo.2), brain
      (BAFNo.1), kidneys (BAFNo.4), liver (BAFNo.3), juvenile cancer
      (BAFNo.8+5+11+22), certain kinds of viral infections
      (BAFNo.14+3+16), post-trauma rehabilitation, major surgery and
      burns (BAFNo.19+4+5). It is especially worth noting that it is
      impossible in principle for BAF fields to cause damage to the
      organism. Whereas nearly all medications have harmful side
      effects; suffice it to recall that cancer patients quite often die
      not from the disease itself, but from the inability of their
      organisms to cope with the chemical preparations, and this applies
      to both children and adults. In many difficult situations
      (although not in all), BAF are actually the only possibility for
      saving life and preserving good health. In combination with good
      medical care, large-scale application of BAF will quickly achieve
      a dramatic improvement in the health of the population,
      substantially reduce (by tens or hundreds of times) the number of
      fatalities from heart and other problems, extend active longevity
      and considerably reduce health care costs by reducing the
      following by many times: incidence of disease, consumption of
      medications, use of complex, expensive equipment, number of
      complicated, expensive operations, demand for donor organs, etc.
      It is worth noting that there are quite a few cases where a person
      dies while waiting for a donor organ, and the use of BAF will
      reduce the number of these situations and eliminate them
      altogether within several years.&nbsp; Many users note that they
      rarely become ill during epidemics.<br>
      <br>
      Another important advantage of BAF is that there are no language
      barriers. People of various nationalities speaking different
      languages react equally well to them. (The versions of Vorsunov’s
      BAF existing today contain no audio information whatsoever). <br>
      <br>
      An organism’s reactions to the fields generated by BAF, along with
      diagnostic methods used in medicine, are absolutely clearly
      registered using K.G. Korotkov’s gas discharge visualization
      cameras (GDV cameras). Measurements of the area of the energy
      field before and after the action of a BAF field are clearly
      different from one another. This kind of camera is manufactured in
      Russia and Germany. <br>
      <br>
      Fields generated by BAF are reliably detected by the geophysical
      anomaly measuring device (IGA-1) invented by Russian engineer Yu.
      P. Kravchenko ( http://www.iga1.ru/pribor.html ).<br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img src="iga1pkrvchenko.jpg" alt="kravchenko"
          width="200" height="164"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Needless to say, the cardiograms of people with heart problems
      improve simultaneously with the improvement in their health. <br>
      <br>
      One user’s doctor, on examining an image of her injured hand, was
      amazed at the condition of her bones, since she had absolutely no
      age-related changes, although she was 58 years old at the time
      (BAF1+2+21).This same user no longer had constant acute precordial
      pain, which appeared after two microinfarcts and which had not
      responded to any medications or other treatments. <br>
      <br>
      Displaying BAF on TV and computer screens transforms the torsion
      fields emitted by these devices from left-handed fields harmful to
      the human organism into right-handed fields. That is, they perform
      the functions of A. R. Pavlenko’s (Dr. Sci., Professor, Ukraine)
      Forpost-1 devices patented in Ukraine and the United States, and
      have been approved in medical institutions in Russia and Ukraine
      as a means of environmental protection of live organisms from
      harmful radiation. These devices are sold in many countries.(
      http://www.spinor.kiev.ua ). According to Dr. Pavlenko’s data,
      many years (10-12) of observation have shown that the regular
      presence of a person in right-handed torsion fields is a powerful
      therapeutic medium. This is another property of BAF fields having
      a positive influence on live organisms. (The phenomenon of
      transformation of a monitor’s torsion radiation from left-handed
      to right-handed by BAF fields was discovered by the inventor of
      the IGA-1 device, Russian engineer Yu. P. Kravchenko.) <br>
      <br>
      Nothing in this account is an exaggeration; on the contrary, it
      reveals by no means all the capabilities of BAF.<br>
      <br>
      Most (but thankfully not 100%) of doctors and scientists consider
      the effectiveness of BAF to be purely psychological (placebo);
      therefore, it should be noted that no one told the children
      anything about what was acting on them, and all the patients in
      the intensive care unit were in a state of unconsciousness. Thus,
      to ascribe the effects of fields generated by BAF to a purely
      psychological influence is ABSOLUTELY wrong. However, the user’s
      trusting psychological make-up undoubtedly reinforces the
      effectiveness of the action of BAF, as with any other methods. We
      should especially note that the mechanisms of action of BAF fields
      on the organism and the psychological effect are very similar. For
      example, under the placebo effect and the influence of the
      information he gets from a doctor or another person, the patient’s
      consciousness is filled with trust in the information being
      provided (trusting psychological make-up) and generates a field
      targeted to him personally and carrying information that he will
      be healthy due to the effects he is being informed about. Like a
      BAF field, this field created by the patient’s own consciousness
      acts on his biofield and harmonizes its state; and this field, as
      in the case with BAF (recall the analogy of interaction of the
      field with the organism to a needle and thread) shifts the organs
      and systems of the organism from a disharmonious, diseased state
      to a harmonious, i.e., healthy state. The similarity of the
      mechanisms of action of psychological effects and BAF fields on
      the organism confirms once again that at the level of theory and
      practice there is nothing unusual, incomprehensible or unreal
      about the performance of BAF. According to the same scheme, people
      wanting to prove that BAF are ineffective can theoretically block
      the action of BAF fields. So far, this has not <br>
      happened in practice, but there was one hostile user, a doctor
      with a node on her thyroid gland, whose husband had persuaded her
      to try BAF. During the first session, she experienced a very
      perceptible choking sensation near the thyroid gland, and the fact
      that her organism reacted amazed and frightened her, because she
      was convinced this could not be happening and wanted to prove to
      her husband that this was nothing more than a fantasy.&nbsp; But
      she could not prove her case, because the BAF field was more
      powerful than the field generated by her consciousness. <br>
      <br>
      We note that among BAF users there are a number of scientists and
      doctors in various countries for whom medicine was no help in
      solving very serious problems (for some of them, these were
      matters of their life and death), but with the help of BAF, they
      were able to solve their problems and they have no prejudices or
      doubts about BAF. Of course, on first acquaintance with BAF, they
      had considerable mistrust and doubts, as with most scientists, and
      the medical profession in particular. The fear of misunderstanding
      and even condemnation from their colleagues compelled them to keep
      quiet about their trust in BAF. <br>
      <br>
      In addition to solving problems of purely physiological health,
      BAF can help solve problems of mental health and psychoemotional
      state, enhance intellectual potential as a whole and creative
      potential in particular (BAFNo.12). Schoolchildren using BAF
      improve their academic performance. The average knowledge rating
      value increased 50% or more after using BAF for four months. Among
      children with hidden talents, these talents are quickly revealed.
      Speed and quality of thinking increase and logic and intuition
      improve. The heart becomes kinder, the character calmer. The use
      of BAF No. 12 at all levels of education will help raise the
      intellectual capacities of the younger generation to such a high
      level that this will necessarily lead to a colossal improvement of
      society’s level of development in all areas (science, the arts,
      industry, etc.), which is impossible to fully appreciate at
      present.&nbsp; Obviously, not all users are transformed into
      geniuses and intellectuals, but their number will increase by many
      times, and there will be far fewer people of average intelligence
      with no creative gifts than at present. These prospects need no
      commentary.<br>
      <br>
      We are justified in predicting that good effects will result when
      BAF are used to help people, and especially children, with
      cerebral palsy and other complex disorders (BAFNo.1+5+22). <br>
      <br>
      There is a slight positive experience with delayed mental
      development and autism. During the first sessions with BAF, a
      state of hysteria and convulsions may occur in children and adults
      with these problems and BAF transmission must be stopped and
      resumed when the person has calmed down.&nbsp; During the final
      sessions, these occurrences become fewer and disappear altogether;
      the problems decrease slowly, but they recede. Experience so far
      is very limited (2 years with 2 children), but there is
      improvement, much faster in one child than in the other. The
      diagnosis of autism was withdrawn after 6-8 months and was
      replaced with “delayed mental development”. Before BAF, the
      parents had tried everything but received no help from medicine.
      For the sake of objectivity, let us add that children sometimes go
      through sessions with Vorsunov’s direct intervention. The
      children’s parents have initiated all of these actions, guided by
      the wish to give their children normal health and out of the
      hopeless situation with their health.<br>
      <br>
      Dogs and cats respond very well to BAF (BAFNo.24+21). Malignant
      growths occurring during the aging process are resorbed in them.
      The tumor often opens and an ugly, foul-smelling mass issues from
      it. (There have been similar cases among human cancer patients).
      Vision, hair, mobility and vital activity are restored, and life
      is extended for several more years in the natural state of their
      organism. (For those who consider the reactions of BAF users to be
      a purely psychological effect, we should remind them that the
      occurrence of psychological effects is intrinsic only to humans
      and is impossible in animals.) It is valid and not difficult to
      project the results of the action of BAF on animals to humans with
      the appropriate adjustments. And this allows us to make the very
      UNEXPECTED and very IMPORTANT conclusion that the struggle against
      old age and its characteristic infirmities, the elimination of
      cancer, life extension and active longevity are problems that in
      principle have already been SOLVED! All that remains is to
      implement BAF in practice at all levels from the home to clinics
      and hospitals. And of course, to improve and enhance their
      effectiveness, which Vorsunov has been doing continuously without
      interruption. If we make an estimate for the purposes of
      illustration (not entirely correct but acceptable to a first
      approximations) of the possible increase in a person’s life span
      from the effect of BAF using the increase in life span of a dog
      and assuming a human/dog life span ratio equal to 6-7, even today,
      the minimum extension of human life with the use of BAF could be
      from 12 to 20 years or more. Of course, this is only a rough
      approximation. But it is still cause for rejoicing. <br>
      <br>
      A change in life situations and life as whole in a more favorable
      direction for the user is also achieved with the use of BAF
      (BAFNo.22). However, crises also occur sometimes. For example, a
      user is suddenly dismissed from work. But several weeks pass and
      the user finds more interesting and higher paying&nbsp; work.
      There is also the case of the breakup of a family and the former
      spouses later find happy new families. To anyone not prepared for
      these crises, please don’t use this film. In essence, this film
      helps lighten the burden of Karma, which determines the course of
      life. In the Indian practice of Yoga, there is the discipline of
      Karma Yoga for solving this problem. Development of this film does
      not go against the postulates of Buddhism. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      There have been several cases where BAF (No.23) fields have
      neutralized aggressive intentions. These results need no
      commentary. BAF No.23 is most effective when used in the presence
      of a large number of people: a factory, transportation, etc. <br>
      <br>
      Thus, summarizing all of the above, we can confidently state that
      today there are no obstacles to the development of biologically
      active films and other technologies with a similar principle of
      action for large-scale use, making it possible to: <br>
      <br>
      1. Solve the overall problem of ensuring a consistently high level
      of mental and physiological health in an absolute majority of
      people. &nbsp;<br>
      2. Drastically reduce the number of fatalities in all age groups
      from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, infections and other
      diseases.<br>
      3. Maintain active longevity and drastically reduce the list of
      incurable diseases and healthcare costs.<br>
      4. Harmonize many Life processes.<br>
      <br>
      Or, to put it simply, large-scale practical application of BAF
      will actually make life happy for most people, because many ugly,
      negative events will simply disappear from Life. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      These last generalizations are not a mere declaration, but rather
      a conclusion following from an analysis of practical experience of
      using BAF.&nbsp; And as is well known, the sole criterion for
      evaluating the validity of any hypothesis or idea is the practical
      result. <br>
      <br>
      But an obstacle still exists. This is dogmatic thinking, often
      arrogant, which gives rise to the well-known principle of bare
      denial: “THIS CAN’T BE, BECAUSE IT CAN NEVER BE”. However, it is
      also well known that the more a person knows, the farther the
      boundaries of the unknown and incomprehensible expand, and the
      principles of dogmatism and the process of knowing are
      incompatible with one another.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b> 3. DESCRIPTION OF BAF IN TERMS OF VISUAL PERCEPTION. </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Visually, the films have the following appearance. A blazing fire,
      which gradually burns down and goes out, is visible in the center
      of the screen. On the right side of the screen is a plant with
      broad leaves characteristic of most deciduous plants. On the left
      is a plant with long, narrow leaves (palm). The leaves are
      stirring in a light breeze, with the palm leaves on the left
      moving more actively than the leaves of the plant on the right.
      The landscapes have 4 forms differing from one another in the
      location of the plants on the screen and the kind of palm on the
      left (2 kinds of palm were used for the shots).<br>
      <br>
      The movement of various faceted figures is easily seen in the
      background of this landscape. They range in color from light gray
      to black shades.&nbsp; When the films are transmitted, they split
      and converge with one another and move from the bonfire to the
      edge of the screen and back. The shifting gray-black images are
      not repeated fully from film to film. In some films, a frame
      periodically appears around the fire, first expanding, then
      contracting and moves towards the fire, disappearing into it. In
      the first instant after its appearance, the frame is outlined in
      black; then a light gray fringe appears inside it and then another
      dark fringe. The figures in each film have their own coloring
      (visible only on very close examination). The images arising in
      the space between the figures as they move across the screen are
      also individual. The character and rate of motion of the
      gray-black images are identical for all films. The brightness of
      the screen is uneven; the lower left hand part of the screen is
      brighter and a light blue highlight sometimes appears in this
      area. <br>
      <br>
      For 15-25 seconds at the start of each film, there are captions
      with the name of the film, the author’s last name, an important
      warning, and the film’s recording date.&nbsp; For users from other
      countries, the captions appear in English.<br>
      <br>
      A description of the principles of action of the film, brief
      information on the practical experience of their use and options
      and rules for use are attached to each BAF copy. <br>
      <br>
      <b>4.OPTIONS AND RULES OF BAF USE.</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      BAF are designed for use during meditative and other states,
      including unconsciousness. The fields generated by BAF act on the
      entire biofield of the organism, but the action in each film has a
      specific focus corresponding to the name of the BAF. If the user’s
      organism has a serious anomaly that does not correspond to the
      film’s specialization, the action will be directed towards
      eliminating this problem first of all. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      Since all people are very different from one another, their
      responses to the effect of BAF and the time required to solve
      problems are also very different.<br>
      <br>
      <b>4.1. IMPORTANT WARNINGS!!!</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      BAF are a fundamentally new, self-contained technology for
      maintaining good health.&nbsp; They are not related to medicine,
      they are not drugs in the classical sense, and are not related to
      physiotherapy methods; strictly speaking, they harmonize the state
      of the biological field of the user’s organism by means of the
      fields they generate, and this is all they do!!! In their
      principles of action they are similar (but not analogous) to
      Eastern schools of mind/body perfection, for example, Reiki
      (Japan), Qi Gong (China) and Yoga (India). Thus, no official
      permits are required to use BAF. Each person must decide
      independently whether or not to use them and independently control
      the process of using BAF, because, just as during practices of the
      Eastern schools, only the user can evaluate the organism’s
      reactions, and they are very different in different people. The
      exception is when the user is in an unconscious state or is a
      child. In the first case, relatives must make all the decisions.
      In the second case (with children), the child’s parents must make
      the decisions. Of course, in critical and complex situations, a
      doctor must monitor the state of the organism. A doctor must also
      regularly check the state of the BAF user’s organism. <br>
      <br>
      In 25-30% of cases, users with serious problems who are not taking
      medications to decrease nerve ending sensitivity may experience
      various strong, unpleasant sensations during the first sessions
      with BAF, including pain, nausea and vertigo. In this situation,
      transmission of the film must be stopped and resumed after all
      negative sensations are completely gone. These situations may
      occur during the first days, rarely weeks, but later the negative
      sensations will diminish from session to session and then cease
      altogether. Users with cerebral palsy, autism, delayed mental and
      intellectual development, and severe head injuries sometimes
      experience severe pain, convulsions and hysteria during the first
      sessions, which quickly pass. However, in these situations,
      transmission must be stopped and then resumed after the user calms
      down. Worsening of the condition is also possible after the end of
      a BAF session. These effects happen at the initial stage of use;
      they do not occur in the subsequent stage and pose no danger.<br>
      <br>
      For people with affective disorders, BAF must be used only in the
      presence of a psychiatrist. Aggravation of the condition requiring
      a doctor’s assistance is possible in such users.<br>
      <br>
      The action of BAF fields is blocked in case of unauthorized
      copying or making a profit. <br>
      <br>
      <b>4.2. Application of BAF</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Ideally, in order to obtain maximum effectiveness when using BAF,
      it is necessary to be as comfortable as possible, to relax, close
      your eyes and not think about anything. (A state similar to
      meditation). You need to resist the urge to sleep. In most users,
      various kinds of sensations occur in abnormal areas during the
      first sessions, including heat, cold, tingling, pain, heaviness,
      etc. Abnormal areas can be determined from the reactions in the
      organism; i.e., a diagnosis van be made. Healthy people and those
      who have taken strong medications do not have any reactions.&nbsp;
      (There are users with congenital low nerve ending sensitivity).
      These sensations will decrease from session to session. The
      minimum BAF transmission time in the initial stage is 2 hours a
      day, and the maximum is 24 hours. Overdosing on BAF fields, as in
      the case of medications and physical radiation, is impossible
      because the organism’s own biofield stops reacting to external
      fields after reaching a state of complete harmony, and when these
      fields are present near the organism, they have no effect
      whatsoever.<br>
      <br>
      The biofield in the organism of healthy people is in a harmonious
      state and also does not react to a BAF field. To prevent light
      from the screen from interfering with sleep, the screen can be
      covered with a thick cloth so as not to violate the operating
      rules of the monitor.<br>
      <br>
      The effect of BAF fields depends on the type and area of the
      screen. The best screen for transmitting BAF is LCD, and the worst
      is a plasma panel. The larger the screen area, the more active the
      fields generated by BAF. The shorter the distance to the screen,
      the stronger the effect will be. However, the distance must not be
      less than the minimum permissible distance for a specific monitor
      from the ecological standpoint.<br>
      <br>
      Reactions of the organism to BAF fields have the greatest value
      when the user is in a relaxed state with eyes closed, but if the
      user is occupied with some business with open eyes, there is still
      an effect. Therefore, BAF may be transmitted, although with less
      effectiveness, when performing any activities.&nbsp; For those who
      spend a lot of time working on a computer, it is useful to turn on
      BAF transmission on the computer monitor, open the required files
      over it and work with them. In this case, the field generated by
      the BAF will have a useful effect on the person working with the
      computer according to the film’s specialization, and as we have
      already said, the computer’s harmful left-handed torsion radiation
      is simultaneously converted to the useful right-handed form.
      Modern video recording technologies make it possible to make
      multi-layered recordings. Thus, it is useful to set up production
      of animated films for children with BAF (BAFNo.12+14 or 1+12,
      etc.) recorded as the first layer, to provide children with a high
      level of intellectual and mental development and good
      physiological health. The same can be done with films for adults.
      <br>
      <br>
      TV broadcasts other than direct-to-air can be recorded and
      transmitted according to the same principle and run at a specified
      time or on separate channels for viewers who want to use the
      powers of BAF to improve their health in this way. It is also very
      relevant to transmit all kinds of advertising and entertainment
      videos recorded this way with BAF.No.23 or 22+23 in all public
      areas (first of all on transport) where aggressive acts may be
      committed, i.e., stadiums, stores, banks, bars, restaurants, etc.
      <br>
      <br>
      For people with serious heart, brain and other problems, it is
      very useful for them to have recordings of the appropriate BAF on
      their cell phones and turn them on at the onset of pain and rest
      the screen in the area of the heart, against the head, etc. Even
      better is to have a pocket media player with recordings of the
      necessary BAF in a pocket or bag. (The convenience of having first
      aid with you at all times is hard to overestimate). A media player
      with BAF can be placed on an animal’s collar. <br>
      <br>
      It is also useful to arrange for BAF transmission on Internet,
      mobile communication and TV channels. <br>
      <br>
      It is very appropriate and humane to transmit BAF 24 hours a day
      in hospices and everywhere there are hopelessly ill patients from
      a medical standpoint. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      This will give some patients a chance to recover or prolong their
      life for a while.<br>
      <br>
      For children in hopeless condition, this must be done, because, as
      we have already stated, the effectiveness of BAF on children is
      often amazingly high and chances of children, even those in a
      hopeless situation, recovering their health are significant.<br>
      <br>
      The use of BAF collections is most effective. <br>
      <br>
      <b>5. LIST OF G.V. VORSUNOV’s BAF. </b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      Reminder: the fields generated by any film act on the entire
      organism, with the focus on what is indicated in the film’s title.
      Do not use BAF to help people with affective disorders (manic
      psychosis, schizophrenia, etc.) without the recommendations and
      presence of a doctor.<br>
      <br>
      Also do not use BAF to help people with implanted artificial
      devices or body parts, i.e., pacemakers, artificial joints, breast
      implants, etc.<br>
      <br>
      Also do not use BAF on anyone who has undergone major surgery:
      i.e., sex change, skin color change, organ transplant, complicated
      plastic surgery, etc. THESE RESTRICTIONS ARE DUE TO THE LACK OF
      EXPERIENCE OF USING BAF FIELDS ON THESE PATIENTS. With time, these
      restrictions may be lifted.<br>
      <br>
      1. Harmony of the head. All problems associated with brain
      dysfunction. Advisable to use in combination with BAF No. 5 and
      others depending on the problem in the organism of a specific
      person by successive transmission of these films one after
      another. Effective for rehabilitation after head injuries. Use
      without anesthesia causes severe headaches, and transmission time
      should be limited. Do not increase emotional and physical loads
      for 3-4 months after pain and other negative effects have
      disappeared. This may be done gradually only after an examination
      and with a doctor’s permission.<br>
      <br>
      2. Harmony of the heart. Do not use on people with pacemakers,
      artificial joints, etc. On the appearance of the first negative
      sensations, open your eyes; if the sensations do not stop, end the
      transmission and resume it after the sensations disappear. (This
      happens in about 25% of users). The reactions will gradually cease
      over a period of several weeks. After heart pains have ceased, do
      not increase physical and emotional loads for 3 months; after this
      time, this may be done very gradually after a doctor’s examination
      and with his permission. Failure to fulfill this condition may
      result in very unpleasant, dangerous situations. <br>
      <br>
      3. Harmony of the liver. In all situations from poisoning and all
      forms of hepatitis to cancer.<br>
      <br>
      4. Harmony of the kidneys. For all problems, including&nbsp;
      poisoning, acute failure, inflammation, cancer, and very important
      for burns,&nbsp; festering wounds and ulcers in combination with
      BAF No. 5 and others. Theoretically, good results may be obtained
      for gangrene when used in combination with other BAF, but there is
      no experience in this area.<br>
      <br>
      5. Harmony of the circulatory system. Advisable to use for all
      problems and for prevention, either alone or in combination with
      other BAF,&nbsp; because the state of the blood and blood vessels
      is of enormous importance for the state of the organism. Moreover,
      the Bible says that the soul resides in a person’s blood. <br>
      <br>
      Therefore, these films are among the most important and requested
      ones.<br>
      <br>
      6. Harmony of the stomach and intestines. For all problems,
      including diabetes, rehabilitation after major surgery, stomach
      injuries and cancer. <br>
      <br>
      Rehabilitation proceeds without complications and in very short
      times.<br>
      <br>
      7. Harmony of the joints, spine and skeleton. Rehabilitation after
      fractures and injuries; help for all kinds of joint problems.
      Rehabilitation is accelerated after injuries, fractures and
      operations. Joints often respond very slowly, requiring 6-12
      months or more. Used in BAF collections against cancer to
      normalize brain function.<br>
      <br>
      8. Anti-cancer. For all types of cancer in combination with other
      BAF.<br>
      <br>
      9. Harmony of the female reproductive system. For the absolute
      majority of problems, including cancer.<br>
      <br>
      10. Harmony of the male reproductive system. For all problems. <br>
      <br>
      11. Active longevity. No comments needed.<br>
      <br>
      12. Boost intellect. Expands intellectual and creative potentials,
      reveals hidden talents, strengthens intuition, improves memory and
      logic and speeds up thinking. Useful for all age groups from
      children to the very elderly and in all professions. <br>
      <br>
      14. Harmony for the whole organism. Created as a preventive
      medium, performs harmonization for problems arising in the
      organism. <br>
      <br>
      15. Antivirus. Created to neutralize the harmful effect of
      viruses, bacteria and fungi. Together with BAF No. 8 and 16,
      useful for helping patients with weakened immune systems. This
      occurs frequently in cancer patients following chemotherapy and in
      AIDS patients. Effective against hepatitis C in combination with
      BAF No.3.<br>
      <br>
      16. Harmony of the respiratory system, Useful for all kinds of
      lung and bronchial problems, including AIDS patients. There is
      still no experience with AIDS.<br>
      <br>
      17. Harmony of the pancreas. For all problems in this area;
      problems recede more slowly than in other organs,<br>
      <br>
      18. Harmony of the thyroid gland. For all problems in this area.<br>
      <br>
      19. Harmony after injuries, burns and operations. Accelerates the
      rehabilitation process and improves its quality. Decreases the
      probability of complications occurring. Halts inflammatory
      processes.<br>
      <br>
      20. Vision. Slows negative age-related changes, helps relieve eye
      fatigue; useful for many problems in this area.<br>
      <br>
      21. Renewal of the organism. Useful for cancer and other problems;
      useful for direct application in all age groups.<br>
      <br>
      22. Wings of fate. Decreases the burden of Karma and thus improves
      the quality of life. Since each person has his own Karma,
      improvements happen according to&nbsp; different scenarios,
      sometimes with aggravations that are impossible to predict. Helps
      solve problems of physiological and mental health.<br>
      <br>
      23. Harmony of Life. Neutralizes negative incidents, aggression.
      High effectiveness confirmed by practice. Also helps solve
      problems of physiological and mental health.<br>
      <br>
      24. Harmony for domestic animals. For all problems. To date, there
      is experience of use with cats and dogs. Especially effective for
      older cats and dogs. <br>
      <br>
      Renews the organism, resorbs cancerous growths, prolongs life for
      several years.<br>
      <br>
      It is useful to download the film onto a media player and fasten
      it to a collar with the screen against the body. Any information
      carrier with the film recorded on it may be fastened to the
      collar, although this is less effective. A micro SD card may be
      used for small animals.<br>

      <b>ABSTRACT</b><br>
      <br>
      Field harmonizer for biosystems and substances with discs for the
      creation of fields which positively affect living organisms,
      including the organism of a human being and substances, wherein
      the field harmonizer is a disk on which 23.5 and more Gbyte of
      biologically active films (short BAF) from GW ; Worsunow, or a
      disc and fixed discs with films taken from the discs after the
      recording of the BAF on these discs, or a certain number of such
      discs placed in packs, or other information carriers, which have a
      Information having a quality and quantity sufficient to excite
      positive changes in biosystems, the information carriers being
      arranged on any surface with a light-reflecting cover of aluminum
      foil, mirrors or of polished metal, etc., for the reflection of
      the field to the biosystem.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      [0004] The present invention relates to the field of
      biotechnology, healthcare and ecology technologies and is intended
      for generating a biologically active field with relatively
      effective power sufficient for changing the state of the human or
      animal body, or other biosystems, from a disharmonious diseased
      state into a harmonious healthy state; promoting emotional
      well-being and raising energy levels; slowing the aging process;
      helping the elderly to stay active; solving ecology problems; and
      improving consumer appeal of various substances and articles used
      by people throughout their lives. It may be applied to a broad
      range of biotechnological problems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Prior Art</b><br>
      <br>
      [0005] All devices described below are sources of biologically
      actives fields, which harmonize the condition of biosystems,
      water, and other substances existing in liquid and semi-liquid
      states. The foundation for their creation are biologically actives
      films (BAF) by Gennady Vorsunov.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] When transmitted to any screen (e.g., TV, computer), G.
      Vorsunov's biologically active films (BAF) generate fields in
      space that affect the biological fields of living organisms and
      change their state from a disharmonious (corresponding to an
      ailing organism) into a healthy harmonious state. Harmonization of
      the ailing person's bio-field triggers various biophysical,
      biochemical and other body processes, which resolve many health
      problems including some that are difficult or impossible to
      resolve with traditional medicine. Copyrights to these films and
      to their use, as well as the description are registered as
      follows: G. Vorsunov, Copyright, THREAD ID 1-70 HVHU, THREAD ID
      1-70JF6Y, Jun. 15, 2010.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] One of the ideas used for making these films is patented by
      G. V. Vorsunov in Germany, useful model patent # 21 2008 000
      034.2., 03.04 2010. The device described in this known patent is a
      prototype for the development of the devices of the present
      invention. The disadvantage of this prototype is its large size,
      which limits its application.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] All the devices were tested on volunteers with chronic or
      acute medical problems. In most cases, positive results were
      obtained in the following areas: chronic joint pain, heart and
      head ache; rehabilitation following traumatic face and head
      injury; rehabilitation of infants and children following birth
      trauma: a girl suffering from cerebral palsy showed improved
      speech and motor coordination; improved logical skills and better
      memory in the elderly; eliminating meteo sensitivity, etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Furthermore, in March 2011, at the request of G. Vorsunov,
      the scientists at the OOO KTI laboratory (Saint Petersburg,
      Russia, www.kti.spb.ru, e-mail: info@kti.spb.ru), using the GDV
      camera experimentally demonstrated that water responds to the
      fields emitted by the harmonizers of G. Vorsunov's biosystems. <br>
      <br>
      Also, with Korotkov's GDV camera, G. V. Vorsunov registered
      reactions of people, toothpaste, and creams to these fields.
      Reactions of sick patients' bodies to the fields generated by BAF
      and the proposed devices are demonstrated by filming the trouble
      spots in the IR region during the fields' application to the
      organisms. An IR camera with 0.05 degr. C. sensitivity recorded a
      decrease in body temperature at trouble spots by 0.5 and more
      degrees 15-30 min. post treatment with the proposed device and
      BAF.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] The fields from the proposed devices are recorded on an
      instrument for measuring geophysical anomalies (IGA1) by Yu. P.
      Kravchenko (www.iga1.ru). In his article “Experimental Measurement
      of the Quantum Mechanics Wave Function,” on p. 22, G. I Shilov
      described his experiments measuring emission of torsion fields on
      the present device (article at http://.spinor. kiev.ua). P.
      Garjaev, Doctor of Biology,
      (http://p-gariaev.narod.ru/wave_gen_intro.htm) views the human
      genome as a quantum biocomputer performing spin-torsion recording
      and storing of information and its transfer to cells. He created
      an active model of a biocomputer in which information is read and
      transferred by laser beam. Information obtained in this model is
      used as a means for programming body cells for rejuvenation,
      healing, etc. G. Vorsunov used laser's ability to capture and
      transfer information in the devices NQ8 and N9.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] Changes in the field areas recorded by the GDV camera for
      water, toothpaste, creams, and humans and a decrease in body
      temperature at the anomalous zones of the body under the effect of
      the fields from the devices of the present invention are a
      reliable proof of the existence of these fields and of their
      performance, while the improvement in health of the device users
      and BAF users confirm their positive impact on human bodies (and
      also on dogs and cats).<br>
      <br>
      <b>DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      [0012] The technical result of the present invention is to design
      technologies for healthcare and ecology, the biotechnologies
      combining high performance with low cost, simplicity and easy
      operability and absolute safety.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] Said technical result is achieved by a field-effect disc
      harmonizer for biosystems and substances, to generate fields with
      a positive impact on living organisms including human bodies and
      on substances, comprising a disc with 23.5 or more GB of G.
      Vorsunov's biologically active films (BAF) or a disc with film
      plates affixed thereof, obtained from the discs that had been
      recorded with BAF, or from several such plates compiled in stacks,
      or from other data carriers storing information in a quality
      fashion and in an amount sufficient for launching positive changes
      in biosystems, located on any surface covered with a
      light-reflecting material made of aluminum foil, mirror, or
      polished metal, etc., to reflect the field to the biosystem.
      Furthermore, the field-effect harmonizer for biosystems and
      substances comprises cell structures that can be made in a
      plurality of shapes but with the following common features: the
      exterior cell contour has to be a regularly shaped polygonal prism
      or a cylinder wherein cylinders or prisms of smaller sizes, both
      intersecting and not intersecting and having light-reflecting
      coatings or polished surfaces are symmetrically positioned inside
      the cells relative to their axis, wherein the devices according to
      paragraph 1 positioned on the outer side of the cells relative to
      the biosystem and lenses, cones, or pyramids made of glass,
      crystal, or minerals located inside the cells and with their
      pointed end directed toward the biosystem, and having a field
      reflector common to the entire device or separate for every cell,
      made of aluminum foil or of mirrors reflecting the field to the
      biosystem.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] One or more fiber optical bundles are fixed on the surface
      of the device with one or both ends, and subsequently, the
      harmonizers according to paragraph 1 or 2 or a combination thereof
      along with the fixed ends of the optical fiber are either fixed on
      the surface with a light-reflecting coating, wrapped in aluminum
      foil, or placed into a box with mirrored interior walls or with
      another reflective surface, while the optical fiber outside the
      box or foil is either loose, and in that case it is used to
      transport the field to one biosystem or one substance, or it is
      split into several bundles and in that case the field is
      transported to several biosystems or several substances
      simultaneously; or it is spread and fixed on the mirrored surface
      or any other emission surface covered with a light-reflecting
      coating; or it is evenly wrapped around a frame followed by a
      fixation on the optical fiber layer of the reflector made of
      mirrors or aluminum foil and reflecting the field into the inner
      space defined by the fiber, containing the biosystem in need of
      the field exposure.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The devices according to paragraph 1, 2, or 3 in various
      embodiments corresponding to the problems to be solved and
      technical possibilities of their fixation and exploitation are
      fixed on the surface of any revolving parts or inner spaces
      thereof, such as blades, rotors of air fans, air and water
      generators, water propellers of ships, wheels of vehicles,
      automobile and other vehicle tires, revolving elements of the
      devices specifically manufactured to generate and emit into the
      space biologically active fields with a positive effect on
      biosystems and substances.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY</b><br>
      <br>
      [0016] A field-effect harmonizer for biosystems and substances
      with a wide application range in a plurality of shapes and sizes
      from packaging for perfumery products, water, foodstuffs,
      alcoholic products, and medications to chambers and facilities for
      healthcare and biotechnology problem solving, is any space defined
      by surfaces covered with light-reflecting materials housing the
      devices according to paragraph 1, 2, 3, or 4 in combinations
      corresponding to the problems being solved with the device of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] In the field-effect harmonizer, the ends of the optical
      fiber bundles are fixed in the device according to paragraph 5.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] A video image of BAF or a laser beam, or several beams, or
      BAF modulated with a video image, or unmodulated with BAF from the
      laser beam (laser beams)&nbsp; located inside the device according
      to paragraph 5 or 3 is transmitted through a projector lens onto
      the optical fiber inlet with a side-emitting effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] A laser beam or laser beams from the field-effect
      harmonizer for the biosystems and substances located inside a box
      is sent through an opening in the chamber wall to the biosystem in
      need of exposure.<br>
      <br>
      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b> Embodiment</b><br>
      <br>
      [0020] 1. A field-effect harmonizer for biosystems and substances
      is a disc with 23.5 or more GB of G. V. Vorsunov's BAF with a
      reflector made of aluminum foil or flat or parabolic mirror pasted
      onto its inactive side (on the side of the label,) and film plates
      obtained from the discs that had been recorded with BAF prior to
      removing the plates, fixed onto the work surface of the disc.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] As G. Vorsunov's experiments demonstrate, the effect of
      these devices is directly proportional to the amount of
      information stored in the device and efficiency of BAF themselves.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] To achieve results in solving health problems, it is
      sufficient to place the device of the present invention with the
      reflector facing out, onto a patient's body in the anomalous zone.
      In a preferred embodiment, the recorded plates are pasted onto a
      base made of thin flexible plastic that had been previously
      covered with aluminum foil. Complicated cases require stacks of
      many plates. These devices can be manufactured in any size by
      affixing stacks of 5-10 or more plates (240 GB of BAF information)
      next to each other onto a light-reflecting surface of a required
      size. In several days or several months of continuous daily use of
      these devices, health problems disappear completely or partially.
      (At night, the device is placed under the pillow cover, under
      sheets, etc., and during the day, the device is placed on the body
      in trouble spots. They are especially effective in children. For
      relatively uncomplicated problems, such as pain from acute
      gastritis, monthly cramps in women, discomfort following alcohol
      intake, spontaneous headaches, pain in the kidneys, liver, heart
      etc., it is sufficient to keep the device in the corresponding
      area for 30-60 min., and the pain and discomfort diminish. Chronic
      problems require treatments over several months. The device of the
      present invention solves health problems in animals.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] Availability of Blue ray discs with 320 GB recording
      capacity and holographic discs for 1.6 or more GB (such discs were
      developed in Japan), the process of making powerful devices of
      this type will become much less complicated, and the devices
      themselves will become more compact.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] Emission from disc and film plate surfaces obtained from
      the discs after they had been recorded with BAF can be attributed
      to the fact that during recording of G. Vorsunov's biologically
      active films (BAF) on discs on the nanometer level, the film, that
      is an information carrier is burned out by a laser with a
      harmonious three-dimensional structure shaped as a helix, which
      reflects information from BAF. The torsion field emitted from this
      structure carries the BAF information producing various
      biophysical, biochemical and other processes in the body and
      promoting good health. Due to the small helix pitch distance, when
      recording is done in the Blue-Ray format, the helix approaches the
      shape of a concentric circle system, and according to the data
      from G. I. Shilov, a Russian scientist, ( http://www.shipov.com ),
      (http://www.fizvakum.narod.ru), chapter 4, and A. R. Pavlenko, a
      Ukrainian scientist, p. 180, A. R. Pavlenko “Computer, Mobile
      Phone, and . . . Health? 2007, Ukraine, Kiev, Osnova ISBN 978-699
      -266-9, the circle has the highest torsion contrast ratio (
      http://www.spinor.kiev.ua ). Field emission from the film surfaces
      following recording of BAF thereupon also explains “The Cavitary
      Structure Effect” coined by the Russian entomologist V. S.
      Grebennikov ( http://www.incognita.rU/hronik/planet/p 020.htm ).
      The cavitary structure effect known to all is demonstrated by the
      fields emitted by honeycomb frames from beehives, emptied of honey
      and stacked one on top of the other.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] According to the theory of torsion fields, they don't carry
      energy but information. To protect people from the adverse torsion
      fields emitted by computers, phones, etc, A. R. Pavlenko developed
      the device called Forpost 1, United States patent Pavlenko, et al
      U.S. Pat. No. 6,548,752 Apr. 15 2003.<br>
      ( http://www.spinor.kiev.ua )<br>
      <br>
      [0026] The mechanism by which information affects living organisms
      was explained by professor Masuru Emoto of Japan
      (www.masaru-emoto.net, www.hado.net). <br>
      <br>
      Based on numerous experiments, he had proved that under the
      influence of information, the structure of water changes
      proportionately to the type of the information received. Since the
      human body, as well as all biosystems, mostly consists of water,
      any positive external information affecting a living organism
      transforms it from a diseased to a healthy state. Experiments
      studying reaction of water to various external factors were
      conducted by K. G. Korotkov, Doctor of Engineering
      (www.korotkov.org). In his experiments, he demonstrated that human
      consciousness (I.e. the field that a person consciously generates
      and emits) affects the state of water. The discs of the device
      according to paragraph 1 contain recordings of biologically active
      films, i.e. information aimed at maintaining a harmonious and
      healthy state of living organisms. Accordingly, impacted by this
      information, the water in living organisms changes its structure
      proportionally to the received information, thus transforming the
      organisms from a diseased to a healthy state <br>
      <br>
      [0027] The advantages of the device of the present invention are
      the simplicity of manufacture and use thereof; it may be made with
      a variety of modifications both in size and the relative effective
      power by varying the amount of information stored in the device.
      For example, for leg and arm joints, it is sufficient to use one
      stack of films with BAF information or one disc, while to restore
      the brain function, it is effective to use at least three discs or
      BAF information plate stacks. This affords consistently high <br>
      <br>
      [0028] efficacy in situations with different degrees of
      complexity. In order to cover a wide variety of areas, the device
      according to paragraph 1 must utilize a large number of discs and
      plates obtained from discs after they had been recorded with
      information from BAF, and the single primary source of the
      biologically active field in this device is BAF information. This
      limits its possibilities. <br>
      <br>
      [0029] 2. In order to eliminate this disadvantage, we designed a
      field-effect cellular harmonizer for biosystems as various
      combinations of symmetrical regularly shaped cells in the form of
      cylinders, of prisms, wherein cylinders located inside the cells
      are both intersecting and not intersecting and have
      light-reflecting coatings and of discs or stacks of plates with
      BAF recordings according to paragraph 1 and also of lenses, cones,
      or pyramids made of glass, crystal, or natural or manmade
      minerals; having a field reflector common to the entire device or
      separate for every cell reflecting the field into the work zone of
      mirrors or foil. <br>
      <br>
      [0030] As G. Vorsunov's experiments demonstrated, the devices
      composed of cells in the shape of symmetrical hexagonal prisms or
      cylinders comprising cylinders of lesser diameters in different
      configurations but symmetrically arranged and covered with
      light-reflecting coatings emit a biologically active field of
      relative effective power sufficient for making a positive impact
      on the condition of the human body. (These devices can be made in
      different sizes, from nanometers to meters and bigger). The cells
      can be made in an infinite plurality of shapes and there can be a
      multitude of different embodiments of such devices, from jewelry,
      clothes, rugs, hats made of thread or cord with light-reflecting
      coatings (such as aluminum foil) to various panels, structural
      elements of furniture—beds, armchairs, various cars and buildings,
      in combination with BAF information carriers (discs, plate stacks
      according to paragraph 1, other information carriers) and with
      lenses, pyramids, cones made of glass or from various natural or
      manmade minerals, which fix the fields and improve the efficacy of
      the devices. It is particularly important to use these devices in
      the facilities for children and medical facilities. Emissions from
      these devices are generated due to the aforementioned “Cavitary
      Structure Effect” and also due to the shape effect described by G.
      I. Shipov, chapter 4 “On Shape Effect.”(
      http://www.fizvakum.narod.ru ). The Shape Effect is also reported
      by another Russian scientist, A. Ye. Akimov (A. Ye. Akimov “The
      Physical Basis of the Fundamental Angi concepts”//Live Ethics,
      Science, Society: a compiled publication by A. Ye. Akimov, RANS
      academician, Director of the International Institute of
      Theoretical and Applied Physics./Penza 2000, pp 12-2. <br>
      <br>
      [0031] The mechanism of the impact on living organisms and
      substances is the same as for the device according to paragraph 1.
      The device must be placed in the closest proximity to the user's
      body in such a way as to direct the field's emission toward the
      body. Relative effective power of the fields generated by such
      device is higher than that from device Ne1 due to the accumulative
      effect of the fields from all the sources. Efficacy of such
      devices is proportional to the number of cells and to the volume
      occupied by the entire structure, and also to the number of
      utilized devices according to paragraph 1 and the lenses, cones
      and pyramids made of glass or minerals that bring these fields
      into focus. <br>
      <br>
      [0032] 3. In order to eliminate the disadvantages inherent to the
      devices according to paragraph 1 and 2, we designed the “optical
      field-effect harmonizer for biosystems” comprising one or several
      optical fiber bundles (inflexible or flexible), wherein one or
      both ends are fixed on one or several devices according to
      paragraph 1 or 2, or on any combinations thereof, wherein said
      devices (or device) with the ends of the optical fibers affixed
      thereto are wrapped into foil or placed into a box coated with a
      light-reflecting material, or affixed to any light-reflecting
      surface, and optical fibers are either loose or also affixed to
      any base with a light-reflecting surface. The use of optical
      fibers facilitates the split of the bundles and can produce a
      simultaneous effect from the combination of devices according to
      paragraphs 1 and 2 or from one of the devices onto several
      biosystems. This is particularly important for big medical
      facilities. Said devices can be prepared and used in an infinity
      of ways: as rugs and bed covers, as parts of clothing, armchairs,
      beds, rooms, and as transportation devices from baby carriages to
      airplanes. In biotechnologies for transmitting BAF fields into
      required zones, etc., in his experiments, G. Vorsunov uses
      flexible optical fibers with 0.15 mm to 1 mm gauge and 0.1 m to 30
      m length, and plate stacks of BAF recordings containing from 96 GB
      to 3 TB of information. In said devices, the light-reflecting
      surface reflects the fields from the films, and these fields
      penetrate the optical fiber. <br>
      <br>
      As demonstrated in practical applications, the fields transported
      from the device according to paragraph 1 through the fiber are
      emitted through the fiber's side surfaces. Optical fibers greatly
      increase the light-reflecting surface and accordingly, the
      relative effective power of the device in comparison to devices #1
      and 2. This was confirmed in the experiments with water conducted
      in OOO KTI. Device Ns1 that had been tested at the OOO KTI
      facility contains 96 GB of information and consist of a disc and
      three films with BAF recordings fixed thereto. Devices Ns2 and #3
      also contain a disc and three films and also carry 96 GB of
      information, but the plates of device #2 are fixed on a cellular
      structure, while the film in device Ns3 has 300 optical fibers
      with 0.15 mm gauge and 200-250 mm length fixed thereto. The
      reaction of water to the fields emitted by the device according to
      paragraph 3 is stronger than the reaction to the fields from the
      first device. Thus, the fields emitted from the surface of the
      plates storing BAF information were demonstrated to penetrate the
      optical fiber and while passing therethrough emitted into the
      space. The device users showed enhanced reactions of the organism
      as the number of fibers of the emitting fields increases. <br>
      <br>
      [0033] An integrated effect on many organs and systems and on the
      whole body, if necessary, or on several people simultaneously can
      be achieved by using only one stack of films storing BAF
      information when placing the fibers next to the user's body by way
      of different constructions (flat or three-dimensional) with fibers
      fixed to the interior surfaces thereof. Varying the amount of
      information stored in the device according to paragraph 1, using
      the various devices according to paragraph 2, and varying the
      total area of the cross-section and the length of the optical
      fibers transmitting the field, the parameters of the field emitted
      by the device can be adjusted to achieve the highest efficiency.
      Using a large number of long fibers (placing them on the bottom of
      bodies of water or hanging them on floats at the desired depth)
      can effectively impact the state of the biosystems in river
      basins, lakes and seas. <br>
      <br>
      [0034] Device Ne4. The disadvantage of the device according to
      paragraph 3 is the difficulty of managing an effective impact on
      biosystems in a large space. To eliminate this disadvantage we
      designed the “dynamic harmonizer for biosystems,” which can be any
      rotating object with the devices according to paragraphs 1, 2, and
      3 fixed thereupon in any combinations that would actually be
      technically feasible. Common fans were used in the experiments.
      Their blades were wrapped into aluminum foil, and then plates with
      BAF recording were pasted onto the blades. Essentially, this is a
      rotating version of the device according to paragraph 1. As the
      experiments demonstrated, the rotating blades of such fans
      generate a field with biological activity much higher than the
      field emitted by the same blades when the fan is off. The higher
      the rotating speed, the higher the biological activity of the
      fields generated by such device. <br>
      <br>
      This phenomenon can be attributed to the torsion field emitted by
      any rotating object. Rotation of sources of biologically active
      fields generates additional torsion fields, which augment the
      filed emitted by said sources. That was demonstrated in the
      experiments conducted at OOO KTI. The reaction of water from a
      rotating fan with the device according to paragraph 1 affixed
      thereto is much stronger that that from a stationary device
      according to paragraph 1. Such fans achieve two goals: air
      circulation and a simultaneous generation of a biologically active
      field into a large space to solve health problems of the people in
      the facility where the fan is located. Such fans are especially
      useful in the ventilation systems of intensive care units, in
      hospices, in the facilities for children, old-age homes, and in
      the hospitals. They are also useful in people's homes, industrial
      facilities, and in all modes of transportation as prophylaxis
      against illnesses, for fostering emotional well-being and raising
      the energy level, etc. In addition, such devices are very useful
      in all technical devices where the devices according to paragraphs
      1, 2, and 3 can be affixed to the moving parts or in the
      assemblies of said devices. First of all, this must be done inside
      automobile tires and on the windmill blades, on water generator's
      and screw propeller's axes. As the wheels, blades, or rotors with
      the information carriers containing BAF recordings affixed thereto
      rotate, biologically active fields are continuously emitted into
      the space, which positively affect the people inside these modes
      of transportation and all the living organisms in the vicinity of
      the operational automobiles or generators. In his experiment, G.
      Vorsunov pasted plates with BAF recordings on the inner surfaces
      of his automobile tires. Both people with health problems and the
      people inside the automobiles experience reactions similar to
      those from the devices according to paragraphs 1, 2, and 3.
      Considering that a huge amount of vehicles, wind and water
      generators, and other various mechanisms are always in motion, we
      can predict with certainty that these devices, when widely used,
      will be very effective for the preventive health care and for
      providing a good ecological environment along the roads and
      highways and near wind power plants. A natural movement of large
      amounts of air and water will broaden the area covered by these
      devices by many miles, and we can predict with certainty that an
      implementation of these devices into practice will make positive
      global effects on the ecology. <br>
      <br>
      [0035] Device #5. A chamber with high density of biologically
      active fields for solving complex health problems (accelerating
      healing of vast wounds, in all kinds of acute insufficiencies, for
      helping children with a majority of problems including birth
      trauma and oncology, etc.), for the effect on various substances
      in order to improve their consumer appeal, such is perfumery
      products, water, fruit, vegetables, liquid and semiliquid food
      products and food products containing water as well as in
      biotechnologies for the acceleration of processes of cell division
      and cell augmentation, said chambers can be any closed space (box,
      room, building) with inner surfaces covered with light-reflecting
      coatings and comprising any of the aforementioned devices or a
      combination thereof. The impact on living organisms from such
      devices is much stronger and more effective than the impact from
      the devices according to paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4. This can be
      attributed to the fact that the fields emitted from the devices
      according to paragraphs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are contained within the
      space defined by the light-reflecting surface. Perfumery products
      kept in such devices for 3 or more days, exhibit a much more
      refreshing and rejuvenating effect than the initial perfumery
      products. Thus, it is very important to use this device for
      packaging of perfumery products. Water, fruit, and liquid products
      kept in a refrigerator made in the form of such device (the
      harmonizer according to paragraph 3 is placed in the refrigerator
      and its inner surfaces are covered with foil) have better taste.
      Cut up potatoes acquire a dark color faster. Theoretically,
      medications kept in such chambers have to exhibit an enhanced
      healing effect. Reactions of toothpaste and skincare creams kept
      in the refrigerator for more than three to five days were recorded
      with a GMV camera. <br>
      <br>
      [0036] 6. The ends of the fiber optic bundles are fixed inside the
      device according to paragraph 5. Owing to the utilization of a
      large number of field sources, such devices can expand the range
      of problems that can be solved with the maximum efficiency. <br>
      <br>
      [0037] 7. Light harmonizer for biosystems. This device comprises a
      bundle or several bundles with BAF transmitted through a projector
      lens onto the inlet thereof. The fiber bundles can be places in
      one plane or in various three-dimensional structures complete with
      a reflector reflecting the field into a work zone. When a BAF
      image passes through the fibers, it emits a biologically active
      field through the side surface thereof, similarly to the device
      according to paragraph 3. Fiber optic bundles from one projector
      can be split and used for several people or used to transmit BAF
      fields into several work zones. Devices containing optic fibers
      with good side-emitting capacity can be concurrently used as light
      sources. This is especially useful in the hospitals, hazardous
      industries, etc. <br>
      <br>
      [0038] 8. A laser harmonizer for biosystems is either the device
      according to paragraph 3, wherein a laser beam or several laser
      beams modulated with BAF video images are sent to the fiber optic
      inlet; or a box containing the device according to paragraphs 1 or
      2, additionally comprising one or more lasers in such a way that
      the laser beam/s enters the optic fibers. In this device, a laser
      beam captures the information emitted by the fields of the device
      according to paragraphs 1 or 2 and carries it through the optic
      fibers, whereas similarly to the device according to paragraph 3,
      a biologically active field is emitted though the side surfaces
      thereof initiating various positive process in the living
      organisms. An electromagnetic field radiation is one of the
      laser's physical properties. In his experiments in wave genetics,
      P. P. Garyaev, Doctor of Biology, uses this property of laser
      beams to capture information and to emit it into the space. Optic
      fibers transport laser beams with no losses to very long
      distances, which can generate large biologically active fields
      with high effective power in very large spaces and due to the
      split, transmit them to a large number of biosystems over long
      distances. <br>
      <br>
      [0039] A device modulating a laser beam has not yet been created
      because of the complexity of its design, but in the practical
      application of BAF, there was a case when the TV of one of the BAF
      users broke and he watched the BAF exclusively on a DVD player. He
      still experienced the positive effects. This means that the field
      emitted by the laser in the player showing the BAF made a positive
      impact on the human body. (The user was an elderly man with bad
      memory). This practical experience and P. P. Garyaev's experiments
      are the basis for the creation of this device. <br>
      <br>
      [0040] 9. In the open laser harmonizer for biosystems, the laser
      beam (or beams) positioned inside a chamber, the inner walls
      thereof are covered with a light-reflecting coating, are
      transmitted through an opening in the chamber wall not to an optic
      fiber but to a space beyond the chamber and into the work zone,
      i.e. to a biosystem in need of an impact. The field in the chamber
      is captured by the laser beam/s and emitted into a space while
      affecting the biosystems adjacent to the beam. <br>
      <br>
      [0041] This version of the harmonizer is simple, convenient, and
      can make an impact at long distances and in large spaces. It is
      efficient in curing illnesses and can be used in biotechnology and
      ecological biotechnology. <br>
      <br>
      <b>INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY </b><br>
      <br>
      [0042] This technical solution is industrially applicable; since
      the description and the useful model indicate the purpose thereof,
      it can be manufactured and used to make a field-effect disc
      harmonizer for biosystems and substances for generating fields
      with a positive effect on living organisms, it can be produced and
      reproduced while the distinctive features of the device help
      achieve the desired technical result, i.e. they are essential. <br>
      <br>
      [0043] The device as described in every of the claims can be
      manufactured by the means and methods described for the prototype
      available to everyone before the date of priority of the
      invention. Thus, the claimed technical solution meets the
      patentability criteria “Industrial Application.” <br>

      [0044] The efficacy of all the proposed devices is easily
      confirmed in practice and those skilled in the art who are

      A device for generating a torsion field having a salt solution
      disposed in a first chamber, a torsion field generator for
      producing a right torsion field, and a magnetic element. The
      magnetic element rotates in response to a change in magnetic
      polarity. The torsion field generator is operably associated with
      the magnetic element. As a result, the torsion field generator is
      oriented in a predetermined association with respect to the
      earth's magnetic field. The first chamber and the torsion field
      generator are disposed such that a portion of the right torsion
      field propagates through the salt solution<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention relates to torsion fields, an in particular to a
      device for providing protection from torsion fields for users of
      electronic equipment.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Torsion fields are generated by the classical spin, or by the spin
      angular momentum density (on a macroscopic level) of any object.
      The spinning of an object sets up polarization in two spatial
      cones, corresponding to a left torsion field and a right torsion
      field. At an atomic level, nuclear spin as well as full atomic
      movements may be the source of torsion fields. This means that all
      objects in nature, live or dead, generate their own torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      Unlike electromagnetic and gravitation fields that have central
      symmetry, torsion fields have axial symmetry. Torsion fields are
      also different from electromagnetic fields in that torsion fields
      having an opposite spin repel each other. Torsion fields may also
      propagate through physical media without interacting with the
      media. Thus, torsion fields may not be shielded by most materials.
      However, a propagating torsion field alters the spin state of the
      media it propagates through.<br>
      <br>
      Since all substances have their own stereochemistry which
      determines not only the location of atoms in molecules, but also
      determines their mutual spin orientation, then the superposition
      of the torsion fields generated by the atomic and nuclear spins of
      each molecule determines the intensity of the torsion field in the
      space surrounding each molecule. The superposition of all these
      torsion fields determines the intensity and spatial configuration
      of the characteristic torsion field for that substance. Thus, each
      physical object, whether living or non-living, possesses its own
      characteristic torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      Torsion fields may also be generated by other methods in addition
      to the classical spin of particles. A wide spectrum of geometric
      forms of substances and objects are a natural source of torsion
      fields. Objects with a certain surface geometry will
      simultaneously generate left and right torsion fields of a certain
      configuration depending on the geometry of the object. Examples
      include, pyramids, cones, tridents, cylinders, and flat triangles.<br>
      <br>
      Torsion fields are also generated by electromagnetic fields. Since
      charge polarization simultaneously results in a loss of
      equilibrium in charge and spin, an <br>
      electrostatic field is also followed by a torsion field. Thus,
      sources of electromagnetic and electrostatic fields are always
      sources of torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      As electromagnetic fields are accompanied by torsion fields, most
      electronic devices, such as mobile phones, computer monitors and
      televisions are sources of torsion fields. Mobile phones, as most
      other electronic devices generate a left torsion field and a right
      torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      The property of spin of the molecules in each object is subject to
      influence by external torsion fields. Thus, the structure of the
      torsion field of each physical object can be altered by the
      influence of an external torsion field. The influence of an
      external torsion field would result in a new configuration of the
      torsion field in the object. This new torsion field would be fixed
      as a metastable state and will remain intact even after the source
      of the external torsion field is removed.<br>
      <br>
      Experiments have shown that exposure to left torsion fields may
      have a negative effect on the human body, while right torsion
      fields may actually have a positive effect. The negative effects
      of left torsion fields may include a decline in the response of
      the immune system and a susceptibility to disease.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a device for generating a
      torsion. The device includes a salt solution, a torsion field
      generator, and a magnetic element. The first chamber and the
      torsion field generator being disposed such that a portion of the
      right torsion field propagates through the salt solution.In one
      embodiment, the first chamber may be in the shape of a sphere. The
      magnetic element may also be a sphere and disposed within the
      first chamber. The salt solution may be disposed between the first
      chamber and the magnetic element or alternatively, within the
      magnetic element.<br>
      <br>
      The magnetic element may be operably associated with the torsion
      field generator so that the magnetic element rotates in response
      to a change in magnetic polarity. The magnetic element orients the
      torsion field generator in a predetermined association with
      respect to the earth's magnetic field. The magnetic element may
      align the torsion field generator with the earth's magnetic field.
      In one embodiment, the torsion field generator may be aligned so
      that the torsion field generator is on the south side of the first
      chamber and produces a torsion field that propagates towards the
      north pole.<br>
      <br>
      The torsion field generator may be in the shape of a trident. The
      torsion field generator inherently produces the right torsion
      field. The torsion field generator may also inherently produces a
      left torsion field.<br>
      <br>
      The salt solution may include a rare earth metal salt. In one
      embodiment, the salt solution may include approximately 5% Cerium,
      5% Lutetium, and 5% Erbium by composition.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention may further include a second chamber in
      proximity to the first chamber. A carbon solution may be disposed
      in the second chamber. In one&nbsp; embodiment, the carbon
      solution has approximately 10-12% Carbon by composition. The
      carbon solution may inherently reduce proximate electromagnetic
      fields, <br>
      which may also inherently decrease proximate torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      In accordance with another aspect of this invention a method of
      significantly decreasing the presence of left torsion fields about
      an electronic device comprises orienting a torsion field generator
      in a predetermined association with respect to the magnetic field
      of the earth; generating a torsion field; and propagating the
      torsion field through a salt solution. The method may further
      include generating a first right torsion field; attracting a
      second right torsion field from the electronic device; generating
      a first left torsion field; and attracting a second left torsion
      field from the electronic device.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      While the present invention may be embodied in many different
      forms, there is shown in the drawings and discussed herein a few
      specific embodiments with the&nbsp; understanding that the present
      disclosure is to be considered only as an exemplification of the
      principles of the invention and is not intended to limit the
      invention to the embodiments illustrated.<br>
      <br>
      FIGS. 1a and 1b depict one potential embodiment of a device for
      generating a torsion field to provide significant protection to a
      user from left torsion fields, especially those generated by
      electronic equipment. The device may include a first chamber 20
      and a second chamber 30. In one embodiment, the first chamber 20
      and the second chamber 30 are positioned on a base 10 adjacent to
      each other. The base 10 allows for the device to be mounted onto a
      surface of electronic equipment, such as a mobile phone.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment of the invention, the first chamber 20 may be
      spherical in shape and may be constructed out of a non-magnetic
      glass-type material. However, the first chamber may be any shape
      and may be constructed out of another material as long as the
      material does not interfere with the functionality of the device.<br>
      <br>
      The first chamber may include a salt solution 21, a magnetic
      element 22, and a torsion field generator 23. The salt solution
      may include water plus any element that would provide a
      significant number of positive and negative ions in the solution.
      For example, the salt solution may be natural sea water. The salt
      solution may alternatively be comprised of water and ordinary
      table salt. The use of various elements, as well as various
      combinations of elements will result in varying torsion field
      strengths generated by the present device. Along with the choice
      of elements, the strength of the generated torsion field is also
      affected by the concentration of each element in the solution, the
      hydration of each element, the temperature of the solution, and
      the total volume of the solution. The water in the salt solution
      may also be substituted with other liquids so long as the liquid
      is capable of generating torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the salt solution includes a rare earth metal
      salt. The rare earth metal salt may be any element with an atomic
      numbers from 58 to 71 (inclusive) on the periodic chart. By using
      a salt solution including rare earth metals, the strength of the
      torsion field generated by the present invention is increased in
      comparison to any other type of salt solution. In one approach,
      the salt solution includes three different elements. The salt
      solution may be approximately 5% Cerium, 5% Lutetium, and 5%
      Erbium by composition. However, any other rare earth metal salt
      may be used in addition to or in place of the these elements. The
      concentration of the element may also be varied.<br>
      <br>
      The salt solution generates left and right torsion due to the
      movement of opposite ions in opposite directions. The ions are set
      into motion by the magnetic fields generated by the magnetic poles
      of the earth. Hydroxyl ions and hydroxonium ions that are
      inherently present in the solution are set into motion as a result
      of the magnetic fields. The trajectories of movement of the
      hydroxyl and hydroxonium ions are cycloids.<br>
      <br>
      Since water molecules have a high dipole moment, the hydroxyl and
      hydroxonium ions that move from the point where they have appeared
      during dimer decomposition and rotate in the same area but in
      opposite directions will orient the nearest water molecules as if
      stringing them on the arch of a cycloid. <br>
      <br>
      This results in the unification of molecules situated on the
      hydroxile and hydroxone arches into flat circular associates due
      to collective aquatic links. Circular associates that appear are
      extremely passive because they are unpolar, neutral and slow
      moving due to their large size and weight. This makes the
      reconstruction of water into regulated ice-like structures easier.
      The ice-like structures generate the left and right torsion
      fields.<br>

      Magnetic element 22 is designed to rotate in response to a change
      in magnetic polarity such that the torsion field generator is
      oriented in a predetermined association with the earth's magnetic
      field. Thus, the magnetic element may basically act as a magnetic
      compass such that a predetermined portion of the magnetic element
      always faces in a predetermined direction, such as north. In one
      embodiment, the magnetic element is spherical and situated within
      and substantially concentric with the first chamber 20. The salt
      solution may be disposed between the magnetic element and the
      first chamber. As such, the magnetic element is suspended in the
      solution, allowing the magnetic element to rotate without a
      significant amount of friction. The salt solution may also be
      disposed within the magnetic element or the salt solution may be
      disposed both inside and outside of the magnetic element. In yet
      another approach, the salt solution may also be disposed in only a
      portion of the first chamber a long as a portion of the right
      torsion field produced by the torsion field generator propagates
      through the salt solution. If the salt solution is only inside the
      magnetic element or in only a portion of the first chamber, a
      different liquid or lubricant may be used between the magnetic
      element and the first chamber in order to allow the magnetic
      element to rotate without significant friction.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the magnetic element 22 may include a first
      magnetic portion and a second magnetic portion associated with a
      susbtantially non-magnetic sphere. The magnetic portions may be
      metallic and the non-magnetic portion may be constructed from a
      plastic material. The first and second magnetic portions have
      opposite polarity and are preferably located on opposite sides of
      the spherical magnetic element. Thus, the first magnetic portion
      may have a positive polarity and the second magnetic portion may
      have a negative polarity. The first magnetic portion is then
      attracted to the south pole and the second magnetic portion is
      attracted to the north pole. This attraction rotates the magnetic
      element such that the magnetic portions become aligned with the
      earth's magnetic fields. Alternatively, the magnetic element may
      also be entirely metallic, a magnetized ferrous material, or any
      other material so long as the magnetic element is capable of
      continuously orienting a predetermined portion of the magnetic
      element in a predetermined direction in a association with the
      earths's magnetic field. The design and shape of the magnetic
      element may also be any other method as is known in the prior art
      for the construction of magnetic compasses.<br>
      <br>
      Torsion field generator 23 may be any geometric shape capable of
      inherently producing left and right torsion fields. In one
      embodiment, the torsion field generator is in the shape of a
      trident (see FIG. 2a) and is metallic. Alternatively, the torsion
      field generator may be in the shape of the star of David (see FIG.
      2b). However, the torsion field generator may also be in the form
      of pins, diffraction grid elements, or any geometric shape capable
      of inherently producing a torsion field. The torsion field
      generator may also be constructed from any material capable of
      inherently producing torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      The torsion field generator 23 is operably associated with the
      magnetic element 22. In one embodiment, the torsion field
      generator is attached to the outer wall of the magnetic element
      22. However, the torsion field generator 23 may alternatively be
      attached to the inner wall of the magnetic element 22, or within
      the magnetic element 22. As a result of being associated with the
      magnetic element, the torsion field generator 23 is also rotated
      with respect to the first chamber 20. Thus, the magnetic element
      22 basically serves to continually position the torsion field
      generator 23 in a similar orientation with respect to the magnetic
      fields of the earth regardless of the orientation of the first
      chamber 20.<br>
      <br>
      In one approach, the torsion field generator 23 is positioned on
      the magnetic element such that the torsion field generator 23 will
      be situated on the portion of the magnetic element 22 that faces
      substantially south. The torsion field generator produces a right
      torsion field and a left torsion field due to the topology of the
      torsion field generator. By orienting the torsion field generator
      in a substantially southern direction, the torsion fields produced
      by the torsion field generator are aligned with the magnetic
      fields of the earth, thereby increasing the right and left torsion
      fields produced by the torsion field generator. The torsion
      generator may alternatively be positioned on the magnetic element
      such that the torsion field generator 23 will be situated on the
      portion of the magnetic element 22 that faces substantially north.
      This would also serve to align the torsion fields produced by the
      torsion field generator with the magnetic fields of the earth.<br>
      <br>
      As the salt solution is disposed around the magnetic element, the
      torsion fields produced by the torsion field generator also
      propagate through the salt solution, further increasing both the
      right and left torsion fields generated by the present invention.
      As shown in FIG. 3, the combination of the salt solution and the
      torsion generator produce a right torsion field 25 and a left
      torsion field 26. When the torsion field generator is positioned
      towards the south, the right torsion field 25 propagates in a
      substantially northward direction, and the left torsion field 26
      propagates in a substantially southward direction.<br>
      <br>
      The second chamber 30 may also be spherical in shape and
      constructed out of a non-magnetic glass type material. In one
      embodiment, the second chamber 30 is adjacent to the first sphere
      chamber 20. The second chamber includes a carbon solution 31. In
      one approach, the carbon solution is water with approximately
      10%-12% carbon by composition. However, the concentration of
      carbon in the carbon solution may be altered.<br>
      <br>
      Colloid solution of carbon may partially absorb electromagnetic
      radiation. This is due to the concentration of the total weight
      and free energy of the system in the interphase surface layers.
      Thus, the carbon solution in the second chamber may absorb, and
      therefore reduce, a portion of an electromagnetic field generated
      by an associated electronic device. Since electromagnetic fields
      are a significant source of torsion fields, the reduction of the
      electromagnetic field produced by electronic equipment has the
      benefit of also decreasing the overall torsion fields generated by
      the electronic equipment. Although the second chamber may aid in
      reducing the torsion fields and the electromagnetic fields
      surrounding most electronic equipment, the torsion fields
      generated by the first chamber may be sufficient to protect the
      user from the left torsion fields generated by such electronic
      equipment independent of the carbon solution.<br>
      <br>
      In operation, the present invention may be mounted on, placed
      inside of, or placed in proximity to an electronic device such as
      a mobile phone. As shown in FIG. 4a, the electronic device 40,
      such as a mobile phone, generates a left torsion field 42 and
      right torsion field 41, as well as electromagnetic fields (not
      shown). Typically, these torsion fields propagate over great
      distances without attenuation and may have a negative effect the
      user of the electronic device.<br>
      <br>
      As illustrated in FIG. 4b, the left torsion field 26 and right
      torsion field 25 generated from the first chamber 20 interact with
      the left torsion field 42 and the right torsion field 41 that are
      generated by the electronic device 40. Specifically, the right
      torsion field 25 generated from the first chamber 20 attracts the
      right torsion field 41 generated by the electronic device 40 and
      the left torsion field 26 generated from the first chamber 20
      attracts the left torsion field 42 generated by the electronic
      device 40. This attraction between torsion fields forms the
      torsion fields into a loop that has the effect of substantially
      preventing the torsion fields generated by either the present
      invention or the electronic device from propagating in any
      direction except towards one another. Thus, the attraction between
      the torsion fields creates a boundary beyond which the torsion
      fields may not propagate.<br>
      <br>
      When the present invention is placed inside the mobile phone or
      other electronic device, the distance between the torsion field of
      the present invention and the torsion fields of the electronic
      device is small, increasing the attraction between them. As a
      result, the are of the loop formed by the attracting torsion
      fields is small and substantially contained within the inside of
      the electronic device. Therefore, the torsion fields are
      substantially prevented from propagating out of the electronic
      device, decreasing the effects of the torsion fields on the user.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, as illustrated in FIG. 4c, the carbon solution in
      the second chamber 30 may further reduce the overall strength of
      the electromagnetic fields, and therefore, also the overall
      strength of the left torsion fields generated by the mobile phone.
      This further reduces the area affected by the torsion fields.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention may be also be used to decrease the effects
      from torsion fields generated by other electrical equipment,
      including vehicles, stereos, televisions, etc. For each electronic
      device, the concentrations of elements in the salt solution, as
      well as the type of right torsion field generator maybe altered in
      order to achieve the appropriate torsion field for the associated
      electronic device.<br>
