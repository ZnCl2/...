      Is it a Gravity Beam Generator? In September 2003, Jeff Cook
      published plans online for a new invention that he claims produces
      a beam of force that can bend a candle flame -- even through solid
      objects! Don't take our word for it --download the plans and build
      one yourself.<br>

      The Jeff Cook effect is a polarized effect -- a flame held in
      front of the device is attracted to the coil as power is applied.<br>

      This profile photo shows the primary effect coil to the right, and
      the smaller coil to directionalize the effect on the left.<br>

      Interestingly, the Cook Effect does not seem to decrease with the
      square of the distance, as shown in this photo at long range.<br>

      <br>
      Jeff Cook claims that this effect penetrates through barriers like
      glass and wood to affect the candle flame with the same intensity.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style=" width: 218px;

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">A New Gravity?</span><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Ning Li predicted a "push-pull" conceptual effect that she
      calls "AC Gravity" in the mid-1990's. The idea is that perhaps
      gravity is a more complex force than what we observe in nature,
      and that as a result of this it may be able to produce interesting
      new effects as yet unseen.<br>
      <br>
      The Jeff Cook Effect could be the beginnings of one of these
      designs. The device uses a set of innovative magnetic-coils wound
      in a unique manner to create a beam of force that Cook claims will
      bend a candle flame or produce a very light pressure on human
      skin.<br>
      <br>
      Cook claims that the JCE Generator is capable of not only exerting
      force on a flame, but can also do it through solid objects. Cook
      has experimented with putting obstacles in between the generator
      and the flame, and claims that the beam of force is not modified
      as it passes through objects like wood and glass.<br>
      <br>
      Interestingly, this corresponds to Podkletnov's observations with
      the rotating superconductor experiments he performed in Finland in
      the early 1990's. Podkletnov's reported 2% reduction in the mass
      of a test-sample was also not effected by obstacles in between his
      superconductor and the sample. This supports in general that idea
      that gravity cannot be shielded.<br>
      <br>
      Cook's claim that the beam is not effected by obstacles is perhaps
      the most important part of his observations -- if this is indeed
      supported by further testing, then it is possible that Cook has
      stumbled across an innovative method for creating directional
      beams of some type of force -- perhaps gravitational.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Shades of Marcus</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In many ways it is difficult to compare the claims of Jeff Cook to
      the sensationalism surrounding Marcus Hollingshead's device from
      the December 2002 timeframe, but there are several interesting
      comparisons.<br>
      <br>
      Firstly, I believe that Jeff's experience in the newsgroups
      teaches us something about tolerance and acceptance of new ideas,
      and secondly, both Marcus and Cook were thinking about similar
      design concepts while creating very different prototype designs.<br>
      <br>
      Jeff Cook began posting information about his experimental claims
      online in the newelectrogravity newsgroup in August 2003. While he
      had hoped for immediate interest in the device, the overwhelming
      response was negative from the newsgroup members. The primary
      rejection was simply in response to his photos, which didn't
      appear convincing enough for the newsgroup members, but secondly
      was the lack of evidence in addition to Cook's claims. Both of
      these issues may now not even exist, as Cook has released
      construction plans to the public to facilitate additional
      experimentation.<br>
      <br>
      Cook indicated to American Antigravity that his original designs
      had been based on the idea of a "rotational device" for affecting
      gravity. This would certainly fit with the concepts that not only
      Marcus examined for controlling gravity, but also have been
      considered by Li, Podkletnov, Searl, Hamel, Chiao, and many
      others.<br>
      <br>
      Cook's idea took a detour from the idea of rotation when he
      decided that he wanted to create a device that didn''t rotate for
      the sake of simplicity in construction. He said that the idea was
      to take the concept of rotating magnets and condense that into a
      solid-state device that was easy to build. After a few failed
      prototypes, he arrived through trial and error with the current
      design, which he believes embodies the concept of rotational
      fields into a device that doesn't require motion to generate an
      effect.<br>
