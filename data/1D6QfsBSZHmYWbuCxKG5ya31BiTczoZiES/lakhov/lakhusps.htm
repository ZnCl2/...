        <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">by Georges Lakhovsky</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since November 1923, I have
          published in various technical and radio publications, several
          papers in which I explained by theory that the instinct or
          special feeling, which permits birds to direct themselves in
          space, is only the results of the emission and reception of
          rays by living beings. While developing this theory, I
          explained how thoroughly I was convinced that science will
          discover, some day, not only the nature of microbes by the
          radiation which they produce, but also a method of killing
          disease bacilli within the human body by means of the proper
          radiations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The researches I have made
          by means of special apparatus have shown such results, that I
          believe my theory is correct. This theory is that life is born
          from radiations, kept going by radiation and suppressed by any
          accident producing the destruction of the oscillator
          equilibrium, especially by the radiations of certain microbes,
          which suppress those of weaker cells.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Before going any further in
          our reasoning, it is necessary, in order to present the facts
          to the uninitiated reader, to imagine what oscillations really
          are. The motion of a pendulum will be used for this
          explanation. When a pendulum is displaced from the position of
          equilibrium, it moves back and forth producing what are known
          as ochrone oscillations, until the energy stored is entirely
          exhausted. By means of a motor, a spring, or an electromagnet,
          it is possible to keep the motion to keep the motion of the
          pendulum of constant amplitude, producing undamped
          oscillations. If, on the contrary, the source of power is
          removed, the oscillations die down and it is necessary not
          only to reapply the power sustaining the oscillations, but
          also to furnish additional energy to start the pendulum in
          motion. This oscillation of a pendulum reproduces exactly what
          happens in the cells of a living being.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Body Composition</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Our organs are composed of
          celled formed of protoplasm containing mineral matters and
          acids such as iron, chloride, phosphorus, etc. It is by the
          combination of these elements that the cells detect outside
          waves and vibrate continuously at a very high frequency,
          probably higher than the period of x-rays or over all other
          vibrations known and measured today. The amplitude of cell
          oscillations must reach a certain value, in order that the
          organism be strong enough to repulse the destructive
          vibrations from certain microbes.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The astrophysicians are
          actually carrying out experiments of great interest on the
          existence of vibrations, which have been called penetration
          rays and of which the frequency is higher than that of x-rays
          and of the alpha, beta, and gamma rays of radium. Such rays,
          according to the theory, are produced by the earth itself and
          some others come from outside space. Some accurate
          measurements have proved the correctness of this theory.
          Therefore, it is quite permissible to believe that these
          penetration rays, or at least some of them, produce the
          vibratory motion of the living cells and consequently their
          life.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For instance, let us suppose
          a cell vibrates at a certain frequency and a microbe vibrates
          at a different frequency; the microbe begins to fight the
          cell, and sickness is started. If the cell cannot repel the
          stronger vibrations and if the amplitude of its own vibration
          decreases, the microbe gains and it vibrations in decreasing
          and stopping those of the cells, bring dangerous sickness or
          death. If, on the contrary, the living cell is started
          vibrating with the proper amplitude by inside or outside
          causes, the oscillatory attack is repulsed. Such is my theory.
          The problem is somewhat similar to the situation in which a
          rescuer finds himself when, coming to help a friend in a
          dangerous situation, finds himself fighting hand to hand
          against strong aggressors. The rescuer does not dare to fire
          his gun, fearing to harm his friend mixed up with the
          aggressors in the melee. Similarly, microbes and healthy cells
          are all exposed to electric or radioactive action, which could
          be used to destroy the unwanted rays and it is difficult to
          suppress them without harming or killing at the same time the
          cells which are to be treated. In fact, since Pasteur
          scientists have been constantly searching for means of
          destroying microbes. The great difficulty with all methods
          found was that in destroying , the bacillae cell was attacked
          too. The experience gained in cancer and tuberculosis treated
          with radium, or ultraviolet rays, shows how difficult is the
          work of the investigators.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A New Method</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The remedy in my opinion, is
          not to kill the microbes in contact with the healthy cells,
          but to reinforce the oscillations of the cell either directly
          by reinforcing the radio activity of the blood or in producing
          on the cells a direct action by means of the proper rays.
          During January 1924, I began to build, according to this
          theory, and with the purpose of therapeutic applications, an
          apparatus, which I have called Radio-Cellulo-Oscillator, with
          the firm belief that the cells vibrating at extremely short
          wavelengths would find their own in the Hertzian waves, which
          have the properties of producing extremely short harmonics.
          The cells with very weak vibrations, when placed in the field
          of multiple vibrations, finds its own frequency and starts
          again to oscillate normally through the phenomenon of
          resonance. This type of vibration produced by radio waves
          which I propose to use, is harmless, unlike those of x-rays
          and radium. Their application, therefore, does not present any
          danger for the operator.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I exposed in front of my
          apparatus, during long periods, a certain number of microbes
          in culture, which developed themselves normally. I, myself,
          have never felt the effect of these ultra radio frequencies,
          although I remained for a great many days near the apparatus,
          during the treatment applied to the living cells. It is only
          when two living beings such as a cell and a microbe are in
          contact, that the rays produced by the
          Radio-Cellulo-Oscillator have any direct effect upon cellular
          structure.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The experiments which I
          carried out a the Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, in the
          service and with the collaboration of Prof. Gosset, were made
          with plants inoculated with cancer, and the results were
          described in a paper presented on July 26, 1924, before the
          Biological Society. The text of the paper follows.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"One knows that it is
          possible to produce by inoculation of bacterium tumefaciens in
          plants tumors similar to those of cancer in animals. One of us
          obtained experimentally by this method, a great number of
          tumors. These had various degrees of development. Some of them
          dry up partially, but do not die entirely until the entire
          plant or at least the limb bearing the tumor dies. Even
          removed by surgical methods, these tumors grew again on the
          sick limb.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The
            Radio-Cellulo-Oscillator</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"We propose to described in
          this paper, the action of electromagnetic waves of very high
          frequency obtained by means of the Radio-Cellulo-Oscillator of
          Georges Lakhvosky. This apparatus produces wavelengths of the
          order of two meters and less, corresponding to 150 million
          cycles per second. A first plant was submitted to the effect
          of the radiation one month after being inoculated with cancer;
          at this time small tumors the size of a cherry stone were
          visible upon it. This plant was submitted to the rays twice,
          for three hours each time. During the following days, the
          tumors continued to grow rapidly in the same way as those on
          plants which had not been submitted to the effect of
          radiations. However, 16 days after the first treatment, the
          tumors began to shrink and dry up. A few days later the tumors
          were entirely dried up and could be very easily detached from
          the limb of the plant by merely touching them. The drying
          action of the radio frequency radiations is selective and
          affects only the sick part of the plant. Even the inside sick
          tissues were destroyed, although they were next to healthy
          cells in the center of the limb, showing that the radiations
          had not affected the healthy parts.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Length of Treatment</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another plant was treated in
          the same way, except that it was exposed 11 times, for three
          hours each time, to the radiations of the oscillator. Sixteen
          days after the first exposure the tumors, which were rather
          large as shown in one of the photographs, began to shrink and
          dry up and were easily detached form the limb exactly as in
          the first case. Again in this case, the healthy parts of the
          plant were not affected in the least. A third plant exposed to
          the radiations for 9 hours, that is, three treatments of three
          hours each, was cured in the same manner as the two others.
          Sixteen plants also inoculated with cancer, were left without
          treatment. They have tumors in full activity, several of which
          are very large. These experiments show conclusively that
          plants inoculated with cancer can be treated and cured by
          means of the ultra radio frequency vibrations, whereas
          surgical treatment fails.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">"In conclusion I wish to
          call the attention of the reader to the fact that I have
          obtained very conclusive results not only with a wavelength of
          two meters, but with longer and shorter wavelengths. The main
          thing is to produce the greatest number of harmonics
          possible."</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Such are the results of my
          researches with plants. At the present time, similar
          experiments are being carried out with animals and it seems
          that the effect on cancerous animals is the same as on
          cancerous plants.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I am highly pleased to
          present my theory and the results of my work in a scientific
          review of the United States, this great country, which has
          always been I the lead in this fight against this terrible
          sickness, cancer, and whose sympathy and help I would greatly
          appreciate.</font> </p>

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention relates
          generally to electric devices excited by electric impulses and
          more particularly to multiple wave length conducting and/or
          producing means. This invention has for its primary object the
          provision of such means disposed within a vacuum tube or a
          tube containing rare gas or gases.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">My work over a period of
          more than 20 years has led me to the belief that there is a
          great need for means conducting and/or producing multiple
          wavelengths which may be employed in many industrial and
          medical fields. Suitable apparatus for producing waves of
          various lengths is disclosed in my U.S. Letters Patent No.
          1,962,565, dated June 12, 1934. Embodiments of this apparatus
          have been in use the world over. Because of the need for
          simplification in such apparatus so that it may be handy and
          easily used by persons lacking skill in electrical matters, I
          have concluded that by providing one unit which incorporates
          oscillation generating means and another in which the wave
          lengths are produced, the apparatus may be more universally
          used in the treatment of cellular life in therapy, in the
          aging or treating of liquids and in other industrial fields.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention deals
          with those units, preferably combined with one another and
          constructed as a portable device and as stated above, has for
          its major object the provision of a unitary multiple
          wavelength producing and/or conducting device in the form of a
          vacuum tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The present invention
          further contemplates the incorporation in such a tube, of
          means for varying the effect of wave lengths, or selectively
          employing the means therefor enclosed in or forming part of
          said tube.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This invention further seeks
          to provide a tube of the indicated type incorporating means
          for generating oscillations.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Another object of the
          invention is to provide a single unit which contains an
          oscillation generator, which produces waves of definite
          frequency, and further inductance mans each permitting

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In that form of my invention
          shown in <b><a href="#fig1a">Figure 1</a></b>, there is
          provided a sealed preferably transparent envelope (10) made of
          glass or like material affixed in the usual manner to a screw
          or Edison plug (11). The latter is conventionally provided
          with a shell terminal (12) and a central terminal (13). The
          support of seal (14) of the tube serves to hold wires such as
          (15) and (16) which connect to the terminals (12) and (13).</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Connected to the wires (15)
          and (16) is a primary inductance member in the form of a loose
          coil (17) which may be disposed axially of the envelope (10),
          as shown. The upper end of said member (17) forms a tight
          wound coil (13) which serves to radiate the strongest induced
          wave lengths.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Surrounding the primary
          inductance member (17), there are arranged a plurality of
          separate coils of wire each being of different length and
          capacity. Thus, I provide a coil (19) having greatest capacity
          and successive coils (20), (21), (22), (23), (24) and (25),
          each having less capacity than the preceding coil. These coil
          (19) to (25) form secondary inductance means each permitting
          emanation of a wavelength of different magnitude and value
          than the other.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">I may support the secondary
          coil in several ways. As shown, I prefer to provide a
          dielectric member such as a glass sleeve (26) surrounding the
          primary inductance wire member (17) and to mount the secondary
          coils (19) to (25) on the outer surface of said sleeve,
          leaving the coil (18) exposed at the top thereof. In order to
          effectively support and centralize the glass sleeve (26), I
          provide spacing washers (27) and (28) of mica or the like, top
          and bottom, and provide a supporting cross-piece (29) on the
          lower portion of the wire (17).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The tube above described may
          be employed as indicated for the treatment of cellular
          structures by connecting it to any one of the rings in the
          electrostatic field of high frequency, such as shown in said
          US Letters Patent </font>, each of the coils (18) to (25)
        producing by induction a different wavelength, as can be
        understood. </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In the form of my invention
          shown in <b><a href="#fig2a">Figure 2</a></b>, the envelope
          (10a) is somewhat differently shaped, and the wire (17a)
          straight instead of arranged as an open coil. In other
          respects, the structure follows that described with reference
          to <b><a href="#fig1a">Figure 1</a></b>.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">As show in <b><a

          (36), (37), (38), (39) and (40) in frustro-conical form, for
          instance, with the largest of said rings at the top and the
          smallest one adjacent the bottom. I have shown said rings as
          supported, for instance, by glass posts (41) and (42), said
          posts being supported on the seal (14b), as by a band (43). I
          provide extensions for the terminal wires (15a) and (16a) and
          connect said extensions (44) and (45) to the upper ring (30)
          and the next lower ring (31), respectively.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The rings (30) and (31) may
          become the primary inductance members, whereas the remaining
          rings constitute the secondary inductance members as before
          set forth. Electric current conducted to the suitably spaced
          rings (30), (31) will cause a spark (48) to be drawn between
          the rings (30) and (31) providing oscillations emanating from
          electrical discharges there-between and causing the radiation
          of waves of various lengths within the envelope (10b) and
          affecting the remaining rings.</font> </p>

              1</a></b> and <b><a href="#fig2a">Figure 2</a></b>, I
          have shown the secondary coils as formed of wires having
          uniform cross-section. <b><a href="#fig4a">Figure 4</a></b>
          illustrates how such wires may be made progressively smaller
          in the succeeding coils (19c), (20c), and (21c), etc. In such
          various manners, the wavelength producing effect of the
          secondary coils or rings may be arrived at.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The secondary coils or rings

          the rings (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), or (f) with plug (11) of
          Figure 1, since either terminal (15), (16) is in contact with
          primary inductance member (17). To this end a conductor (not
          shown) connects such a ring with said plug or socket.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">In <b><a href="#fig8a">Figure




              8</a></b>, I have shown a modification of the invention
          which comprises a vacuum tube (50) containing a plate (51) and
          a plurality of different wave lengths producing grids (52),
          (53), and (54). I connect each grid with a variable capacity
          device, such as (55), (56), and (57) carried by said tube (50)
          and preferably by its base support (62), whereby the grids may
          be selectively connected into an operating circuit (not shown)
          by means of the respective prongs (58), (59), and (60), and
          the place prong (61). Heating or other exciting means may be
          incorporated in the tube in a well-known manner. This
          combination tube (50) is designed to replace a plurality of
          known tubes each operating with different and variable
          wavelength effect, more exterior manipulation at said base
          support brings about change of the capacities (55), (56), and

          incorporate a vibrator (62) which produces electrical
          oscillations by a spark intermittently generated between the
          end of the primary inductance member (17d) and vibrator
          armature (64). In other respects the structure follows that of

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It may be noted that any

      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Abstract --- </b>The
          Lakhovsky Multiple wave oscillator (MWO) has been used to
          treat various disease conditions. The device emits
          electromagnetic radiations which are directed at a subject
          requiring treatment. It has been shown that the human body is
          sensitive to electromagnetic radiation and may be healed or
          harmed upon exposure to them. It was therefore determined that
          a spectral analysis of the frequency content of the emanations
          from a Multiple Wave Oscillator would be of interest and was
          thus performed.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Background</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Russian-born Georges
          Lakhovsky began an investigation into the field of electronic
          medicine in the 1920s. His book, "The Secret of Life", was
          published in English in 1939. In 1949 Mark Clement published a
          reviews of Lakhovsky's work called "Waves That Heal". An
          excellent review of the literature, studies, experimentation,
          and plans for construction of an MWO has been published by
          Borderland Sciences Research Foundation (BSRF).</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The frequency spectrum of
          the MWO has been measured previously. He BSRF publication
          quotes Clements as stating the oscillator gave "wavelengths
          from 10 cm to 400 meters".</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Since 9(MHz) = meters / 300,</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The frequency range would
          run from 750 KHz to 3 GHz. Bob beck in the same publication
          reported a bandpass of 15 to 250 MHz. The MWO used in the
          present study did not, however, interfere with radio or tv
          reception as previously reported, and has been used in the
          same room as a television receiver without any interference.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The amplitude versus
          frequency content of the MWO is an important consideration
          given in the table of effects by Kleinstein and Dyner as
          presented in Kaines, "Electromagnetic Field Interactions with
          the Human Body". If some frequencies of electromagnetic
          radiation produce deleterious effects and some frequencies
          promote healing then analysis of the frequency content of the
          MWO should give clues to its successful usage.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MWO Theory of Operation</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The MWO is a high voltage
          transformer. The traditional methods and the one used during
          this research consists of 12 volt DC power supply amplified
          and set into oscillation with a Model T Ford spark plug
          operating at about 400 Hz. The Ford coil is a high voltage
          transformer with a relay in series with the primary. As soon
          as the 12 VDC is applied to the primary, a magnetic field is
          generated in the core pulling in the relay and interrupting
          power. The result is a series of high voltage spikes at the
          output of the transformer. The high voltage spikes are fed
          into a Tesla coil. Tuning is accomplished by varying the
          tension in the Ford coil relay and by adjusting the spark gap
          in the Tesla coil circuit. Local atmospheric conditions,
          primarily humidity temperature, affect the operation of the
          circuit and retuning is sometimes required.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The spark gap si a study in
          itself. An adjustable spark gap was developed which is
          suitable both for the MWO and the Tesla coil enthusiasts. The
          dynamics of spark gaps and sustained arcing are delineated in
          the book, "The Electric Arc".</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MWO Technical Description</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The inductance of the Tesla
          coil in the MWO tested was measured with an Electro Scientific
          Industries Impedance Meter, Model No. 253 and was found to
          have a primary inductance of 14.6 uH and a secondary
          inductance of 3.1 mH. Exciting the primary with a sine wave
          from an Exact electronics model 504 function generator, and
          measuring the output with the Tektronikx Model 7313 storage
          scope and Heathkit Model IM 4100 frequency counter, the
          maximum output was found at 200 KHz.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Antenna Design</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The antennas used for MWO
          operation were fabricated using guidelines established in the
          BSRF publication. The concentric rings were etched from a
          copper clad board using standard photo resist methods. Several
          sets of antennas were made in order to delineate the optimum
          spacing between rings. The antennas which gave the best arcing
          pattern when used with each of the six MWOs were chosen for
          use during the Spectral analysis.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The second antenna used
          during experimentation was based on the geometry of a mandala
          known as a flat pyramid. The visual effects and the amount of
          sparking were significantly enhanced.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Transistorized MWOs</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Many methods of generating
          the high voltages required by the MWO may be devised. The
          Tesla coil kit sold by BNF Enterprises generates sufficient
          voltage but the frequency of operation is too high. A
          frequency of 55 KHz with a power consumption of 1 amp is
          generated when not arcing and in an idle mode. When an arc is
          drawn, the frequency lowers to a minimum of 250 KHz at an arc
          length of one inch, while the power supply current increases
          to 3 amps. The high voltage and frequency generated does not
          match the MWO Tesla coil and cannot be used to replace the
          Ford coil in the MWOs used in this study. If the output of
          this circuit is hooked directly to an antenna, there is
          sufficient voltage to produce arcing but the copper etching is
          burned off the antenna at arcing points due to the high
          frequency generated by the BNF circuit.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">A more viable solution to
          transistorized operation is in the following circuit. This
          will allow tuning the output frequency and the power level. It
          may even be feasible to build an MWO without having to hand
          wind the Tesla coil as described in the BSRF publication.</font>

      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The Frequency Analysis</font></b>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The electromagnetic
          radiations of the MWO were tested using computer controlled
          EMI-RFI equipment. The equipment used was as follows:</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">(1) Singer Stoddart Model

          Antenna 25-100 MHz</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Field strength was tested at
          1 meter.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The results of the tests
          from 16 KHz to 10 GHz are shown in the accompanying computer
          printouts.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The signal strength at 14
          KHz was around 140 dB. At 25 MHz the signal had dropped to
          approximately 120 bB. A subject sitting between the pates
          would be exposed to a signal level about 10 times stronger
          than a local broadcast station a this frequency. Five runs of
          data were printed on top of each other. The plot shows that
          the MWO has a constant output. This was shown to be true over
          the entire measured spectrum.</font> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The next run from 25 MHz to
          200 MHz was conducted using two different antennas. The
          pyramid antenna was used along with an improved circular
          antenna with close ring spacing. The closer spacing on this
          antenna produces more arcs of a greater diameter. There was no
          significant difference in output between the two antennas.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The hypothesis that the
          radiated energy was coming from within the MWO due to the
          spark gap was tested. Removing the antenna produced no
          noticeable change and was measured without an antenna attached
          to the MWO. The run from 1 GHz to 10 GHz was made with and
          without antenna. Again no difference in output was noted. The
          data beyond 7 GHz was determined to be faulty, requiring
          modification of the program parameters.</font> </p>
      <p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Conclusion</font></b> </p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">At a later date an analysis
          will be made from 20 Hz to 14 KHz and from 10 GHz to 20 GHz.
          The significance of the data recorded at this time can be seen
          not only in its constant high output of a large range in
          frequencies, but also in the radiated output without antennas.
          It may well be that the beneficial effects of MWO usage for
          various disease conditions is not due to radiation in the
          electromagnetic spectrum. The electric discharge of the spark
          gap may generate non-hertzian waves. Tom Bearden has suggested
          this possibility in describing Tesla's Colorado Springs
          experiments, and Preston Nichols described this possibility in
          his description of Marconi's trans-Atlantic broadcasts.
          Although the reference has not been verified at this time, it
          is suggested that Tesla considered his longevity and health to
          be due to frequent exposure to high voltage, high frequency
          electric discharges. This in effect can be duplicated by use
          of the Lakhovsky Multiple Wave Oscillator.</font> </p>
