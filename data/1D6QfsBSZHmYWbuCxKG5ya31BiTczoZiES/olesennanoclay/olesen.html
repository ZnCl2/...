      Water is a scarce resource that many of us take for granted, but
      unfortunately large parts of Earth’s population do not have that
      luxury. Ole and his innovation team have tried to solve an
      enormous task: to turn sand into soil. Even more exciting – they
      believe they have solved the problem! Listen to Ole talk us
      through the concept behind turning deserts and sand dunes green.
      How their technology could change the face of the planet, and
      solve parts of the global environmental problem. Presenting the
      game-changing concept at TEDxArendal, he will show you the
      fascinating images of the green lush results! Ole Morten has an
      extensive background in R&amp;D and is focused on "Desert Control"
      since the companys inception. He has been instrumental in
      developing and testing Liquid nano clay, which is a tool for
      turning sand into soil. This talk was given at a TEDx event using
      the TED conference format but independently organized by a local

      Line in the sand: New technology could transform poor-quality
      sandy soils into high-yield agricultural land.<br>
      <br>
      Through a combination of climate change, drought, overgrazing and
      other human activities, desertification across the world is on the
      march. It’s a process defined by the UN as “land degradation in
      arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions”. Given that around 40
      per cent of the Earth’s land surface is occupied by drylands –
      home to around two billion people – the potential for
      desertification to impact the planet is huge. A recent report from
      the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative claimed that it’s a
      problem costing the world as much as US$10.6tn every year –
      approximately 17 per cent of global gross domestic product.<br>
      <br>
      The refugee crisis in Europe has highlighted the difficulties that
      arise when large numbers of people migrate. However, the numbers
      arriving from countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Eritrea pale in
      comparison to those that could be forced into exile by changing
      climate conditions. According to the UN’s Convention to Combat
      Desertification (UNCCD), the process could displace as many as 50
      million people over the next decade.<br>
      <br>
      But one Norwegian start-up is developing a technology to wage a
      frontline battle with desertification. Desert Control is a
      Norwegian company set up by Kristian and Ole Morten Olesen,
      alongside chief operating officer Andreas Julseth. It was recently
      awarded first prize at ClimateLaunchpad, a clean-tech business
      competition that attracted more than 700 entries from 28 countries
      across Europe. The product that earned Desert Control top honours
      was Liquid NanoClay, a mixture of water and clay that is mixed in
      a patented process and used to transform sandy desert soils into
      fertile ground.<br>
      <br>
      “The mixing process splits the clay particles into individual
      flakes and adds air bubbles on both sides of the flakes,” Ole
      Morten Olesen, CEO of Desert Control, told The Engineer. “The mix
      is then spread over the land and allowed to saturate down to root
      level – about 40-60cm deep. This requires around 40 litres of
      water and 1kg of clay per square metre.”<br>
      <br>
      Olesen explained that his father Kristian, Desert Control’s chief
      technical officer, has been working on the process behind Liquid
      NanoClay since 2008. The treatment gives sand particles a
      nanostructured clay coating, completely changing their physical
      properties and allowing them to bind water. The process, which
      does not involve any chemical agents, can change poor-quality
      sandy soils into high-yield agricultural land.<br>
      <br>
      According to Desert Control, virgin desert soils treated with
      Liquid NanoClay produced a yield four times greater than untreated
      land, using the same amount of seeds and fertiliser, and less than
      half the amount of water. It found that Liquid NanoClay acts as a
      catalyst for Mycorrhizal fungi when nourishment is available, with
      the fungi responsible for the increased yield.<br>
      <br>
      Clay is a fundamental component of productive arable land, acting
      as a water-holder, providing elasticity, and allowing non-clay
      elements to bind to the soil. In the past, adding clay to dry land
      in order to improve its agricultural value has involved tilling
      clay into the soil. This requires large volumes of clay and
      substantial amounts of manual labour. The process of transforming
      sandy soil into fertile land can take between seven and 15 years.
      By comparison, Liquid NanoClay takes just seven hours to saturate
      into the land.<br>
      <br>
      The water and clay is mixed on site using the patented process,
      then traditional irrigation systems such as sprinklers or water
      wagons are used to spread it across the sandy soil. The individual
      clay flakes bind to the surface of the sand particles with a Van
      der Waals binding, significantly increasing the ability of the
      soil to hold water and nutrients.<br>
      <br>
      The cost of treatment per hectare is US$4,800, and requires a
      15-20 per cent retreatment after four or five years if the land is
      tilled. If the soil is untilled, the treatment lasts for longer.
      Converting a piece of desert the size of a rugby pitch into
      fertile land for this cost seems like a pretty good deal.<br>
      <br>
      “In just seven hours the soil is totally transformed,” said Ole
      Morten. “We use existing irrigation systems to apply the Liquid
      NanoClay, removing the need to till the land and use much greater
      volumes of water.”<br>
      <br>
      The performance data for Liquid NanoClay is based on field tests
      that were conducted at the Agricultural Research Centre (ARC) in
      Ismailia in Egypt. White pepper was planted in test fields
      containing dry sandy soil. Fields treated with Liquid NanoClay
      gave an additional two months of harvest, compared to the fields
      that were untreated.<br>
      <br>
      Following the initial harvest, the plants were then left without
      irrigation over winter and spring, when new plants were due to be
      sown. However, the original crops were found to be in such good
      condition that they could be used for another season.<br>
      <br>
      “When we returned the following season, we were surprised that the
      pepper plants were looking so healthy,” said Ole Morten. “We had
      expected to have to replant, as they had been left over winter and
      spring without irrigation. But the old plants were in good enough
      shape that we could use them again in the next season.”<br>
      <br>
      Unsurprisingly, some of the most vulnerable areas to
      desertification are in north and central Africa, around the edges
      of the Sahara. Other regions under threat include large parts of
      China and Mongolia, as the Gobi encroaches into the eastern parts
      of the Eurasian Steppe and the farmland it supports, as well as
      several regions in Australia.<br>
      <br>
      When pitching Desert Control at ClimateLaunchpad, chief operating
      officer Andreas Julseth also focused in on the particular business
      opportunity available in Central Valley, California. Making up
      around 14 per cent of California’s total land area, the valley is
      one of the world’s most productive agricultural regions. However,
      since 2011, the state has been in the grip of one of the worst
      droughts on record.<br>
      <br>
      “In 2014, the agricultural sector in Central Valley lost 165,000
      hectares to fallowing,” Julseth recently told the ClimateLaunchpad
      audience. “Fallowing means they ploughed the land but didn’t sow
      any seeds, because there simply wasn’t enough water available to
      sustain the land. They estimate this had a US$2.2bn impact on the
      agricultural industry.”<br>
      <br>
      In the desperate search for water, farmers in California have been
      digging ever deeper, employing oil-drilling equipment to reach the
      disappearing aquifers. Not only is this expensive, it is
      eradicating an ancient natural resource in a classic tragedy of
      the commons. Acting out of rational self-interest, the farmers are
      draining a communal water resource dry. Julseth believes Liquid
      NanoClay can help avert the impending tragedy.<br>
      <br>
      “I believe that farmers will flock to us as soon as they see that
      they can reduce their dependency on water by at least 50 per
      cent,” he said. “Put it this way – if they were using our product,
      the present drought would no longer be a problem. I also believe
      that land developers will use the opportunity to buy dry land,
      have us treat it, and then be able to sell it for eight to 10
      times the purchasing price. Because that’s the reality now – dry
      land goes for one-tenth what fertile land goes for.”<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “I believe that farmers will flock to us as
      soon as they see that they can reduce their dependency on water by
      at least 50 per cent. If they were using our product, the present
      Californian drought would no longer be a problem" -- Andreas
      Julseth, Desert Control<br>
      <br>
      If Desert Control can successfully get Liquid NanoClay to market,
      the potential of the technology is enormous, with implications for
      fragile environments around the globe and the populations that
      inhabit them. Along with the testing that took place in Egypt,
      additional third-party verification is taking place at the Faculty
      of Natural Sciences at Imperial College London.<br>

          ClimateLaunchpad</b><br>

      <br>
      Aug 22, 2016 - About 900 tons of clay per hectare were required to
      have positive results. The labor required was enormous. Still,
      researchers had extremely positive results in terms of crop yield
      after adding 90-100 kilos of clay to every square meter.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Clay holds the key</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The founders of Desert Control had spent three years in Egypt and
      Kuwait testing a product to enhance the reflection of sunlight
      from the surface of the desert sand. The results were excellent,
      but short-lived, making further development unfeasible.<br>
      <br>
      While there, Kristian P. Olesen, an expert in fluid dynamics, had
      become intrigued by the concept of enhancing sandy soil. He’d been
      infected with the same curiosity and desire for a solution as had
      the scientists and engineers who lived in the region. He wanted to
      address the problem of desertification.<br>
      <br>
      Like many before him, he thought the solution must be clay.<br>
      <br>
      He developed and patented a mechanical process for disintegrating
      individual clay flakes into water. This mixture could be irrigated
      into dry sandy soil.<br>
      <br>
      Kristian’s son, Ole traveled to Egypt in the middle of January
      2006 to discuss a simple test with Dr. Islam Wassif of Egypt’s
      Desert Research Center.<br>
      <br>
      Dr. Wassif was furious and happy all at once when he realized what
      the Desert Control team had accomplished. How could two
      hillbillies from Norway find a solution to something that had
      eluded his team for decades? At the same time, he was hopeful
      about what this development could mean for Egypt’s future.<br>
      <br>
      The first tests made examined the mixture’s ability to slow and
      even halt the movement of sand. The thin treated layer stopped
      sand from moving in wind velocities of up to 27 meters per second.
      This was later tested with Dr. Wang Tao at the Cold and Arid
      Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute Chinese
      Academy of Sciences in Lanzhou, China.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Saving water</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The research institutes in Egypt had done a lot of different work
      to enhance the growth potential of dry sandy soil. Research using
      clay had been done for at least 15-20 years. The expense and the
      amount of clay used made the project prohibitive.<br>
      <br>
      About 900 tons of clay per hectare were required to have positive
      results. The labor required was enormous.<br>
      <br>
      Still, researchers had extremely positive results in terms of crop
      yield after adding 90-100 kilos of clay to every square meter.<br>
      <br>
      When the Desert Control team explained how their liquid NanoClay
      could be irrigated into the soils without any mechanical work,
      there was great enthusiasm. If only 10% of the water needed for
      irrigation could be saved, a statue of the ambassador would be
      built, Egypt’s Minister of Agriculture Land and Reclamation Amin
      Abaza told Norway’s ambassador.<br>
      <br>
      <b>“We know you’re cheating”</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Desert Control team was brought in to prove the technology on
      an unused plot. The results were so positive that the scientific
      team monitoring the experiment refused to sign off on them. The
      test plot treated with Desert Control’s Liquid NanoClay
      demonstrated a 416% higher yield than untreated plots.<br>
      <br>
      “We know you’re cheating,” the Desert Control team was told. The
      results seemed scientifically impossible. Another test was
      ordered, this one observed by a whole team of scientists and
      overseen by Dr. Ahmed Yousry Kerdany. The results were repeated
      and the test was confirmed, Ole Olesen told ClimateLaunchpad.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We had the same results as good American farm
      soil, in the Sinai. We ourselves didn’t even know what was causing
      such great results.”<br>
      <br>
      In 2006, Dr. Wassif saw something surprising in the Liquid
      Nanoclay. A fungus had begun to grow in the sand treated with
      Nanoclay. Dr. Wassif knew its presence made the land more
      productive, but he didn’t know what it was.<br>
      <br>
      In 2014, the team figured out the secret to the high yields. It
      wasn’t just that the mixture retained water and nutrients: it was
      that the mixture of clay and cow manure they used became a
      catalyst for a particular type of fungus: mycorrhizal fungi.<br>
      <br>
      According to biologist Douglas H. Chadwick, writing in Mother
      Earth News, “Mycorrhizae, not plant roots, are the principal
      structures for most nutrient uptake in the plant kingdom.”
      Chadwick explains:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The outer walls of hyphae contain gluey
      compounds that cause fine particles of earth to clump together on
      and around the threads. This process is a major factor in building
      soil structure and making the ground less vulnerable to erosion.
      Mycelial networks also play a valuable role in sequestering carbon
      within microclusters of filaments. They limit their partner
      plants’ exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, zinc and cadmium,
      by keeping those elements bound to the hyphae’s sticky sheath. At
      high latitudes and high altitudes, mycorrhizal fungi scrounge
      nutrients from cold, rocky soils. In boggy regions, the hyphae
      buffer plant partners from the high acid content of peaty soils.
      In saline ground, the hyphae help safeguard their partners from
      high salt concentrations. Mycorrhizae can also protect plants from
      pests and diseases.”<br>
      <br>
      Ole Olesen explained,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The fungus existed in the cow manure we used.
      It was also in the ground. The clay created the right environment
      for the fungus to flourish.”<br>
      <br>
      He continued:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Imagine trying to grow anything in glass
      beads. That is what sand is like. Water and nutrients flush right
      through. Wrap the beads in something like newspaper and the water
      and nutrients remain. That’s what the fungus does to the sand. It
      creates a great environment for growth.”<br>
      <br>
      The possibilities are truly groundbreaking<br>
      <br>
      Liquid Nano Clay is a truly exciting technology that could
      actually reverse desertification and revolutionize agriculture.
      Ole Olesen tells ClimateLaunchpad, “We consider the Gobi good
      farmland.”<br>
      <br>
      In addition,the&nbsp; surface temperature of plant-covered land is
      significantly cooler than that of bare sandy land. The Desert
      Control report states:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Converting bare sandy soils to green plant
      covered land lowers the surface temperature around 15°C. This has
      a cooling effect of 320 – 360 MW/km2. Changing desert to the green
      land also reduces CO2 emissions by between 15 – 25 tons/hectare.”<br>
      <br>
      The Desert Control team imagines growing energy (bio-fuels),
      reducing water usage for agriculture (the mixture retains water
      effectively), and even for usage in areas without enough
      freshwater.<br>
      Where are they now?<br>
      <br>
      Political upheaval got in the way of a full-scale implementation
      in Egypt. Desert Control is still working on its product, looking
      for two more large-scale verifications of the technology. We
      expect to hear more news from them soon as the results of tests
      come in.<br>

      [0001] The present invention relates to an inorganic binder
      composition which displays static electric charge, more precisely
      a homogenised dispersion of clay particle consisting substantially
      of single flakes of clay and air bubbles dispersed in a fluid. The
      present invention also relates to a method for the preparation of
      said binder composition as well as use of the binder composition
      as a texture stabilising element in an organic or inorganic
      particle composition, such as soil and sand. The invention also
      relates use of the binder composition as a filtering mass for the
      purification of, for instance, air or water.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] The main causes of desertification are wind erosion and the
      advancement of sand dunes. It is known from land areas exposed to
      strong drought that the earth surface is easily exposed to wind
      erosion when a protecting, unifying vegetation cover is removed by
      overgrazing, traffic flow and so forth. The mineral soil
      particles, substantially consisting of sand, lack the ability to
      remain closely connected and sand transport may arise. This may
      also arise under relatively humid conditions, for example in sand
      dune formations, where the sand's reduced ability to transport
      humidity from the underground by capaillary action leads to local
      drying in the surface with subsequent lack of opportunity for
      vegetation with shallow root system to establish growth. Both the
      lacking ability of the mineral soil to maintain a stable unifying
      structure as well as the sand soils lacking ability to bind
      humidity from underground reservoirs are major obstacles with
      relation to for example maintainance and increase of food
      production ability in drought exposed areas.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] It is generally recognized that when soil particles are
      entirely unattached to each other the soil is known as
      structureless or as a single grained structure such as the case of
      sand dunes. When, on the other hand, the primary soil particles
      under favourable circumstances tend to group themselves and
      associate into small units or aggregates, the soil is termed
      aggregated. It has been shown, in the studies of sandy soil, that
      about 99.5% of the original particles are of a diameter of less
      than 0.5 mm, i.e. constitute wind erodible particles. It is also
      evident that the percentage of dry aggregates &gt;0.8 mm is less
      than 0.2% of the soil matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] It is also known that the formation and maintainance of
      stable aggregates is an essential feature which is highly
      desirable, due to the fact that it ensures the most favourable
      conditions for tilth, cultivation, plant growth and conservation
      of soil against degrading factors.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] An organic binding agent is generally known which is
      intended for addition to the uppermost layer of mineral soil, in
      order to thereby stabilize the structure, increase the ability for
      capillary transport of water as well as increase the binding of
      water on the soil particles. The disadvantages of this binding
      agent is that the organic material is rapidly decomposed by the
      bacterial cultures living in the mineral soil in those parts of
      the world where this binding agent has its major use.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The dry mixing of clay into sandy soils have been
      researched and used up till 1987 when it was a fact that it was a
      much too expensive treatment even with just positive practical
      results.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Generally known is also the fact that clay has an extensive
      ability to bind water and to establish coherent structures in dry
      condition. Dry clay soil is hard to crumble, and dry clay forms
      hard, durable structures, used for instance in sun dried building
      blocks. Clay has already been used in an effort to combat
      desertification and to increase the fertility of the soil. Clay
      has a twofold function when applied to the soil. It enhances water
      retention, reduces the wash-out of fertilizers and rehabilitates
      the soil with regard to ion exchange. Secondly, it provides
      growing plants with nutrients. The previous use of clay for this
      purpose has been the use of dry clay for mixing with the soil.
      Substantial amounts of clay were required and the mixing required
      a considerable amount of mechanical work. The problems so far has
      thus been price and availability.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] The object of the invention is to propose a new and
      improved solution to the problems outlined above whereby sandy
      deserts may be reclaimed and desertification may be prevented with
      higher efficiency, with less clay and less mechanical work and
      thereby at reduced costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The object is achieved by the features disclosed below in
      the specification and in the following claims.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is generally known that flakes of clay, which are the
      mechanical single units in clay, are negatively electrically
      charged and has a strong ability to bind, inter alia, water to the
      surface thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The invention substantially relates to a negatively charged
      binder composition consisting of homogenised, negatively charges
      flakes of clay for the binding of positively charged particles in
      order to increase the adsorption and the absorption capability of
      for instance water, impurities in water and undesirable substances
      in or on a target object when the binder composition is added to
      the target object. The binder composition may be added to the
      target object for instance in an aqueous solution. The positively
      charged particles may for instance be water molecules.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The clay particles may be provided in any form obtained by
      a homogenisation process which divides the clay into single flakes
      or particles consisting of a few coherent flakes of clay dispersed
      in a liquid, for instance water, whereafter the flakes of clay,
      after an application process, covers the surface of particles. The
      clay flakes have a surface diameter of from about 25 to 2000 nm,
      and a thickness from about 1 to 10 nm, adjusted to the particle
      structure of the target object. In order to increase the stability
      in the homogenised dispersion of clay flakes air may suitably be
      added in the form of microscopic bubbles which will give a weak
      cation bonding to the clay flakes. The result is that the mixture
      is stable until it comes into contact with cations of higher
      electrical charge/potential/valence. A single flake of clay in
      water will thus in reality consist of the solid particle and a
      cloud of air ions which neutralise the particle, surrounds it and
      is bonded by the charge of the solid particle.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The binder composition is applied, for instance on soil, by
      ordinary watering techniques in such an amount that the soil is
      moist down to the relevant root depth or to the depth required for
      stopping wind erosion.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] The binder according to the invention has the desirable
      property that it hardens by drying and by heating combined with
      drying.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] The application of the binder on soil particles result in
      an increased ability to attract and transport humidity with the
      aid of the clay particles humidity binding capacity, caused by the
      negative polarity, as well as the increased capillary transport
      ability, caused by the microscopic voids between the clay flakes.
      This increases the ability of plants to grow in the soil. This
      results in a better food access and increased absorption of carbon
      dioxide. The increased growth of plants also further the Albedo
      value of the soil, which means that the reflection of incident
      radiation is increased and that the temperature of the earth
      surface is reduced. (The Albedo or solar reflectance is a measure
      of a material's ability to reflect sunlight (including the
      visible, infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths) on a scale of 0 to
      1. An Albedo value of 0,0 indicates that the surface absorbs all
      solar radiation and a 1,0 Albedo value represents total
      reflectivity.) Measurements have shown that in desert
      surroundings, with an air temperature of 32° C. and sea
      temperature of 28° C., the temperature measured over a sand
      surface was 51° C. which transformed to 34° C. over an area
      covered with grass. The ground surface temperature reduction
      achieved by greening was thus in the range of 17° C.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] The dehydration makes the treated surface of the soil hard,
      which means that the surface to a greater extent will endure the
      load of traffic, wind and so forth without loosening of single
      particles, which causes the structure to collapse, the roots of
      plants to be destroyed and the soil, for example humus particles
      and other nutrient particles, to be carried away by the wind.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] With the supply of water in the form of rainfall,
      irrigation or a change in the balance between evaporation and
      capillary transport of humidity from the underground, the soil is
      structure again softens.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] In one embodiment of the present invention the binder
      composition may be mixed with a plant nutrient dissolved, or
      dispersed, in liquid before application on the soil, in order to
      increase the growth of plants.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] The binder composition according to the invention may be
      applied by homogenising the mixture in water and thereafter
      applying this on the soil to be treated.<br>
      <br>
      [0020] The soil particles may for instance be sand particles,
      humus particles, coarse plant remains, carbon particles and so
      forth, which in mixture or each on its own constitute a
      substantial part of the soil and which preferably should be bonded
      together so that no movement is taking place under normal stress
      levels applied on said particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In a first embodiment the invention relates to a binder
      composition for use as a structure stabilizing element in masses
      of organic and/or inorganic particles, comprising a homogenised
      mixture of clay, whereby the clay particles principally are
      separated into single flakes of clay.<br>
      <br>
      [0022] The binder composition preferably comprises air micro
      bubbles bonded to a considerable part of the clay flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] The binder composition is preferably a liquid based
      dispersion, preferably based on water.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The binder composition preferably comprises at least one
      plant nutrient.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The binder composition preferably comprises one or more
      dispersion agents.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] Another feature of the invention relates to a method for
      the preparation of a binder composition, whereby the method
      comprises the steps of homogenising a dispersion of clay and a
      liquid in a homogenisation device in order to make a dispersion of
      clay flakes and to introduce a clay flake dispersion and to
      introduce gas micro bubbles in the dispersion of clay flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The gas micro bubbles are preferably added during the
      dispersion process. The gas is micro bubbles are preferably air
      micro bubbles.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The dispersion of the clay flakes is preferably put into a
      substantially laminar flow, for thereafter to be put into a
      turbulent flow caused by a substantial change of direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Alternatively, the clay flakes are put into a substantially
      laminar flow movement, thereafter they are put into a turbulent
      flow movement caused by a substantial change of direction,
      whereafter the flakes again are put into a substantially laminar
      flow for thereafter again to be put into a turbulent flow caused
      by a substantial change of direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The change of direction is preferably in the range 45-135
      degrees.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The method according to the invention preferably also
      comprises the step of introducing at least one dispersant to the
      dispersion of clay flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The method further comprises the preferable step of adding
      at least one plant nutrient to the dispersion of the clay flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] A further embodiment of the present invention relates to
      the use of a clay flake dispersion according to the invention as a
      water- and particle binding agent and a capillary transport
      enhancing agent for a soil mass as well as a plant protection
      agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] The treated layer of sand particles have the ability to
      filter out unwanted positively charged impurities, for example
      salt in seawater, cleaning contaminated water.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] The filter mass will typically consist of a particle
      structure which is pretreated with the clay flake dispersion in
      such a way that the particles are covered with clay flakes as done
      for stopping wind erosion in sandy deserts. This method uses
      approximately 13% of the amount of clay used in the old dry mixing
      method and achieves the same benefits together with an immediate
      binding of the sand particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The process for the preparation of the binder composition
      according to the invention may be carried out in any suitable
      device.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The present invention also relates to the use of the above
      binder composition as a filtering mass.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] In this embodiment of the invention the binder composition
      is used to increase the adsorption- and absorption ability of for
      instance water, impurities in water and unwanted substances in or
      on a target object when the binder composition is brought into
      contact with the target object.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] When the binder composition is used to remove unwanted
      substances from a target object this is done by filtration of a
      fluid containing the unwanted substances through the binder
      composition which is prepared with the wanted structure in such a
      way that the unwanted substances are retained in the binder
      composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] A preferred embodiment of this aspect of the invention
      relates to use of the clay flake dispersion as disclosed above for
      the preparation of a filter mass for purification of water and
      air, including desalination of sea water. The filter mass may
      typically consist of a particle structure which is pretreated with
      the clay flake dispersion in such a way that the particles are
      covered by clay flakes.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] In practice the desalination of sea water may be carried
      out of preparing a layer of sand on a mesh, this is treated with
      the clay dispersion and when the layer is filled with salt
      remains, this can be flushed into the ocean or the salt can be
      used for other purposes.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] Below a non-limiting example of a preferred embodiment will
      be described, which is shown in the enclosed figures, wherein<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0043] FIG. 1 shows an example of a non-swelling clay particle

      <br>
      [0048] FIG. 1 shows an example of a clay particle of a
      non-swelling clay type. The transverse dimension is about 1 μm. A
      particle may contain up to 1200 flakes. Examples of non-swelling
      clays are kaolin and illite.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] In FIG. 2 the numeral 2-A shows a part of a particle stack
      of a swelling synthetic clay of laponite type before
      hydratisation. A hydratisation process I results in the swelling
      of the clay particle stack, shown in magnification in 2-B. A
      separation II of the hydrated clay particle stack 2-B provides
      individual clay flakes 2-C, here shown in increased magnification.
      The metal ion bonding to the surface of the clay flake is
      illustrated by the sodium ion Na(+), whereas the osmotic pressure
      leads to a weakening of the metal ion bonding. A magnified section
      2-D schematically shows the molecular structure in the clay
      particle and at its surfaces.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Laponite is an example of a triochtahedral smectite.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] Non-swelling clay can not be separated be hydratisation
      solely. When the clay particles are exposed to considerable
      mechanical stress, for instance considerable shear forces by
      turbulent flow in accordance with the inventive method for
      homogenisation of a clay flake dispersion, or by using a suitable
      homogenisation device, a stack of non-swelling clay flakes may be
      separated. It is obvious that also swelling clay flakes may be
      separated in this manner.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] FIG. 3 shows typical clay flake structures when a
      non-swelling clay is mixed with water. The water is not capable of
      penetrating in between the single flakes and the stacks will
      remain intact. Different structures may be formed by the single
      flakes of non-swelling type when these are mixed with water.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] FIG. 4 shows different clay flake structures which are
      formed when clay flakes are dispersed in water. The structures are
      surrounded by a cloud of ions. Typical flake structures formed by
      swelling clay are: (a) edge against edge (chain structure), (b)
      surface against edge (house of cards) and (c) surface against
      surface (as a deck of cards).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] FIG. 5 shows a section through a single grain of sand
      surrounded, according to the invention, by single flakes of clay
      with a thickness of 1 nm and a transverse dimension of 25-400 nm.
      When the grain of sand has a diameter of 0.1 mm between 1000 and
      13000 flakes are required to cover the circumference with flakes
      of clay of the given magnitude. In order to cover the whole
      surface of the grain of sand about 50.000.000 flakes of a
      transverse dimension of 25 nm, about 3.000.000 flakes with a
      transverse dimension of 100 nm and about 200.000 flakes with a
      transverse dimension of 400 nm are needed.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] A binder composition according to the invention is provided
      by treating a dispersion of clay and water in a mechanical
      homogenisation device with a very high turbulence index, for
      example the one described above, for thereby to split the normally
      smallest components of the clay into single flakes. In order to
      keep the mixture stable air is also supplied to the dispersion, so
      that micro bubbles of air bind to the single flakes of clay, and
      neutralise the negative polarity of the clay flakes. The air
      bubbles increase the stability of the mixture and thereby prevent
      sedimentation. Sedimentation may also be prevented when the
      dispersion after homogenisation is kept in motion with the aid of
      for instance a rotation device.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] Said micro bubbles have a diameter of from about 1 nm to
      about 20 μm.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In an alternative embodiment of the binder composition one
      or more additives are added, for example plant nutrients, in
      dispersion or solution. Added in dispersion form, the particle
      diameter must be less than 20 μm in order for the substance to be
      able to be watered down in the sand together with the rest of the
      mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In a further embodiment of the binder composition a
      dispersion agent is added in order to keep the binder composition
      homogeneous for a sufficient time. Without any salt present, the
      air bubbles stabilize the mixture for 2-4 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Application of the binder composition on the particle mass
      to be treated may for instance be accomplished by spraying,
      flooding or by sinking in the particle mass. The particle mass may
      be sand, gravel, humus, aggregates for the production of building
      materials, for example raw materials for the production of bricks,
      etc.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] The amount of binder composition used is adjusted according
      to the particle mass to be treated. In order to improve the
      properties of sand a few grams of the binder composition (based on
      dry matter) is used per kilogram of sand.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Below the invention will be illustrated further by the
      following non-limiting examples.<br>
      <br>
      <b>EXAMPLES</b><br>
      <br>
      [0062] Two types of experiments have been carried out.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] The first one were pot experiments aimed at comparing the
      effect of different levels of both suspended kaolin and dry mixing
      kaolin on wheat grain germination percent and physical properties,
      the second one was wind tunnel experiments aimed at studying the
      effect of suspended kaolin on threshold velocity and soil loss by
      wind erosion.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination Experiments</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0064] This experiment was carried out under greenhouse conditions
      in order to compare the effect of different levels of kaolin
      either in suspended form or as a powder, i.e. dry mixing with
      soil, on the germination rate of wheat grains.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] The experimental treatments included the following:<br>
      <br>
      control, i.e. without kaolin application,<br>
      two levels of kaolin, i.e. 2.5% (of soil mass to root depth—7
      kg=175 gram clay) (T1) and 5% (of soil mass to root depth—7 kg=350
      gram clay) (T2) applied as dry mixing.<br>
      four levels of kaolin, i.e. 1% (of suspension weight—0.9 kg=9
      gram) (T3), 1.5% (of suspension weight—0.9 kg=13.5 gram) (T4), 2%
      (of suspension weight—0.9 kg=18 gram) (T5) and 2.5% (of suspension
      weight—0.9 kg=22.5 gram) (T6) applied as suspended kaolin. The
      suspension applied to field capacity=900 ml.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The pots were arranged according to completely randomised
      design, and each treatment was replicated three times. The total
      number of pots was 7·3=21 pots.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Procedure</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0070] After application of the above mentioned treatments, 20
      grains of the local wheat variety (Triticum vulgari var Sakha 93)
      which is recommended for desert areas—were sown in each pot. The
      pots were irrigated up to the field capacity level. The amount of
      the applied water was 900 ml. Thereafter they were watered with
      amounts sufficient to compensate the depleted moisture. Such
      amounts ranged between 100 to 150 ml. Germination began after 4 to
      6 days at which the rate of germination was followed up and
      recorded.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] After 20 days from sowing the vegetative parts of the
      plants were harvested and dried in a ventilated oven at 70° C.,
      thereafter the dry weight was recorded.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] Soil penetration resistance for each of the applied
      treatments was measured by using a computerised electrical
      Penetrometer after harvesting.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] These tests were conducted in relatively small pots and the
      studied soil is mainly sand. Penetrometer readings were taken at
      every 3 cm intervals. Because the penetration resistance is
      strongly affected by soil moisture content, soil samples were
      taken at each tested depth to determine the soil moisture content
      at the time of measurements. Thereafter the soil samples were
      collected from each pot to determine soil aggregates, field
      capacity, and wilting percentage.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Experimental Results:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0074] The given percentages in all the report give percent value
      which seems to be % of the same objects, but as shown in brackets
      is of different objects: 5% (of total soil weight 7 kg=350 gram
      clay) dry kaolin and/or 5% (of the applied water suspension 0.9
      kg=45 gram clay) suspended kaolin. The amount of clay used in the
      suspension is 13% of the amount used in the dry mixing, the old
      method. The suspended clay bind the particles as soon as applied
      and the dry mixing, old method must have water applied before it
      had any binding abilities, dry clay particles is dangerous for
      humans when inhaled into the lungs. The remarkable result is thus
      that this method uses approximately 13% of the amount of clay used
      in the old dry mixing method and achieves the same benefits
      together with an immediate binding of the sand particles.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Germination Rate and Seedlings Dry Weight:</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0075] Table (1) shows that the application of kaolin either by
      mixing dry or suspended kaolin with any level increased
      germination percent after four days from sowing as compared to the
      control treatment. After six days from sowing the same trend was
      obtained with the exception of applying suspended kaolin with 1%
      level. The best levels were 2.5% for dry mixing and 1.5% suspended
      clay, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] From the statistical point of view the difference between
      germination rates under 2.5% of dry application and those under
      1.5% of suspended kaolin treatments were not significant.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Penetration Resistance:</b><br>
      <br>
      [0078] As mentioned above, the penetration resistance is strongly
      dependent on the amount of moisture retained in the soil (i.e.
      layer under test). Therefore, the amount of soil moisture was
      measured in soil samples taken very close to the penetrometer cone
      at the time of measuring soil resistance. The obtained data of
      soil moisture in the tested depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm) is
      given in table (3). This table shows that the soil moisture
      content at the time of measurement was almost similar either in
      respect to the applied treatments or in the tested depth in each
      pot. Therefore, the obtained variations in soil resistance
      expressed by the penetration resistance data are mainly related to
      the influence of the kaolin treatments, i.e. the levels and
      methods of application. In other words, under the conditions of
      the current study, the variation in soil resistance can be
      explained only on the basis of the kaolin treatments because the
      influence of soil moisture on resistance is negligible, as shown
      in table (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      <br>
      <b>TABLE 3</b><br>
      Soil moisture content (w/w) at time of Penetration resistance
      measurement under the conditions of applied treatments<br>
      <br>
      [0079] Regarding the influence of the application level it has
      been shown that the penetration resistance is linearly associated
      with the application level. In other words, mixing dune sand with
      kaolin at a rate of 5% dry or 2% suspended kaolin (w/w) has
      resulted in increasing the penetration resistance from about 0.4
      to 1.40 Mpa/cm&lt;2&gt;. This remarkable impact is favourable for
      both plant production as well as environmental requirements. These
      low values of soil strength do not impede root growth of most of
      the cultivated crops while improving the soil bearing capacity and
      thus trafficability.<br>
      <br>
      Wind Tunnel Experiments<br>
      <br>
      [0080] These experiments focus on the study of the relation
      between wind velocity and soil loss or threshold velocity, i.e.
      the velocity required to create soil particle movement, under
      different levels of binder, i.e. kaolin, suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The capacity of the binder according to the present
      invention to reduce the soil loss by wind was measured in wind
      tunnel experiments. The experiments were carried out at the “Cold
      and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute,
      The Chine Academy of Sciences” in China. The tunnel was an
      open-circuit type through which air was forced by a blower to the
      test section with dimensions of 1.0 m width, 0.6 m height and
      16.23 m length. Air was sucked from ambient through a bell shaped
      entrance by the blower to the entrance section and then proceeded
      to the exit. Before reaching the test section, the flow passed
      through a diffusor followed by a convergent nozzle and wind
      simulator component.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The test section was equipped with traverse mechanism to
      measure the flow velocity profile at different levels. The
      diffusor floor was equipped with a sand trap mechanism in order to
      collect sand transported and the air left through a vertical duct
      to the outside air.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] The following table shows the test results obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] It is evident that at any wind velocity the soil loss
      decreased by increasing application levels, but the percent
      reduction varied according to the wind velocity. The highest
      reduction occurred with 5% suspension and 3 L/m2 or more and 10%
      suspension and 1 L/m2 or more, at wind velocity of 27.5 m/s with
      100% reduction. It is also evident that the threshold velocity
      increased by increasing the binder suspension.<br>

      <b>Results</b><br>
      <br>
      [0088] The results show that increasing kaolin levels increased
      threshold velocity, in other words the velocity required to create
      soil particle movement increased by adding suspended kaolin at any
      level. As mentioned the threshold velocity is the lowest wind
      velocity which create movement of the soil particles.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] It is also evident that at any wind velocity soil loss
      decreased by increasing application of kaolin levels, but the
      percent reduction varied according to the value of wind velocity.
      The highest reduction occurred with 5% suspension and 3 L/m2 or
      more and 10% suspension and 1 L/m2 or more, at wind velocity of
      27.5 m/s with 100% reduction.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] It is evident from the above experiments that the present
      invention allows the use of clay of moderate quality and at the
      same time gives improved results and just using an average of 13%
      of what was used in the old method of dry mixing. Or as said above
      to stop wind erosion efficiently by 1 L water/m2 using 100 gram
      clay per litre has never been done before.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] The obtained results also indicate that the applied
      treatments significantly increase the adhesion and cohesion forces
      within the soil matrix, with consequent decrease in soil
      erodibility and hence erosion losses.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] The most recent results obtained by applying 0.5-1 litre
      suspension per m2 with a percolation depth of 0.5-1 cm have
      demonstrated that by the application of 9% suspended kaolin,
      without pre-watering of the ground, the increased soil moisture in
      the soil surface layer (i.e. 0-10 cm) increased by 24%. Screening
      experiments have indicated that this increase seems to be
      exponentiental.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] It will be obvious for a person skilled in the art that the
      electrostatically binding properties of the binder composition is
      of use in all areas where it is desirable to fix small entities,
      for example microscopic particles, atoms, viruses, bacteria and
      other cellular structures, to a medium, in order to remove
      unwanted substances or add wanted substances to change the
      properties of the medium, as described above and as claimed in the
      following patent claims.<br>

      Firstly you have to determined The Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC)
      which can be determined for the raw clay sample by saturation with
      1 N solution of sodium acetate trihydrate (CH3 COONa .3H2O) for
      long time at pH 8.2, then washing for several times by ethanol 95
      % to get rid the excess sodium ion. The reacted sodium (Na+) with
      the clay sample was extracted by reaction with 1 N ammonium
      acetate solution followed by sodium determination using flame
      photometer in the extracted solution .<br>
      <br>
      Since the mEq equal to mg*valence of surfactant divided by its
      molecular weight, the amount of CEC will be changeable according
      to the molecular weight of each surfactant.<br>
      5g of clay was dispersed in 300 ml of distilled water for 24 h at
      room temperature using a magnetic stirrer and then a desired
      amount of surfactant according to CEC and M.Wt of surfactant was
      slowly added. The concentration of surfactant can be varied from
      0.5 to 5.0 according to the CEC of clay. The reaction mixtures
      were stirred for 5 h at 80 oC. Consequently, the cation exchange
      reaction occurs rapidly. The resulting organoclay suspension was
      mixed further for 12 h. All products were washed until free from
      bromide anions and dried at 90oC. Finally, the resulting material
      was ground using SFM-1 Desk Top Planetary Ball Miller (MTI) for 3
      hours, in order to obtain a nanoscale powder. The organo nanoclay
      product was stored in bottle .<br>
