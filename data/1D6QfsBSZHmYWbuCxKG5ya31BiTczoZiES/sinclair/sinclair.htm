      <div align="center"> <big><b>University of NSW research finds
            compound that can reverse ageing </b><b><br>
          </b></big></div>
      <br>
      AUSTRALIAN researchers have found what could become the elixir of
      life - a chemical compound that can reverse ageing.<br>
      <br>
      The discovery of nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) by University
      of NSW researchers could lead to new treatments for ageing,
      cancer, type 2 diabetes and muscle wasting and inflammatory
      diseases within five to ten years.<br>
      <br>
      Human trials of the compound that turns back ageing by improving
      communication between parts of a cell could start as early as next
      year.<br>
      <br>
      The only hiccup is the cure is unaffordable for most people
      because it costs $1,000 per gram.<br>
      <br>
      The research used the equivalent of 500mg of NMN for every
      kilogram of body weight per day.<br>
      <br>
      This means the substance would cost the average 86 kilogram man
      $43,000 a day and the average 71 kilogram woman $35,000 a day.<br>
      <br>
      Lead researcher University of NSW Professor David Sinclair says he
      soon hopes to find a way to produce it more cheaply.<br>
      <br>
      The compound is fast acting and could also benefit healthy people
      by making them super charged.<br>
      <br>
      Just a week after older mice were injected with the compound they
      had improvements in their muscles that made them indistinguishable
      from younger animals.<br>
      <br>
      "It's something like a 60 year old being similar to a 20 year old
      on some measures," says University NSW pharmacologist and
      co-author Dr Nigel Turner.<br>
      <br>
      Very old mice that were the equivalent of a human aged 85 also
      benefited from the substance with their body improving to be like
      that of a 40 year old.<br>
      <br>
      "If those results stand, then ageing may be a reversible
      condition, if it is caught early", says Professor Sinclair who is
      based at Harvard Medical School.<br>
      <br>
      Underpinning the breakthrough is the discovery that when there is
      a communication breakdown between the mitochondria, the battery
      pack of a cell, and the nucleus of the cell ageing accelerates.<br>
      <br>
      A chemical called NAD is central to kick starting this cellular
      communication process but it begins to decline as we age.<br>
      <br>
      The only way to combat the decline in NAD is excessive calorie
      restriction and intensive exercise.<br>
      <br>
      In a research paper published in the journal Cell today the
      researchers report they have found that NMN injected into an
      animal body transforms into NAD to repair the broken communication
      channels.<br>
      <br>
      This compound mimics the effect of diet and exercise.<br>
      <br>
      "It was shocking how quickly it happened," says Dr Nigel Turner.<br>
      <br>
      "If the compound is administered early enough in the ageing
      process, in just a week, the muscles of older mice were
      indistinguishable from the younger animals," he said.<br>
      <br>
      The research is also examining another molecule called HIF-1 that
      also interferes with cellular communication and has a role in
      cancer.<br>
      <br>
      This molecule is switched on in many cancers and researchers have
      now found it also switches on as we age.<br>
      <br>
      "We become cancer-like in our ageing process," says Professor
      Sinclair.<br>
      <br>
      "This may explain why the greatest risk of cancer is age," he
      says.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Sinclair has previously been behind research that found
      resveratrol a substance found in red wine and certain nuts, made
      an anti-ageing gene SIRT1 run faster.<br>
      <br>
      This new compound, NMN, activates all seven of the sirtuin genes
      implicated in longevity.<br>
      <br>
      Further studies will test whether NMN leads to mice living longer
      lives, whether it helps them lose weight or has any side effects.<br>
      <br>
      Professor Sinclair stresses that although NMN is a naturally
      occurring "I wouldn't advise anyone to take it until we know it is
      safe, we wouldn't want any surprises".<br>

      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ever since eukaryotes subsumed the bacterial ancestor of
      mitochondria, the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes have had to
      closely coordinate their activities, as each encode different
      subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system.
      Mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of aging, but its causes
      are debated. We show that, during aging, there is a specific loss
      of mitochondrial, but not nuclear, encoded OXPHOS subunits. We
      trace the cause to an alternate PGC-1a/ß-independent pathway of
      nuclear-mitochondrial communication that is induced by a decline
      in nuclear NAD+ and the accumulation of HIF-1a under normoxic
      conditions, with parallels to Warburg reprogramming. Deleting
      SIRT1 accelerates this process, whereas raising NAD+ levels in old
      mice restores mitochondrial function to that of a young mouse in a
      SIRT1-dependent manner. Thus, a pseudohypoxic state that disrupts
      PGC-1a/ß-independent nuclear-mitochondrial communication
      contributes to the decline in mitochondrial function with age, a
      process that is apparently reversible.<br>

      <br>
      IT sounds too good to be true, but a respected Australian
      scientist believes he has invented a new class of superdrug that
      could prevent cancer and Alzheimer's disease.<br>
      <br>
      What's more, Professor David Sinclair says his drugs have the
      potential to help some people enjoy a healthy life until the age
      of 150. However, this needs further research.<br>
      <br>
      A paper in the March 8 issue of the journal, Science, explains how
      the drugs have the ability to switch on the body's defences
      against ageing.<br>
      <br>
      Three of the drugs are in human trials for the treatment of
      specific illnesses such as type 2 diabetes and inflammatory bowel
      disease, says the University of New South Wales geneticist.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Sinclair is most excited about the potential to prevent
      illness and hopes to prove the drugs will have a dual purpose of
      treating and preventing disease at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      "My research has been criticised because it sounds too good to be
      true. This paper shows it is true," he says in a telephone
      interview from Harvard Medical School, where he is based.<br>
      <br>
      Prof Sinclair's drugs target the enzyme SIRT1, which is switched
      on naturally by calorie restriction and exercise, but it can also
      be enhanced through activators such as resveratrol in red wine.<br>
      <br>
      He and his colleagues have developed 4000 synthetic activators.
      Each one is 100 times more potent than a glass of red wine and the
      best three are the ones in human trials.<br>
      <br>
      "Our drugs can mimic the benefits of a healthy diet and exercise,
      but there is no impact on weight," says Prof Sinclair, who
      suggests the first medicine to be marketed could be for diabetes
      in about five years.<br>
      <br>
      Once a significant number of people are using the drugs, it will
      be possible to assess other benefits.<br>
      <br>
      "We can look at 10,000 people and see if they are healthier and
      living longer than the general population."<br>
      <br>
      In animal tests, overweight mice given synthetic resveratrol were
      able to run twice as far as slim mice and they lived 15 per cent
      longer.<br>
      <br>
      "My prediction is that we will delay the onset of diseases and
      will not have so many people becoming chronically sick in their
      50s and 60s," says Prof Sinclair.<br>
      <br>
      The hope is that people will live healthily into their hundreds.<br>

      The invention provides methods and compositions for modulating the
      life span of eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells and for protecting
      cells against certain stresses, e.g., heatshock. One method
      comprises modulating the flux of the NAD+ salvage pathway in the
      cell, e.g., by modulating the level or activity of one or more
      proteins selected from the group consisting of NPT1, PNC1, NMA1
      and NMA2. Another method comprises modulating the level of
      nicotinamide in the cell.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Physiological studies and, more recently, DNA array analysis of
      gene expression patterns have confirmed that aging is a complex
      biological process. In contrast, genetic studies in model
      organisms have demonstrated that relatively minor changes to an
      organism's environment or genetic makeup can dramatically slow the
      aging process. For example, the life span of many diverse
      organisms can be greatly extended simply by limiting calorie
      intake, in a dietary regime known as caloric restriction (1-3).<br>
      <br>
      How can simple changes have such profound effects on a complex
      process such as aging? A picture is emerging in which all
      eukaryotes possess a surprisingly conserved regulatory system that
      governs the pace of aging (4,5). Such a regulatory system may have
      arisen in evolution to allow organisms to survive in adverse
      conditions by redirecting resources from growth and reproduction
      to pathways that provide stress resistance (4,6).<br>
      <br>
      One model that has proven particularly useful in the
      identification of regulatory factors of aging is the budding
      yeast, S. cerevisiae. Replicative life span in S. cerevisiae is
      typically defined as the number of buds or "daughter cells"
      produced by an individual "mother cell" (7). Mother cells undergo
      age-dependent changes including an increase in size, a slowing of
      the cell cycle, enlargement of the nucleolus, an increase in
      steady-state NAD&lt;+&gt; levels, increased gluconeogenesis and
      energy storage, and sterility resulting from the loss of silencing
      at telomeres and mating-type loci (8-13). An alternative measure
      of yeast life span, known as chronological aging, is the length of
      time a population of non-dividing cells remains viable when
      deprived of nutrients (14). Increased chronological life span
      correlates with increased resistance to heat shock and oxidative
      stress, suggesting that cumulative damage to cellular components
      is a major cause of this type of aging (14,15). The extent of
      overlap between replicative and chronological aging is currently
      unclear.<br>
      <br>
      One cause of yeast replicative aging has been shown to stem from
      the instability of the repeated ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus (16).
      This instability gives rise to circular forms of rDNA called ERCs
      that replicate but fail to segregate to daughter cells.
      Eventually, ERCs accumulate to over 1000 copies, which are thought
      to kill cells by titrating essential transcription and/or
      replication factors. (16-18). Regimens that reduce DNA
      recombination such as caloric restriction or a fob1 deletion
      extend replicative life span (17,19,20).<br>
      <br>
      A key regulator of aging in yeast is the Sir2 silencing protein
      (17), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;+&gt;)-dependent
      deacetylase (21-24). Sir2 is a component of the heterotrimeric
      Sir2/3/4 complex that catalyzes the formation of silent
      heterochromatin at telomeres and the two silent mating-type loci
      (25). Sir2 is also a component of the RENT complex that is
      required for silencing at the rDNA locus and exit from telophase
      (26,27). This complex has also recently been shown to directly
      stimulate transcription of rRNA by Pol I and to be involved in
      regulation of nucleolar structure (28).<br>
      <br>
      Biochemical studies have shown that Sir2 can readily deacetylate
      the amino-terminal tails of histones H3 and H4, resulting in the
      formation of 1-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose and nicotinamide (21-23,29).
      Strains with additional copies of SIR2 display increased rDNA
      silencing (30) and a 30% longer life span (17). It has recently
      been shown that additional copies of the C. elegans SIR2 homolog,
      sir-2.1, greatly extend life span in that organism (31). This
      implies that the SIR2-dependent regulatory pathway for aging arose
      early in evolution and has been well conserved (4). Yeast life
      span, like that of metazoans, is also extended by interventions
      that resemble caloric restriction (19,32). Mutations that reduce
      the activity of the glucose-responsive cAMP (adenosine
      3'5'-monophosphate)-dependent (PKA) pathway extend life span in
      wild type cells but not in mutant sir2 strains, demonstrating that
      SIR2 is a key downstream component of the caloric restriction
      pathway (19).<br>
      <br>
      In most organisms, there are two pathways of NAD+ biosynthesis
      (see FIG. 1). NAD+ may be synthesized de novo from tryptophan or
      recycled in four steps from nicotinamide via the NAD+ salvage
      pathway. The first step in the bacterial NAD&lt;+&gt; salvage
      pathway, the hydrolysis of nicotinamide to nicotinic acid and
      ammonia, is catalyzed by the pncA gene product (33). An S.
      cerevisiae gene with homology to pncA, YGL037, was recently
      assigned the name PNC1 (SGD) (34). A nicotinate
      phosphoribosyltransferase, encoded by the NPT1 gene in S.
      cerevisiae, converts the nicotinic acid from this reaction to
      nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) (35-38). At this point, the
      NAD&lt;+&gt; salvage pathway and the de novo NAD&lt;+&gt; pathway
      converge and NaMN is converted to desamido-NAD&lt;+&gt; (NaAD) by
      a nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NaMNAT). In S.
      cerevisiae, there are two putative ORFs with homology to bacterial
      NaMNAT genes, YLR328 (39) and an uncharacterized ORF, YGR010
      (23,39). We refer to these two ORFs as NMA1 and NMA2,
      respectively. In Salmonella, the final step in the regeneration of
      NAD&lt;+&gt; is catalyzed by an NAD synthetase (40). An as yet
      uncharacterized ORF, QNS1, is predicted to encode a NAD synthetase
      (23).<br>
      <br>
      In yeast, null mutations in NPT1 reduce steady-state NAD&lt;+&gt;
      levels by ~2-fold (23) and abolish the longevity provided by
      limiting calories (19). One current hypothesis explaining how
      caloric restriction extends replicative life span is that
      decreased metabolic activity causes an increase in NAD&lt;+&gt;
      levels, which then stimulate Sir2 activity (reviewed in Campisi,
      2000 and Guarente, 2000).<br>
      <br>
      Transcriptional silencing involves the heritable modification of
      chromatin at distinct sites in the genome. Silencing is referred
      to as long-range repression as it is promoter non-specific and
      often encompasses an entire genomic locus (1',2'). In yeast these
      silent regions of DNA, which are similar to the heterochromatin of
      higher eukaryotes, are subject to a wide variety of modifications
      (3'). Among the most well studied of these modifications is the
      reversible acetylation of histones (reviewed in 4',5').<br>
      <br>
      There are two classes of enzymes that affect the acetylation state
      of histones: histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and the opposing
      histone deacetylases (HDACs). Compared with more transcriptionally
      active areas of the genome, histones within silent regions of
      chromatin are known to be hypoacetylated, specifically on the
      NH2-terminal tails of core histones H3 and H4 (6'). Three classes
      of histone deacetylases have been described and classified based
      on homology to yeast proteins. Proteins in class I (Rpd3-like) and
      class II (Hda1-like) are characterized by their sensitivity to the
      inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (7',8'). Studies using this
      inhibitor have provided a wealth of information regarding the
      cellular function of these proteins, including their involvement
      in the expression of regulators of cell cycle, differentiation,
      and apoptosis (reviewed in 9').<br>
      <br>
      Yeast Sir2 is the founding member of Class III HDACs. Sir2-like
      deacetylases are not inhibited by TSA and have the unique
      characteristic of being NAD&lt;+&gt;-dependent (10'-13'). Proteins
      of this class are found in a wide array of organisms, ranging from
      bacteria to humans. At least two Sir2 homologues, yeast Hst2 and
      human SIRT2, are localized to the cytoplasm and human SIRT1 has
      recently been shown to target p53 for deacetylation (11',13'-15').
      These results indicate that not all members of this family are
      specific for histones or other nuclear substrates.<br>
      <br>
      The term, silent information regulator (SIR), was first coined to
      describe a set of non-essential genes required for repression of
      the mating type loci (HML and HMR) in S. cerevisiae (16').
      Silencing in yeast is also observed at telomeres and the ribosomal
      DNA (rDNA) locus (2',17'). The formation of heterochromatin at
      mating type loci and the poly(TG1-3) tracts of yeast telomeres is
      mediated by a heterotrimeric complex of Sir2, Sir3 and Sir4
      (18',19'). At the rDNA locus, Sir2 is part of the RENT (regulator
      of nuleolar silencing and telophase exit) complex, which includes
      Net1 and Cdc14 (20',21'). Of these proteins, Sir2 is the only
      factor that is indispensable for silencing at all three silent
      regions (22'-24').<br>
      <br>
      The yeast rDNA locus (RLN1) consists of 100-200 tandemly-repeated
      9 kb units encoding ribosomal RNAs. A major cause of yeast aging
      has been shown to stem from recombination between these repeats
      (25'-27') which can lead to the excision of an extrachromosomal
      rDNA circle (ERC). ERCs are replicated but they fail to segregate
      to daughter cells, resulting in their exponential amplification as
      cells divide. ERCs can accumulate to a DNA content greater than
      that of the entire yeast genome in old cells and are thought to
      kill cells by titrating essential transcription and/or replication
      factors (28'). Although Sir2 silences Pol II-transcribed genes
      integrated at the rDNA, there is evidence that its primary
      function at this locus is to suppress recombination. Deletion of
      SIR2 eliminates rDNA silencing and increases the frequency that a
      marker gene is recombined out of the rDNA 10-fold (29'). This
      results in increased ERC formation and a dramatic shortening of
      life span (29',30').<br>
      <br>
      Sir2 is a limiting component of yeast longevity. A single extra
      copy of the SIR2 gene suppresses recombination and extends life
      span by 40% (26',31',32'). Recently, it has been shown that SIR2
      is essential for the increased longevity provided by calorie
      restriction (31''), a regimen that extends the life span of every
      organism it has been tested on. Moreover, increased dosage of the
      Sir2 homologue sir2.1 has been shown to extend the life span of
      the nematode C. elegans (33') and the nearest human homologue
      SIRT1, has been shown to inhibit apoptosis through deacetylation
      of p53 (34',35'). These findings suggest that Sir2 and its
      homologues have a conserved role in the regulation of survival at
      the cellular and organismal level.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a great deal of insight has been gained into the
      biochemistry of Sir2-like deacetylases (reviewed by 36'). In
      vitro, Sir2 has specificity for lysine 16 of histone H4 and
      lysines 9 and 14 of histone H3 (10',12',13'). Although TSA
      sensitive HDACs catalyze deacetylation without the need of a
      cofactor, the Sir2 reaction requires NAD&lt;+&gt;. This allows for
      regulation of Sir2 activity through changes in availability of
      this co-substrate (10'-13'). Sir2 deacetylation is coupled to
      cleavage of the high-energy glycosidic bond that joins the
      ADP-ribose moiety of NAD&lt;+&gt; to nicotinamide. Upon cleavage,
      Sir2 catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group to ADP-ribose
      (10',11',15',37'). The product of this transfer reaction is
      O-acetyl-ADP-ribose, a novel metabolite, which has recently been
      shown to cause a delay/block in the cell cycle and oocyte
      maturation of embryos (38').<br>
      <br>
      The other product of deacetylation is nicotinamide, a precursor of
      nicotinic acid and a form of vitamin B3 (39'). High doses of
      nicotinamide and nicotinic acid are often used interchangeably to
      self-treat a range of conditions including anxiety,
      osteoarthritis, psychosis, and nicotinamide is currently in
      clinical trials as a therapy for cancer and type I diabetes (40').
      The long-term safety of the high doses used in these treatments
      has been questioned (41') and the possible effects of these
      compounds at the molecular level are not clear.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In one embodidment, the invention provides methods for modulating
      the life span of a cell or its resistance to stress, comprising
      modulating the flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway in the cell.
      The method may comprise increasing or extending the life of a cell
      or increasing its resistance against stress, comprising increasing
      the flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway in the cell. Modulating
      the flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway may occur essentially
      without changing steady state levels of NAD+ and NADH and
      essentially by maintaining the NAD+/NADH ratio in the cell.<br>
      <br>
      Increasing the flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway may comprise
      increasing the level or activity of a protein selected from the
      group consisting of NPT1, PNC1, NMA1 and NMA2. The method may
      comprise introducing into the cell at least one nucleic acid
      encoding a protein selected from the group consisting of NPT1,
      PNC1, NMA1 and NMA2, or a nucleic acid comprising at least 5
      copies of a gene. Alternatively, the method may comprise
      introducing into the cell at least one protein selected from the
      group consisting of NPT1, PNC1, NMA1 and NMA2. The method may
      comprise contacting the cell with an agent that upregulates the
      expression of a gene selected from the group consisting of NPT1,
      PNC1, NMA1 and NMA2. The cell may live at least about 40% longer,
      or at least about 60% longer.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides methods for increasing the resistance
      of the cell against stress, e.g., heat shock, osmotic stress, DNA
      damaging agents (e.g., U.V.), and inadequate nitrogen levels,
      comprising increasing the flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway in
      the cell.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, modulating the life span of a cell comprises
      modulating silencing in the cell. Silencing may include telomeric
      silencing and rDNA recombination.<br>
      <br>
      The cell whose life span can be extended or who can be protected
      against stress can be a eukaryotic cell, such as a yeast cell or a
      prokaryotic cell, such as a bacterial cell. The cell can be in
      vitro or in vivo.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, modulating the life span of a cell or its
      resistance to stress comprises modulating the amount of
      nicotinamide and/or the ratio of NAD:nicotinamide in the cell. The
      ratio of NAD:nicotinamide may be modulated by a factor of at least
      about 50%, 2, 3, 5, 10 or more. For example, reducing the life
      span of a cell or rendering a cell more sensitive to stress may
      comprise increasing the level of nicotinamide in the cell. This
      may comprise contacting the cell with an amount of nicotinamide of
      about 1 to 20 mM, preferably of about 2 to 10 mM. The level of
      nicotinamide in a cell may also be increased by increasing the
      level or activity of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of
      nicotinamide or by decreasing the level or activity of enzymes
      that degrade or inactivate nicotinamide. Enzymes which directly or
      indirectly inactivate nicotinamide include PNC1; nicotinamide
      N-methyl transferase (NNMT and NNT1); NPT1, and human homologs
      thereof; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPRT); and
      optionally nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase
      (NMNAT-1 and 2); NMA1 and 2 and human homologs thereof.<br>
      <br>
      On the contrary, extending the life span of a cell or rendering
      the cell more resistant (i.e., less sensitive) to stress may
      comprise decreasing the level of nicotinamide in the cell. This
      may be achieved by decreasing the level or activity of enzymes
      involved in the biosynthesis of nicotinamide or by increasing the
      level or activity of enzymes that degrade or inactivate
      nicotinamide. Accordingly, increasing lifespan or stress
      resistance in a cell can be achieved by increasing the activity or
      level of expression of a protein selected from the group
      consisting of NPT1, PNC1, NMA1, NMA2, NNMT, NAMPRT, NMNAT-1, and
      NMNAT-2. Increasing lifespan or stress resistance can also be
      achieved by contacting the cell with nicotinamide riboside, an
      NAD+ precursor, or a biologically active analog thereof or prodrug
      thereof, and optionally increasing the protein level or activity
      of nicotinamide riboside kinase, e.g., Nrk1 and Nrk2 (see,
      Bieganowski et al. (2004) Cell 117:495).<br>
      <br>
      The invention further provides methods for identifying compounds
      that modulate the life span of a cell or its resistance to stress,
      comprising (i) contacting a protein selected from the group
      consisting of NPT1, PNC1, NMA1, NMA2, NNMT, NAMPRT, NMNAT-1, and
      NMNAT-2 with a test compound for an amount of time that would be
      sufficient to affect the activity of the protein; and (ii)
      determining the activity of the enzyme, wherein a difference in
      the activity of the enzyme in the presence of the test compound
      relative to the absence of the test compound indicates that the
      test compound is a compound that modulates the life span of the
      cell or its resistance to stress. The method may further comprise
      contacting a cell with the test compound and determining whether
      the life span of the cell has been modulated. The method may also
      further comprise contacting a cell with the test compound and
      determining whether the resistance of the cell to stress has been
      modulated.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the invention provides a method for
      identifying a compound that modulates the life span of a cell or
      its resistance to certain types of stresses, comprising (i)
      contacting a cell or a lysate, comprising a transcriptional
      regulatory nucleic acid of a gene selected from the group
      consisting of NPT1, PNC1, NMA1, NMA2, NNMT, NAMPRT, NMNAT-1, and
      NMNAT-2 operably linked to a reporter gene, with a test compound
      for an amount of time that would be sufficient to affect the
      transcriptional regulatory nucleic acid; and (ii) determining the
      level or activity of the reporter gene, wherein a difference in
      the level or activity of the reporter gene in the presence of the
      test compound relative to the absence of the test compound
      indicates that the test compound is a compound that modulates the
      life span of the cell or its resistance to certain types of
      stresses. The method may further comprise contacting a cell with
      the test compound and determining whether the life span of the
      cell has been modulated. The method may also further comprise
      contacting a cell with the test compound and determining whether
      the resistance of the cell to stress has been modulated.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided herein are methods for identifying an agent, e.g., a
      small molecule that modulates the nicotinamide level in a cell.
      The method may comprise (i) providing a cell or cell lysate
      comprising a reporter construct that is sensitive to the level of
      nicotinamide in a cell; (ii) contacting the cell with a test
      agent; and (iii) determining the level of nicotinamide in the cell
      contacted with the test agent, wherein a different level of
      nicotinamide in the cell treated with the test agent relative to a
      cell not treated with the test agent indicates that the test agent
      modulates the level of nicotinamide in the cell. The cell may
      further comprise a vector encoding a fusion protein that can bind
      to a DNA binding element operably linked to the reporter gene. The
      fusion protein may comprise at least an NAD+ binding pocket of a
      nicotinamide sensitive enzyme, e.g., a Sir2 family member, and a
      heterologous polypeptide. The heterologous polypeptide may be a
      transactivation domain of a transcription factor. The method may
      further comprise contacting a cell with the test compound and
      determining whether the life span of the cell or its resistance to
      stress has been modulated.<br>
      <br>
      Also within the scope of the invention are computer-assisted
      methods for identifying an inhibitor of the activity of a Sir2
      family member comprising: (i) supplying a computer modeling
      application with a set of structure coordinates of a molecule or
      molecular complex, the molecule or molecular complex including at
      least a portion of a Sir2 family member comprising a C pocket;
      (ii) supplying the computer modeling application with a set of
      structure coordinates of a chemical entity; and (iii) determining
      whether the chemical entity is an inhibitor expected to bind to or
      interfere with the molecule or molecular complex, wherein binding
      to or interfering with the molecule or molecular complex is
      indicative of potential inhibition of the activity of the Sir2
      family member. The chemical entity may be an analog of
      nicotinamide. Another method for identifying an inhibitor of the
      activity of a Sir2 family member comprises: (i) contacting a
      protein of the Sir2 family comprising at least the C pocket with a
      test compound for a time sufficient for the test compound to
      potentially bind to the C pocket of the protein of the Sir2
      family; and (ii) determining the activity of protein; wherein a
      lower activity of the protein in the presence of the test compound
      relative to the absence of the test compound indicates that the
      test compound is an inhibitor of the activity of a Sir2 family
      member.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the invention provides methods for treating or
      preventing diseases that are associated with aging or cell death
      (e.g., apoptosis) in a subject or diseases that may benefit from
      the effects of calorie restriction. A method may comprise
      administering to a subject in need thereof an agent that increases
      the flux through the NAD+ salvage pathway or reduces nicotinamide
      levels or the ratio of nicotinamide/NAD+ in the cells susceptible
      or subject to cell death. Diseases can be chronic or acute and
      include Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke,
      myocardial infarction or a metabolic disease, such as insulin
      resistance. The methods of the invention for extending life span
      or increasing resistance to stress can also be used to reduce
      aging, e.g., for cosmetic purposes. The agent can be administered
      locally or systemically. Methods for extending life span or
      increasing resistance to stress can also be used on cells, tissues
      or organs outside of a subject, e.g., in an organ or tissue prior
      to transplantation.<br>
      <br>
      The invention also provides methods for treating or preventing
      diseases in which reducing the life span of cells or rendering
      cells sensitive to stress is beneficial. Such diseases include
      those in which cells are undesirable, e.g., cancer and autoimmune
      diseases. Methods may also sensitize cells to killing by other
      agents, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
      <br>
      The methods of the invention can also be used to modulate the
      lifespan and stress resistance of organisms other than mammals.
      For example, the method can be used in microorganisms and plants.
      In particular, the methods of the invention permit to increase the
      resistance of plants to high salt, drought or disease, e.g., by
      treating these with a chemical that lowers nicotinamide levels or
      by genetically modifying genes that modulate the NAD+ salvage
      pathway or the level of nicotinamide in cells.<br>
      <br>
      Also provided are diagnostic methods, e.g., a method for
      determining the general health of a subject or whether a subject
      has been exposed, e.g., unknowingly exposed, to a stress
      condition. A diagnostic method may also be used for diagnosing the
      presence or likelihood of developing cancer. A method may comprise
      (i) providing a sample of cells or bodily fluid, e.g., blood or
      serum, from a subject; and (ii) determining the level of
      expression of a gene or level of protein or activity thereof
      encoded thereby selected from the group consisting of NPT1, PNC1,
      NMA1, NMA2, NNMT, NAMPRT, NMNAT-1, and NMNAT-2, wherein a higher
      level of expression of a gene or the level of protein encoded
      thereby or activity thereof relative to a control sample indicates
      that the general health of the subject is not adequate, acceptable
      or optimal. A diagnostic method may also comprise determining the
      level of NAD+, NADH, nicotinamide or other intermediate compound
      of the NAD+ salvage pathway. In one embodiment, the method
      comprises determining the level of NAMPRT in serum of a subject.<br>

      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>[0002] BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] The Silent Information Regulator (SIR) family of genes
      represents a highly conserved group of genes present in the
      genomes of organisms ranging from archaebacteria to a variety of
      eukaryotes (Frye, 2000). The encoded SIR proteins are involved in
      diverse processes from regulation of gene silencing to DNA repair.
      The proteins encoded by members of the SIR gene family show high
      sequence conservation in a 250 amino acid core domain. A
      well-characterized gene in this family is S. cerevisiae SIR2,
      which is involved in silencing HM loci that contain information
      specifying yeast mating type, telomere position effects and cell
      aging (Guarente, 1999; Kaeberlein et al., 1999; Shore, 2000). The
      yeast Sir2 protein belongs to a family of histone deacetylases
      (reviewed in Guarente, 2000; Shore, 2000). The Sir2 homolog, CobB,
      in Salmonella typhimurium, functions as an NAD (nicotinamide
      adenine dinucleotide)-dependent ADP-ribosyl transferase (Tsang and
      Escalante- Semerena, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      [0004] The Sir2 protein is a class III deacetylase which uses NAD
      as a cosubstrate (Imai et al., 2000; Moazed, 2001; Smith et al.,
      2000; Tanner et al., 2000; Tanny and Moazed, 2001). Unlike other
      deacetylases, many of which are involved in gene silencing, Sir2
      is insensitive to class I and II histone deacetylase inhibitors
      like trichostatin A (TSA) (Imai et al., 2000; Landry et al.,
      2000a; Smith et al., 2000).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Deacetylation of acetyl-lysine by Sir2 is tightly coupled
      to NAD hydrolysis, producing nicotinamide and a novel acetyl-ADP
      ribose compound (Tanner et al., 2000; Landry et al., 2000b; Tanny
      and Moazed, 2001). The NAD-dependent deacetylase activity of Sir2
      is essential for its functions which can connect its biological
      role with cellular metabolism in yeast (Guarente, 2000; Imai et
      al., 2000; Lin et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2000). Mammalian Sir2
      homologs have NAD-dependent histone deacetylase activity (Imai et
      al., 2000; Smith et al., 2000). Most information about Sir2
      mediated functions comes from the studies in yeast (Gartenberg,
      2000; Gottschling, 2000).<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Biochemical studies have shown that Sir2 can readily
      deacetylate the amino- terminal tails of histones H3 and H4,
      resulting in the formation of 1-Oacetyl-ADP- ribose and
      nicotinamide. Strains with additional copies of SIR2 display
      increased rDNA silencing and a 30% longer life span. It has
      recently been shown that additional copies of the C. elegans SIR2
      homolog, sir-2.1, and the D. melanogaster dSir2 gene greatly
      extend life span in those organisms. This implies that the
      ,S'/i?2-dependent regulatory pathway for aging arose early in
      evolution and has been well conserved. Today, Sir2 genes are
      believed to have evolved to enhance an organism's health and
      stress resistance to increase its chance of surviving adversity.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Caloric restriction has been known for over 70 years to
      improve the health and extend the lifespan of mammals (Masoro,
      2000). Yeast life span, like that of metazoans, is also extended
      by interventions that resemble caloric restriction, such as low
      glucose. The discovery that both yeast and flies lacking the SIR2
      gene do not live longer when calorically restricted provides
      evidence that SIR2 genes mediate the beneficial health effects of
      this diet (Anderson et al., 2003; Helfand and Rogina, 2004).
      Moreover, mutations that reduce the activity of the yeast
      glucose-responsive cAMP (adenosine 3'5'-monophosphate)-dependent
      (PKA) pathway extend life span in wild type cells but not in
      mutant sir2 strains, demonstrating that SIR2 is likely to be a key
      downstream component of the caloric restriction pathway (Lin et
      al., 2001).<br>
      <br>
      <b>[0008] SUMMARY</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0009] The present invention is directed to nicotinamide riboside
      and analogs thereof, including their use in methods of treating
      diseases or conditions, such as diabetes/insulin resistance,
      hyperlipidemia and obesity. It is believed that nicotinamide
      riboside and its analogs directly or indirectly activate sirtuins,
      such as the human protein SIRTl. For convenience, the compounds
      disclosed herein are referred to as "sirtuin modulating
      compounds"; however, Applicants do not intend this designation to
      mean that the biological effects of these compounds are dependent
      upon sirtuin modulation (activation).<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In certain embodiments of the invention, the invention is
      directed to analogs of nicotinamide riboside, particularly
      compounds that are metabolized, hydrolyzed or otherwise converted
      to nicotinamide riboside in vivo...<br>

      In enzymology, a nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase (EC
      2.7.7.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction<br>
      <br>
      ATP + nicotinamide ribonucleotide \rightleftharpoons diphosphate +
      NAD+<br>
      <br>
      Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and nicotinamide
      ribonucleotide, whereas its two products are diphosphate and NAD+.<br>
      <br>
      This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically
      those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups
      (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme
      class is ATP:nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase. Other
      names in common use include NAD+ pyrophosphorylase, adenosine
      triphosphate-nicotinamide mononucleotide transadenylase, ATP:NMN
      adenylyltransferase, diphosphopyridine nucleotide
      pyrophosphorylase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
      pyrophosphorylase, nicotinamide mononucleotide
      adenylyltransferase, and NMN adenylyltransferase. This enzyme
      participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism. The human
      version of this protein is NMNAT1.<br>

      <b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has become an epidemic in our modern
      lifestyle, likely due to calorie-rich diets overwhelming our
      adaptive metabolic pathways. One such pathway is mediated by
      nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), the rate-limiting
      enzyme in mammalian NAD+ biosynthesis, and the NAD+-dependent
      protein deacetylase SIRT1. Here we show that NAMPT-mediated NAD+
      biosynthesis is severely compromised in metabolic organs by
      high-fat diet (HFD). Strikingly, nicotinamide mononucleotide
      (NMN), a product of the NAMPT reaction and a key NAD+
      intermediate, ameliorates glucose intolerance by restoring NAD+
      levels in HFD-induced T2D mice. NMN also enhances hepatic insulin
      sensitivity and restores gene expression related to oxidative
      stress, inflammatory response, and circadian rhythm, partly
      through SIRT1 activation. Furthermore, NAD+ and NAMPT levels show
      significant decreases in multiple organs during aging, and NMN
      improves glucose intolerance and lipid profiles in age-induced T2D
      mice. These findings provide critical insights into a potential
      nutriceutical intervention against diet- and age-induced T2D.<br>

      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Recent studies have raised an interesting possibility that various
      physiological mechanisms that mediate metabolic adaptation have
      evolved in response to nutritionally scarce conditions such as
      famine and drought (Lazar, 2005). In our modern, sedentary
      lifestyle with calorie-rich diets, such adaptive mechanisms could
      be seriously overwhelmed, causing an epidemic of obesity and T2D
      worldwide (Yach et al., 2006). In mammals, one such mechanism
      comprises NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis and the NAD+-dependent
      protein deacetylase SIRT1 (Haigis and Sinclair, 2010; Imai, 2010;
      Imai and Guarente, 2010). NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis and
      SIRT1 together play critical roles in regulating a variety of
      biological processes that include metabolism, stress response,
      cellular differentiation, and circadian rhythm, and also mediating
      adaptive responses to limited energy intake, such as fasting and
      diet restriction (Imai, 2010). For example, in skeletal muscle,
      both nutritional deprivation and exercise increase Nampt
      expression through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase
      (AMPK), enhancing NAD+ biosynthesis and SIRT1 activity (Canto et
      al., 2010; Fulco et al., 2008). In pancreatic ß cells, both
      NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis and SIRT1 regulate
      glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in response to glucose
      availability (Moynihan et al., 2005; Revollo et al., 2007).
      Additionally, in the liver and white adipose tissue (WAT), NAMPT
      and SIRT1 comprise a novel transcriptional-enzymatic feedback loop
      for the regulation of circadian rhythm, a powerful effecter for
      metabolism (Imai, 2010).<br>
      <br>
      How nutritional and environmental perturbations affect the system
      dynamics of this NAMPT/NAD+/SIRT1-driven adaptive, systemic
      regulatory network, named the “NAD World” (Imai, 2010), still
      remains unclear. Here we show that HFD and aging compromise
      NAMPT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis, contributing to the pathogenesis
      of T2D. Importantly, we also provide evidence that promoting NAD+
      biosynthesis by using nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a product
      of the NAMPT reaction and a key NAD+ intermediate, could be an
      effective intervention against diet- and age-induced T2D.<br>
