      <b> </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation
      properties, with promise for many applications1,2,3,4,5. However,
      their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited
      by a permeation cutoff of ~9 Å (ref. 4), which is larger than the
      diameters of hydrated ions of common salts4,6. The cutoff is
      determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of ~13.5 Å, typical for
      graphene oxide laminates that swell in water2,4. Achieving smaller
      d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a
      challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical
      confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving.
      Membranes with d from ~9.8 Å to 6.4 Å are demonstrated, providing
      a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this
      regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with
      energy barriers of ~10–100 kJ mol–1 depending on d. Importantly,
      permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size
      but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of &lt;2). The
      latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water
      molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries.
      Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable
      method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling,
      which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl.<br>

      [0001] The invention relates to graphene oxide laminate membranes
      that are physically constrained. This invention also relates to
      methods of purifying water using said membranes and methods of
      making said membranes.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      [0002] The removal of solutes from water finds application in many
      fields.<br>
      [0003] This may take the form of the purification of water for
      drinking or for watering crops or it may take the form of the
      purification of waste waters from industry to prevent
      environmental damage. Examples of applications for water
      purification include: the removal of salt from sea water for
      drinking water or for use in industry; the purification of
      brackish water; the removal of radioactive ions from water which
      has been involved in nuclear enrichment, nuclear power generation
      or nuclear clean-up (e.g. that involved in the decommissioning of
      former nuclear power stations or following nuclear incidents); the
      removal of environmentally hazardous substances (e.g. halogenated
      organic compounds, heavy metals, chlorates and perchlorates) from
      industrial waste waters before they enter the water system; and
      the removal of biological pathogens (e.g. viruses, bacteria,
      parasites, etc) from contaminated or suspect drinking water.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] In many industrial contexts (e.g. the nuclear industry) it
      is often desirable to separate dangerous or otherwise undesired
      solutes from valuable (e.g. rare metals) solutes in industrial
      waste waters in order that the valuable solutes can be recovered
      and reused or sold.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Graphene is believed to be impermeable to all gases and
      liquids. Membranes made from graphene oxide are impermeable to
      most liquids, vapours and gases, including helium. However, an
      academic study has shown that, surprisingly, graphene oxide
      membranes having a thickness around 1 µ?? composed of oxygen rich
      functionalities are permeable to water even though they are
      impermeable to helium. These graphene oxide sheets allow unimpeded
      permeation of water (10&lt;10&gt;times faster than He) (Nair ef
      al.<br>
      <br>
      Science, 2012, 335, 442-444). Such GO laminates are particularly
      attractive as potential filtration or separation media because
      they are easy to fabricate, mechanically robust and offer no
      principal obstacles towards industrial scale production.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Sun et al (Selective Ion Penetration of Graphene Oxide
      Membranes; ACS Nano 7, 428 (2013)) describes the selective ion
      penetration of graphene oxide membranes in which the graphene
      oxide is formed by oxidation of wormlike graphite. The membranes
      are freestanding in the sense that they are not associated with a
      support material. The resultant graphene oxide contains more
      oxygen functional groups than graphene oxide prepared from natural
      graphite and laminates formed from this material have a wrinkled
      surface topography. Such membranes differ from those of the
      present invention because they do not show fast ion permeation of
      small ions and also demonstrate a selectivity which is
      substantially related to chemical and electrostatic interactions
      rather than size of ions.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] This study found that sodium salts permeated quickly
      through GO membranes, whereas heavy metal salts permeated much
      more slowly. Copper sulphate and organic contaminants, such as
      rhodamine B are blocked entirely because of their strong
      interactions with GO membranes. According to this study, ionic or
      molecular permeation through GO is mainly controlled by the
      interaction between ions or molecules with the functional groups
      present in the GO sheets. The authors comment that the selectivity
      of the GO membranes cannot be explained solely by ionic-radius
      based theories. They measured the electrical conductivities of
      different permeate solutions and used this value to compare the
      permeation rates of different salts. The potential applied to
      measure the conductivities can affect ion permeation through
      membranes.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Other publications (Y. Han, Z. Xu, C. Gao. Adv. Fund.
      Mater. 23, 3693 (2013); M. Hu, B. Mi. Environ. Sci. Technol. 47,
      3715 (2013); H. Huang et al. Chem. Comm. 49, 5963 (2013)) have
      reported filtration properties of GO laminates and, although
      results varied widely due to different fabrication and measurement
      procedures, they reported appealing characteristics including
      large water fluxes and notable rejection rates for certain salts.
      Unfortunately, large organic molecules were also found to pass
      through such GO filters. The latter observation is disappointing
      and would considerably limit interest in GO laminates as molecular
      sieves. In this respect, we note that the emphasis of these
      studies was on high water rates that could be comparable to or
      exceed the rates used for industrial desalination. Accordingly, a
      high water pressure was applied and the GO membranes were
      intentionally prepared as thin as possible, 10-50 nm thick. It may
      be that such thin stacks contained holes and cracks (some may
      appear after applying pressure), through which even large organic
      molecules could penetrate.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Recently, Joshi et al have described the use of graphene
      oxide laminate membranes as size exclusion membranes (R. K. Joshi
      et al., 2014, Science, 343, 752-754; see also <b>WO2015/075451</b>).



      These membranes selectively excluded solutes having a hydration
      radius greater than about 4.5 A. allowing solutes with a smaller
      radius to pass through. Molecular permeation through GO membranes
      is believed to occur along graphene channels that develop between
      GO sheets, and their sieving properties are defined by the
      interlayer spacing, d, which depends on the humidity of the
      surrounding. Immersing GO membranes in liquid water leads to
      intercalation of 2-3 layers of water molecules between individual
      GO sheets, which results in swelling and d ~ 13.5 A. The effective
      pore-size of 9 A in these swollen membranes (excluding the space
      occupied by carbon atoms) is larger than a typical size of
      hydrated ions and restricts possible uses of GO for size-exclusion
      based ion sieving. Unfortunately, many solutes which might be
      desirable to be able to filter out, including for example NaCI,
      have hydration radii which are below 4.5 A and are not effectively
      excluded from passing through the membrane.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] WO2016/ 189320 (PCT/<b>GB2016/051539</b>) describes how
      graphene oxide laminate membranes could be modified, either by
      including graphene flakes or by including cross-linking agents, to
      improve the level of exclusion of solutes that have hydration
      radii which are below 4.5 A, e.g. NaCI.<br>

      <b><b></b>Abstract</b><br>
      Graphene-based materials can have well-defined nanometer pores and
      can exhibit low frictional water flow inside them, making their
      properties of interest for filtration and separation. We
      investigate permeation through micrometer-thick laminates prepared
      by means of vacuum filtration of graphene oxide suspensions. The
      laminates are vacuum-tight in the dry state but, if immersed in
      water, act as molecular sieves, blocking all solutes with hydrated
      radii larger than 4.5 angstroms. Smaller ions permeate through the
      membranes at rates thousands of times faster than what is expected
      for simple diffusion. We believe that this behavior is caused by a
      network of nanocapillaries that open up in the hydrated state and
      accept only species that fit in. The anomalously fast permeation
      is attributed to a capillary-like high pressure acting on ions
      inside graphene capillaries.<br>
      <br>
      Membranes based on graphene can simultaneously block the passage
      of very small molecules while allowing the rapid permeation of
      water. Joshi et al. (p. 752; see the Perspective by Mi)
      investigated the permeation of ions and neutral molecules through
      a graphene oxide (GO) membrane in an aqueous solution. Small ions,
      with hydrated radii smaller than 0.45 nanometers, permeated
      through the GO membrane several orders of magnitude faster than
      predicted, based on diffusion theory. Molecular dynamics
      simulations revealed that the GO membrane can attract a high
      concentration of small ions into the membrane, which may explain
      the fast ion transport.<br>

          using graphene oxide membranes</b><br>
        <b>Williams, C. D. &amp; Carbone, P. </b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      The effective removal of radioactive technetium (99Tc) from
      contaminated water is of enormous importance from an environmental
      and public health perspective, yet many current methodologies are
      highly ineffective. In this work, however, we demonstrate that
      graphene oxide membranes may remove 99Tc, present in the form of
      pertechnetate (TcO4–), from water with a high degree of
      selectivity, suggesting they provide a cost-effective and
      efficient means of achieving 99Tc decontamination. The results
      were obtained by quantifying and comparing the free energy changes
      associated with the entry of the ions into the membrane
      capillaries (?Fperm), using molecular dynamics simulations.
      Initially, three capillary widths were investigated (0.35, 0.68,
      and 1.02 nm). In each case, the entry of TcO4– from aqueous
      solution into the capillary is associated with a decrease in free
      energy, unlike the other anions (SO42–, I–, and Cl–) investigated.
      For example, in the model with a capillary width of 0.68 nm,
      ?Fperm(TcO4–) = -6.3 kJ mol–1, compared to ?Fperm(SO42–) = +22.4
      kJ mol–1. We suggest an optimum capillary width (0.48 nm) and show
      that a capillary with this width results in a difference between
      ?Fperm(TcO4–) and ?Fperm(SO42–) of 89 kJ mol–1. The observed
      preference for TcO4– is due to its weakly hydrating nature,
      reflected in its low experimental hydration free energy.<br>
