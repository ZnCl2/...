      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention relates to a method of killing mature root crop tops
      prior to harvesting, and to a method of pruning certain perennial
      crop plants, with minimum adverse impact on the environment. In
      the past it has been proposed to kill plants with electricity, as
      shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,007,383, 2,607,165, 2,632,285,
      3,543,488, and 3,559,337. It has not previously been recognized,
      however, that certain root crops can be contacted with electricity
      to destroy the above-ground portions thereof while not adversely
      affecting the tubers -- the crop portion -- thereof. This has been
      recognized according to the present invention, however, and may be
      utilized to facilitate the harvesting of potatoes, beets, carrots,
      onions, and the like. According to the present invention, some
      time before harvesting, after the crops to be harvested are
      substantially mature, the above ground growth of the crops is
      contacted with electricity from a high-voltage source, which
      causes desiccation thereof; for instance for potatoes, the above
      ground growth is contacted with electricity from a 20 kv source
      about 10-20 days prior to harvesting, and by the time for
      harvesting the skin of the potatoes has become more firm, the
      potatoes are not subject to disease (i.e. leaf roll), and
      harvesting thereof with conventional equipment is greatly
      facilitated.<br>
      <br>
      In the past, it has been known to kill the above-ground growth of
      some root crops -- i.e. potatoes -- prior to harvesting to
      facilitate the harvesting and firm the skin thereof, but past
      methods have had a number of drawbacks. For instance, when
      conventional chemicals are used to kill the above-ground growth,
      they can and do leave residues which might migrate to the food
      portion of the crop, and in any event are retained in the soil to
      some extent and can be assimilated by the next year's crop; if the
      chemicals are applied too closely to a time when it rains, they
      may be washed off before they can be effective for killing the
      above-ground growth and thus a complete wasteful repeat of the
      application is necessary; dense foliage is not easily penetrated;
      also; the chemical treatments are often temperature dependent
      which means that it is not always possible to apply them at the
      optimum time, and therefore optimum harvesting conditions may not
      exist. Roto-beating -- that is, actual physical destruction of the
      above-ground growth -- also is practiced in addition to or in
      place of chemical application. While roto-beating avoids some of
      the problems inherent with chemical treatment, it is fairly energy
      intensive, and is not as completely successful as is the chemical
      treatment.<br>
      <br>
      It has also not been previously recognized that certain perennial
      crops -- such as blueberries -- can be pruned with the application
      of high-voltage electricity, but not destroyed. Conventional
      proposals for the application of electricity to plants, such as
      the patents mentioned above, do not recognize that a crop plant
      may not be killed but merely the above-ground growth thereof
      destroyed by the application of electricity. According to the
      present invention, blueberries and like perennial crops, may be
      treated by the application of electricity -- from a 20 kv source,
      for instance -- to the above-ground portions thereof every other
      year to prune the bushes and thereby encourage future growth.
      Conventionally, pruning of blueberry bushes on a commercial scale
      is accomplished by burning off of the plants with oilfired
      burners. While this effectively prunes the plants without serious
      damage to the root systems, it also destroys much of the organic
      material in the soil, and is fairly energy intensive.<br>
      <br>
      Thus according to the present invention, the pruning of perennial
      crops, such as low-bush blueberries, and the destruction of the
      above-ground growth of root crops, such as potatoes, carrots,
      onions, and beets, are greatly facilitated by the application of
      high-voltage electricity to the above-ground portions of the
      plants. Apparatus such as shown in our U.S. Pat. No. 3,919,806,
      the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference
      herein, may be utilized for practicing the method according to the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      It is the primary object of the present invention to provide
      improved methods for the pruning of certain perennial crops and
      for facilitating the harvesting of certain root crops, such
      methods eliminating many of the drawbacks inherent in prior art
      methods. This and other objects of the invention will become clear
      from an inspection of the detailed description of the invention,
      and from the appended claims.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      According to the present invention, potatoes and other root crops,
      such as beets, carrots, and onions, are treated by bringing the
      above-ground portions of the plants into contact with a
      high-voltage source of electricity. While the exact voltage
      applied will vary with the soil conditions, type of crop, etc., it
      has been found that 20 kv (no load) appears to be an ideal voltage
      for effecting desiccation of the above-ground portions of the
      crops, while not adversely affecting the root, food portions
      thereof. An effective energy density of about 11-15 kw/foot width
      of crop being treated normally results when such a no-load voltage
      is being used. While 20 kv and an energy density of 11-15 kw/foot
      have been found to be workable values, the range of each can vary
      widely and still be effective for accomplishing the desired
      result. Any voltage and energy density that results in the
      application of about 250 milliamps or more to the above-ground
      stems of root crops (i.e. potatoes) is believed effective. A
      maximum on the voltage and energy density would be that which
      would apply so much current that the root portion of the crop was
      adversely affected; however, there appears to be no adverse effect
      whatsoever when 12 kv with an energy density of about 11-15 kw/ft
      is utilized.<br>
      <br>
      The following table gives a summary of actual test results for the
      method of top killing of root crops according to the present
      invention. Katahdin potato vines in Maine were treated
      approximately 21 days prior to harvesting, the potatoes being
      harvested approximately 4 months after planting, and the vine kill
      rating of the method according to the present invention was
      determined one day prior to harvest. The kill rating code for the
      below (and the succeeding) table is 1=no or poor kill of leaves
      and stems, 2=90% of leaves but poor stem kill, 3=100% of leaves
      and 40% of stems killed, 4=100% of leaves and 70% of stems killed,
      and 5=100% of leaves and stems killed. By dragging behind a
      tractor six 24 inch vertical chains (covering a 16 inch horizontal
      band) which were electrically energized with AC current, the
      following results were obtained:<br>

      was slight regrowth on all plots, however, this regrowth may -- it
      is believed -- be avoided to a large extent by harvesting closer
      to the date of treatment with the electricity. Treatment with
      electricity should precede harvesting by 10-20 days.<br>
      <br>
      The values in Table A may be compared with similar values for a
      variety of chemical treatments of the same type of potatoes grown
      in the same area in generally the same time span. The results of
      such chemical treatment are listed below (all applied on days when
      it did not rain):<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">TABLE B</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      There was slight regrowth on many plots where the kill was not
      complete.<br>
      <br>
      It is noted that the effectiveness of the kill with Dow General
      and Des-I-Cate may be increased through proper application thereof
      by adjustment of the differential pressure and water dilution
      (applied with an F.M.C. sprayer) to 5.0 when the differential
      pressure and water dilution factors are optimized.<br>
      <br>
      It will be seen that treatment with electricity is just as
      effective as many of the chemical treatments applied above, and
      additionally has the previously mentioned advantages of no
      environmental degradation, ready penetration of thick growth, and
      no adverse effect when it rains or is cold. It is possible to
      increase the effectiveness of the treatment with electricity by
      watering down the ground before treatment, or by application of
      water with ionic materials (i.e. fertilizer salts) therein; this
      insures no damage to the tubers by allowing the electricity to
      dissipate to the ground quickly. Also, it is possible to combine
      the treatment with electricity with chemical treatment (either
      before or after electrical treatment), diminishing the amount of
      chemical that must be applied for successful treatment, and
      allowing one treatment to be made despite the weather conditions.<br>
      <br>
      According to the method of the present invention, low-bush
      blueberries have been pruned successfully, substantially all of
      the above-ground growth thereof being killed by contacting the
      blueberry bushes (or other perennial crop plants) with 10-20 kv
      (no load) at ground speeds of approximately 3 miles/hour, 2-3 KW
      of output power per foot of width being provided. This method may
      be repeated every other year to increase the yield from the
      plants, no apparent adverse effect on the roots taking place.<br>
      <br>
      While the invention has been herein shown and described in what
      are presently conceived to be the most practical and preferred
      embodiments thereof, it will be obvious to one of ordinary skill
      in the art that many modifications may be made thereof within the
      scope of the invention, which scope is to be accorded the broadest
      interpretation of the appended claims so as to encompass all
      equivalent process and methods. </p>

        </b>Apparatus for magnetically treating seeds comprises a magnet
        for producing a unipolar magnetic field, an enclosed generally
        cylindrical housing having a closable access opening therein in
        which said seeds are placed for treatment, drive means
        associated with the housing for rotating said housing and
        imparting rolling and tumbling motion to the seeds within the
        housing, the housing being disposed with respect to the magnet
        such that the seeds move through the magnetic field as they roll
        and tumble. By magnetically treating the seeds in a unipolar
        magnetic field while rolling and tumbling the seeds, the
        characteristics of plants grown therefrom are favorably altered.</font>

        </b>Microwave transmitters generate electromagnetic energy at a
        desired frequency in the range of from 300 MHz to 300 GHz.
        Energy derived from the microwave transmitters is coupled into a
        waveguide for transmission to an energy radiator coupled to the
        waveguide. The energy radiator, waveguide and microwave
        transmitters are vehicle mounted such that the radiator is made
        to pass over areas in which it is desired to control vegetation.
        Vegetation, including seeds, in the path of energy emitting from
        the radiator absorbs the energy from the field resulting in
        internal changes in the plant or seed causing death or
        debilitation of the vegetation or seed.</font> <br>

      <font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>Abstract ~ </b>A method and
        apparatus for destroying weeds growing in and around crop rows
        without destruction of crops growing therein. A plurality of
        electrically conductive spring members are disposed in a
        generally horizontal plane and connected to a high voltage
        source of electricity. The spring members have a spring constant
        such that relatively stiff crops plants will deflect the spring
        members while relatively flexible weeds will not deflect them.
        Substantially all of the plants in and around the crop rows are
        contacted with current-carrying portions of the spring members
        by moving the spring members relative to the crop rows parallel
        to the crop rows. A larger dwell time of contact is provided
        between the spring members and the relatively flexible weeds
        then the dwell time of contact between the spring members and
        the relatively stiff crop plant so that the weeds receive
        sufficient electrical energy to result in destruction thereof,
        while the crop plants do not receive sufficient electrical
        energy to result in destruction thereof. The difference in dwell
        time is provided by forming each spring member so that it has
        one end connected to a supporting member and the first portion
        extending from the connected end making a first angle .alpha.
        with a line along the direction of movement of the spring
        member, and having a free end with a second portion adjacent the
        free end making a second angle .beta. with a line along the
        direction of movement of the spring member, the angle .beta.
        being substantially greater than the angle .alpha., and by
        disposing the connected end of the spring member between crop
        rows while the free end extends into a crop row during movement
        of the spring member to affect contacting.</font> <br>

        </b>A machine and method for destroying plant growth. A
        specialty application is provided for plant growth around and
        between railroad tracks, and a general description is provided
        for preventing damage to the high voltage source of electricity
        used for the plant destruction, and for minimizing the number of
        fires started in dry material accessory to plant destruction. A
        vehicle with a high voltage electricity source is mounted on
        railroad tracks, with wheels of each wheel set for the vehicle
        being electrically isolated, and the high voltage source being
        grounded through one of the wheels. Special plant contacting
        devices comprising rounded end generally cylindrical contacting
        members are provided. The current output of the high voltage
        source is limited to prevent damage to the high voltage source,
        and the no-load voltage of the high voltage source is held to
        generally the same level as the full-load current limited
        voltage to minimize the number of fires started by the plant
        contactors.</font> <br>

        </b>A device for magnetically treating seeds prior to planting
        so as to increase the yield of plants grown from the seeds. The
        device includes a tubular member provided with an internal
        support for securing a permanent magnet therein so that as seeds
        are poured through the tubular member, they are magnetically
        treated. The magnet, which has opposite poles disposed at
        opposite ends thereof, is oriented with its longitudinal axis
        extending in the direction of the passage, the passage adjacent
        the magnet being of substantially annular shape in cross-section
        whereby a uniform cylindrical shaped magnetic field occupies the
        annular passage through which the grain must pass. The tubular
        member has a converging portion in the direction of seed travel
        so as to provide an area of maximum constriction adjacent the
        magnet which results in the seeds being funnelled radially
        inward towards the more concentrated magnetic field closest to
        the magnet. The converging or constricted portion may be shaped
        to provide the flow of seeds along streamlines so that the rate
        of flow is enhanced.</font> <br>

        </b>A machine is provided for destroying plants with electricity
        comprising a tank adapted to hold electrically conductive
        liquid, an electrode for placing the electrically conductive
        liquid in the tank at high electrical potential, including a
        high voltage source of electricity; nozzles for spraying the
        electrically conductive liquid on plants to be destroyed; and a
        structure for grounding the high voltage source. Air pressure
        provided over the liquid in the tank provides the motive force
        for spraying, and pneumatically operated valves in line with the
        nozzles are provided for selectively supplying liquid to the
        nozzles. In this way, there are no moving parts which are

        operation of the pneumatic valves, such as air limit proximity
        switches. The current output of the high voltage source is
        limited so that damage to the source is prevented, and the

        being planted with the seeds, and to provide reliable
        disinfection without using toxic agents. The seed is irradiated
        by low-energy electrons with energy and dosage controlled so
        that the surface and regions close to the surface are exposed to
        the radiation with fungicidal effect. A beam of the low-energy
        electrons is provided by an electron gun aimed at a region
        within a seed-receiving chamber at which the seeds to be
        irradiated are caused to intercept the radiation repeatedly and
        on all sides. The chamber may be at atmospheric pressure or be
        evacuated, the latter condition requiring vacuum locks at seed
        inlet and outlet ports of the chamber.</font> <br>

        </b>A system for producing nitrogen fertilizer using an electric
        arc process is described in which the electric arc necessary for
        the process is generated by piezoelectric elements actuated by a
        hammer mechanism powered by water pressure such as from a garden
        hose. The nitrogen oxides produced by the arc discharge are
        drawn into the water to serve as a source of nitrogen
        fertilizer. The net result of the invention is that the operator
        can provide nitrogen fertilizer as he supplies water to the same
        area. The only inputs to this system are air and a source of
        water under pressure.</font> <br>

        </b>A method and apparatus for controlling plant growth is
        provided. The apparatus includes a magnetic field generator for
        producing a controlled, fluctuating, directionally oriented
        magnetic field parallel to a predetermined axis projecting
        through viable plant material. In one aspect, a magnetic field
        detector measures the magnetic flux density along the
        predetermined axis. The applied magnetic field may comprise a
        full-wave rectified signal oscillated at predetermined
        frequencies to maintain a preselected ratio of frequency to the
        non-zero average value of the flux density, where the ratio is
        effective in altering the natural growth characteristics of the
        target plant material, such as accelerating growth rate. This
        ratio is maintained by adjusting the frequency of the
        fluctuating magnetic field and/or by adjusting the intensity of
        the applied magnetic field after nulling out or measuring and
        accounting for the local magnetic field in that region
        containing the target plant material.</font> <br>

        hand held tool for trimming and electrifying vegetation. The
        portable, hand swingable, weed trimmer passes electricity
        through its cutting or trimming element so as to pass
        electricity into the weeds to kill the roots of the weeds. The
        tool includes a power unit for rotation of a cutter drive. A
        pancake generator generates electricity via rotation of the
        cutter drive. Brushes between the pancake generator and the
        cutter blade conduct current to the cutter blade, which in turn
        permits the current to pass into the vegetation as the cutter
        blade trims the vegetation.</font> <br>

~









        </b>A device for the manipulation of a biological material
        [seeds] by a magnetic field is presented. The device comprises a
        magnetic field source coupled to a current source. The current
        source is of a kind supplying an electric current of at least
        two electrical degree shifted phases. The magnetic field source
        comprises a two-part inductor, each inductor part producing a
        coordinate varying magnetic field (CVMF). Each inductor part is
        formed by at least two conductors aligned in a spaced-apart
        relationship, wherein each of the at least two conductors is
        connectable to a different phase of the current source, and has
        two spaced-apart parts arranged such that when the conductor is
        connected to the current source, the electric current flows in
        its two parts in opposite directions, respectively. The
        conductors of each inductor part are arranged such that each two
        locally adjacent conductor parts are associated with two
        different phases of the electric current source. A distance
        between the two conductor parts coupled to the same phase of the
        current source defines a half-wavelength .lambda./2 of a wave of
        magnetic induction of the CVMF. This distance is selected in
        accordance with a predetermined relation between the wavelength
        .lambda. and an effective space .DELTA. within the magnetic
        field region defined by the dimensions of the biological
        material and its distance from the magnetic field source.<br>
