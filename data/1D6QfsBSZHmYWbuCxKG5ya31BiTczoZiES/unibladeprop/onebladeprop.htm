      A single-blade propeller may be used on aircraft to generate
      thrust. Normally propellers are multiblades but the simplicity of
      a single-blade propeller fits well on motorized gliders, because
      it permits the design of a smaller aperture of the glider fuselage
      for retraction of the power plant. The counterbalanced teetering
      mono-blade propeller generates fewer vibrations than conventional
      multiblade configurations[citation needed]. Everel Propeller
      Corporation in the 1940s produced the counterbalance single-blade
      propeller.[1]<br>

      </b><b>Propeller propulsion unit for aircrafts in general</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Beretta, et al.<br>
      <br>
      A propeller propulsion unit for aircrafts in general including a
      rotation shaft driven by a motor, the unit including a
      single-blade propeller and a counterweight that are connected to
      the shaft, the counterweight being arranged in a substantially
      diametrical position with respect to the single blade in order to
      balance the moment generated by centrifugal force and being
      variably offset with respect to the axis of the blade in order to
      balance the moment generated by the traction force of the
      single-blade propeller.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The present invention relates to a propeller propulsion unit for
      aircrafts in general.<br>
      <br>
      Aircrafts in general that do not use jet propulsion systems are
      conventionally provided with one or more propellers that convert
      the power supplied by the motor into traction.<br>
      <br>
      The propellers normally used are of various kinds, such as for
      example pusher or pulling propellers, with fixed or variable
      pitch, and ducted; these propellers are furthermore constituted by
      two or more blades that are arranged so as to balance, on the
      propeller axis, both the action of the centrifugal force, produced
      by the rotation of said propeller, and the moments caused by the
      aerodynamic forces generated by the relative speed of the blade
      with respect to the air.<br>
      <br>
      Propellers having a single blade are used exclusively in the field
      of flying model aircrafts, i.e., with power plants having
      extremely small power ratings.<br>
      <br>
      The use of a single-blade propeller would certainly be useful in
      many applications in aircrafts, since it would be possible to
      improve the efficiency of the propeller and have considerable
      constructive simplicity; however, this type of use has so far been
      unfeasible, since all the problems that arise from compensating
      the radially-directed forces, inertial forces, and aerodynamic
      forces, with their corresponding moments, generated by the
      relative speed of the blade with respect to the air, have not been
      solved. These factors, which also vary as the relative speed of
      the blade with respect to the air varies, would produce
      troublesome stresses and vibrations that might lead to fatigue
      failure, especially if considerable masses are involved.<br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, the use of a propulsion unit with single-blade
      propeller has never had a practical follow-up.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A principal aim of the invention is to solve the above problem by
      providing a propeller propulsion unit for aircrafts in general
      that allows to use a single-blade propeller without having
      imbalances of the forces involved that might produce vibrations or
      stresses.<br>
      <br>
      Within the scope of this aim, a particular object of the invention
      is to provide a propulsion unit in which it is possible to
      automatically compensate for any imbalances in forces, working at
      all times with a system that is balanced and as such is never in
      abnormal operating conditions.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a propeller
      propulsion unit for aircrafts in general that is capable of giving
      the greatest assurances of reliability and safety in use thanks to
      its particular constructive characteristics.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to provide a propeller
      propulsion unit for aircrafts in general that can be easily
      obtained starting from commonly commercially available elements
      and materials and is furthermore competitive from a merely
      economical point of view.<br>
      <br>
      This aim, these objects, and others that will become apparent
      hereinafter are achieved by a propeller propulsion unit for
      aircrafts in general, according to the invention, comprising a
      rotation shaft driven by a motor, characterized in that it
      comprises a single blade that is connected to said shaft and a
      counterweight that is arranged in a diametrical position with
      respect to said blade in order to balance the moment generated by
      centrifugal force and is offset with respect to the axis of said
      blade in order to balance the moment generated by the traction
      force of the single-blade propeller.<br>
      <br>

      </b><b>DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>With reference to the above figures, the propeller propulsion
      unit for aircrafts in general, according to the invention,
      comprises a rotation shaft 1 driven by a motor that is not shown
      in the drawings.<br>
      <br>
      The single blade 2 and a counterweight 3 are connected to the
      shaft 1.<br>
      <br>
      In order to solve the problem of the imbalance caused by the
      moment generated by the traction force, the center of gravity of
      the counterweight is axially offset with respect to the
      center-of-gravity axis of the blade, so as to generate a new
      moment, produced indeed by the centrifugal forces, that is capable
      of balancing the previous moment.<br>
      <br>
      In order to better clarify the concept, reference should be made
      to the diagrams of FIGS. 8 and 9, in which Fcp designates the
      centrifugal force on the blade, Fcc designates the centrifugal
      force on the counterweight, Ft designates the traction force, and
      Fr designates the resisting force of the blade.<br>
      <br>
      As shown by the accompanying drawings, in order to compensate for
      the moment produced by the traction force Ft it is necessary to
      create a moment that balances it, and this is achieved by axially
      offsetting the counterweight 3, as shown in FIG. 8, along the axis
      of the shaft 1, whereas in order to compensate for the resisting
      force of the blade, as shown in FIG. 9, an axial offset is
      produced through an angular displacement of the counterweight 3 on
      the plane that it traces by rotating; in this manner, the
      counterweight is displaced, albeit slightly, from a position that
      is exactly diametrical with respect to the blade.<br>
      <br>
      With reference to the drawings, FIG. 1 illustrates a solution with
      a counterweight 3 having a fixed axial offset, said solution being
      shown conceptually in the diagrams 8 and 9.<br>
      <br>
      This solution allows to solve the problem of the imbalance of the
      forces involved in constant flying conditions.<br>
      <br>
      However, even if operation occurs at a constant rotation rate,
      flying conditions are variable, and in particular the traction
      coefficient, and therefore the value of said traction force, can
      vary considerably.<br>
      <br>
      This variability produces an imbalance, since the balancing moment
      generated by the axial offset is fixed and therefore does not take
      into account the change in the traction force.<br>
      <br>
      In order to solve this problem, the proposed solution provides for
      a change in the axial offset, so as to balance the single-blade
      system.<br>
      <br>
      As shown schematically in the diagrams of FIGS. 10 and 11, wherein
      d designates the axial offset, one result of the present invention
      is pointed out, namely the utilization, as the traction force Ft
      varies, of a change in the axial offset d, which is achieved by
      allowing the single-blade propeller to oscillate with respect to
      the shaft by means of a pivot that allows to form an angle
      .varies., even a small one. As shown schematically in FIG. 11, it
      is thus evident that as the traction force Ft varies, the axial
      offset d also varies and the resulting moment of equilibrium is
      changed accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, therefore, a device is provided which interconnects
      the blade, the shaft, the hub, and the counterweight and is
      capable of creating, by utilizing centrifugal forces, another
      opposite moment that can vary as the traction coefficient varies.<br>
      <br>
      In order to achieve and control the movement produced by the
      centrifugal forces, the distance, measured along the rotation
      axis, between the center of gravity of the blade and the center of
      gravity of the counterweight has therefore been changed, producing
      a change in the distance that is a function of the imbalance, in
      order to achieve the intended substantial balance.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2, the distance is changed by means of a pivot 10
      that allows the hub 4, the blade 2, and the counterweight 3, which
      are rigidly provided on the hub, to rotate about an axis that is
      perpendicular to the shaft 1.<br>
      <br>
      From a conceptual design point of view, the involved centrifugal
      forces, which are extremely large, are discharged onto the hub 4,
      whereas the more modest torque transmitted from the shaft to the
      propeller is discharged onto the pivot 10.<br>
      <br>
      A solution is thus proposed that is capable of meeting the
      requirements of adapting the axial offset without having excessive
      constructive complexities.<br>
      <br>
      In the embodiment of FIG. 3, the hub 4 and the counterweight 3 are
      rigidly coupled to the shaft 1, whilst the blade 2 is pivoted to
      the hub 4, thus obtaining a conceptual diagram that is similar to
      the preceding one.<br>
      <br>
      From a conceptual design point of view, the pivot 10 of the blade
      is subjected both to almost all the torque transmitted by the
      shaft to the propeller and, most of all, to the centrifugal force
      to which the blade is subjected.<br>
      <br>
      The above-described solution therefore entails greater structural
      and construction problems, but it has the advantage that it is
      optionally possible to fold the blade 2 backward when it is not
      being used, so as to avoid creating resistance to motion.<br>
      <br>
      An intermediate solution, which is conceptually linked to the
      preceding ones, is shown in FIG. 4; in this solution, the
      counterweight 3 is arranged on the shaft 1 and the hub 4 is
      rigidly coupled to the blade and pivoted with respect to the shaft
      1.<br>
      <br>
      According to a different embodiment, the axial offset can be
      achieved, as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6, by displacing the single
      blade 2 about an axis that is substantially parallel to the axis
      of the blade 2 and is substantially perpendicular to the shaft 1.<br>
      <br>
      This variation in the axial offset value can be achieved, as shown
      in FIG. 5, by rotating the blade 2 about a secondary shaft 15 that
      is parallel to the axis of the blade 2, and therefore it is
      possible to vary both the axial offset and the pitch of the blade
      2 and therefore the traction of the propulsion system is changed
      without altering the rotation rate of the motor, thus achieving a
      simultaneous adaptation of the pitch of the blade 2 and a change
      in the extent of the axial offset between the axis of the center
      of gravity of the blade 2 and the center of gravity of the
      counterweight 3.<br>
      <br>
      This solution provides considerable advantages, such as a flying
      condition that theoretically always provides for the maximum
      efficiency of the propeller, and entails constructive difficulties
      that are considerable with respect to those described previously.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment, shown in FIG. 6, changes the pitch of the
      blade 2 and therefore Fp instead of resorting to an axial offset.<br>
      <br>
      In this case, therefore, the opposite moments are canceled out
      whilst keeping the value of traction constant at all times.<br>
      <br>
      The blade 2 in practice is rotated about its own axis, providing a
      solution that is certainly simple but has the limitation of
      providing a traction value that is theoretically always constant.<br>
      <br>
      From the above description it is thus evident that the invention
      achieves the intended aim and objects, and in particular the fact
      is stressed that a single-blade propulsion unit is provided which
      allows to compensate for the resulting imbalances in a very simple
      way, thus making this type of propulsion unit particularly adapted
      for application to powered gliders, in which it is necessary to
      retract the propulsion unit once the soaring altitude has been
      reached.<br>
      <br>
      With conventional solutions, either a fixed two-blade propeller is
      used, with the need to provide a recess that is twice the one of
      the single-blade propeller, or foldable two-blade propellers are
      used, which are structurally complicated and not very effective.<br>
      <br>
      The invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous
      modifications and variations, all of which are within the scope of
      the inventive concept. All the details may furthermore be replaced
      with other technically equivalent elements.<br>
      <br>
      In practice, the materials employed, so long as they are
      compatible with the specific use, as well as the contingent shapes
      and dimensions, may be any according to the requirements.<b><br>

      of its controls, allows execution of the manoeuvres typical of
      this type of vehicle.<br>
      <br>
      [0003] To this end, helicopters are usually equipped with vertical
      axis rotors provided with two or more identical blades joined by
      hinges or similar means to a central propeller hub, which is in
      turn fixed to the upper end of a vertical mast driven by a system
      for the transmission of the rotary motion connected to one or more
      engines.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] When maintained in rotation at the appropriate speed, the
      blades support the helicopter because of the upward lift produced
      as a consequence of the relative air speed with respect to the
      aerodynamically profiled blades. Moreover, the blades are subject
      to the weight force and, due to rotation, to the centrifugal
      force. The balance of all these forces and their moments with
      respect to the joints of the blades to the rotor hub and the mast,
      to which the weight of the rotorcraft is applied, determines the
      geometrical position of the blades, which, with respect to the
      plane orthogonal to the rotation axis, are directed upwards with a
      normally small coning angle. The entity of the total lift is
      adjusted by the pilot through the collective control lever that
      acts on the blade pitch by means of rods, levers, and rotating
      mechanisms connected with suitable pitch horns located on the hub
      of each blade, coupled in a rotary way to the rotor hub, with
      rotation axis sensibly parallel to its own longitudinal axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] The control mechanisms allow the pilot to change the pitch
      of each blade with the cyclic control lever, with respect to the
      average value determined by the collective control, in order to
      create pitch differences symmetrical to this average value, in
      positions diametrically opposed to the rotational axis, inducing
      the rotor disk to tilt, thus causing the helicopter to move in the
      corresponding direction of tilting.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Rotors are usually manufactured according to multiple
      solutions, all of which, in order to guarantee correct operation,
      require the blades to be identical in terms of entity and mass
      distribution and as similar as possible in terms of shape and
      aerodynamic behaviour, while the joints at the rotor head and the
      kinematic chain that controls their pitch must have the same
      characteristics for all the blades of the rotor. Therefore, in
      order to maintain acceptable performance, such rotors require
      frequent maintenance works of blades tracking and balance,
      involving complicated procedures and methods and using special
      equipment.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] In such multi-blade rotors, the lifting surface is divided
      between the blades of the rotor. With the same diameter and
      solidity, in a multiblade rotor each blade has a shorter mean
      chord which, for a given rotor tip, results in a lower value of
      the ratio between the product of the speed multiplied by the chord
      and the kinematic viscosity of the air (Reynolds Number). Since
      this lower value results in an increased blade drag coefficient
      for a given lift, it is therefore convenient to reduce the number
      of blades.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Moreover, it must be stressed that the rotation of each
      lifting blade produces a wake that can disturb the following
      blade, especially during hovering or low speed flight, with
      negative effects on its performance. The time interval between the
      passage of one blade in a disk area and the following as the
      number of rotor blades decreases, under given conditions, thus
      reducing the perturbation of the air in which the rotor operates.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] In view of the above considerations, whenever possible, the
      adoption of a reduced number of blades can give aerodynamic
      advantages over similar rotors with a higher number of blades.
      Moreover, the reduction in the number of blades decreases the
      number of components and moving parts, leading to the simple
      bi-blade rotor with suspended hub connected to the mast with a
      horizontal hinge normal to the rotation axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Experiments have also been carried out with single-blade
      rotors in which the blade is balanced by a counterweight, but the
      difficulties in obtaining an acceptable balance between the forces
      and moments acting on such rotors under various operating
      conditions have not allowed the application and diffusion of such
      solutions.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The main purpose of the present invention is to overcome
      the inconveniences found in multi-blade and single-blade
      helicopters of known type, by means of a main rotor system for
      helicopters consisting of a single blade with central hub, a
      counterweight and balancing devices, having high flexibility and
      adaptability and characterised by easy construction, safe use and
      efficient operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] The second purpose of the present invention is to create a
      single-blade rotor system, with working mechanism, in which the
      balance of the forces and moments acting on its parts is obtained
      by means of the reciprocal positions assumed by these parts as the
      coning angle of the single blade varies. The mechanisms
      controlling rotor balancing may be kinematic systems of known
      type, or other electromechanical or hydraulic devices. In any
      case, the horizontal component of the lift of the single blade is
      balanced by an identical opposed misbalance of centrifugal
      inertial forces, obtained by moving the rotor centre of mass
      relative to its rotation axis.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] The third purpose of the present invention is to devise a
      rotor system, with control mechanisms, which does not require
      blades-tracking to ensure correct operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Last, but not least, another aim of the present invention
      is to design a mechanism capable of creating and maintaining a
      stable balance between the elements of the single-blade rotor
      during operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] These and other aims, which will be highlighted in the
      description below, can all be achieved by the present invention.<br>
      <br>

      <b><br>
      </b>[0023] The above figures show that the hub (1) of the rotor is
      joined to the support (14) of the blade (8) and made up of a
      vertical pair of plates (1a and 1b) symmetrical to the mast (7).
      The blade (8) is joined to the support (14) by a pitch hinge of
      known type, so that the blade can rotate around its longitudinal
      axis A-A, changing its geometrical pitch through joints and
      devices of known type, very similar to those generally used in
      helicopter rotors, applied to the pitch horn (9) of the blade,
      controlled by the rod (10).<br>
      <br>
      [0024] The blade (8) is also fitted with a hinge, of virtual type
      also, with axis B-B in vertical and eccentric position with
      respect to the axis Y-Y of the mast which allows it to assume an
      angular position in the plane orthogonal to the rotational axis
      Y-Y, the said hinge being equipped with a damper or similar known
      devices.<br>
      <br>
      [0025] The two plates (1a and 1b) making up the hub (1) contain
      two holes (1c) on the same axis R-R in which the cylindrical body
      (2) is coupled in a rotary way, the said body being centrally
      hollow and coupled in a rotary way also to the top of the mast (7)
      by means of a pair of opposing pins (7a), appropriately provided
      with friction devices 30, 31, with axis X-X normal to the same
      mast. The two opposite sides of the cylindrical body (2) also
      house two rotating coaxial cylinders (3) with axis T-T eccentric
      to the other axis R-R and X-X in a rotary way. The cylinders (3)
      are housed in an opposing coaxial pair of eccentric holes (2b)
      located in the aforementioned hollow body (2), which features
      another opposing coaxial pair of holes (2a), housing the pin (7a)
      mentioned above.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] These cylinders (3) are in turn connected through revolving
      eccentric pins (4) to two pairs of identical levers (5) of the hub
      (11) of the counterweight, comprising the hub (11) placed at the
      end of an arm (12), featuring a profiled mass (13) at the other
      end.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] The hub (11) is hinged in a rotary way to the rotor hub (1)
      by conaxic hinges (6) with appropriate friction devices, normal to
      the longitudinal axis of the counterweight; the joining of the
      centre of the pins (6) with the barycenter of the counterweight
      (13) determines a direction C-C. The hinges have threaded ends
      (6a).<br>
      <br>
      [0028] More exactly, the hinges (6) are housed in two opposite
      coaxial holes located on the plates (1a and 1b) of the hub (1)
      along an axis W-W parallel to, but underlying, the axis X-X.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] When the blade rotates without lift (FIG. 1), it rotates in
      almost the same horizontal plane as the counterweight , whose axis
      is formed by extending the axis A-A.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] When the pilot increases the geometrical pitch of the
      rotating blade with the collective control, the lift inclines the
      blade upwards at a coning angle ([beta]) such that the lift
      balances with the other forces and moments acting on the blade
      (FIG. 3). When executing this movement the blade (8) drags the hub
      (1) to which it is joined, which rotates around the axis (R-R) of
      the cylindrical body (2) at a corresponding angle ([beta]).<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The rotation also takes place with respect to the
      counterweight, which maintains its longitudinal axis orthogonal to
      the rotation axis Y'-Y' of the rotor. Thanks to this relative
      motion, the cylinders (3) linked by the revolving eccentric pins
      (4) to the levers (5) of the counterweight and the cylindrical
      body (2), coupled in a rotary way to the hub (1) rotate around
      each other, determining a new position of the hub (1) relative to
      the rotational axis Y-Y, along the direction C-C, passing through
      X-X that is, a different position of the rotor centre of mass with
      respect to the rotational axis. Since the lift is perpendicular to
      the blade, the coning of the blade involves a horizontal component
      of the lift, directed towards the centre of rotation. The
      horizontal force composes with the inertial forces affecting the
      blade and the counterweight. By appropriately dimensioning the
      relative positions of the pins (4), the hinges (6) and the axes
      R-R, X-X, T-T using known calculation methods of known type and
      considering the masses and positions of the relative barycentres
      of the blade, counterweight and the other components of the rotor
      and the mutual joints, it is possible, within the normal range of
      coning values to set up a sufficiently approximate and stable
      balance which remains constant on variating the coning angle and
      is practically independent of the rotational speed of the rotor,
      since the forces that act on the rotor-whether due to lift or
      inertia-all proportional to the square of the rotational speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] The pitch variations, caused by the pilot acting on of the
      cyclic control from the pilot or determined by the asymmetry of
      the air flow investing the blade during horizontal flight, cause
      the rotational plane of the counterweight to tilt, with consequent
      tilting of the entire rotor around the axis X-X, as illustrated in
      FIG. 4, thus allowing the helicopter to be moved and controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIG. 5 illustrates a second embodiment-but not last-of the
      present invention in which the displacement of the rotor centre of
      mass relative to the rotational axis Y'-Y' and along the direction
      C-C, in order to balance the horizontal component of the lift, is
      carried out by an electromechanical actuator (15) acting between
      pins (16) and (17), respectively joined to the hub (1) of the
      rotor and the cylindrical body (2), which is in turn coupled in a
      rotary way with the hub, electrically controlled by a control box
      (18) according to the value detected and transmitted with
      electrical signals by the telescopic detection device (19) of
      known type of the relative distance assumed by the points (20) and
      (21), in relation to which the detector (19) is respectively
      hinged to the hub (11) of the counterweight and the hub (1) of the
      rotor, as the coning of the blade (8) changes.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In fact, the control box is designed and programmed using
      known calculation methods and construction systems, so that for
      each coning value of the blade, as measured by the detector device
      (19), the actuator (15) causes the cylindrical body (2) to rotate
      around the hub (1) so that the rotor centre of mass relative to
      the rotation axis, passing through X-X, assumes the correct
      position to ensure balance between the aerodynamic and inertial
      forces acting on the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] FIG. 6 illustrates a third embodiment of the present
      invention, in which the actuator (15) controlled by the control
      box (18) radially displaces the mobile mass (22) that slides on
      the rod (12) of the counterweight, according to the coning angle
      measured by detector (19), thus changing the position of the rotor
      centre of mass relative to the rotational axis of the rotor.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The actuator (15) is joined by hinging pins (16 and 16a) to
      one of the plates of the hub (1) and to the mobile mass (22).<br>
      <br>
      [0037] In this construction version the two plates of the hub (1)
      only show two opposing holes (23) located along the same axis X-X
      perpendicular to the rotational axis Y-Y of the rotor. The holes
      (23) house the pins (7a) located at the top of the mast (7).<br>

      </b><b>US 6234422</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b>The invention is related to air flight vehicles, such as
      vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) airplanes, helicopters and
      covercraft.The goal of this invention is to create an air rotor
      designed so that while after vertical take off or cover regime,
      one can be stopped, fixed in a specific position and hidden into
      the fuselage (gondola) thus eliminating of air resistance when the
      rotor is not in working state. On landing this rotor can be
      extended out, brought into rotation and used for creation of lift
      force and vertical landing.The indicated goal is achieved by means
      of the rotor made as single blade (uniblade). The author solved
      the problem of force and moment balance of single blade. The
      center of gravity of the counterweight is located below the
      horizontal plane, and the blade has the horizontal sway axle, that
      crosses the vertical rotor rotation axis. The author offer this
      rotor on single axis, on co-axis, and on different exiles.This
      uniblade rotor is designed to subsonic and supersonic VTOL
      airplanes, for helicopter cars, flight motorcycles, hoppycopters,
      and hovercraft.The uniblades be used also as a veritable sweep
      wing (for subsonic and supersonic aircraft).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><b><br>
      </b><b>1. Field of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      This invention is related to air flight vehicles, such as
      apparatus of vertical take off and landing (VTOL), helicopters,
      covercraft, flighting automobiles, motorcycles, and traditional
      airplanes.<br>
      <br>
      2. Description of the Related Art.<br>
      <br>
      Known in art are helicopter rotors having 2, 3, 4, 6 and more
      blades (Jane's Aircraft Directory, 1995-1996), (FIG. 1a-d).
      Requirement of 2 or more blades is dictated by the blades
      aerodynamic force and weight balance. Total resultant lift force
      of blades thrust must act along blade axis O (FIG. 1) and blades'
      centrifugal force must be balanced, while the blade horizontal
      axis Oi is located close to vertical axis O, but Oi and O do not
      cross each other (FIG. 1e).<br>
      <br>
      <b>BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The goal of this invention is to create an air rotor designed so
      that while in flight, it can be stopped, fixed in a specific
      position and hidden into the fuselage (gondola0 thus eliminating
      air drag when the rotor is not in working state.<br>
      <br>
      On lending this rotor can be extended out, brought into rotation
      and used for creation of lift force and vertical landing.<br>
      <br>
      The indicated goal is achieved by means of the rotor made as
      single blade (uniblade). The center of gravity of the counter
      weight B (FIG. 2) is located below the horizontal blade plane, and
      blade has the horizontal sway axis O1 that crosses the vertical
      rotor's rotation axis O (FIG. 2a).<br>
      <br>
      Uniblade rotor has huge advantages when compared to a helicopter
      rotor with 2,3 of more blades. The uniblade rotor can be stopped
      (in direction of air stream) and moved in to the fuselage
      (gondola). In hidden position, the uniblade rotor does not
      interfere with the air flow whereby the air vehicle can reach
      designed speed, even supersonic speed. On landing, the uniblade
      rotor is easy to move out of the fuselage, bring into rotation and
      make landing in helicopter mode.<br>
      <br>
      However, the uniblade rotor posses a problem of the blade
      balancing. The most important of which is that large unbalanced
      blade lifting force P rotates along circumference Q together with
      the blade at angular speed .omega. (FIG. 2b) and creates large
      capsizing moment, direction of which also changes (rotates).<br>
      <br>
      In order to eliminate these negative effects, the inventor
      proposes to place the blade counterbalance B. The counter balance
      gravity center is shifted down (distance CB in FIG. 2a) from the
      blade plane, and for elimination of the capsizing moment, the axis
      of horizontal swing O of the blade is located so that it crosses
      rotation axis O of the engine power drive.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      As shown in FIG. 2, uniblade rotor comprises blade 1,
      counterbalance B, horizontal axle of blade swing O situated in the
      blade plane and crossing vertical drive axle O. Counterbalance B
      is shifted down at distance CB from the blade plane. This distance
      CB could go to zero in limit in presence of axle O.<br>
      <br>
      The uniblade rotor work as follows. Lift force P (FIG. 2) created
      by a rotating blade, causes moment M (FIG. 3) that tends to rotate
      the blade counter-clockwise. Counterbalance centrifugal force F
      (FIG. 2a), due to the counterbalance shifted down, also creates
      counterweight moment M (FIG. 3) with direction opposite to moment
      M (FIG. 3).<br>
      <br>
      Resultant lift force P acts along drive rotation axle ) and
      balances flight vehicle weight G (FIG. 3). The blade and
      counterbalance centrifugal forces F1 and F2 are also balanced, F1
      =F2.<br>
      <br>
      Co-axial uniblade rotors rotate synchronously and meet on line KL
      of movement direction of the flight vehicle (FIG. 4). In this
      position the blades are parallel to each other which makes it
      possible to keep distance between the blades (unirotors) small,
      actually much smaller than in traditional co-axial multiblade
      helicopter propellers. This results in uniblade having
      significantly simpler design and increased rotor efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      The main blade can has the additional small blade at the end (FIG.
      4b). That may be turning or interning. This end blade increase the
      rotor efficiency and trust about ground. The trust and ratio of
      fuel depend strong from distance, which is from the end of
      additional blade to ground. The trust may increase in 2-6 times.
      It is important for covercraft-helicopter (FIG. 14). In regime of
      cover this vehicle can move over marsh, river, sand. And in regime
      of helicopter one can flight over forest, precipice, mountains and
      so on.<br>
      <br>
      The end blade has a sensor of distance from end of additional
      blade to ground, for example, ultrasonic sensor. The additional
      blade can rotate and follow to profile of ground surface (see FIG.
      4b).<br>
      <br>
      The uniblade can be make of folding (FIG. 15). That can have hinge
      2 and lock 3. The folding may used on flying car, motorcycle,
      holycopter, covercraft and military VTOL airplanes and
      helicopters.<br>
      <br>
      As you see on FIG. 15c the size of aircraft may be decreased more
      than two times, and request area for storage in 4 times.<br>
      <br>
      In case of a coupled rotor, thanks to only one blade in the
      uniblade rotor, distance between axles of the two uniblade rotors
      can be made smaller than in multiblade variant. In this case the
      meeting line KL (of the synchronously rotating rotors) is
      perpendicular to flight direction (FIG. 5).<br>
      <br>
      Various versions of the uniblade use are shown in FIGS. 6 to 13.
      FIG. 6 shows a supersonic fighter aircraft with the uniblade
      rotor. The rotors reaction here is balance by the gas jet of the
      aircraft. FIG. 7 shows the subsonic transport VTOL airplane having
      the uniblade rotor reaction of which is balanced by the
      single-blade tail propeller. FIG. 8 shows the small subsonic
      passenger VTOL airplane with uniblade rotor. FIG. 9 shows the
      flight car with co-axial uniblade rotors. One can be used as
      helicopter and as a car. FIG. 10 shows the flight motorcycle for
      young people. One can be used as a helicopter and as a motorcycle.
      FIG. 11 shows the small knapsack helicopter (hoppycopter) for
      young people, sportsmen, and soldiers with uniblades co-axial
      rotors. It can be put on shoulders of man and allow people to flay
      with maximum speed 50 mph (80 km/h), in ceiling of 12000 foot
      (4000 m), and range of 100 miles (160 km). FIG. 12 shows high
      speed vertical takeoff and landing airplane having co-axial rotors
      blades of which serve as variable geometry wings.<br>
      <br>
      The blade of the uniblade rotor may have such a form of the widen
      part where the counterbalance is placed, that the resultant of
      lift force pressure and resistance is located at the vertical
      connecting axle. Thanks to this blade in the stopped position can
      work in flight as a high-speed variable swept wing (FIG. 13).<br>
      <br>
      The uniblade rotor can have a mechanism for breaking, stopping,
      moving into the fuselage and moving out of the fuselage and
      rotating--all can be done in flight. Moreover, a mechanism for the
      rotor move-out operations can be made as either movable axle or as
      sliding axle of varying length. In removed state, the rotor does
      not create any drag and speed of the air vehicle can reach its
      designed value, including supersonic level. On landing, the rotor
      is moved out of the fuselage and starts rotating. It must be noted
      that this is possible only with a single-blade (uniblade) rotor.
      For rotors with 2, 3 or more blades, it is practically impossible
      to design in-flight rotor stopping and removal mechanism. The air
      stream would immediately destroy rotor, or topples a flight
      vehicle. Moreover, it is very difficult from a technical point of
      view, to move in and move out several blades.<br>
      <br>
      Even with out hiding an uniblade rotor in flight, the single blade
      is positioned along the air stream and creates a little drag.
      Dimensional sizes of an flight vehicle with the uniblade rotor is
      less than sizes of a helicopter, and the apparatus can be quickly
      prepared for flight.<br>
      <br>

      The invention relates to a single leaf screw disposed on a drive
      shaft with an extension shaft, the vane disposed counterweight
      that is disposed perpendicular to the drive shaft, so that the
      blade screw about its own in extending the service of the
      underpinning axis located. Said Influence of centrifugal force and
      also under the influence of air resistance can be pivoted.<br>
      <br>
