      Rustum Roy (July 3, 1924 - August 26, 2010) was a materials
      scientist who held visiting professorships in materials science at
      Arizona State University and in medicine at the University of
      Arizona, as well as an emeritus position at Pennsylvania State
      University in three departments. He described himself as a science
      policy analyst, advocate of interdisciplinary education and
      alternative medicine, and science and religion.<br>
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Education and career</span><br>
      <br>
      Roy was born in Ranchi, Bihar Province, India. In 1942 he received
      BS in Physical Chemistry from Patna University and in 1944 his MS
      from the same university. He earned a Ph.D. in ceramics at Penn
      State in 1948, and became an American citizen in 1961. He had a
      long career at Penn State in geochemistry and materials science.
      He founded the Materials Science Laboratory at Penn State and
      authored hundreds of technical papers. Roy was a member of the
      National Academy of Engineering. Publishing in a journal for which
      he was editor-in-chief, he wrote about the relevance of the
      structure of water to homeopathy[1] which he defended from
      'Homeophobia' by letter to The Guardian.[2] He referred to himself
      as a "citizen scientist."<br>

      We demonstrate in this paper that common crystalline phases can be
      made noncrystalline and hard magnets can be converted to soft
      magnets in the solid state in several seconds at temperatures far
      below the melting points. New crystal structures and magnetic
      structures of ferromagnetic oxides (ferrites such as BaFe12O19,
      CoFe2O4, Fe3O4, and ZnFe2O4, etc.) are formed by reacting either
      the stoichiometric mixture of oxides or the preformed phase-pure
      crystalline material in a pure H field (or E field) at microwave
      (2.45 GHz) frequencies. These major changes in the magnetic
      properties as well as major structural phase changes are caused by
      the magnetic field.<br>

      microwaves have been harnessed for weaponry, but not for useful
      commercial applications. The standard configuration consists of a
      power supply, magnetron and horn antenna. Modifications of this
      configuration described by Cornwell, produced a radiation which
      has radically new effects on materials. We report the effects of
      915 MHz and 2.45 GHz directed fields, conventional versus
      modified, on a wide-range of materials, liquids and solids, and

      <br>
      Polarized radiation and epitaxy are presented here as key vectors
      for structuring water. <br>
      <br>
      Raman spectroscopy reveals that liquid water treated with 2.45 GHz
      polarized microwave and 13.56 MHz radiofrequency radiation
      undergoes dramatic structural changes, including striking
      reduction in the main O-H stretching modes which relax to normal
      on the order of several hours,&nbsp; while other structural
      changes persist for days or weeks. <br>
      <br>
      Water containing small amounts of NaCl in presence of a polarized
      radiofrequency fields, causes an unpredicted electrodeless
      dissociation of water, splitting the O-H bond to generate nascent
      hydrogen and oxygen, which can be burned, and/or which can
      spontaneously ignite. <br>
      <br>
      For epitaxial structuring, water properties, including surface
      tension and viscosity, have been altered using macroscopic, large,
      ultrahard phases: corundum, diamond and quartz crystals. This led
      to the development of a silica gel sol that is used in industrial
      applications and in the health industry.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- A process for
      heating a material (30) includes providing a microwave radiation
      source (14) and a processing chamber (12). The process includes
      generating a region of pure magnetic field from the microwave
      radiation in the processing chamber (12). A region of pure
      electric field from the microwave radiation is also generated. The
      material (30) is positioned in the region of pure magnetic field
      while no portion of the material is positioned in the region of
      pure electric field and the material is heated in the region of
      pure magnetic field. The heating may be conducted to sinter the
      material (30) which may include a metal.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The present invention relates to methods for processing materials
      in the presence of microwave energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Background</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Application of microwave energy to process various kinds of
      materials in an efficient, economic, and effective matter, is
      emerging as an innovative technology.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave heating of materials is fundamentally different from
      conventional radiation-conduction-convection heating. In the
      microwave process, the heat is generated internally within the
      material instead of originating from external heating sources.
      Microwave heating is a sensitive function of the material being
      processed.<br>
      <br>
      Microwaves are electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging
      from 1 mm to 1 m in free space and frequency between approximately
      300 GHz to 300<br>
      MHz, respectively. Today, microwaves at the 2.45 GHz frequency are
      used almost universally for industrial and scientific
      applications. The microwaves can be transmitted, absorbed, or
      reflected, depending on the material type with which they
      interact.<br>
      <br>
      In conventional sintering processes, extremely high temperatures,
      long processing times and, in some cases, hot pressing or hot
      isostatic processing must be applied in the fabrication of
      products to achieve the highest density and minimum porosity.
      Conventional powder processing involves the compaction of a powder
      into the desired shape following by sintering. Typically, powders
      in the range of 1 to 120 micrometers are employed. The powder is
      placed in a mold and compacted by applying pressure to the mold.
      The powder compact is porous. Its density depends upon the
      compaction pressure and the resistance of the particles to
      deformation.<br>
      <br>
      The powder compact is then heated to promote bonding of the powder
      particles. The sintering temperature is such as to cause atomic
      diffusion and neck formation between the powder particles. The
      diffusion process can yield a substantially dense body upon
      completion of the sintering cycle. Such a process is used in
      industry for a variety of products and applications.<br>
      <br>
      Microwave sintering processes have unique advantages over
      conventional sintering processes. The fundamental difference is in
      the heating mechanism. In conventional heating, heat is generated
      by heating elements (resistive heating) and then transferred to
      samples via radiation, conduction and convection. In microwave
      heating, sample materials themselves absorb microwave power and
      then transform microwave energy to heat within the sample volume.<br>
      <br>
      The use of microwave processing typically reduces sintering time
      by a factor of 10 or more. This minimizes grain growth. The fine
      initial microstructure can be retained without using grain growth
      inhibitors and hence achieve high mechanical strength. The heating
      rates for a typical microwave process are high and the overall
      cycle times are reduced by similar amounts as with the process
      sintering time, for example from hours/days to minutes. Microwave
      processing of materials has the potential to yield products having
      improved mechanical properties with additional benefits of short
      processing times and low energy usage.<br>
      <br>
      Typical microwave processing procedures utilize a mixed electric
      field and magnetic field condition, with the sample placed into a
      chamber where it is exposed to both the electric field and the
      magnetic field generated by the microwaves.<br>
      <br>
      Cherrardi et al., in Electroceramics IV. Vol. II, (eds. Wasner,
      R., Hoffmann, S.,Bonnenberg, D., &amp; Hoffmann, C.) RWTN, Aachen,
      1219-1224 (1994), published a paper indicating that both the
      magnetic field and electric field may contribute to the sintering
      of certain materials.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Summary</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      One embodiment relates to a process including providing a
      microwave radiation source and a processing chamber. The process
      includes generating a region of pure magnetic field from the
      microwave radiation in the processing chamber. A region of pure
      electric field from the microwave radiation is also generated. A
      material is positioned in the region of pure magnetic field while
      no portion of the material is positioned in the region of pure
      electric field, and the material is heated in the region of pure
      magnetic field. In one aspect of certain related embodiments, the
      heating is conducted to sinter the material. In another aspect of
      certain related embodiments, the material includes a metal.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment relates to a method including providing a
      microwave radiation source and a processing chamber. A first
      region of maximum magnetic field from the microwave radiation is
      generated in the processing chamber, and a second region of
      maximum electric field from the microwave radiation is generated
      in the processing chamber. A body is positioned in only one of the
      first region and the second region during a first time period. The
      body is positioned in the other of the first region and the second
      region during a second time period. In an aspect of certain
      related embodiments, a first portion of the body is heated during
      the first time period and a second portion of the body is heated
      during the second time period, wherein during the first time
      period the first portion is heated to a higher temperature than
      the second portion, and during the second time period the second
      portion is heated to a higher temperature than the first portion.<br>
      <br>
      Another embodiment relates to a method for heating including
      providing a substrate having a layer of material thereon. One of
      the substrate and the layer is positioned in one pure field
      selected from the group consisting of a microwave generated pure
      magnetic field and a microwave generated pure electric field,
      during a first time period. The one of the substrate and the layer
      is heated layer to a temperature greater than that of the other.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Fig. 1 illustrates a microwave system 10 including a finely tuned
      waveguided cavity 12 with a cross-sectional area of 86mm by 43 mm
      which works in TE, 03 single mode which was used to investigate
      the microwave heating of several materials in different microwave
      fields using a 2.45 GHz, 1.2 kW microwave generator 14 (Toshiba,
      Japan). The system also includes a circulator and water dummy load
      16, a frequency tuner 18, microwave power monitor 18, and
      temperature monitor 20 (infrared pyrometer from Mikron Instrument
      Co., Model<br>
      M90-BT with a temperature range of-50 C to 1000 C) connected to
      the cavity 12.<br>
      <br>
      A gas supply may also be connected for atmospheric control.<br>
      <br>
      Figs. 2 (a)-2 (d) illustrates the cavity 12 in more detail. The
      cavity is rectangular in cross-section and has a length a = 12.4
      cm. A quartz tube 22 is positioned in the cavity 12 to hold the
      sample 30 and to permit easy atmospheric control. As seen in Figs.
      2 (a) and 2 (b), the samples may be positioned at location (a) at
      the center of the chamber or at position (b) at the side wall of
      the cavity. Fig. 2 (c) illustrates the position of the temperature
      monitor 20 when a sample 30 is positioned in the electric field
      region. Fig. 2 (d) shows the electric field E and magnetic field H
      distributions along the length a (as seen in Fig. 2 (b) of the
      chamber. In the location halfway along the length of the cavity,
      the maximum electric field is in the center of the cross-section,
      where the magnetic field is a minimum, and the maximum magnetic
      field is near the wall, where the electric field is at a minimum.
      During experimental processing runs nitrogen gas was passed
      through the tube 22 to avoid oxidation of metal samples at
      elevated temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      A number of samples were prepared and sintered using the
      experimental set up described above. The samples were centered
      either at the electric field maximum node or at the magnetic field
      maximum node. The electric field maximum region and the magnetic
      field maximum region in the experimental set up described above
      are separated by about 6 cm, hence, the sample sizes of about
      6.25mm (1/4 inch) diameter pellets are small. It should be noted
      that depending on the size of the sample, it is possible that the
      entire sample may not lie at the absolute maximum of the magnetic
      field or electric field. For example, if the maximum electric
      field is located at the center point of the cavity, then part of
      the sample may be positioned exactly at the center point, and part
      of the sample may be positioned slightly adjacent to the center
      point. As such, the part that is positioned slightly adjacent may
      not be exposed to the maximum electric field and minimum magnetic
      field. As a result, when the samples are described herein as being
      positioned at a"maximum" field region or a"minimum"field region,
      or at a"pure"field region, it is understood that a portion of the
      sample may be positioned slightly adjacent to the maximum field
      point, minimum field point, or pure field point.<br>
      <br>
      A first sample was a commercial powdered metal having a
      composition of Fe-2wt% Cu-0.8wt% C (obtained from Keystone
      Powdered-Metal Company, Saint Marys, PA). In the pure or maximum
      electric field region, the sample reached a maximum temperature of
      180 C after being microwave heated for 8 minutes, as seen in Fig.
      3 (a). In the maximum magnetic field region, the sample heated up
      quickly and uniformly. The heating rate was higher than 300 C per
      minute in the first two minutes, then it slowed down. The final
      temperature reading was 780 C after 10 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      A cobalt powder-compact sample displayed similar behavior to the
      Fe2wt% Cu-0.8wt% C sample described above. There was little
      heating effect in the maximum electric field region, with the
      sample reaching a temperature of only about 150-200 C in 10
      minutes. There was a high heating rate in the maximum magnetic
      field region, with the sample reaching a temperature of about 550
      C in about 2 minutes, and further increasing to a temperature of
      about 700 C at 10 minutes, as seen in Fig. 3b.<br>
      <br>
      A copper powder-compact sample was also tested and displayed fast
      heating when placed in the maximum electric field region and when
      placed in the maximum magnetic field region. As seen in Fig, 3c,
      the sample temperature rose to about 600700 C and then dropped
      down to-500 C and remained within the range of about 500-550 C
      during the heating. In the maximum electric field region, the
      sample reached maximum temperature in about 1-2 minutes. In the
      magnetic field region, the same reached maximum temperature in
      about 3-4 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      For comparison to the copper powder-compact sample, a solid copper
      bar with the same shape and size was tested to determine its
      energy absorption and heating behavior (Fig. 3d). There was little
      or no temperature rise in the solid copper bar in either the
      maximum electric field region or the maximum magnetic field
      region. After being exposed in the microwave field for 10 minutes,
      the sample remained at room temperature, as seen in Fig. 3d.<br>
      <br>
      Non-metal samples were also tested. Alumina is a typical ceramic
      material with excellent dielectric properties. Alumina usually has
      a very low dielectric loss, and it is generally not easy to heat
      up by microwaves, particularly at lower temperatures. Since the
      dielectric loss of alumina increases with temperature, microwave
      heating of alumina becomes more efficient at high temperature.<br>
      <br>
      Alumina powder-compact samples doped with 0. 05wt% MgO (from
      Baikowski<br>
      International, Charlotte, NC) were tested (Fig. 3e). In the
      maximum electric field region, the heating rate speeded up after
      the sample reached a temperature of about 400-500 C. In the
      maximum magnetic field region, the alumina sample barely heated
      up, as seen in Fig. 3e.<br>
      <br>
      Tungsten carbide (from Teledyne) powder-compact samples were also
      tested.<br>
      <br>
      The WC samples exhibited different behavior than the alumina
      samples. As seen in<br>
      Fig. 3f, the heating rate was rapid in the maximum magnetic field
      region, reaching a maximum of about 700 C in 3-4 minutes and then
      leveling out. In the maximum electric field region, the heating
      rate was slow, and after 7 minutes of heating the sample
      temperature was only about 180 C and there was some electrical
      discharging around the sample.<br>
      <br>
      Two types of composite samples were also tested, including
      aluminapowdered metal (50% A1203 and 50% (Fe-2wt% Cu-0.8wt% C))
      and tungsten carbide-cobalt (WC-10% Co).<br>
      <br>
      For the alumina-metal composition, in the maximum magnetic field
      region, the sample was rapidly heated to a temperature of about
      900 C in about 1-2 minutes and then leveled out. In the maximum
      electric field region, the reached a temperature of about 400 C in
      about 2 minutes and then leveled out.<br>
      <br>
      For the tungsten carbide-cobalt sample, in the maximum magnetic
      field region, the sample was rapidly heated to a temperature of
      about 400 C in about 2 minutes and then continued to increase to a
      temperature of about 650 C in 10 minutes. In the maximum electric
      field region, the sample was barely heated at all, reaching a
      temperature of about 100 C in 10 minutes.<br>
      <br>
      It should be noted that there was no insulation placed around the
      samples, and as such, thermal loss was likely significant at the
      higher temperatures, leading to lower heating rates at the higher
      temperature ranges. In addition, for the experimental set-up
      described above, it is believed that placing the center of the
      sample within about 3 mm of the maximum or minimum field point
      will yield similar results. In addition, a fixed microwave power
      for testing runs was not used because for some samples, the
      temperature increase was too fast to be measured with the
      pyrometer, and for certain conditions, discharging and arcing
      occurred. As a result, the samples were tested at the powers set
      forth in Table 1 below.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Table I. Microwave power applied
        to test materials.</span><br>

      powdered metal compact (Fe-2% Cu-0.8% C) samples 200<br>
      cobalt powder-compact samples 150<br>
      copper powder-compact samples 150<br>
      solid copper rod samples 150<br>

      tungsten carbide powder-compact samples 150<br>
      alumina-powder-compact metal composite samples 120<br>
      tungsten carbide-cobalt powder-compact samples 200<br>
      From the above results, it is apparent that different materials
      have different heating behaviors in the electric and magnetic
      field regions, and that exposure to either the electric field
      alone or the magnetic field alone can be used for processing a
      variety of materials. In general, the higher conductivity samples,
      such as the powdered metal sample, can be more rapidly and
      efficiently heated in the maximum magnetic field region. The pure
      ceramic alumina sample with low conductivity exhibited a more
      rapid and efficient heating rate in the maximum electric field
      region.<br>

      Fig. 4 illustrates microstructures of a pure Cu powder compact
      microwave heated in the maximum magnetic field region for 10
      minutes, including (A) surface region with no sintering and
      considerable porosity; (B) interlayer region with little sintering
      and some porosity ; and (C) core region fully sintered with little
      or no porosity. Fig. 5 shows a portion of the experimental set-up
      during microwave heating of a Fe-Cu-C powdered metal sample in the
      maximum magnetic field region.<br>

      Embodiments may find application in a variety materials processing
      applications. For example, for certain types of electronic devices
      it may be desirable to heat only a portion of the device. By
      properly positioning the device, a particular portion may be
      subjected to the maximum magnetic field or electric field region
      in order to heat up the particular portion. One example of an
      application would be to heat a metal deposited on a ceramic
      substrate. By subjecting the metal to the magnetic field region,
      it may be possible to heat the metal while the ceramic is not
      heated, due to the different interactions of the metal and the
      ceramic with the magnetic field. Such a process may be suitable
      for activating catalysts, processing semiconductor devices,
      forming coating, etc., where different materials can be heated
      differently depending on their interactions with the magnetic
      field or electric field generated by the microwave processing
      system. Numerous materials may be processed according to
      embodiments of the present invention, including, but not limited
      to metals, ceramics, semiconductors, superconductors, polymers,
      composites and glasses. The term metals includes not only pure
      metals but also other materials having metallic properties, such
      as alloys.<br>
      <br>
      In semiconductor processing, it is sometimes necessary to heat a
      particular layer in order to, for example, activating a dopant,
      annealing a metal, causing reflow of an electrode, etc. Microwave
      processing by exposing the necessary region to a separate
      essentially pure magnetic field and/or electric field enables one
      region to be heated while other regions, which may be damaged by
      heat, are kept at a lower temperature. In addition, it is possible
      to configure a processing system so that a sample can be moved
      through the regions of maximum magnetic and/or electric field as
      desired. Such a system may be a stand alone processing system or
      attached to a larger processing system having multiple processing
      chambers, such as a semiconductor processing cluster tool.<br>

      present invention, in its various aspects, will be apparent to
      those skilled in the art. The scope of the invention should not be
      limited by the particular embodiments described herein.<br>
      <br>
