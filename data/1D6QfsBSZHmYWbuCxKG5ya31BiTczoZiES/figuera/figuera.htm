              1910 AntiGravity News » A Letter From Nicola Tesla</b></big><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          Living down in Tenerife in the Spanish Canary islands it isn’t
          often one gets to hear of local inventors that have rubbed
          shoulders with Nicola TESLA. So when a friend of mine
          mentioned a letter Tesla wrote to a friend which mentioned the
          Canary Islands my ears pricked up.&nbsp; Figueras Was unknown
          to me and to everyone i spoke to. But the press cutting that
          Tesla sent to his friend was making truly remarkable claims
          that Figuera had invented a machine capable of extracting
          electricity from the atmosphere. This was one of Teslas
          predictions. That was over 2 years ago and it seemed I was the
          only one with an interest&nbsp; , that is until this week I
          found this story , written by someone with the same curiosity
          as myself who, had encountered this story and had followed it
          up. Originally written in Spanish but translated by me , it
          shows&nbsp; Sr. Figueras was completely unknown to the
          locals.&nbsp; I found lots of news paper cuttings , one of
          which Tesla cut out at the time and sent to his friend.&nbsp;
          Beyond the initial press clamor of 1902, I could only find
          reference to his partner, a Sr. Blasberge having been made
          director of the local gas works in the 1920’s. This sparked
          the conspiracy theorist in me and I searched high and low to
          find out why Blasberg was the director of the gas works while
          Clemente Figueras was forgotten. I only uncovered part of the
          story but I am very grateful to this Spanish author who filled
          in the blanks to a forgotten part of Tesla and Canary island
          history.<br>

          "Mr. Clemente Figueras of Las Palmas, Canary Islands, is
          credited with having invented a contrivance which generates
          electricity without the use of any intermediate motive power
          or chemical reaction, but simply gathers the force from the
          atmosphere. The report of the invention comes from the Daily
          Mail correspondent at Las Palmas, who says Mr. Figuera has one
          of his machines in successful operation in his house. The
          discovered, Mr. Clemente Figueras, is Engineer of Woods and
          Forest for the Canary Islands, and for many years professor of
          physics at St. Augustine´s College, Las Palmas, and long known
          as a scientific student..."<br>
          <br>
          Well, we have some of the pieces of the puzzle. A canary
          engineer appears, a machine that extract energy from the
          atmosphere, although that was an incorrect assessment by the
          journalist, and also other data such as the condition of
          physics professor and inventor, as stated later in the article
          Figuera had the intention of patenting the technology in
          Madrid and Berlin. The next logical step was to go to the
          Patent Office to check about what was mentioned, and whether,
          indeed, there were such patents. But first, a brief mention
          should be made of what the Spanish press published about the
          case around those dates. For example, in the May 1902 edition
          of the journal The Reading in Science and Arts is written:<br>
          <br>
          "In the English newspapers are extensive references to an
          important discovery conducted by D. Clemente Figueras, forest
          engineer in Canary Islands and physics professor at College
          San Agustin from Las Palmas. Mr. Figueras has been working
          silently in order to find a method to use directly, ie,
          without dynamos and chemical agent, the huge amounts of
          electricity which exist in the atmosphere and are being
          renewed constantly, constituting an inexhaustible reservoir of
          this form of energy. Our compatriot (…) has achieved his
          purpose, having managed to invent a generator which can
          collect and store the atmospheric electric fluid in a position
          of being able to use later for pulling trams, trains, etc., or
          to run machinery in factories to light the houses and streets.
          Although no one knows the details of the procedure that Mr.
          Figueras reserves until he will get it completely perfected,
          he states that his invention will produce a tremendous
          economic and industrial revolution. The apparatus devised by
          Mr. Figueras has been built in separate pieces, in accordance
          with the drawings made by him in different companies in Paris,
          Berlin and Las Palmas. Received the parts, the engineer has
          put them together and articulate in his workshop. The company
          from Berlin which built some of the pieces, got curious about
          what they would be used for, sent an engineer to the Canary
          Islands, with the pretext of helping set up and with real
          purpose to study and sketch the whole device, but has not
          achieved his objective. Apparently, Mr. Figueras´ apparatus
          consists essentially of three parts: a collector, a
          transformer and a accumulator, so that, in short, what it does
          is to collect atmospheric electricity, transforming it from
          static to dynamic and store it in a secondary battery for
          later use in the form and amount required. We have understood
          that the inventor will soon come to Madrid and, later he will
          depart to Berlin and London, and then you will be able to know
          the procedure in detail."<br>

          "When rumors about the invention of our dear friend and wise
          engineer Mr. Clemente Figuera appeared, we were its convinced
          believers, because knowing Figuera´s character he had not
          claim for sure an statement of such importance publicly,
          unless he were mad, until not being fully convinced that he
          had made a discovery of those which performs a great
          revolution in the industrial world. <br>
          <br>
          "We had faith in him from the very beginning, and this was
          increasing while the famous engineer was providing us, by
          means of his notable work, which was published in these
          columns, the theories of the invention, keeping, as it is
          natural, the secret thereof. It is no longer possible for even
          the most skeptical, doubt the invention of Mr. Figuera,
          because he has just sold , we assume that for high sum of
          money, the Spanish patent which were obtained from our
          government when he arrived at Madrid. The company, which has
          bought it, will be well ascertained, before handing the
          stipulated capital between that company and the inventor, that
          the discovery does not leave any room for the slightest doubt.
          Here Mr. Figuera´s telegram which has produced so much
          satisfaction: <br>
          <br>
          Madrid 15-13 h. <br>
          <br>
          “I have just signed sale deed Spanish patent managing world
          bankers first union formation. Congratulations.” FIGUERA. <br>
          <br>
          "Many celebrate that a discovery of this nature have been done
          in the Canary Islands which should worry to large companies
          worldwide and even to governments themselves; We are very
          satisfied with the patriotism of Mr. Figuera for having
          obtained the patent for his invention in Spain, perhaps
          sacrificing his interests, because everyone knows how great
          discoveries are paid in other nations. <br>
          <br>
          ""Mr. Figuera receives our warmest congratulations that we
          extend to the distinguished family of the wise inventor." <br>
          <br>
          [ Allegedly 30 million pesetas -- about$ 230,000 in 1902 ]<br>
          <br>
          I have no idea where the press got the idea about the
          “atmospheric electricity” because Figuera´s patents, or at
          least those that I have been able to review, do not mention
          anything similar. It was clear to me after reading all the
          press clippings that the personage deserved to be
          investigated, albeit briefly. What I found next was completely
          unexpected. From experience, having collected dozens of
          stories that sound similar mode on alleged inventors of
          miraculous machines of all kinds, I always came to the same
          conclusion, namely, that they were solitary adventurers, most
          of them without proper training or prestige, they thought that
          they had invented something great or, simply, they were
          fraudsters. But, with Clemente Figuera I found the perfect
          engineer, respected and respectable, a well-known person
          highly appreciated at that time, and which had nothing to do
          with “crazy” dreamers who develop meaningless inventions. It
          was Figuera’s own life which disturbed me, because it has
          nothing to do with an amateur adventurer.<br>
          <br>
          Following the trail from official papers and press
          publications I have been able to reconstruct a short biography
          of Clemente Figuera, in which we can see a person with an
          unblemished career. The first reference I have located about
          Clemente Figuera y Ustáriz, the full name of our protagonist,
          was released in November 1865 as laudatory reference to the
          future engineer, who at that time was advancing in his studies
          in the university. He also appears among the aspirants to the
          Forestry Corps. The Official Spanish Guide settle him in
          Salamanca around 1872, but I haven´t found more references
          close to that date.<br>
          <br>
          In 1875 Figuera reappears, this time on the occasion of a
          transfer. It is mentioned that working as Forest Engineer in
          Malaga and was required to be transfer to Granada. Slowly he
          rose in his career; in 1880 he was appointed as Second Class
          Chief Engineer and for several years held that office in the
          province of Badajoz, moving in 1899 as Chief Engineer in the
          Canary Island. In 1903 he was promoted to Second Class General
          Inspector and, in 1904, he was moved to Barcelona with a
          position as Inspector. Again he was promoted in 1906 to the
          rank of First Class Inspector, staying in Barcelona until his
          death, which happened at the end of 1908. It is curious to
          read the accolades that made his fellow engineers in the press
          at the time of his death, being considered a flawless and
          highly respected member of his profession. In various official
          documents can also read how, throughout his long career,
          Clemente Figuera received commissions from various governments
          to do projects of great importance in establishing the
          economic activities in the Canary Islands and Catalonia. With
          all this information in my hand, I stood thoughtfully: What
          necessity had a respected engineer to become inventor and to
          run the risk of being labeled, at least, as fantasist? Most
          striking of all it was that his role as inventor was,
          apparently, something that he carried in the most absolute
          secrecy, unveiling that part of his life only when he set out
          to apply for patents and, even then, he decided to pass as
          unnoticed as possible.<br>
          <br>
          <b> </b><b>Adventures in the Patent Office</b><br>
          <br>
          It was time to figure out how the Figuera machine should work.
          The search results were again surprising because it did not
          resemble anything I had previously imagined. The first logical
          step was to find out if it really existed patents whose
          ownership could be attributed to Clement Figuera. The search
          soon offered results. Here are all their patents according to
          the Spanish Patent and Trademark Office. I have divided them
          into two groups with a very personal notation, depending on
          the place of residence of the applicant at the time the
          proceedings were issued. We can say that about Pedro
          Blasberge, who appears as co-author in some of the patents, I
          just managed to find out little information, only that he
          worked as director of a gas plant in Las Palmas:<br>
          <br>

          Constantino de Buforn (who was an economical partner of

          Figuera´s device shortly after his death. These patents, which
          I have consulted with interest in the Spanish Patent and
          Trademark Office, do not really provide anything which was not
          already included in the latest patents of Figuera. For
          information, it is patent 47706, 50216, 52968, 55411 and

          than a few minutes to ask the Patent Office for a copy of all
          of them. Unfortunately, I was informed that all of them were
          damaged, apparently, by the humidity of an ancient flood which
          affected the files. They were barely able to give me a copy,
          with some damage, of patents 30375 and 44267, that is, the
          first and last of the series. There you can read how Figuera
          approach is very original and has nothing to do with
          extracting energy from the atmosphere. Moreover, after having
          discussed the case with a few engineers, although we agree
          that possibly it will not be able to run, it bears some
          intriguing aspect because, at the time these patents were
          published, was requested to provide a complete operative model
          which was revised deeply before being accepted as patent
          application. Knowing the reputation of Figuera, I had in my
          mind the question: Did really Figuera find a technology that
          was hardly interesting? The time limitation to check the
          remaining patents make me keep the doubt, because I am unaware
          of what it might contain other documents damaged. In the two
          patents can be seen how ingeniously and by mechanical methods,
          the engineer tried to generate electrical energy inside a coil
          by varying the flow of two opposite and opposing magnetic
          fields, trying to get into the machine the same characteristic
          behavior of a conventional generator, but without moving
          parts. I don´t doubt that in the coil induced currents are
          generated, as he thought, but to pretend that more energy is
          generated in the coil or set of coils, which is needed to
          generate the inductive fields, even if they vary over time
          very rapidly, is an illusion. However, as a curious
          experiment, those who dare to try something really see that it
          is easy to implement, you can always learn something from a
          setup like this. Today it is easier than in times of Figuera,
          because it can be used electronic components, not
          mechanical...<br>

        <div align="left"><b>INTERVIEW With CLEMENTE FIGUERA ( 1902 )</b><br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          Mr. Clemente Figuera. - The name of the conscientious and
          intelligent engineer, Inspector of mountains in Canary, is now
          universally known, thanks to the news published by the press
          about the generator of his invention for producing
          far-reaching consequences, because it constitutes a valuable
          element in modern mechanics, solving problems which will
          influence powerfully in most industries.<br>
          <br>
          The meritable engineer states in a recently published work. -
          "With persistent effort nature keeps its secrets, but man´s
          intelligence, the most precious gift due to the divine artist,
          author of all creation, allows that slowly and at the cost of
          thousands studies and works, the human race realize that God's
          work is more perfect and harmonious than it looks at first
          sight.<br>
          &nbsp;<br>
          There was no need to create a agent for each kind of
          phenomenon, nor varying forces to produce the multiple
          motions, nor so many substances as varieties of bodies are
          present to our senses; In doing so, it was proceeding worthy
          of a least wise and powerful creator that that, with a single
          matter and a single impulse given to an atom, started in
          vibration all cosmic matter, according to a law from which the
          others are natural and logical consequences” <br>
          <br>
          And later he adds: "The twentieth century has given us the
          mercy of discovering its program in general lines. It will
          stop using the hackneyed system of transformations, and it
          will take the agents where the nature has them stored. To
          produce heat, light or electricity, it will rely on the
          suitable vibratory motion because nature´s available storages
          are renewed constantly and have no end ever. For the next
          generation, the steam engines will be an antique, and the
          blackness of coal, will be replaced by the pulchritude of
          electricity, in factories and workshops, in ocean liners, in
          railways and in our homes” <br>
          <br>
          So says Mr. Figueras, who is consistent with his scientific
          creed, has based his significant invention on harnessing the
          vibrations of the ether, building a device, that he names as
          Generator Figueras, with the power required to run a motor, as
          well as powering itself, developing a force of twenty horse
          power. Should be noted that the produced energy can be applied
          to all kinds of industries and its cost is zero, because
          nothing is spent to obtain it. All parts have been built
          separately in various workshops under the management of the
          inventor, who has shown the generator running in his home in
          the city of Las Palmas. <br>
          <br>
          The inventor holds that his generator will solve a portion of
          problems, including those which are derived from navigation,
          because a great power can be carried in a very small space,
          stating that the secret of his invention resembles the egg of
          Columbus. <br>
          <br>
          With the generator it may be obtained the voltage and amperage
          required, as direct or alternate currents, producing light,
          driving force, heat and all the effects of the electricity. It
          is said that shortly Mr. Figuera will depart to Paris, to
          constitute a union in charge of the exploitation of his
          invention. <br>
          <br>
          Due to the gallantry of our good friend, the distinguished
          photographer of Las Palmas Mr. Luis Ojeda, we thank for making
          public to our readers a portrait of Mr. Clemente Figueras, to
          whom we congratulate on his invention, making fervent hopes to
          produce the expected beneficial results, for the benefit of
          mankind, for the sake of science and honor of our country,
          proud to count him among the number of its illustrious sons. <br>

          The London '' Daily Mail '' hears from its Las Palmas, Canary
          Islands, correspondant that Senor Clemente Figueras, of the
          place, has discovered a method of '' directly using
          atmospheric electricity without chemicals or dynamos and
          practically applying it without any motive force.''<br>
          <br>
          Senor Figueras is jealously guarding his invention and is not
          disposed to say anything more about it just now '' than the
          only extraordinary point about it is that it has taken so long
          to discover a simple fact.''&nbsp; The inventor, who is a
          professor of physics at St Augustin's College, Las Palmas,
          will according to a dispatch to a New York paper, soon go to
          Madrid and Berlin to patent his invention. It is stated in the
          original communication that Prof. Figueras '' has constructed
          a rough apparatus by which he obtains a current of 550Volts,
          which he utilizes in lighting his house and driving a 20Hp
          motor.'' As usual in such cases, '' the whole apparatus is so
          simple that a child can work it.''<br>

          <b> </b>( 1902 )<br>
          <b> </b><br>
          <b> </b><b>DESCRIPTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          All systems adopted, until the present, to produce electric
          currents, are based on the well-known principle that, when a
          core of soft iron which approach or moves away from a magnet
          is magnetized and demagnetized do appear induced current in
          any copper wire which is coiled in said core. This is the
          fundamental principle of the Clarke machine, of the company
          “The Alliance”, and the current dynamos, which, like all
          others, are machines to transform mechanical force into
          electricity. In all of them, the magnetizations and successive
          demagnetizations of the core or cores is achieved approaching
          and moving away these permanent magnets or electromagnets,
          called excitatory.<br>
          <br>
          Those who sign, have devised a new method or process for
          producing magnetic changes in the core, and this procedure
          consists of making intermittent or alternating the current
          which drives the excitatory electromagnets, in which case
          neither the nuclei, nor the induced circuit need to be moved
          at all.<br>
          <br>
          The whole question comes down to change the state of
          magnetization of the cores, so that electrical currents could
          appear in the induced wire. Until now, this result is achieved
          by making the core or cores approaching or moving from the
          magnetic centers created by the excitatory electromagnets. We,
          through an intermittent or alternating electric current
          achieve a variation in the magnetic state of the cores of the
          excitatory electromagnets, and also changing, the magnetic
          state of the cores on which the induced circuit is coiled,
          where electric currents appear ready to be industrially
          exploited.<br>
          <br>
          As the soft iron core of a dynamo becomes a real magnet from
          the time when current flow along the wire of the induced
          circuit, we think that this core must be formed or constituted
          by a group of real electromagnets, properly built to develop
          the highest possible attractive force, and without taking into
          account the conditions to be fitted in the induced circuit,
          which is completely independent of the core.<br>
          <br>
          The procedure is thus reduced to establish an independent
          induced circuit, within the sphere of action or magnetic
          atmosphere formed between the magnetic pole faces, of opposite
          name, of two electromagnets, or series of electromagnets
          driven by intermittent or alternating currents.<br>
          <br>
          In the current dynamos, the coils of the induced circuit cut
          the force lines which go from the faces of the excitatory
          electromagnets to the core; in our procedure, the same lines
          of force, which are born and die cross through the coils on
          the induced.<br>
          <br>
          The novelty of our procedure is as follows:<br>
          <br>
          In that, you do not need to use any driving force, since the
          machines built according to these principles will not act as
          transformers of work into electricity.<br>
          <br>
          In that, until the present, none has tried to change, at
          industrial scale, from zero, the magnetic power of the
          excitatory magnets or electromagnets of a running machine.<br>
          <br>
          Note: for which the patent is filed: Procedure to achieve
          electric currents, establishing a motionless and independent
          induced circuit, within the sphere of action or magnetic
          atmosphere formed between the magnetic pole faces of two
          excitatory electromagnets, or series of motionless
          electromagnets, powered by intermittent or alternate currents.<br>

          By running a dynamoelectric machine, the inducer
          electromagnets exert attractive action on the soft iron core,
          but as it is round, it is not too difficult to rotate it more
          or less quickly. But, as soon as currents appear in the
          induced circuit coils, the soft iron core becomes a real
          magnet and the difficulty to turn it increases extremely.<br>
          <br>
          Everyone knows that the current generated by a dynamo is
          produced because the induced coils cut the lines of force of
          the magnets, therefore producing induction, and it is supposed
          that the force required to move the machine is applied to
          rotate the induced, so that their coils cut the said lines of
          force. <br>
          <br>
          The undersigned inventors have been persuaded that this view
          is not accurate, and they also believe that the horsepower
          consumed by the generator, for its operation, are only used to
          rotate the core, and to overcome the force of attraction
          exerted mutually between the poles of the inducer
          electromagnets and those on the core, which is nothing more
          than a magnet. The authors believe that, for the existence of
          magnetic fields, there is no need to rotate the core, and for
          achieving the induced coils to cut the lines of force it is
          only needed that the induced circuit rotates, this is, the
          coils alone, without the soft iron core. But, as currents
          appears in the coils, the core becomes a real electromagnet,
          the undersigned inventors think that the electromagnet must be
          formed in the likeness of the exciter electromagnets, that is,
          in the best conditions for this core to become a magnet as
          powerful as possible while passing the current along the wire
          coiled on the core. <br>
          <br>
          In the construction of current dynamos the copper wire
          covering the core must be -necessarily of a determined length
          and thickness in order that the induced current will get the
          desired voltage and amperage, and the mentioned length and
          thickness of the wire do not allow to coil it around the core
          in proper conditions to be a good electromagnet. <br>
          <br>
          By contrast, a dynamo built with motionless core and exciter
          magnets, and just moving or rotating the coils on the induced
          circuit, may get an electromagnet in the core in the best
          conditions to obtain, at its poles, a powerful
          electromagnetism, and independently of this
          core-electromagnet, the coils in the induced circuit can be
          built with the copper wire of such required length and
          thickness in order that the dynamo can get the desired voltage
          and amperage. <br>
          <br>
          In summary: in the machine that it is requested to have a
          privilege, the excitatory magnets are constructed as those in
          the current machines, and in the number, size and desired
          arrangement. The core consists of a group of as many
          electromagnets as those of the excitatory side, and the wires
          in the excitatory electromagnets and core electromagnets
          disposed in series or parallel or as required for the
          excitatory current, whose aim is to convert them in powerful
          magnets and to create the magnetic fields which are formed
          between the poles of each excitatory electromagnet and its
          corresponding electromagnet in the core. Both, exciter
          electromagnets as those in the core, which are also exciters,
          are terminated by expansions of iron or steel, placing face to
          face these expansions and disposing them in such a way that in
          front of a pole of a name there is placed a pole of opposite
          name. The core is composed of motionless electromagnets around
          shaft, and nor those magnets neither the exciter ones rotate.
          The induced circuit formed by wires coiled in a drum type
          configuration rotates around its axis, inside the magnetic
          fields, accompanied by a collector and a pulley, so that any
          motor may put them into movement. <br>
          <br>
          As copper is diamagnetic, the force required to rotate the
          induced coils will be very small, even taking into account the
          friction of brushes, air resistance, bearings, and higher or
          lower attracting electric currents, so that, a relatively weak
          electric motor, powered by either an independent current, or
          by a portion of the total current produced by the machine can
          be used to put the induced circuit into quick rotation
          movement. <br>
          <br>
          Therefore Mr. Clemente Figuera and Mr. Pedro Blasberg, on name
          and on behalf of society "Figuera-Blasberg" according to the
          principles established by the law request respectfully for
          definitive privilege or patent of invention which is described
          as: <br>
          <br>
          The inducer or exciter circuit is formed by two series of
          multiple electromagnets, motionless them all, and conveniently
          placed so that each pole of a series will be at short distance
          in front of a pole of opposite name in the other series. In
          the small separation between the expansions of these magnets
          the induced coils rotate, dragging, in its turn, the
          collectors and transmission pulleys. The figure of the
          attached drawing, which is only theoretical, gives an idea of
          the arrangement which is requested for privilege. The

          <b>DESCRIPTIVE NOTES </b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          On all magneto and dynamo-electric machines, from Clarke´s
          machine to the most sophisticated ones, there is a copper
          wire, called induced circuit, which is wound, in a more or
          less convenient and ingenious way, on a soft iron core. This
          core, under the successive action of the poles, of opposite
          name, of several electromagnets undergoes very rapid magnetic
          changes which produce the induced electrical currents, and in
          practice, these effects are achieved thanks to the rotation or
          revolution, more or less rapidly of the induced circuit joined
          to its core, or rotation of the exciter circuit with its core,
          needing, in both cases, a high amount of mechanical force to
          overcome the force of attraction exerted between the exciter
          electromagnets and the core of the induced. <br>
          <br>
          But, as the distribution and establishment of magnetic fields
          is always the same and independent of the rotation, the
          undersigned inventors have thought that it is not needed to
          move the core for the induced coils to cut the existing lines
          of force between the pole faces of the exciter electromagnets
          and the core, producing this way the induction, and it is
          enough that the induced circuit will be separated by a very
          tiny distance from this core, only rotating the induced coil,
          for which, it is not required a great strength since, with
          copper being diamagnetic, simply it is sufficient with the
          necessary effort to overcome the air resistance, friction of
          brushes, and higher or lower attraction from currents to
          currents, effort which is easily obtained using a suitable
          electric motor driven by an independent current, or by a part
          of the total current given by the machine. This procedure
          allows to obtain currents remarkably identical to those
          existing today in dynamos, but without using driving force
          which is today used and wasted away, almost entirely, in
          rotating the soft iron core.<br>
          <br>
          Therefore what we do is to let still the exciter circuit, the
          core of this circuit and the core of the induced, and rotate
          only the induced circuit within the sphere of action, or
          existing magnetic fields, between the pole faces of the
          exciter electromagnets and the core of the induced circuit.<br>
          <br>
          In order that the magnetic fields will be more intense we
          build this core by a group of real electromagnets in the
          likeness of the exciters ones, and this design has the
          advantage that the induced circuit, as being independent and
          separated from the core, is constructed in the most convenient
          shape and arrangement. The collector and the pulley or pulleys
          for transmission of motion rotate also with the induced drum.<br>
          <br>
          NOTE, for which a patent is applied <br>
          <br>
          Procedure for obtaining electrical currents originated in an
          induced circuit which rotates, with collector and transmission
          pulleys, cutting its coils the lines of force which flow from
          the pole faces of a series of motionless electromagnets to the
          pole faces of other electromagnets, analogous to the first and
          also motionless, which are placed in front of the first. <br>

          ( 5 September 1902 )<br>
          <br>
          Since 1833, when, in France, Pixii built the first
          magneto-electric machine, to the present time, all machines
          magneto and dynamo-electric that inventors’ knowledge has
          materialized in the industry are based on the law of induction
          that says "all magnet which approaches or moves away from a
          close circuit, produces in it induced currents" In Gramme ring
          and in the current dynamos, current is produced by induction
          exerted on the wire of the induced circuits as its coils cut
          the lines of force created by the excitatory electromagnets,
          this is, as the induced circuit moves, quickly, inside the
          magnetic atmosphere which exists between the pole faces of the
          excitatory electromagnets and the soft iron core of the
          induced. In order to produce this movement, mechanical force
          need to be employed in large quantity, because it is necessary
          to overcome the magnetic attraction between the core and the
          excitatory electromagnets, attraction which opposes the
          motion, so the current dynamos are true machines for
          transforming mechanical work into electricity. <br>
          <br>
          The undersigned, believe that is exactly the same as the coils
          in the induced cut the lines of force, or that these lines of
          force cross the induced wire, because not changing, by
          rotation, the arrangement of the magnetic fields, there is no
          necessity to move the core, for induction to occur. Leaving
          still both the induced circuit and the core, it is essential
          that lines of forces to be born and die, or being removed,
          which is achieved by making the excitatory current
          intermittent or alternating in sign.<br>
          <br>
          The current dynamos, come from groups of Clarke machines, and
          our generator recalls, in its fundamental principle, the
          Ruhmkorff induction coil. In that machine the induction
          machine is created by movement of the induced circuit: in the
          generator, induction occurs because of the intermittences of
          the current which magnetize the electromagnets, and in order
          to achieve these intermittences or changes in sign, only is
          required a very small quantity or almost negligible force, we,
          with our generator, produce the same effects of current
          dynamos without using any driving force at all.<br>
          <br>
          In the arrangement of the excitatory magnets and the induced,
          our generator has some analogy with dynamos, but completely
          differs from them in that, not requiring the use of motive
          power, is not a transforming apparatus. As much as we take, as
          a starting point, the fundamental principle that supports the
          construction of the Ruhmkorff induction coil, our generator is
          not a cluster of these coils which differs completely. It has
          the advantage that the soft iron core can be constructed with
          complete indifference of the induced circuit, allowing the
          core to be a real group of electromagnets, like the exciters,
          and covered with a proper wire in order that these
          electromagnets may develop the biggest attractive force
          possible, without worrying at all about the conditions that
          the induced wire must have for the voltage and amperage that
          is desired. In the winding of this induced wire, within the
          magnetic fields, are followed the requirements and practices
          known today in the construction of dynamos, and we refrain
          from going into further detail, believing it unnecessary. <br>
          <br>
          The inventors, who subscribe, constitute their generator, as
          follows: Several electromagnets are arranged opposing each
          other, and their opposite pole faces separated by a small
          distance. The cores of all these electromagnets are formed in
          such a way that they will magnetize and demagnetize quickly
          and not retain any residual magnetism. In the empty space
          remaining between the pole faces of the electromagnets of
          these two series, the induced wire passes in one piece, or
          several, or many. An excitatory current, intermittent, or
          alternating, actuates all the electromagnets, which are
          attached or in series, or in parallel, or as required, and in
          the induced circuit will arise currents comprising, together,
          the total generator current. That allows suppressing the
          mechanical force, since there is nothing which needs to be
          moved. The driving current, or is an independent current,
          which, if direct, must be interrupted or changed in sign
          alternately by any known method, or is a part of the total
          current of the generator, as it is done today in the current
          dynamos. <br>
          <br>
          Founded on these considerations, Mr. Clemente Figuera and Mr.
          Pedro Blasberg, in the name and on behalf of the society
          "Figuera-Blasberg" respectfully requests to be granted final
          patent of invention for this generator whose form and
          arrangement are shown in the attached drawings, warning that,

          electromagnets, or two sets of four excitatory electromagnets
          in each, and the induced circuit is marked by a thick line of
          reddish ink, being this way the general arrangement of the
          appliance, but meaning that you can put more or less
          electromagnets and in another form or grouping. <br>

          <b> </b><br>
          if within a spinning magnetic field we rotate a closed circuit
          placed at right angles to the lines of force a current will be
          induced for as long as there is movement , and whose sign will
          depend on the direction in which the induced circuit moves.<br>
          <br>
          This is the foundation of all magnetic machines and electric
          dynamos from the primitive, invented by Pixii, France and
          modified and improved later by Clarke until the current
          dynamos of today.<br>
          <br>
          The principle where is based this theory, carries the
          unavoidable need for the movement of the induced circuit or
          the inductor circuit, and therefore these machines are taken
          as transformer of mechanical work into electricity.<br>
          <br>
          <b>PRINCIPLE OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Watching closely what happens in a Dynamo in motion, is that
          the turns of the induced circuit approaches and moves away
          from the magnetic centers of the inductor magnet or
          electromagnets, and those turns,&nbsp; while spinning, go
          through sections of the magnetic&nbsp; field of different
          power, because, while this has its maximum attraction in the
          center of the core of each electromagnet, this action will
          weaken as the induced&nbsp; is separated from the center of
          the electromagnet, to increase again, when the induced is
          approaching the center of another electromagnet with opposite
          sign to the first one.<br>
          <br>
          Because we all know that the effects that are manifested when
          a closed circuit approaches and moves away from a magnetic
          center are the same as when, this circuit being still and
          motionless, the magnetic field is increased and reduced in
          intensity;&nbsp; since any variation , occurring in the flow
          traversing a circuit is producing electrical&nbsp; induced
          current .It was considered the possibility of building a
          machine that would work, not in the principle of movement, as
          do the current dynamos, but using the principle of increase
          and decrease, this is the variation of the power of the
          magnetic field, or the electrical current which produces it.<br>

          The voltage from the total current of the current dynamos is
          the sum of partial induced currents born in each one of the
          turns of the induced. Therefore it matters little to these
          induced currents if they were obtained by the turning of the
          induced, or by the variation of the magnetic flux that runs
          through them; but in the first case, a greater source of
          mechanical work than obtained electricity is required, and in
          the second case, the force necessary to achieve the variation
          of flux is so insignificant that it can be derived without any
          inconvenience, from the one supplied by the machine.<br>
          <br>
          Until the present no machine based on this principle has been
          applied yet to the production of large electrical currents,
          and which among other advantages, has suppressed any necessity
          for motion and therefore the force needed to produce it.<br>
          <br>
          In order to privilege the application to the production of
          large industrial electrical currents, on the principle that
          says that “there is production of induced electrical current
          provided that you change in any way the flow of force through
          the induced circuit,” seems that it is enough with the
          previously exposed; however, as this application need to
          materialize in a machine, there is need to describe it in
          order to see how to carry out a practical application of said
          principle.<br>
          <br>
          This principle is not new since it is just a consequence of
          the laws of induction stated by Faraday in the year 1831: what
          it is new and requested to privilege is the application of
          this principle to a machine which produces large industrial
          electrical currents which until now cannot be obtained but
          transforming mechanical work into electricity.<br>
          <br>
          Let’s therefore make the description of a machine based on the
          prior principle which is being privileged; but it must be
          noted, and what is sought is the patent for the application of
          this principle, that all machines built based on this
          principle, will be included in the scope of this patent,
          whatever the form and way that has been used to make the
          application.<br>
          <br>
          <b>DESCRIPTION OF GENERATOR OF VARIABLE EXCITATION “FIGUERA”</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The machine comprise a fixed inductor circuit, consisting of
          several electromagnets with soft iron cores exercising
          induction in the induced circuit, also fixed and motionless,
          composed of several reels or coils, properly placed. As
          neither of the two circuits spin, there is no need to make
          them round, nor leave any space between one and the other.<br>
          <br>
          Here what it is constantly changing is the intensity of the
          excitatory current which drives the electromagnets and this is
          accomplished using a resistance, through which circulates a
          proper current, which is taken from one foreign origin
          into&nbsp; one or more electromagnets, magnetize one or more
          electromagnets and, while the current is higher or lower the
          magnetization of the electromagnets is decreasing or
          increasing and varying, therefore, the intensity of the
          magnetic field , this is, the flow which crosses the induced
          circuit.<br>
          <br>
          To fix ideas is convenient to refer to the attached drawing
          which is no more than a sketch to understand the operation of
          the machine built using the principle outlined before.<br>
          <br>
          Suppose that electromagnets are represented by rectangles N
          and S. Between their poles is located the induced circuit
          represented by the line “y” (small). Let be “R” a resistance
          that is drawn in an elementary manner to facilitate the
          comprehension of the entire system, and “+” and “-” the
          excitatory current which is taken from an external and
          foreigner generator. The different pieces of the resistance
          will connect, as seen in the drawing, with the commutator bars
          embedded in a cylinder of insulating material that does not
          move; but around it, and always in contact with more than one
          contact, rotates a brush “O”, which carries the foreign
          current, revolves. One of the ends of the resistance is
          connected with electromagnets N, and the other with
          electromagnets S, half of the terminals of the resistance
          pieces go to the half of the commutator bars of the cylinder
          and the other half of these commutator bars are directly
          connected to the firsts.<br>
          <br>
          The operation of the machine is as follows: it has been said
          that the brush “O” rotates around the cylinder “G” and always
          in contact with two of their contacts. When the brush is in
          touch with contact “1? the current, which comes from the
          external generator and passes through the brush and contact
          “1?, will magnetize electromagnets N to the maximum but will
          not magnetize the electromagnets S because the whole
          resistance prevents it. Therefore, first electromagnets are
          full of current and the second ones are empty. When the brush
          is in touch with contact “2? the current won’t entirely go to
          electromagnets N because it has to pass through part of the
          resistance; In contrast, some current goes to the electrodes S
          because it has to overcome less resistance than in the
          previous case. This same reasoning is applicable to the case
          in which the brush “O” closes the circuit in each of the
          different contact until finished those in a semicircle, and
          begins to operate in the other half, which are directly
          connected to each other. In short, the resistance makes the
          function of a splitter of current because those current not
          going to excite some electromagnets excites others and so on;
          it can be said that electrodes N and S works simultaneously
          and in opposite way because while the first ones are filling
          up with current, the seconds are emptying and while repeating
          this effect continuously and orderly a constant variation of
          the magnetic fields within which is placed the induced circuit
          can be maintained, without any more complications than the
          turning of a brush or group of brushes that move circularly
          around the cylinder “G” powered by the action of a small
          electrical motor.<br>
          <br>
          As seen in the drawing the current, once that has made its
          function, returns to the generator where taken; naturally in
          every revolution of the brush will be a change of sign in the
          induced current; but a switch will do it continuous if
          wanted.&nbsp; From this current is derived a small part to
          excite the machine converting it in self-exciting and to
          operate the small motor which moves the brush and the switch;
          the external current supply, this is the feeding current, is
          removed and the machine continue working without any help
          indefinitely.<br>
          <br>
          The invention is really new; very daring and above all has
          huge technical and industrial consequences under all sights,
          we didn’t ask for privilege of invention until having a
          machine working based on these principles which gives the
          practical realization without which these claims will be
          useless.<br>

          <b>NOTE</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          The applied patent for 20 years is requested upon a “NEW
          GENERATOR OF ELECTRICITY, so-called “FIGUERA” of variable
          excitation, designed to produce electrical currents for
          industrial applications without using neither driving force,
          nor chemical reactions. <br>
          <br>
          The machine is essentially characterized by two series of
          electromagnets which form the inductor circuit, between whose
          poles the reels of the induced are properly placed. Both
          circuits, remaining motionless, induced and inductor, are able
          to produce a current induced by the constant variation of the
          intensity of the magnetic field forcing the excitatory current
          (coming at first from any external source) to pass through a
          rotating brush which, in its rotation movement, is placed in
          communication with the commutator bars or contacts of a ring
          distributor or cylinder whose contacts are in communication
          with a resistance whose value varies&nbsp; from a maximum to a
          minimum and vice versa, according with the commutator bars of
          the cylinder which operates, and for that reason the
          resistance is connected to the electromagnets N by one of its
          side, and the electromagnets S at the other side, in such a
          way that the excitatory current will be magnetizing
          successively with more or less strength to the first
          electromagnets, while, oppositely, will be decreasing or
          increasing the magnetization&nbsp; in the second ones,
          determining these variations in intensity of the magnetic
          field, the production of the current in the induced, current
          that we can use for any work for the most part, and of which
          only one small fraction is derived for the actuation of a
          small electrical motor which make rotate the brush, and
          another fraction goes to the continuous excitation of the
          electromagnets, and, therefore, converting the machine in
          self-exciting, being able to suppress the external power which
          was used at first to excite&nbsp; the electromagnets. Once the
          machinery is in motion, no new force is required and the
          machine will continue in operation indefinitely.<br>

          In accordance with Mr. Figuera, you can obtain not only 200%
          but infinite amount of energy. Mr. Figuera wrote that once the
          generator starts, the excitation power can be derived directly
          from the output and the external battery can be eliminated.
          THIS IS NOT ONLY THE SIMPLEST FE DEVICES I'VE EVER SEEN, BUT
          ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT. I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE A TEST OF THIS
          DEVICE!<br>
          I am having problems in getting the quadratic voltage
          generator. I thought that maybe I can use two inverters and
          make one of them 90 degrees out of phase. However, I have not
          been able to find inverters with that capability. The last
          resource is to modify the winding connections of a dynamo.<br>

          I have been reading the PDF and can understand most of it.<br>
          The one item I would appreciate some clarification on is the
          fixed cylinder "G" with the connections 1 to 16 that connect
          to the brushes.<br>
          The bridging contacts and the brush arrangement are what I am
          unable to visualise.<br>

          With reference to the commutator arrangement, do you think
          that the brush running around the outside edge contacted only
          one connection at a time or do you think it covered at least
          2? I ask because the first arrangement would give a pulse of
          increasing / decreasing current, whereas the second option
          would be a more linear increase/decrease.<br>

          That is an important question I missed to address in my paper.
          If your planning to use the taps configuration as shown in the
          patent, I think the brush should be two-contact one. The
          problem with one contact is that at times the brush will be
          between two taps – not in contact with the resistor R. And,
          that is a problem because the primary coils will be switched
          on/off, and you know that when this happens to a coil, it
          generates a lot of sparks and voltage surges. On the other
          hand, with the two brushes configuration, when one is in
          between taps the other is in contact. This configuration will
          practically eliminate the generation of sparks and high
          voltage spikes. That fellow (Mr. Figuera) was really smart!<br>

          - In paragraph 5 you say that Vs is zero in fig. 1. I don't
          follow where you have explained why this is the case (is it
          because there's no load?).<br>
          - In fig 12, you show Br in the same direction as Bp. If
          that's true, then I don't understand - maybe you can help
          clarify?<br>
          If I understood correctly, the secondary voltage/current is
          caused by the see-sawing of Bp across the portion of the
          secondary coils contained within the gap. 3/4 of the secondary
          windings are "wasted". Would it make sense to consider winding
          the secondary coil only within the air gap, not around the
          other side of the core? Would this double the output
          frequency? Is there an opportunity to put a secondary core at
          right angles to the main core, completely outside of the main
          core (eg. The secondary windings spill outside of the main air
          gap)?<br>
          <br>
          wonju <br>
          Senior Member<br>
          Paragraph six explains the reasons why Vs shall be zero. As
          shown in figure 1, the magnetic field B is not interacting
          with the wires of the secondary coil. First, for a voltage Vs
          to be induced, the Faraday’s induction law requires the
          magnetic field B and the wires of the secondary coil to
          interact as shown in figure 2. And second, if the magnetic
          field of each turn of the secondary increases/decreases in a
          closed loop, no way the magnetic field B only flows within the
          iron core IC.<br>
          Remember that Bp is the magnetic field inducing the secondary
          voltage Vs. The magnetic field B in the iron core always stays
          constant. Because the induced magnetic field Bs is cancelling
          the primary magnetic field Bp, the primary current Ip
          increases to compensate for the cancelling effect of the
          secondary magnetic field Bs. As I explain in the paper, this
          self-regulation effect is due to the self-inductance.<br>
          If a magnetic field B crosses the secondary coil on both sides
          (completely), then Vs would be equal to zero. The reason for
          this is that the magnetic field induces two voltages with
          opposite polarities within the same coil.<br>
          The frequency induced in the secondary coil is always the same
          as the magnetic field Bp that induces it.<br>
          I am not sure I understood that last question but I think you
          may be interested in the next paper (part 2). In part two I
          show some iron cores with angles.<br>
          The function of the cylinder G and the brush O is in the
          patent description that is available. I was also very confused
          with this device. I was expecting the cylinder G to rotate in
          contact with a fixed brush, which is the standard
          configuration of any motor with brushes. The description
          states that two brushes O (not one) rotate around the fixed
          cylinder G. As it rotates, the contacts of the cylinder
          (resistor's taps) are selected sequentially. I do not know if
          these brushes rotate in the outer or inner part of the
          cylinder.<br>
          However, I would not be too concern about it. The important
          issue here is to understand the role of these devices. The
          role of the resistor, cylinder, and brushes is to generate two
          excitation voltages with 90 degrees out of phase as shown in
          figure 21.<br>
          Once you understand its function, it can be implemented in
          many ways. Personally, I do not like the implementation using
          resistor taps because it generates a lot of harmonics. When
          the changes in resistance are discrete, the voltages and
          currents through the N and S electromagnets are stepped
          sinusoids, and so is the output voltage Vsy.<br>

            Figuera</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          Clemente Figuera of the Canary Islands died in 1908. He was a
          highly respected individual, an Engineer and University
          Professor. He was awarded several patents and was known to
          Nikola Tesla. Figuera’s design is very simple in outline. He
          has avoided the performance-killing Lenz Law magnetic feedback
          by splitting a transformer into three parts. Two parts form
          the primary winding and are shown on the left and on the
          right. The third part is the secondary winding which is
          located in the centre. Because of the splitting of the primary
          into two parts, Lenz’s Law has been abolished for this design,
          allowing a spectacular performance where the current drawn
          from the secondary winding has no effect on the current
          flowing in the two halves of the primary winding. There is
          also, no back-EMF as current flows continuously in both halves
          of the primary winding. The very clever method used by
          Clemente makes the strength of the current in the two halves
          of the primary to oscillate with one side repeatedly having
          first much more current and then far less current than the
          other half. This generates alternating current in the
          secondary, current which can be drawn off and used for useful
          work, powering lights, heaters, motors, etc. The following
          information comes from a man who wishes to remain anonymous.
          On 30th October 2012, he made the following comments about his
          repair to a Figuera patent which was missing some of the
          content. He says:<br>
          <br>
          I heard of Clemente Figuera for the first time from one of the
          Tesla articles. In 1902 the Daily Mail announced that Mr.
          Figueras (with an “s”), a Forestry Engineer in the Canary
          Islands, and for many years Professor of Physics at St.
          Augustine’s College, Las Palmas, had invented a generator
          which required no fuel. The newspaper article says that “He
          claims to have invented a generator which can collect the
          electric fluid, to be able to store it and apply it to
          infinite purposes, for instance, in connection with shops,
          railways and manufacturers. He will not give the key to his
          invention, but declares that the only extraordinary point
          about it is that it has taken so long to discover a simple
          scientific fact. Señor Figueras has constructed a rough
          apparatus by which, in spite of it’s small size and it’s
          defects, he obtains 550 volts, which he utilises in his own
          house for lighting purposes and for driving a 20 horse-power
          motor. Señor Figueras is shortly coming to London, not with
          models or sketches, but with a working apparatus. His
          inventions comprise a generator, a motor, and a sort of
          governor or regulator, and the whole apparatus is so simple
          that a child could work it.” [Taken from “Perpetual Motion – A
          History of an Obsession”].<br>

        <div align="left"> I was in one of the forums when someone
          mentioned Clemente Figuera and provided some links to
          documents referring to his work [1]. In one of the documents,
          I found what looks to be the only page showing sketches from
          one of his patents. After restoring the faint lines which show
          the wire connections, I was very surprised to see the
          similarities between the embodiment of Mr. Figuera’s drawing
          and one of my own for over-unity transformers.<br>
          <br>
          I was very eager to read any information about Mr Figuera's
          work and the operation of his ‘Infinite Energy Machine’. It
          looks very suspicious that the pages describing the most
          important part of the machine have been ‘lost’. I then decided
          to just figure this machine out for myself.<br>
          <br>
          Please note that the rotating contact brush needs to be a
          “Make Before Break” type. That is, it needs to bridge across
          the gap between adjacent stator contact strips so that there
          is no sparking due to the current flow being interrupted.<br>
          <br>
          According to Mr. Figuera, an over-unity transformer can be
          built without using permanent magnets, and based on a very
          simple concept. Figuera’s generator consists of three rows of
          electromagnets, where each row is connected in series. The
          rows of “S” and “N” electromagnets function as the primary of
          the transformer, while the row of “y” electromagnets, located
          in the centre, functions as the secondary. The “S” and “N”
          stand for South and North poles, respectively. The apparatus
          includes a resistor “R” having multiple taps connected to a
          type of distributor formed by a cylinder “G” and brush “O”.
          The brush “O” rotates inside the cylinder “G” changing the
          connection to the resistor taps. When the brush “O” rotates
          around the eight taps, it generates two stepped half-cycle
          sine waves which are 90° out of phase with each other. I
          suggest that Fig.15 is the wiring diagram as originally
          disclosed by Mr. Figuera in his patents. The most significant
          component of the system is the arrangement of the
          electromagnets shown in section A-A of figure 14. Keep in mind
          that each electromagnet shown in figure 15 corresponds to a
          row of seven electromagnets connected in series as shown in
          figure 14. In addition, I recommend that when building this
          apparatus, at least for the first implementation, that you try
          to replicate all of the details of the device shown in the
          patent. For example, figure 14 shows the top area of the “S”
          and “N” electromagnets being approximately equal to twice the
          top area of the “y” electromagnets.<br>
          <br>
        </div>
        <div align="left"><img alt="" src="pkelly1.jpg" height="1102"
            width="662"><br>

        </div>
        <div align="left"><br>
          <br>
          Even though Mr. Figuera used stepped sinusoidal currents Ips
          and Ipn, I consider the resistor shown in Fig.15, to be a
          linear variable resistor having infinite ‘taps’ and the
          voltage and current generated to be pure half-cycle sine waves
          which are 90° out of phase. The coils of the “S” and “N”
          electromagnets are connected together and attached to the
          negative terminal of the battery. The other ends of both
          electromagnets are connected to both ends of the resistor “R”.
          The sliding contact “O” is connected to the positive terminal
          of the battery and is rotated continuously making electrical
          connections repeatedly from left to right and then back from
          right to left across the multi-tap resistor “R”. The position
          of the sliding contact “O”, determines the magnitude of the DC
          currents Ips and Ipn passing through the primary coils “S” and
          “N”. For instance, when the brush is in position 1, the “S”
          coils receive the full voltage of the battery, producing the
          maximum current Ips and maximum magnetic field Bps, while at
          the same time, the current Ipn and magnetic field Bpn of the
          “N” coils are at their minimum values because they are now
          connected to the battery through the maximum value of the
          resistor “R”. Figure 21 shows the voltage, current, and
          magnetic field waveforms flowing through these coils. The
          voltage induced in the secondary coils “y” is a sinusoidal
          alternating voltage. The secondary voltage should be zero when
          the magnitudes of the currents Ips and Ipn are equal. At this
          point, the magnetic fields Bps and Bpn induce two voltages of
          the same magnitude and opposite polarity.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk3.jpg" height="229" width="235"><br>
          <br>
          The magnetic interaction of the “S”, “N”, and “y”
          electromagnets is shown in Fig.16 to Fig.20. Figure 16
          illustrates the situation when the brush “O” is at position 1.
          Here, the current Ips and magnetic field Bps are at their
          maximum, while the current Ipn and magnetic field Bpn are at
          their minimum values. When the secondary current Isy starts
          flowing, the “y” coils generate a magnetic field Bsy which
          opposes the magnetic field Bps in accordance with Lenz’s law.
          As a consequence, a South pole is created at the top of the
          “y” electromagnet and a North pole at the bottom. Because
          magnets of the same polarity repel and opposite polarities
          attract, it is likely that some of the induced magnetic field
          Bsy2 is diverted through the iron core of the “N”
          electromagnet, which represents a lower reluctance path. And,
          if the induced magnetic field Bsy can be rerouted so as to
          avoid opposing the magnetic field Bps which generates it,
          then, it might be possible to have an over-unity transformer<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk4.jpg" height="256" width="261"><br>
          <br>
          Fig.17 illustrates the situation when the sliding contact “O”
          is at position 3. The primary current Ips and the primary
          magnetic field Bps are decreasing in magnitude while the
          magnitude of the primary current Ipn and magnetic field Bpn
          are both increasing. The primary current Ips (and Bps) is
          still larger than primary current Ipn (and Bpn). As shown in
          the figure, part of the induced magnetic field Bsy2 is still
          coupled to the “N” electromagnets.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk5.jpg" height="256" width="265"><br>
          <br>
          Fig.18 illustrates the scenario when the brush is at position
          M. This position is exactly at the centre of the resistor “R”
          and both currents Ips and Ipn are of equal magnitudes, and as
          a result, the magnetic fields Bps and Bpn are also equal. The
          net voltage Vsy, current Isy, and magnetic field Bsy induced
          in the secondary coils “y” are all zero.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk6.jpg" height="256" width="256"><br>
          <br>
          Figure 19 shows the situation when sliding contact “O” is at
          position 6. The primary current Ips and the primary magnetic
          field Bps are still decreasing in magnitude while the
          magnitude of the primary current Ipn and the magnetic field
          Bpn are increasing. The primary current Ips (and Bps) is now
          of lower magnitude than primary current Ipn (and Bpn). Because
          the magnetic field Bpn of the “N” electromagnets is stronger
          than the magnetic field Bps of the “S” electromagnets, the
          polarity of the induced voltage Vsy, current Isy, and magnetic
          field Bsy are reversed in accordance with Lenz’s law. In this
          situation, the secondary electromagnets “y” present the north
          poles at the top and the south poles at the bottom making the
          “y” and “N” electromagnets to repel and the “y” and “S” to
          attract. Because of the now higher reluctance of the “N”
          electromagnets and lower reluctance of the “S” electromagnets,
          it is expected that part of the induced magnetic field Bsy
          will couple with the “S” electromagnets, and therefore, the
          effect of Lenz’s law is minimised.<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk7.jpg" height="231" width="242"><br>
          <br>
          Fig.20 illustrates the situation when the brush “O” is at
          position 8. The primary current Ipn and the magnetic field Bpn
          are at their maximum values. The induced secondary voltage
          Vsy, current Isy, and magnetic field Bsy are also maximum and
          of opposite polarities to those which they had at position 1.
          Again, part of the induced secondary magnetic field Bsy is
          attracted by the “S” electromagnet mitigating the effect of
          Lenz’s law.<br>

        <div align="left"> There are some practical points which have
          not been included so far and which need to be mentioned. The
          Figuera patent shows the electromagnets as just rectangles,
          and while C-shaped electromagnet cores have been indicated and
          discussed, there is a distinct possibility that the
          electromagnet cores are just I-shaped or even a short cylinder
          which is several times wide than it is tall. These more simple
          shapes could make it very much easier to construct, although
          the C-shaped core need only be three straight sections placed
          together.<br>
          <br>
          While it is definitely possible to construct each of the cores
          of the electromagnets from a solid block of iron, doing that
          will certainly allow eddy currents to generate heat in the
          cores, wasting useful energy in the process. It would be
          advisable therefore, to use the standard manufacturing method
          of assembling each core from a number of thin iron pieces,
          each separated from it’s neighbour by a thin layer of
          insulating material. These components are available from
          companies which manufacture transformers.<br>
          <br>
          [ Information discovered after the text was written indicates
          that Figuera specifically says not to use laminated cores ]<br>
          <br>
          I have to agree wholeheartedly with the anonymous contributor
          when he recommends that any attempted replications stay as
          close to the arrangement shown in the patent drawing, and have
          seven separate sets of three electromagnets. However, for
          subsequent experiments, a somewhat easier construction with
          just one set of electromagnets might be tried, making the
          electromagnets equal in length to the seven separate units:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk11.jpg" height="398" width="434"><br>
          <br>
          This arrangement has advantages if the design is taken on into
          manufacturing as less construction is needed.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 15 shows two electromagnets connected at the top to the
          battery Minus and at the bottom to the battery Plus. But, one
          is marked with a North pole at the top and the other with a
          South pole at the top, so perhaps some explanation would be
          helpful. If the coils are connected that way, then one will
          have to be wound in a clockwise (“CW”) direction and the other
          in a counter-clockwise (“CCW”) direction:<br>
          <br>
          Or the alternative is to have all of the electromagnets wound
          in the same way, and adjust the connections:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk12.jpg" height="398" width="434"><br>
          <br>
          The Figuera design was implemented more than a hundred years
          ago, and so Clemente did not have any semiconductors available
          to him, and so he used a motor-driven commutator arrangement
          to produce the electrical switching which he needed...<br>
          <br>
          Experienced experimenter ‘Woopy’ has posted a video of a quick
          experiment to test the working principle of this Figuera
          design. It is at <br>
          <br>
          <b>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlOGEnKpO-w&amp;feature=g-u-u</b><br>
          <b> </b><br>
          and in it, he short-circuits the secondary winding, showing
          that the input power is totally unaffected by the current draw
          from the secondary.<br>
          <br>
          He shows some very interesting oscilloscope shots:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk18.jpg" height="266" width="668"><br>
          <br>
          The first screen shot surprises me as it shows clearly that
          the output is actually an excellent square wave while I would
          have expected it to be a sine wave as it is coming from a coil
          which has inductance. The second shot shows very clearly, how
          the two banks of primary electromagnets operate out of phase
          with each other thanks to Woopy’s mechanical 6-way switching
          arrangement. It is reported that Mr Figuera ran a
          20-horsepower motor with his prototype and if that motor were
          fully loaded, then that is 15 kilowatts of power, easily
          enough to power a household.<br>
          <br>
          Please bear in mind that if the electromagnets are made from
          iron, whether laminated or not, that iron restricts the
          frequency, probably to 500 Hz or less, and so it is necessary
          to keep the frequency that low if using a solid-state circuit
          to drive the transformer. For 60 Hz output with mechanical
          switching, requires the motor to run at 3,600 rpm which is
          fairly fast although definitely achievable. Also, the output
          power will be limited by the current handling capacity of the
          wire in the secondary winding. The first page of the Appendix
          shows the current capacities for the standard AWG and swg wire
          sizes.<br>
          <br>
          Because this Figuera design is so important, being
          low-voltage, high power and not needing tuning I have recently
          been asked to explain it in greater detail and suggest some
          component values for people starting to experiment with it. I
          am not an electronics expert, and so my suggestions need to be
          taken as just that, namely, suggestions for a possible
          starting point for experimentation.<br>
          <br>
          The first point is that the two halves of the primary winding
          of the transformer become electromagnets when current flows
          through their windings. The strength of an electromagnet
          increases as the current flow increases. Large current: strong
          magnet. Small current: weak magnet.<br>
          <br>
          Clemente Figuera’s circuit is arranged so that the current
          through the windings is made to vary so that when one magnet
          is strong, the other one is weak. It works like this:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk19.jpg" height="261" width="390"><br>
          <br>
          When the mechanical (or transistor) switching connects the
          battery to point ‘8’ in the previous diagrams, we get the
          situation shown above. Current from the battery flows directly
          through the right-hand electromagnet “A”, making it the
          strongest magnet that it can be at that battery voltage. The
          electromagnet “B” on the left gets current flow from the
          battery all right, but that current is reduced because it has
          to flow through the resistor.<br>
          <br>
          When the switching changes and the battery is connected to
          point “1” in the previous diagrams, we get this arrangement:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk20.jpg" height="262" width="394"><br>
          <br>
          Here, electromagnet “B” is free of the resistor and gets it’s
          maximum possible current, making it the strongest magnet which
          it can be at that battery voltage, while electromagnet “A” has
          it’s current reduced by the resistor getting in the way,
          making it the weakest magnet it can be when the system is
          running.<br>
          <br>
          If we switched between these two positions, we would get a
          square wave style of operation, but Clemente did not do that.
          Instead, he split the resistor into seven parts (if Fig.14 is
          drawn correctly, one part having only half the resistance of
          the other parts). This makes the arrangement like this:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk21.jpg" height="329" width="320"><br>
          <br>
          When the battery negative “N” is connected to point “2”, then
          the current flow through electromagnet “B” is hindered by
          resistor R1, but the current flow through electromagnet “A” is
          hindered by resistors R2 and R3 and R4 and R5 and R6 and R7,
          which together, have a far higher resistance than R1 on its
          own. This makes the current flow through electromagnet “B” far
          greater than the current flow through electromagnet “A”.<br>
          <br>
          When the battery negative “N” is connected to point “3”, then
          the current flow through electromagnet “B” is hindered by
          resistor R1 and resistor R2, but the current flow through
          electromagnet “A” is hindered by resistors R3 and R4 and R5
          and R6 and R7, which together, have a far higher resistance
          than resistors R1 and R2. This makes the current flow through
          electromagnet “B” still greater than the current flow through
          electromagnet “A”.<br>
          <br>
          When the battery negative “N” is connected to point “4”, then
          the current flow through electromagnet “B” is hindered by
          resistors R1, R2 and R3, and the current flow through
          electromagnet “A” is hindered by resistors R4, R5, R6 and R7,
          which together, have a higher resistance than resistors R1, R2
          and R3. This makes the current flow through electromagnet “B”
          somewhat greater than the current flow through electromagnet
          “A” (nearly a balanced flow as resistor R7 is only half the
          value of each of the other resistors.<br>
          <br>
          When the battery negative “N” is connected to point “5”, then
          the current flow through electromagnet “B” is hindered by
          resistors R1, R2, R3 and R4, while the current flow through
          electromagnet “A” is hindered by resistors R5, R6 and R7,
          which together, now have a lower resistance than resistors R1,
          R2, R3 and R4. This makes the current flow through
          electromagnet “B” somewhat less than the current flow through
          electromagnet “A”.<br>
          <br>
          When the battery negative “N” is connected to point “6”, then
          the current flow through electromagnet “B” is hindered by
          resistors R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5, while the current flow
          through electromagnet “A” is hindered by resistors R6 and R7,
          which together, now have a much lower resistance than
          resistors R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5. This makes the current flow
          through electromagnet “B” much less than the current flow
          through electromagnet “A”.<br>
          <br>
          When the battery negative “N” is connected to point “7”, then
          the current flow through electromagnet “B” is hindered by
          resistors R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6, while the current flow
          through electromagnet “A” is hindered by resistor R7, which
          has a very much lower resistance than resistors R1, R2, R3,
          R4, R5 and R6 together. This makes the current flow through
          electromagnet “B” very much less than the current flow through
          electromagnet “A”.<br>
          <br>
          Clemente has arranged the battery switching sequence to be to
          points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
          repeating over and over again. This makes the connections to
          points 1 and 8 to be twice as long compared to the connection
          times for the intermediate points, giving a sine-wave shape
          rather than a sawtooth shape.<br>
          <br>
          There is current flow through both electromagnets at all
          times. The current flow is never broken although, as you can
          see, the intensity of the current flow varies all the time
          with each electromagnet getting stronger than the other one
          repeatedly.<br>
          <br>
          The mechanical switching used by Clemente will work perfectly
          well, although there will be motor noise and wear on the
          switch contacts. A solid state version will be silent, more
          reliable and much longer lasting. There are many different way
          to build most electronic circuits and each builder will have
          his own favourite way of constructing the circuit. This
          Figuera circuit does not specify the battery voltage and so
          some people will want to use a twelve volt battery. As many
          FET transistors need as much as ten volts in order to switch
          on properly, a twelve volt supply is probably a little low for
          them, and so I suggest using the older bipolar transistors.<br>
          <br>
          As the transistor has to carry the current which passes
          through the electromagnets, it needs to be able to handle
          considerable current flow. The very common 2N3055 transistor
          can do that (as can many other suitable transistors). The
          switching rate is very, very slow for a transistor and so
          speed is not an issue. The voltage is very low, and so that is
          not an issue either and so the 2N3055 transistor is definitely
          a possible choice.<br>
          <br>
          In common with most high-power transistors, the current gain
          is low being between 20 and 30 typically. That means that to
          switch it on properly, a current of one twentieth of the
          switched current has to be fed into the base of the
          transistor. That base current is too high to be convenient, so
          we can raise the transistor gain to around 6000 by adding in a
          low-power transistor such as the 2N2222 transistor. The two
          transistors are connected together in a configuration called a
          ‘Darlington Pair’ which looks like this:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk22darlpr.jpg" height="104" width="144"><br>
          <br>
          In this arrangement, the two Collectors are connected
          together, while the Emitter of the 2N2222 transistor feeds
          into the Base of the 2N3055 power transistor. With a high gain
          of six thousand or so for our transistor pair, we need to
          limit the current flowing through their combined
          Base-to-Emitter junction, and so we introduce a current
          limiting resistor R8 in the following circuit suggestion:<br>
          <br>
          <img alt="" src="pk23.jpg" height="426" width="486"><br>
          <br>
          The 10K resistor value shown would limit the transistor
          current to about nine amps, while a 4.7K resistor would allow
          around eighteen amps. Each transistor pair is only on for one
          eighth of the time, but the 2N3055 transistors need to be
          mounted on a heat-sink. If a single metal plate is used as a
          heat-sink for all eight 2N3055 transistors, then mica washers
          (available from the supplier of the transistors) must be used
          between each transistor and the plate because the Collector of
          each 2N3055 transistor is it’s metal case and in this circuit,
          the Collectors do not connect to a common point. The mica
          washers pass heat but not electricity. Separate heat-sinks
          can, of course, be used.<br>
          <br>
          The capacitor “C” in the above circuit diagram will probably
          not be needed. The switching needs to maintain a constant
          current flow through both electromagnets. I would expect the
          4017 chip switching to be fast enough to allow this to happen.
          If that proves not to be the case, then a small capacitor
          (probably 100nF or less) can delay the switch-off of the
          transistors just long enough to allow the next transistor in
          the sequence to be switched on to provide the required
          ‘Make-Before-Break’ switching.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated in the table above, the 4017 pins which feed the
          transistor pairs through the 1N4001 (or similar) diodes are:<br>
          <br>
          IC1 pin 3 and IC2 pin 5 for resistor connection point 1.<br>
          IC1 pin 2 and IC2 pin 1 for resistor connection point 2.<br>
          IC1 pin 4 and IC2 pin 10 for resistor connection point 3.<br>
          IC1 pin 7 and IC2 pin 7 for resistor connection point 4.<br>
          IC1 pin 10 and IC2 pin 4 for resistor connection point 5.<br>
          IC1 pin 1 and IC2 pin 2 for resistor connection point 6.<br>
          IC1 pin 5 and IC2 pin 3 for resistor connection point 7.<br>
          IC1 pin 6 and IC1 pin 9 for resistor connection point 8.<br>
          <br>
          This Figuera design is very attractive as it uses only simple,
          readily available materials, low voltage and does not require
          difficult tuning. It also has the potential to be self-powered
          if part of the output is used to provide a voltage-stabilized
          power supply for the input power and the remaining output
          power can be kilowatts if the wire diameters chosen can carry
          that much current.<br>

          This video is for WONJU at energeticforum under the thread
          "Reinventing the wheel "<br>
          I did this setup with my garbage, to simply see what could be
          the result of using this rotating commutator system as Figuera
          did in his time.<br>
          the 2 primary are Microwave fan motor coil and core that i
          have somehow cut&nbsp; to fit the drawing made by Wonju .<br>
          It is interesting to see that the output power on the
          secondary seems to be completely with no influence on the
          primary !!<br>
          OK for the rest the video is self explanatory.<br>
          good luck at all<br>

          The answer is a transformer looks like a pair of gears
          connected together (like in a car's standard transmission)<br>
          The input gear is large, and it runs at low RPM and high
          torque. It's connected to an output gear, and that runs at
          high RPM and low torque.<br>
          So in this case RPM is like voltage, and torque is like
          current.<br>
          I don't know if that will? help you, but I just gave you a
          very good mechanical analogy to a transformer, it's a pair of
          gears connected together.<br>
          ...&nbsp; <br>
          Woopy, your videos are always fun and interesting.<br>
          Let me just give you a suggestion that might help you
          visualize your system. Think of a step-up transformer, 12 volt
          AC in, 120 volts AC out. You must also know that you can say
          the transformer takes low voltage and high current and
          transforms that into high voltage and low? current for the
          same power. So what can we think of in the real life physical
          world that acts just like a transformer?<br>
          ...<br>
          woopy enjoyed the video, one thing? is the secondary is not
          lot , i mean to see major difference you need to have bigger
          secondary wind , the juice is not coming out primary though to
          secondary, it is very small part..<br>
          ... &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
          Add transistors and higher frequency this could? be
          massive!!!!<br>
          ...<br>
          You are doing almost flip-flop action just in middle of cycle
          both primary legs are powered on equal level and because? both
          primaries are not directly magnetically coupled, there are no
          spikes.<br>
