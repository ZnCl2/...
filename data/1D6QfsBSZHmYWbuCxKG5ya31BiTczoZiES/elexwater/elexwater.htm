      </center>
      <p><b>Electrolysed water</b> (EOW also known as electrolyzed
        oxidizing water, electro-activated water or electro-chemicaly
        activated water solution) is produced by the electrolysis of
        ordinary tap water containing dissolved sodium chloride.[1] </p>
      <p><b>Creation process</b> </p>
      <p>The electrolysis occurs in a specially designed reactor which
        allows the separation of the cathodic and anodic solutions. In
        this process, hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions are produced at
        the cathode, leading to an alkaline solution that consists
        essentially of sodium hydroxide. At the anode, chloride ions are
        oxidized to elemental chlorine. If some of this chlorine is
        allowed to combine with some of the hydroxide ions produced at
        the cathode, it disproportionates into hypochlorous acid, a weak
        acid and an oxidizing agent. This "acidic electrolyzed water"
        can be raised in pH by mixing in the desired amount of hydroxide
        ion solution from the cathode compartment, yielding a solution
        of sodium hypochlorite NaOCl which is the major component of
        ordinary household laundry bleach. A solution whose pH is 7.3
        will contain equal concentrations of hypochlorous acid and
        hypochlorite ion; reducing the pH will shift the balance toward
        the acid. </p>
      <p><b>Efficient disinfectant</b> </p>
      <p>Both sodium hydroxide and hypochlorous acid are efficient
        disinfecting agents;[2] since relatively few microorganisms can
        tolerate acidic conditions, the acidic form of EOW is usually
        preferred for rinsing food-preparation surfaces, fruits and
        vegetables. Preparations sold for topical application to wounds
        are usually slightly alkaline.[citation needed] </p>
      <p><b>Wound healing capabilities</b> </p>
      <p>Using a proprietary and non-cytotoxic formulation of
        oxychlorine compounds in a pH-neutral solution, Microcyn
        Technology, a commercially available electrolyzed water,
        provides a shelf life of 2 years and kills infection [3] without
        harming healthy tissue [4]. Oxychlorine compounds occur
        naturally in the human body as they are released by neutrophils,
        which are the most abundant type of white blood cells in humans
        and form an essential part of the immune system. </p>
      <p><b>Research</b> </p>
      <p>Some promotions of EOW claim that it can act as an antioxidant
        food additive; however, both of the chlorine-containing
        components of EOW are active chemical oxidizing agents.[5] </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">The Bottom Line</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>"Here, in a nutshell, are a few basic facts that I believe
        anyone with a solid background in chemistry or physiology would
        concur with: </p>
      <p>* "Ionized water" is nothing more than sales fiction; the term
        is meaningless to chemists. </p>
      <p>* Pure water (that is, water containing no dissolved ions) is
        too unconductive to undergo signficant electrolysis by "water
        ionizer" devices. </p>
      <p>* Pure water can never be alkaline or acidic, nor can it be
        made so by electrolysis. Alkaline water must contain metallic
        ions of some kind — most commonly, sodium, calcium or magnesium.
      </p>
      <p>* The idea that one must consume alkaline water to neutralize
        the effects of acidic foods is ridiculous; we get rid of excess
        acid by exhaling carbon dioxide. </p>
      <p>* If you do drink alkaline water, its alkalinity is quickly
        removed by the highly acidic gastric fluid in the stomach. </p>
      <p>* Uptake of water occurs mainly in the intestine, not in the
        stomach. But when stomach contents enter the intestine, they are
        neutralized and made alkaline by the pancreatic secretions — so
        all the water you drink eventually becomes alkaline anyway. </p>
      <p>* The claims about the health benefits of drinking alkaline
        water are not supported by credible scientific evidence. </p>
      <p>* There is nothing wrong with drinking slightly acidic waters
        such as rainwater. "Body pH" is a meaningless concept; different
        parts of the body (and even of individual cells) can have widely
        different pH values. The pH of drinking water has zero effect on
        that of the blood or of the body's cells. </p>
      <p>* If you really want to de-acidify your stomach (at the
        possible cost of interfering with protein digestion), why spend
        hundreds of dollars for an electrolysis device when you can take
        calcium-magnesium pills, Alka-Seltzer or Milk of Magnesia? </p>
      <p>* Electrolysis devices are generally worthless for treating
        water for health enhancement, removal of common impurities,
        disinfection, and scale control. Claims that "ionized" waters
        are antioxidants are untrue; hypochlorites (present in most such
        waters) are in fact oxidizing agents..." &amp;c... </p>

      <p><i>February 23, 2009</i> </p>
      <p>It's a kitchen degreaser. It's a window cleaner. It kills
        athlete's foot. Oh, and you can drink it. </p>
      <p>Sounds like the old "Saturday Night Live" gag for Shimmer, the
        faux floor polish plugged by Gilda Radner. But the elixir is
        real. It has been approved by U.S. regulators. And it's starting
        to replace the toxic chemicals Americans use at home and on the
        job. </p>
      <p>The stuff is a simple mixture of <b>table salt</b> and tap
        water whose ions have been scrambled with an electric current.
        Researchers have dubbed it electrolyzed water -- hardly as
        catchy as Mr. Clean. But at the Sheraton Delfina in Santa
        Monica, some hotel workers are calling it el liquido milagroso
        -- the miracle liquid. </p>
      <p>That's as good a name as any for a substance that scientists
        say is powerful enough to kill anthrax spores without harming
        people or the environment. </p>
      <p>Used as a sanitizer for decades in Russia and Japan, it's
        slowly winning acceptance in the United States. A New York
        poultry processor uses it to kill salmonella on chicken
        carcasses. Minnesota grocery clerks spray sticky conveyors in
        the checkout lanes. Michigan jailers mop with electrolyzed water
        to keep potentially lethal cleaners out of the hands of inmates.
      </p>
      <p>In Santa Monica, the once-skeptical Sheraton housekeeping staff
        has ditched skin-chapping bleach and pungent ammonia for spray
        bottles filled with electrolyzed water to clean toilets and
        sinks. </p>
      <p>"I didn't believe in it at first because it didn't have foam or
        any scent," said housekeeper Flor Corona. "But I can tell you it
        works. My rooms are clean." </p>
      <p>Management likes it too. The mixture costs less than a penny a
        gallon. It cuts down on employee injuries from chemicals. It
        reduces shipping costs and waste because hotel staffers prepare
        the elixir on site. And it's helping the Sheraton Delfina tout
        its environmental credentials to guests. </p>
      <p>The hotel's kitchen staff recently began disinfecting produce
        with electrolyzed water. They say the lettuce lasts longer.
        They're hoping to replace detergent in the dishwasher.
        Management figures the payback time for the $10,000 electrolysis
        machine will be less than a year. </p>
      <p>"It's green. It saves money. And it's the right thing to do,"
        said Glenn Epstein, executive assistant at the Sheraton Delfina.
        "It's almost like fantasy." </p>
      <p>Actually, it's chemistry. For more than two centuries,
        scientists have tinkered with electrolysis, the use of an
        electric current to bring about a chemical reaction (not the
        hair-removal technique of the same name that's popular in
        Beverly Hills). That's how we got metal electroplating and
        large-scale production of chlorine, used to bleach and sanitize.
      </p>
      <p>It turns out that zapping salt water with low-voltage
        electricity creates a couple of powerful yet nontoxic cleaning
        agents. Sodium ions are converted into <b>sodium hydroxide</b>,
        an alkaline liquid that cleans and degreases like detergent, but
        without the scrubbing bubbles. Chloride ions become <b>hypochlorous









          acid</b>, a potent disinfectant known as acid water. </p>
      <p>"It's 10 times more effective than bleach in killing bacteria,"
        said Yen-Con Hung, a professor of food science at the University
        of Georgia-Griffin, who has been researching electrolyzed water
        for more than a decade. "And it's safe." </p>
      <p>There are drawbacks. </p>
      <p>Electrolyzed water loses its potency fairly quickly, so it
        can't be stored long. Machines are pricey and geared mainly for
        industrial use. The process also needs to be monitored
        frequently for the right strength. </p>
      <p>Then there's the "magic water" hype that has accompanied
        electrolyzed drinking water. A number of companies sell
        so-called ionizers for home use that can range from about $600
        to more than $3,000. The alkaline water, proponents say,
        provides health benefits. </p>
      <p>But Richard Wullaert, a Santa Barbara consultant, said
        consumers should be careful. </p>
      <p>"Some of these people are making claims that will get everybody
        in trouble," said Wullaert, whose nonprofit Functional Water
        Society is spreading the word about electrolyzed water. "It's
        time for some serious conferences with serious scientists to
        give this credibility." </p>
      <p>Most of the growth has happened outside the United States. </p>
      <p>Russians are putting electrolyzed water down oil wells to kill
        pesky microbes. Europeans use it to treat burn victims.
        Electrolyzing equipment is helping to sanitize drinking water in
        parts of Latin American and Africa. </p>
      <p>It's big in Japan. People there spray it on sushi to kill
        bacteria and fill their swimming pools with it, eliminating the
        need for harsh chlorine. Doctors use it to sterilize equipment
        and treat foot fungus and bedsores. It's the secret weapon in
        Sanyo Electric Corp.'s "soap-less" washing machine. </p>
      <p>Now Sanyo is bent on cleaning up Japan's taxis with a tiny air
        purifier that fits into a car's cup holder. The device uses
        electrolyzed water to shield passengers from an unwelcome
        byproduct of Japan's binge-drinking business culture: vomit. </p>
      <p>"There was some concern about the spreading of viruses and
        bacteria via the taxi, not to mention the . . . stinky smells,"
        Sanyo spokesman Aaron Fowles said. </p>
      <p>Sanyo's taxi air washer isn't yet available in the U.S.;
        commuters will have to hold their noses for now. But the U.S.
        Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and
        the Environmental Protection Agency have approved electrolyzed
        water for a variety of uses. </p>
      <p><b>PuriCore</b> of Malvern, Pa., and <b>Oculus Innovative
          Sciences</b> of Petaluma, Calif., have developed treatments
        for chronic wounds. Albuquerque, N.M.-based MIOX Corp. sells
        municipal water-purifying systems. E<b>AU Technologies Inc</b>.
        of Kennesaw, Ga., caters to both ends of a dairy cow, with
        alkaline water to aid the animal's digestion and acid water to
        clean up its manure. </p>
      <p><b>Integrated Environmental Technologies Inc</b>. of Little
        River, S.C., is working with oil companies to keep wells free of
        bacteria and with high schools to sanitize sweaty wrestling mats
        and grungy football equipment that spread skin infections. </p>
      <p><b>Electrolyzer Corp</b>. of Woburn, Mass., is going after the
        hospitality market. The Sheraton Delfina purchased one of its
        machines. So has the Hyatt Regency Chicago and the Trump
        International Beach Resort near Miami. </p>
      <p>Patrick Lucci, Electrolyzer's vice president of marketing,
        likes to bombard prospects with scientific studies, then give
        'em the old razzle-dazzle. He'll swig the processed salt water
        before he mops the floor with it. </p>
      <p>"Try that with bleach," he said. </p>
      <p>The unit in Santa Monica looks a little like an oversized water
        heater, with two tanks side by side -- one for making the
        hypochlorous acid sanitizer, the other for the sodium hydroxide
        cleanser. </p>
      <p>Rebecca Jimenez, director of housekeeping, heard grumbling from
        the cleaning staff when the hotel brought the machine in last
        fall. Housekeepers doubted that the flat, virtually odorless
        liquids were really doing the job. Some poured the guest
        shampoos into their bottles to work up a lather. </p>
      <p>"If it doesn't suds up, it doesn't work," Jimenez said. "That's
        the mentality." </p>
      <p>Still, she said, most have come around and are enjoying working
        without fumes and peeling skin. </p>
      <p>Minnesota food scientist Joellen Feirtag said she was similarly
        skeptical. So she installed an electrolysis unit in her
        laboratory and began researching the technology. She found that
        the acid water killed E. coli, salmonella, listeria and other
        nasty pathogens. Yet it was gentle enough to soothe her
        children's sunburns and acne. </p>
      <p>She's now encouraging food processors to take a look at
        electrolyzed water to help combat the disease outbreaks that
        have roiled the industry. Most are dubious. </p>
      <p>"This sounds too good to be true, which is really the biggest
        problem," said Feirtag, an associate professor at the University
        of Minnesota. "But it's only a matter of time before this
        becomes mainstream." </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">How Our Technology Works</font></b></p>
      </center>
      <p>PuriCore's proprietary technology mimics the production by the
        human immune system of the body's natural anti-microbial by
        generating hypochlorous acid. Under a variety of brands
        including Sterilox, Aqualox, and Aquatine EC, PuriCore's Systems
        electrochemically generate hypochlorous acid solutions for
        customers at a range of concentrations to meet the needs of each
        application. Requiring only common salt, water, and electricity,
        these systems are reliable, safe, effective, and user-friendly.
        Because hypochlorous acid does not have a prolonged shelf life,
        our systems produce the solutions on-site and on-demand. </p>
      <p>Each PuriCore System includes a combination of proprietary
        electrolysis cells, software, and control systems within a
        custom-designed unit. These proprietary control systems ensure
        that the optimal concentration of hypochlorous acid is produced
        consistently and reliably within narrow specification
        tolerances. The hypochlorous acid solution produced is at near
        neutral pH (between 5 and 7), optimizing its biocidal efficacy,
        yet remaining completely safe to humans and the environment.
        (Below pH 4, the solution is aqueous chlorine; above pH 7.4, the
        Solution is hypochlorite, the chemical in common bleach.) </p>
      <p>PuriCore's Systems can be remotely monitored and incorporate a
        series of internal controls to ensure that only effective
        hypochlorous acid solution is available for use. </p>

          occlusive wound dressing, pulsative lavage device,
          hydrotherapy, hydrosurgical device, and/or ultrasound. A waste
          container may be operably connected to the apparatus for
          collecting waste from the wound by run-off, or by applying
          negative pressure (e.g. a vacuum). Because the apparatus of
          the invention can optionally be portable or mobile, the
          invention is suitable for use in hospitals and nursing homes,
          as well as for home wound care.; The invention also provides a

          shelf-stable Microcyn Technology platform have demonstrated,
          in a variety of research and investigational studies, the
          ability to treat a wide range of pathogens, including
          antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria (including MRSA and
          VRE), viruses, fungi and spores. The technology has also
          demonstrated wound healing in chronic and acute wounds in
          clinical investigational studies. It has been commercialized
          outside of the United States for the treatment of infected
          wounds. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract -- </b>A tissue cell growth-promoting solution
          manufactured using this invention will comprise water
          containing active oxygen as a prime ingredient. When the
          solution is applied to an internal or external wound, it
          supplies active oxygen originating from outside the biobody to
          supplement the active oxygen produced by the biobody's own
          protective system cells (such as neutrophils and macrophages)
          which gather at the wound site. The solution thus increases
          the concentration of active oxygen at the site of the wound, a
          state mimicking one in which a large quantity of such
          biosignals is secreted by the biobody itself.; The tissue cell
          growth-promoting solution described herein promotes the
          reconstruction of tissues, a process that corresponds to the
          last of the four main steps involved in wound healing
          biochemical processes of "blood vessel reaction", "blood
          vessel coagulation", "inflammation", "reconstruction of
          tissues" and which would otherwise have to rely on the natural
          healing power of the biobody itself. <br>

        <p><b>Abstract -- </b>An improved device and method for the
          creation of acidic electrolyzed water is described. The device
          has an flow-through anode chamber and a static cathode
          chamber. The static cathode chamber contains a fixed amount of
          salt-containing electrolyte, which is renewed as needed. The
          flow rate of water through the anode is restricted to a range
          of about 5 to 40 ml per ampere of current passed through the
          electrode. Electrolyzed water flowing from the anode is
          diluted to obtain the desired concentration of hypochlorous
          acid, and is collected in a tank or other vessel. The
          electrolysis reaction is terminated when a preset amount of
          current has passed through the anode. Water circulation may be
          one pass or recycling. In a preferred embodiment, the membrane
          is anion-selective.; Preferably, the membrane and the
          electrodes are integrated into a preassembled format that can
          be attached to the anode and cathode compartments via flanges
          or similar devices allowing quick replacement of an electrode
          assembly in an electrolyzer. The anion-permeable membrane can
          be protected by a protection membrane, in which are provided
          slits or other discontinuities to allow venting of gas. </p>

        <p>A unique technology utilizing electro-chemical activation
          (ECA) has been in use around the world for more than 30 years.
          The technology allows for the functional properties of water
          to be temporarily modified into solutions which can be used to
          destroy microorganisms, neutralize chemical agents, purify
          water and clean and degrease surfaces. IET’s EcaFlo® Division
          uses this unique technology as the core of its manufacturing
          platform to produce ECA equipment. </p>
        <p>IET designs, assembles, manufactures and sells the equipment
          that produces the two basic types of ECA solutions: anolytes
          and catholytes. Anolytes are strong oxidizing solutions that
          are used as antimicrobial agents to kill microorganisms.
          Catholytes are anti-oxidant, mild alkaline solutions that can
          be used as detergents and degreasers. Anolyte and catholyte
          solutions: </p>
        <p>* Are environmentally friendly * Do not require special
          handling * Are hypoallergenic * Can be safely disposed of in
          sewage systems * Are fast acting * Are powerful biocides * Can
          be used throughout the disinfecting and cleaning process * Can
          be applied in liquid, ice or aerosol form * Yield no synthetic
          chemical residues * Can be generated on-site, eliminating the
          handling and storage of chemicals * Can be produced from tap
          water and a very dilute brine solution </p>
        <p>IET produces and sells equipment under the EcaFlo® name
          brand. These equipment systems which can be placed on-site at
          point of use, generate reliable, economical and predictable
          liquid biocide solutions from sodium chloride (salt) brine. </p>
        <div align="center"><b><font size="+1">EcaFlo® Technology - How
              It Works</font></b></div>
        <center> </center>
        <p>The ECA process that IET employs is a patented technology
          that uses an electrolytic cell to temporarily alter the
          properties of water. The cell is exclusively manufactured for
          IET in the United States and is designed to meet specific IET
          performance requirements. The IET electrolytic cell is a
          specially designed and patented device consisting of a
          titanium anode tube, coated with precious metals, and
          separated from a titanium cathode tube by a semi-porous
          ceramic diaphragm. This unqiue cell is the key component of
          the EcaFlo® equipment produced by IET. </p>
        <p>When the anode and cathode tubes are electrically charged, a
          saline solution may be passed through the cell, producing
          anolyte from the anode chamber and catholyte from the cathode
          chamber. Anolyte and Catholyte are two distinctly different
          streams of activated water. </p>
        <p>Anolyte, produced in the anode chamber of the cell, is a
          strong oxidizing solution with a pH range of 3.5 - 8.5 and an
          Oxidation-Reduction Potential (ORP) of +600 to +1200mV. The
          most common application of anolyte is as a biocide agent. </p>
        <p>Catholyte, produced in the cathode chamber of the cell, is an
          antioxidant, mildly alkaline solution with a pH range of 10.5
          - 12.0 and ORP of -600 to -900mV. The most common application
          of catholyte is as a mild cleaning detergent and degreasing
          agent. </p>

        <p><b>Abstract --&nbsp; </b>Strongly acidic electrolyzed water
          (SAEW) is readily prepared from water containing NaCl by
          direct current electrolysis. SAEW has a strong bactericidal
          activity due to the high available chlorine (AC)
          concentration. We developed a compact device with a
          titanium-coated platinum electrode to make electrolyzed water
          for home care and evaluated this device. Analysis of the
          electrolyzed water produced by the device confirmed that the
          water on the anode side conformed to the definition of SAEW
          and it had a strong bactericidal activity. This device is
          useful for making SAEW as a disinfectant to employ at home
          care, when considering economic and environmental factors,
          since it returns to ordinary water after use. </p>
