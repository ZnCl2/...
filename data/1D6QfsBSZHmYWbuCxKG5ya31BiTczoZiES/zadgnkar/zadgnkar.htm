              A Wand that Converts Plastic Waste to Fuel</font></b> </p>

      <p>New Delhi Jan 31: The magic wand to convert the world's most
        daunting environmental problem of plastic waste into its most
        precious commodity, fossil fuels including diesel and petrol, is
        being wielded by a low profile woman scientist in India's
        western state of Maharashtra. </p>
      <p>Alka Zadgaonkar, who lives and works as an applied chemistry
        professor in the central Indian town of Nagpur, began to work
        her magic almost two years ago. </p>
      <p>A zero-pollution industrial process to convert
        non-biodegradable - and mostly non-recyclable - plastic waste
        into liquid hydrocarbons is quietly underway in the Butibori
        industrial estate, 25 km from Alka's home in Nagpur, the
        absolute central point of the country. </p>
      <p>The Zadgaonkars' Unique Waste Plastic Management &amp; Research
        Company plant devours a whole range of plastic waste -- from
        discarded carry bags to mineral water bottles and broken buckets
        to PVC pipes, polyethylene eriophthalate (PET) bottles, even ABS
        (acrylonitrile butadine sterine) plastic material used in the
        making of computer monitors and TV sets, keyboards et al -- and
        converts it 100 percent into liquid hydrocarbon fuels (85
        percent) and gases (15 percent). </p>
      <p>The Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has recommended use of the
        Zadgaonkar liquid fuels in running agriculture pumps and
        boilers, as marine fuel and input feed for petro refineries, and
        the gaseous fuels as an in-house and industrial substitute for
        LPG. </p>
      <p>The world's first and so far the only continuous process
        industrial plant in Butibori has caught the eye of the
        scientific community and begun to beckon entrepreneurs to
        approach its close-fisted promoter with buy-up or tie-up offers.
      </p>
      <p>While this happens, the inventor continues to go about her
        modest Indian urban middle-class routine of cooking food for her
        family every morning and evening and teaching at the Raisoni
        Engineering College during the day. </p>
      <p>"Invention of the process was the greatest reward of my life;
        why should I change my lifestyle?" asks Professor Alka
        Zadgaonkar, who is in her 40s, while serving her in-laws a meal.
      </p>
      <p>Husband Umesh offers the next bit of information - Alka is now
        concentrating on a method of producing solid fuel (similar to
        coal) from biodegradable solid waste in 24 hours flat. But the
        world might have to wait a while for the next revolution to
        happen. </p>
      <p>What's in the immediate offing at the plant is the upscaling of
        its production capacity from 10,000 to 25,000 litres of liquid
        hydrocarbons per day and addition of a unit to convert the 15
        percent gaseous output into electricity. </p>
      <p>Though the small scale industrial unit has an installed
        capacity to consume only 25 metric tonnes (MT) of plastic waste
        - present consumption is 10 MT a day - that would still leave
        more than 50 MT of the non-biodegradable hazard to the Nagpur
        Municipal Corporation (NMC) to dispose of. </p>
      <p>Clearly, the proven industrial process if replicated on a macro
        scale holds great promise for the country and the world at
        large. </p>
      <p>India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) estimates
        municipal solid waste (MSW) generation in the country to
        increase from the present 130,000 MT per day to a whopping
        821,000 MT by 2047. The estimated requirement of land for its
        disposal would be 169.9 sq km by then, as against 20.2 sq km in
        1997. </p>
      <p>The proportion of non-biodegradable plastic waste in the MSW,
        which increased from 0.69 percent in 1971-73 to 7 percent in
        2003, is growing exponentially. </p>
      <p>The scenario in the most industrially developed countries is
        even more frightening. In Los Angeles, 90 percent of the
        underground space allocated for landfills has already been
        occupied. Indeed, the Environmental Protection Agency, UK, has
        found as much as 65 percent increase in the generation of waste
        plastic litter globally from 1997 to 2005. </p>
      <p>Given the limits of plastic recycling (output degrades after
        each cycle) coupled with the fact that incineration is highly
        expensive and can be hazardous, emitting toxic gases if not done
        properly, and in view of the future energy crunch, Alka decided
        to try for herself what several polymer scientists in the world
        are already experimenting with - conversion of plastic to
        hydrocarbon fuels. </p>
      <p>Setting up an apparatus consisting of a cylindrical stainless
        steel vessel, a condensing system, a receiving flask and an
        outlet vent apart from a pressure gauge and a timer, Alka
        started experimenting with the idea way back in 1995 and saw the
        first signs of success only after four years of nerve-wracking
        perseverance. </p>
      <p>The method comprised regulated anaerobic heating of a mixture
        of plastic waste (90 percent) and coal (10 percent) in the
        presence of a catalyst. </p>
      <p>With word spreading across an incredulous scientific community,
        Alka began to receive invitations to attend seminars and give
        presentations. India's scientist President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,
        hearing about the encomiums showered on the inventor at a
        national seminar invited her to a conference in 2003. </p>
      <p>He then pushed the Department of Science of Technology (DST)
        and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas to verify Alka's
        claims. Top scientists of the IOC's R&amp;D wing had her
        conversion process test-demonstrated repeatedly under different
        conditions before handing down a favourable certification. </p>
      <p>But what had already clinched the issue in favour of the Indian
        scientist was a positive search report and subsequent
        publication of her patent application by the Geneva based World
        Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). The prestigious John
        Willey Publications, UK, devoted one whole chapter to her
        invention in their latest World Polymer Series, which is
        considered as the highest mark of authenticity. </p>
      <p>The only scientist from India to attend the Global Plastic
        Environmental Conference (GPEC) - 2004 at Detroit, US, on a
        special invitation, Alka has been approached by the Japanese oil
        giant Izemitsu, the US Applied Science Inc. and Germany's Marlos
        Thormann Energy Solutions with tie-up offers. </p>
      <p>However, Alka and her husband are keen to keep commercial
        interests within India and retain control over the industrial
        application of her invention. </p>
      <p>Back home, industrial giant Reliance Industries has shown
        interest and sent two senior officers to Butibori. </p>
      <p>Discussions for a large scale plant with global engineering
        consultants Mott- Macdonald and Dalal Engineering Consultants
        are on as well. </p>
      <p>Zadgaonkar's Unique Waste Plastic Management &amp; Research
        Company is running on a liberal loan from the state-run State
        Bank of India. </p>
      <p>"We receive an uninterrupted supply of raw material and sell
        the fuel in bulk to an agent who supplies it to small industrial
        units in the region," says Umesh Zadgaonkar. </p>
      <p>Citing statistics of crude oil consumption of 115 million MT
        per annum in India, 80 percent of which has to be imported at
        the rate of $60 per barrel and pointing out that one litre of
        crude oil yields only 600 ml of hydrocarbon fuel, Umesh says
        plastic waste converted into liquid hydrocarbons in his plant
        without emitting any pollutants would be a cheaper partial
        substitute. It would also take care of hazardous plastic waste.
      </p>
      <p>Coupled with the bio-diesel revolution, the
        plastic-waste-to-fuel process can prove to be a double-boon for
        humanity. </p>
      <p>This is an idea whose time has come. </p>

        <p><b><font size="+1">Converting Plastic Waste into Petrol!</font></b>
        </p>
        <p><b>T. Jahnavi</b></p>
      </center>
      <p>ALKA Zadgaonkar believes in creating something of value even
        out of waste. Since last year, she has been demonstrating to
        Indian and foreign experts how waste plastic can be converted
        into petrol, offering a solution to one of the world’s biggest
        environment problems—-waste plastic disposal. </p>
      <p>Head of the Department of Organic Chemistry at Nagpur’s G.H.
        Raisoni College of Engineering, Zadgaonkar recently signed a
        memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Indian Oil
        Corporation (IOC) for manufacturing and marketing petroleum
        products generated from waste plastic. She has been given Rs 5.9
        million for the pilot project. </p>
      <p>How did she hit upon the idea? "Both plastics and
        petro-products are hydrocarbons. The only difference is that in
        plastics the chain of molecules is longer. So, I wondered if it
        was possible to break the chain into small segments to convert
        it into value-added fuel. I started working on this idea in 1995
        and my first successful experiment was in 1998-99," says
        40-year-old Zadgaonkar. </p>
      <p>Zadgaonkar’s method is simple: shredded plastic waste - free of
        oxygen – is heated with coal and a secret chemical. The products
        include fuel range liquids, coke and LPG range gases. About 1 kg
        of plastic and 100 gm of coal churn out a litre of fuel, which
        contains the gasoline range. More processing, Zadgaonkar claims,
        yields refined petrol. </p>
      <p>"We can use any waste plastic recycled any number of times,"
        says Zadgaonkar. She has received a patent from the World
        Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO). </p>
      <p>Zadgaonkar’s partner in her quest has been her husband, Umesh,
        also a chemical engineer. The couple has demonstrated this
        technique in Delhi, Mumbai (in the presence of Chief Minister
        Sushilkumar Shinde), and in Pune. They stay in a joint family
        with their 14-year-old son. Members of the family sold part of
        the family property to support her research. </p>
      <p>Zadgaonkar claims almost all plastic products—- bags, Polyvinyl
        Chloride (PVC), old raincoats and broken buckets can be
        converted into fuel through her processing method. There is also
        no problem with residue disposal or emission, as the solid
        residue is coke and the gaseous emission is pure LPG, she says.
      </p>
      <p>The quest is significant for India, which produces 7,000 tonnes
        of waste plastic every day. Zadgaonkar calculates that even if
        50 per cent of this waste is converted, the country would have
        approximately 2.5 million litres of petrol every day, and
        significant volumes of diesel and lubricating oil. </p>
      <p>Also, unlike in crude oil processing, this conversion can be
        carried out in smaller, low-investment plants. Zadgaonkar says
        the processing costs are also low because this distillate,
        unlike crude oil, contains no sulphur or lead. With further
        value addition, more expensive petro-products like alfa-olifins
        and aviation-grade gasoline can be obtained from the liquid
        distillate. </p>
      <p>While Zadgaonkar announced the success of her experiment almost
        two years ago, she was briefly dogged by controversy when her
        Ph.D guide, Dr G.K. Ghoshal from Lakshmi Narain Institute of
        Technology, Nagpur, declared that he was the co-inventor of
        petrol from plastic waste. </p>
      <p>Zadgaonkar claims she chose reclamation of petro-products from
        waste plastic as the topic for her D. Sc degree and started
        experimenting with waste plastic way back in 1995. She met
        Ghoshal in 1999 and decided to do a Ph.D under his guidance. Her
        subject this time was ‘Studies in co-processing of petroleum
        residues with other heavy materials for optimum yield and
        quality of coke products and their mechanism’, different from
        her D.Sc research. </p>
      <p>"But in 2001, when I applied for a patent on the waste plastic
        conversion process, Ghoshal demanded co-inventor status and
        threatened to subvert my Ph. D. When I did not yield, he carried
        out a media campaign against me, saying that my claims were a
        hoax." </p>
      <p>The negative publicity however, could not take credit away from
        Zadgaonkar, who was invited by the IOC to sign a MoU on the
        production of petrol from waste plastic. "That is what matters
        to me, not a Ph.D degree." </p>
      <p>She is looking forward to the launch of her new product within
        a year. A pilot plant with a capacity of 15 tonnes will come up
        in Nagpur within six months, followed by plants in Delhi and
        then all over the country. </p>
      <p>Will reclaimed petrol be cheaper than ordinary petrol?
        According to Zadgaonkar, the process of conversion costs Rs 7.50
        per litre. Along with the raw material expenditure, the total
        cost of petrol production would be about Rs 12. However, she
        says it is not possible to determine the exact cost at this
        stage. </p>
      <p>Zadgaonkar is happy that she has contributed in suggesting ways
        to solve the plastic waste problem of the country. WFS </p>

        to our lives. We can't deny that." </p>
      <p>Were she a spokeswomen for the dishonest, self-serving plastic
        industry lobby, that statement would be understandable. Were she
        a legislator we could say she was evading the issue. Her
        statement will likely infuriate many of us agonising over the
        plastic litter all around us. </p>
      <p>But hold your breath. Alka loves plastics for an exciting
        reason; she is the inventor of a process that has the potential
        to clear our environment of plastic waste, create a million jobs
        in waste management, add useful, profitable products to our
        economy and make India a technology leader in taming plastics.
        Her work is breathtaking good news for this planet's
        environment. </p>
      <p><b>Pie on the table:</b> </p>
      <p>We are not talking of a pie in the sky idea that is still in
        the laboratory. Alka and her husband Umesh, are buying in 5
        tonnes of plastic waste everyday in Nagpur at prices attractive
        to rag pickers. They are wringing fuel oil out of that unsightly
        pile and selling it to industries in the Butibori Industrial
        Estate, on Wardha Road out of Nagpur. Production from their
        plant, Unique Plastic Waste Management &amp; Research Co Pvt Ltd
        is sold out for the next year. </p>
      <p>They are making money right now, and are about to scale up and
        buy in 25 tonnes of plastic waste a day. That production too is
        booked. As Nagpur generates only 35 TPD of plastic waste, they
        will shortly run out of raw material to grow bigger. So, a plant
        based on their technology may soon be playing in your town, at a
        factory near you. </p>
      <p><b>All your questions:</b> </p>
      <p>Too good to be true? Let us at once address some of the
        questions that are already popping up in your mind. Zadgaonkar's
        is not a demo plant running on some government grant or subsidy.
        They took a commercial loan from the State Bank of India in 2005
        and have already begun paying back. In fact, the government let
        them down and Zadgaonkars decided to flex the great Indian
        entrepreneurial muscle. [On that, more later.] </p>
      <p>The process invented and patented by Alka Zadgaonkar is capable
        of accepting all tribes and castes of plastic waste as input:
        carry bags, broken buckets and chairs, PVC pipes, CDs, computer
        keyboards and other eWaste, the horrible, aluminized crinkly
        bags of the kind that pack crisps, expanded polystyrene [the
        abominable 'thermocole'], PET bottles- are these and others are
        all given equal opportunity to contribute to Zadgaonkars'
        profits. No sorting or picking is done. </p>
      <p>No preparatory cleaning is necessary either, except shredding
        that helps economic transport of bulky waste. All solids and
        metal fines settle down in the melting process or are converted
        to ash. </p>
      <p>Chlorinated plastics like PVC are particularly hazardous to
        burn because they emit dioxins. In the Alka Zadgaonkar process,
        the entire shredded mixture is melted at a low temperature and
        led to a de-gasification stage. Here chlorine is led away to
        harmlessly bubble through water, producing hydrochlorous acid. </p>
      <p><b>Process path:</b> </p>
      <p>Shredded waste is continually fed into a conventional extruder.
        Here over the length of a heated extruder screw, the waste is
        plasticised and melted at a relatively low temperature. The melt
        is then stripped of chlorine as we just saw, and led to a
        reactor where lies the crux of the invention. The melt interacts
        with proprietory catalysts invented by Alka. The stable,
        continual chain of carbon found in all plastics is destabilised
        by a depolymerization reaction and rendered ready for a rich
        harvest. </p>
      <p>Three streams of produce are obtained. A part of the gaseous
        cloud is condensed to form a liquid hydrocarbon. This is the
        recovered fuel oil. It is a sulphur free equivalent of
        industrial crude. It can be readily used in furnaces or put
        through fractional condensation to obtaine finer grades like
        petrol. For a long while to come, the best market for this is as
        furnace oil for process heating in factories. Zadgaonkar
        recovery plants, when they spread in the country, can use
        plastic from local dumps and serve local industries which
        currently buy expensive furnace oil from far away. </p>
      <p>What is not condensable at the reactor is obtained as a LPG
        equivalent. A modified genset can generate electricity using
        this gas. This is now standard practice at a Zadgaonkar plant,
        which is self sufficient for power. The final remains are a
        solid fuel called petroleum coke. Approximately 70% is liquid
        hydrocarbon, 15% is gas and 5% is solid coke. Balance is ash and
        metal fines. </p>
      <p><b>And now the story:</b> </p>
      <p>Alka born in 1962, has always had a fascination for organic
        chemistry. "I was intrigued by the way new products can be
        created by playing with carbon and hydrogen molecules," she
        says. "There was a sense of great control over things." That
        mind set was to eventually lead her to her invention. </p>
      <p>After marriage to Umesh Zadgaonkar, she settled in Nagpur and
        began teaching chemistry. Umesh is an MBA and a natural
        entrepreneur- which means he has an ability to grab the
        opportunity ball and carry it over the line, eluding all
        tackles. He was the first to bring health clubs and gyms to a
        sleepy, conservative Nagpur; he realised the idea would appeal
        to citizens given to living the clean life. In contrast, Alka is
        a small, self-effacing lady fiercely committed to teaching and
        housekeeping. Their son Akshay is a computer prodigy. </p>
      <p>In 1993, Alka first began to notice plastic piles in their
        clean and pleasant Nagpur. The menace was already a huge problem
        in big cities and there was a rising chorus of concern demanding
        solutions. These ranged from fiats to ban carry bags use [- as
        though other forms of plastics were innocent], to recycling to
        making the industry pay. "You can't wish away plastics," says
        Alka. "They have become a part of our lives." </p>
      <p>She began to think of a creative solution. It was still
        pre-Internet days and she did not have ready to access to the
        state of the art. She knew her chemistry, though. She began
        arguing that the source of all plastics is petroleum. The trick
        is to revert them to their previous life where they become
        petroleum again. Plastics get their variety and stability from
        strong continual, patterned bonding of the carbon molecule. If
        this long chain is disrupted, they would collapse and can be
        coaxed to their original form. The process of disruption is
        random depolymerization. </p>
      <p><b>Planning disruption:</b> </p>
      <p>That is so simplistic that many technologists will react
        stating the many problems in the way. Alka was lucky she was
        sounding Umesh. He's a positive person who believes anything is
        possible. Ten years ago, when their son Akshay was just 8 and
        home computers were intimidating, expensive objects, everyone
        shooed the boy away from it. Not Umesh. That encouragement led
        Akshay to become at 12, the world's youngest Microsoft Certified
        Software Developer [MCSD]. The Zadgaonkar family was sent
        tickets to Seattle for a private meeting with Bill Gates.
        [Akshay, yet to finish college is interning with Microsoft at
        Hyderabad.] </p>
      <p>So Umesh understands dreamers. He urged Alka to explore her
        idea. "He believed in me and kept saying it was only a matter of
        time and labour," she says. Young Sunil Raisoni, who runs the
        Raisoni College where Alka teaches was another man who
        encouraged her. She got space and permission to set up a lab in
        the college. Zadgaonkars sold an apartment they had and set
        aside Rs. 1 Lakh for equipment. </p>
      <p>From the beginning Alka was clear that any process she develops
        should be able to handle any manner of plastics, with little
        cleaning or preparation. She was setting herself a harder target
        in a territory without maps. Her idea was to get a plasticised
        pool of waste to react with her proprietory catalysts to create
        hydrocarbon fumes that can be condensed. </p>
      <p>She set up her experiment at Raisoni college and began trying
        various catalyst recipes. "I began with an awareness that it'd
        be a long series of exploration," she says. But she was not
        prepared for the length of that series. The temperature and
        pressure [-atmospheric] parameters were pretty much
        standardised; the only experimentation was with various
        catalysts. And yet, there was no sign of promise. </p>
      <p><b>Then came Carver:</b> </p>
      <p>Three years into her experiments and with nothing to show, Alka
        was close to giving up. She began to doubt her ability. Umesh
        sensed the mood and brought home a Marathi book for her to read.
        It was 'Ek Hota Carver', a biography of George Washington
        Carver, the great black American inventor and idealist. Alka
        says,"That book shamed me. Here was a man who was black, denied
        parental love and racially discriminated. Yet he pursued
        knowledge that may benefit all and left his wealth for common
        good." </p>
      <p>Carver carried her over the last mile. She resumed her
        experiments with a new vigour. Then came the day, Dec 13, 1999.
        She had set up that morning's trial catalyst and was in a
        classroom teaching. A maintenance staff came rushing at 11 am
        and said cooking gas was leaking from her lab. </p>
      <p>"I knew at once that I had my winning catalyst. If there was
        gas, there would be a distillate too," she recalls. And there it
        was, a few milli litres of liquid petroleum recovered from
        plastic film waste. She sat down for a few moments to take it
        all in. And then she called Umesh. </p>
      <p>The inevitable hard journey then began. News of such a
        development naturally evokes both hyperbole and skepticism.
        Media picked up the story and all Nagpur was agog. Then on Sep
        2, 2003, the Union petroleum ministry sent a team from Indian
        Oil Corporation's [IOC] R&amp;D department. </p>
      <p>They were dedicated investigators. They sat all day in Alka's
        lab, even taking lunch there. They measured and noted
        everything, peered into corners and took away samples they
        produced with their own hands. Then at the invitation of the
        minister Ram Naik, another demo took place at IOC's Faridabad
        centre. Two more demos followed in Mumbai and Delhi. </p>
      <p>IOC then declared its findings in a report: "The products have
        been tested at IOC R&amp;D and recommended possible end uses are
        as follows: For liquid hydrocarbon: agricultural pumps, DG sets,
        boiler fuel, marine bunker fuel, as input for petroleum
        refineries, fuel oil etc; For gas: any nearby industries using
        LPG, in-house consumption; For solid fuel: thermal power plants,
        metallurgical industries." The minister then declared a grant of
        Rs.6 crores for a pilot production plant to be set up by
        Zadgaonkars in collaboration with IOC. </p>
      <p><b>The freedom run:</b> </p>
      <p>Only, the grant never materialized. Alka and Umesh wrote
        letters, reminders and called. Things stayed intriguingly
        silent. When they probed deeper they discovered that a senior
        science bureaucrat was angling for equity in the venture.
        Elsewhere, Alka's PhD guide was campaigning to be named
        co-inventor. </p>
      <p>Well, well what's new you say. Aren't these typical of India.
        Yes, odds are indeed stacked against those with novel ideas and
        spontaneous help seldom comes forth. But aren't heroes meant to
        be of sterner stuff? And if there weren't enough of them around
        GoodNewsIndia can't have run for over five years. A hero does
        suffer setbacks but they don't stop him. Nor does he make a
        display of his martyrdom. A hero vaults the odds or works around
        them. </p>
      <p>In 2004, Umesh, ever the entrepreneur, flushed the whole
        connection with IOC. He went over to the State Bank of India and
        presented a business plan. They were interested but would
        conduct their own trials on the idea. It was soon done and a
        team of senior bank staff arrived in Nagpur to grant a loan of
        Rs 5 crores. Alka's patent was treated as equity and pledged to
        the bank as security. In under six months the plant came up and
        in 2005 production began. </p>
      <p><b>The rest we know.</b> </p>
      <p>Umesh is a busy man now, taking calls and meeting potential
        franchisees. A delegation of Chief Ministers from five states
        have visited to explore setting up plants in their states. A
        team from Netherlands is in dialogue to see if the produce can
        be mostly solid coke instead of liquid fuel. A team in IIT,
        Mumbai is designing automation features for standard 5 TPD units
        to be set up by franchisees. But these are early days still. </p>
      <p>For now, clients in Butibori Estate's industrial units are
        buying all that Unique can produce. The Bank has seen repayments
        begin. But at the Zadgaonkar household, values have hardly
        changed. Success sits lightly on this family of knowledge
        seekers: Alka refuses to give up her calling as a teacher.</p>
