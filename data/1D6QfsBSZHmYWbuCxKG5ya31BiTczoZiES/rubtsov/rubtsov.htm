      Government-funded researchers are building a flashlight that makes
      people puke on command.
      <p>The LED Incapacitator uses a range-finder to measure the
        distance to a target's eyes, <i>Threat Level </i>notes. Then
        it unleashes continually changing, multi-color light pulses that
        make the target feel bad -- really bad. The "effects, whose
        effectiveness depends on the person, range from disorientation
        to vertigo to nausea," according to <i>Technology Review</i>. </p>
      <p>The trick isn't trying to figure out which light-pulse sequence
        will make people hurl. "There’s one wavelength that gets
        everybody,” says Robert Lieberman, who along with his partner
        Vladimir Rubtsov, is developing the Incapicator for the
        Department of Homeland Security. “Vlad calls it the evil color.”
      </p>
      <p>The tough part for Lieberman and Rubstov is getting the thing
        down to a manageable size, a DHS newsletter notes. </p>
      <p><i>At 15 inches long by 4 inches wide, the current prototype is
          more transportable than portable. The next-generation weapon
          must be as short and svelte as a D-cell Maglite, designed to
          fit on a duty belt. “Phase 3 will be our shrink phase,”
          Lieberman says.</i> </p>
      <p>There's also talk of making the weapon bigger, too.
        "immobilizing a mob, for instance, might call for a wide-angle
        'bazooka' version," the newsletter muses. But even king-sized
        vomit-lights could have some pretty obvious countermeasures, <i>Technology



          Review </i>notes. "The person being targeted could easily
        look away, or he or she might be wearing heavily tinted
        glasses." </p>
      <p>Harder to beat would be a radio-frequency puke ray. Lucky for
        us, the Navy is backing one of those, too. </p>

      <p><b>Abstract</b> </p>
      <p>Apparatus and method for using an light source to incapacitate
        a subject in which the light source strobes by a spatial
        scanning through a pattern and a temporal flashing at a rate
        sufficient to cause incapacitation. The strobing (meaning both
        spatial scanning and temporal flashing is in a pattern to
        prevent the subject from escaping the strobing effect. The
        flashing is timed so that each flash point in the pattern will
        flash at a rate and sequence to cause incapacitation. In a
        preferred embodiment, the light source is an array of LEDs or
        laser diodes. </p>

      <p><b>DESCRIPTION</b> </p>
      <p>Following is a description of the invention sufficient to
        enable it to be practiced and extending to the best mode or
        modes of the invention known to the inventor. </p>
      <p>In one aspect the invention is a method and apparatus for
        incapacitating a person or other animal (referred to as the
        subject or target) by causing a light source to have a temporal
        flash component and a spatial scan component. The spatial scan
        component will create a pattern by means of positions in the
        apparatus that result in flash points in space to define a
        scanned area. In one aspect the invention is a method and
        apparatus for incapacitating a person or other animal by use of
        an array of light emitting elements having a temporal flash
        component and a spatial scan component in a repeating pattern
        such that at each repetition of a given position in the pattern
        a flash rate occurs within the range of flash rates that will
        cause some level of incapacitation. When a plurality if light
        emitting elements is used each may be equipped with a
        collimator, or a combined beam former may be used to transform
        the wide angle of the LEDs to a narrow beam. The exposure of the
        subject to the flashing light is not necessarily limited to
        avoiding permanent injury or lethality. However, in one aspect
        the invention is defined in relation to the MPE (maximum
        permissible exposure) as defined in Laser Institute of America
        ANSI Z136.1-2000, Safe Use Of Lasers (reference 1) so as to not
        exceed the MPE. </p>
      <p>In one aspect of the invention the spatial scan rate and the
        temporal flash rate are selected such that in each cycle of the
        pattern at least one flash occurs at each flash point. </p>
      <p>In accordance with the invention, it is important that light
        energy be delivered to a target area that includes an area
        greater than the beam footprint. This prevents the subject from
        escaping the effect of the flashing. This is done by setting the
        device to a sequence of directions to visit a sequence of flash
        points to result in a pattern that defines an area in space. In
        such a case, it is necessary to spatially scan the beam through
        a sequence of positions while flashing to ensure the delivery of
        the energy to effect some level of incapacitation. The direction
        of the beam and the number of flashes to occur in each position
        may be achieved in a number of different ways. Two examples are
        presented. The first involves a flash rate that is so much
        faster than the spatial scan rate that the beam direction
        revisits each position in the scan sequence and consequently
        each flash point in space at a rate such that at least one flash
        occurs at each flash point. The second is that the spatial scan
        rate is so much greater than the flash rate that not every flash
        point is flashed at each spatial scan cycle. </p>
      <p>These conditions are controlled by three variables: A = scan
        rate, the time for spatial scan of the entire pattern in
        cycles/unit time; B = flash rate, the time in flashes/unit time;
        and C = number of positions or flash points in the pattern; </p>
      <p>whereby the relationship that defines the sequence of temporal
        flashing and spatial scanning within the pattern is given by: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq1.jpg" height="52" width="207"></p>
      </center>
      <p>wherein flashes may occur once or a multiple of times at each
        flash point per spatial scan cycle, or may skip one or more
        flash points per spatial scan cycle. </p>
      <p>The term strobe or strobing is be used in this description and
        in the claims as having a special definition, meaning a
        combination of a spatial scan component being the movement of
        the beam and of a temporal flash component representing the
        flashing of the light emitting elements. Strobing is utilized to
        create a flash pattern also called a target configuration. A
        flash pattern is established by the spatial scan component to
        provide a set of flash points in space each flash point
        representing one direction of the beam footprint. Typically the
        flash points are illuminated in a flash order which in one
        embodiment is repeated to define the flash pattern. A flash is
        defined as being repeated in an ordered sequence when there is
        some geometric relationship to the sequence such as adjacent
        flash points. One or both components of the strobe or strobing,
        the spatial and the temporal, can be set fixedly or be
        adjustable. When all the flash points of a flash pattern have
        been visited, either with one or more flashes or not, a flash
        pattern cycle is completed. Also, as will be explained in more
        detail below, the flash order may be set to a regular geometric
        relationship such as with the flash pattern spatially scanning
        through adjacent flash points, or it may be set in a randomized
        flash order that repeats itself in each cycle. Although it is
        practical to cause the flash order to repeat by use of a CPU
        controlled and programmed device the flash order can vary for
        each cycle. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment each flash point is flashed at least once in
        each spatial scan cycle. Although this may be done in an ordered
        sequence as described above, it may also be done in a randomized
        sequence. In either case the sequence may be constantly repeated
        or may be varied such as by different ordered sequences or by
        different randomized sequences. For example, a set of X
        different randomized flash patterns can be programmed, which
        repeat. </p>
      <p>In another aspect the target of exposure is exposed to an
        amount of irradiance not exceeding the MPE (as designated in
        ANSI Z136.1-2000) in order to cause less than permanent injury
        to the eyes. </p>
      <p>These and other aspects of the invention will be apparent from
        the following description(s) of embodiments of the invention. </p>
      <p>FIG. 1 shows in schematic form, an apparatus 10 constructed in
        accordance with the invention. The apparatus 10 has a case 12 in
        which are contained the operating components. These are a power
        supply 14, an electrical control module 16, a scan module 18, a
        light emitting module 20 and a lens or beam former 22. </p>
      <p>The case 12 can be generally elongated to carry the components,
        although any workable arrangement of the components and
        configuration of the case 12 is within the scope of the broad
        concept of the invention. It has a rear handle 24 and a lower
        handle 26 adapted to enable it to be held and operated by hand.
        Also it has a mounting receptacle 28 for attaching any kind of
        stand for holding it in a steady and controllable position.
        Although the flash pattern is designed to trap a subject in the
        pattern, that is to be large enough that incapacitation will
        occur before the subject can escape from the pattern; it is also
        possible that the user can traverse the apparatus as the subject
        moves in order to keep the subject closer to the middle of the
        scan pattern and in any event to keep the subject in the pattern
        as long as necessary. </p>
      <p>The power supply 14 can be a rechargeable battery along with or
        alternatively, a receptacle for an external power source. A
        battery life indicator 30 is shown as well as contacts 32a and
        32b. </p>
      <p>The electrical control module 16 has an electrical input and
        control element 34 connected to the power supply 14 by contacts
        36a and 36b and a spatial scan control element 38 that has
        circuitry and processing elements for allowing the spatial scan
        and temporal flash to be set and controlled. An adjusting
        mechanism 40 allows the spatial scan rate and temporal flash
        rate to be changed. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment the spatial scan module 18 has a vertical
        scanner mechanism 42 and a horizontal scanner mechanism 44. In
        one embodiment the vertical scanner 42 is a linear actuator or
        incrementer that will operate in specific, and if desired,
        adjustable vertical increments while the horizontal scanner 44
        is a continuous reciprocating scan device operating over a
        horizontal reciprocal range and if desired it can have an
        adjustable (in either or both speed and range) mode. These could
        be reversed. Where a continuous motion of scanning is used the
        flash points are defined by the event of flashing; and where a
        stepping device is used the flash points may be defined by a
        mechanical position. </p>
      <p>The light emitting module 20 has a control frame 46 extending
        from the scan module 18 to an light element support frame 48 on
        which are mounted a heat sink 50 and a light source 52. </p>
      <p>FIG. 2 shows in schematic form, an alternative apparatus 100
        constructed in accordance with the invention. The apparatus 100
        has a case 102 in which are contained the operating components.
        These are a power supply 104, an electrical control module 106,
        a scan module 108, a light emitting module 110 and a lens or
        beam former 112. </p>
      <p>The case 102 can be generally elongated to carry the
        components, although any workable arrangement of the components
        and configuration of the case 102 is within the scope of the
        broad concept of the invention. It has a rear handle 114 and a
        lower handle 116 adapted to enable it to be held and operated by
        hand. Also it has a mounting receptacle 118 for attaching any
        kind of stand for holding it in a steady and controllable
        position. Although the flash pattern is designed to trap a
        subject in the pattern, that is to be large enough that
        incapacitation will occur before the subject can escape from the
        pattern; it is also possible that the user can traverse the
        apparatus as the subject moves in order to keep the subject
        closer to the middle of the scan pattern and in any event to
        keep the subject in the pattern as long as necessary. </p>
      <p>The power supply 104 can be a rechargeable battery along with
        or alternatively, a receptacle for an external power source. A
        battery life indicator 120 is shown as well as contacts 122a and
        122b. </p>
      <p>The electrical control module 106 has an electrical input and
        control element 124 connected to the power supply 104 by
        contacts 126a and 126b and a spatial scan control element 128
        that has circuitry and processing elements for allowing the
        spatial scan and temporal flash to be set and controlled. An
        adjusting mechanism 130 allows the spatial scan rate and
        temporal flash rate to be changed. </p>
      <p>In one embodiment the spatial scan module 108 has a vertical
        scanner mechanism 132 and a horizontal scanner mechanism 134. In
        one embodiment the vertical scanner 132 is a linear actuator or
        incrementer that will operate in specific, and if desired,
        adjustable, vertical increments while the horizontal scanner 134
        is a continuous reciprocating scan device operating over a
        horizontal reciprocal range and if desired it can have an
        adjustable (in either or both speed and range) mode. These could
        be reversed. Where a continuous motion of scanning is used the
        flash points are determined by the event of flashing; and where
        a stepping device is used the flash points may be determined by
        a mechanical position. </p>
      <p>The light emitting module 110 has a control frame 136 extending
        from the scan module 108 to an light element support frame 138
        on which are mounted a heat sink 140 and an array of LEDs (light
        emitting diodes) 142 on a mounting platen 144. The light
        emitting module 110 is held in place by a flexible support ring
        146 that allows the light emitting module 110 to pivot as it is
        moved in the spatial scan component of the strobe function. </p>
      <p>The LED array 142 can be an array of discrete LEDs or it can be
        one or more LED clusters. </p>
      <p>The beam former 112 is an optical element that functions to
        form a desired beam 148 from the light emitted by the LED array
        142. The beam angle X defines the size of the spot of a single
        flash point on the target. The beam diameter at the exit of the
        beam former defines the observed aperture x.sub.1--x.sub.1.
        Other light emitting elements can be employed. For use of
        coherent light sources, a laser source can be employed with
        optical fibers carrying the laser light from a single laser at
        an input end to an output end the output ends being arranged in
        an array. Alternatively a plurality of lasers in an array could
        be employed. By use of coherent light, with less divergence,
        longer operating ranges are possible. </p>
      <p>Other light emitting elements include laser diodes used in the
        same manner as the LEDs, in which case a beam combiner or/and a
        beam expender could be used. </p>
      <p>The beam can be formed in other ways. In one aspect each light
        emitting element can have its own beam former. In the case of
        LEDs each one can have its own collimator. </p>
      <p>Scanning can be accomplished by other than the mechanical means
        shown above. An electro-optical scanning element such as an
        electro-optical crystal lens such as a lithium niobate crystal
        can be placed in front of the beam former or formers. An
        opto-mechanical scanner such as cylindrical cartridge containing
        a number of optical fibers equal to the number of flash points
        could be employed. The fibers are organized at the output in
        such a manner that light flashes from the end of the fibers
        cover the predefined area during axial rotation of the
        cartridge. Also liquid crystals can be used for scanning. </p>
      <p>FIGS. 3a and 3b show an exemplary target configuration 170, in
        this example made up of four rows r1, r2, r3, and r4 and four
        columns c1, c2, c3, and c4 representing flash exposure points
        for each flash of the LEDs as they are scanned and incremented.
      </p>
      <p>In FIG. 3a the target configuration 170 is a flash pattern
        having 16 flash points in a 4 by 4 matrix or pattern that
        operates through a strobing sequence as illustrated in FIG. 2a
        in which the spatial component starts at the flash point r1, c1
        and moves horizontally to r1, c4 and then is both incremented
        vertically down and reversed horizontally to r2, c1 and then
        strobes through r2, c4 and so on. After the flash at r4, c4 the
        scanner and incrementer return to flash at r1, c1 and the
        sequence is repeated. The chart for that sequence is shown in
        FIG. 4a. </p>
      <p>In FIG. 3b there is shown the same 4 by 4 pattern with an
        alternative strobe sequence in which the spatial component
        differs starting at the flash point r1, c1 and scanning
        horizontally to the right to r1, c4 and then incrementing
        vertically to r2, c4 and then scanning horizontally to the left
        to r2, c1 then incrementing vertically to r3, c1, then scanning
        horizontally to the right to r3, c4, then incrementing
        vertically to r4,c4 and then scanning horizontally to the left
        to r4, c1 and then incrementing upward to r1, c1 to begin the
        sequence again. The chart for that sequence is shown in FIG. 4b.
      </p>
      <p>In each of the examples of FIGS. 3a and 3b, the sequence could
        be rotated ninety degrees so that scanning occurs vertically and
        incrementing occurs horizontally. </p>
      <p>The foregoing described sequences through adjacent flash
        points. But the sequence could be randomized to a selected
        repeating order of flashes. The flash order should repeat after
        each cycle. Moreover, through programming options, the user can
        be enabled to select a pattern through adjacent flash points or
        randomized repeating or even randomized varying (in which the
        cycle is completed but differently each time). </p>
      <p>The pattern and strobe sequence is selected for the particular
        application. It need not be equal horizontally and vertically,
        for example a pattern of six columns and four rows might be
        selected. Also, for example, a pattern might have a center flash
        point surrounded by three or more flash points and then possibly
        surrounded by several more. An arrangement of concentric circles
        with or without a central flash point might be useful. The
        purpose of the pattern is to cover an area such that a subject
        or subjects exposed to the strobing will be unable to move or at
        least will have difficulty moving out of the pattern before
        being incapacitated. </p>
      <p>The flash pattern is cycled over a time period to repeat each
        flash point at a rate sufficient to incapacitate a subject who
        is in the pattern. It is known that flash rates from 7 15 Hz can
        achieve incapacitating effects. A preferred range of flash rate
        for incapacitating effect is 9 11 Hz. Therefore the strobe rate
        is selected to cause each flash point to flash at the selected
        rate. </p>
      <p>It is not necessary that a specific flash point be directly
        aimed at the subject's eyes, but at least some of the flash
        points should be so closely directed to the subject's eyes as to
        have the flash effect. Thus the flash pattern will be designed
        in accordance with the type of use contemplated. Also a given
        device could be equipped to allow selection of different flash
        patterns for different uses. </p>
      <p>In one exemplary use, for personal protection, a pattern
        effective at a range of, say, 1 5 meters would be desirable. For
        law enforcement purposes a pattern effective at a range from 5
        10 meters would be desirable. For combat purposes a longer range
        would be desirable. In each case the parameters of flash rate
        and irradiance coupled with observed aperture, beam angle and
        radiant aperture must be selected to enable incapacitation. </p>
      <p>In some embodiments and applications it is desired or required
        that incapacitation effects be obtained but without injury to
        the subject's eyes. If incapacitation without injury (to the
        eyes) is desired the irradiance level must not exceed the MPE. </p>
      <p>In another aspect the invention is a method and apparatus in
        which an array of light emitting elements or a single element
        will cause incapacitation by applying a selected flash rate,
        pulse duration and, for each flash, an optical power such that
        at a particular range an irradiance level will be provided at a
        particular range. In a further aspect, the irradiance is a
        minimum of 1/260 of the MPE. Also, the range may be selected to
        not exceed the MPE. </p>
      <p>All the work and calculations that resulted in the data
        presented in Table 1 was carried out under the guidance of the
        safety standards developed by the Laser Institute of America
        ANSI Z136.1-2000, Safe Use of Lasers [Ref 1]. This document
        provided a number of rules that should be followed for the safe
        use of high intensity light sources in particular, it contained
        diagrams and formulas to define the maximum permissible exposure
        (MPE), which provided the relationship between intensity of the
        exposure, and the eye-damage threshold. Data from different
        types of point and extended radiation sources, operating in
        continuous and pulsed modes, is presented. </p>
      <p>The focused LED modules and arrays are considered an extended
        source of radiance. Such radiation source is defined as a source
        viewed by the observer at an angle larger than .alpha..sub.min,
        which is 1.5 mrad. The formula for calculating MPE.sub.pulses in
        terms of source energy level for extended light sources is given
        in Ref. [6], p. 46, Table 5b and Section 8.2.3. on page 37: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq1b.jpg" height="63" width="297"></p>
      </center>
      &nbsp;where .tau. is the pulse duration or exposure time, n is the
      number of pulses in the train, and C.sub.E=.alpha./.alpha..sub.min
      when .alpha..sub.min.ltoreq..alpha..ltoreq..alpha..sub.max, and
      where .alpha..sub.max is 100 mrad. .alpha. is aperture of the
      device observed at the target plane. The LED results in Table 1
      fall in this interval.
      <p>In terms of irradiance, for average pulse power, MPE: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq1c.jpg" height="53" width="137"></p>
      </center>
      <p>where F is the frequency, and d is the pulse duty cycle. Since
        only part of the energy reaches the human retina through the
        iris in the eye (approximately 7 mm in diameter), the
        MPE.sub.pulses must be reduced by a factor of 0.775. The final
        formula is: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq2.jpg" height="59" width="310"></p>
      </center>
      <p>It is well recognized that bright light flashing at frequencies
        near the frequencies of the human brain (7 15 Hz) and operating
        in the eye-safe region, are capable of affecting a person, or a
        group of people, through visual impairment (green and blue-green
        light are especially effective). The physiological and
        psychological effects of these types of light are rapidly
        induced and can range from simple glare and flashblindness to
        strong startlement, vertigo and disorientation. The strongest
        effects appear when the source intensity is at the level of the
        MPE (but still in the safe region), and the effectiveness of the
        visual impairment drops with the reduction of the intensity of
        light. An attempt to classify the visual impairment effect in
        accordance to the intensity of light for one exposure of 0.25
        sec that is equal to the aversion time (blink effect) has been
        made in Reference [2]. The diagram of FIG. 4 presented below
        progressively shows the effects from very strong flashblindness
        (which includes vertigo, disorientation and startlement) to
        simple glare (right column) versus irradiance level on the eye
        (left column). The strongest effects appeared when the
        irradiance is on the level of MPE, which is 2.6 mW/cm.sup.2. The
        arrow on the right pointing down indicates the decrease of the
        effectiveness, as the exposure time diminishes. </p>
      <p>At frequencies of 7 15 Hz, exposure duration of 0.25 sec is not
        achievable. Therefore, a number of pulses should be applied to
        accomplish incapacitating effect. As shown in Formula (2), MPE
        and hence, the strongest effect, could be provided at any level
        of irradiance by applying the respective number of pulses, while
        maintaining the equivalence of the other parameters. There would
        be more pulses at lower irradiance and vice versa. In turn, the
        number of pulses will define the incapacitating time. To
        estimate this time, the formula is rewritten as: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq3.jpg" height="67" width="291"></p>
      </center>
      <p>.times..tau..times..times..times..times. ##EQU00005## and the
        irradiance that was accomplished in the device is suggested as
        the MPE. The number of pulses derived from (3) gives the
        estimated time necessary to produce the highest level of the
        incapacitating effect at a given irradiance, frequency, pulse
        duration and the device design (C.sub.E). </p>
      <p>The visual impairment that is produced by the intense flashing
        light is a cumulative effect; therefore, the dosage of radiation
        received depends on the number of pulses delivered.
        Alternatively, in another way, as fewer pulses are delivered,
        the MPE would be higher (see Formula 1). Hence, if one wants to
        estimate the time necessary to produce visual impairment effect
        at the level of irradiance lower than MPE, the number of pulses
        in Formula 1 should be simply divided by the ratio of irradiance
        produced by the device (which is considered as MPE) by the
        irradiance, at which level the effect is considered: </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq4.jpg" height="260" width="355"></p>
      </center>
      <p>##EQU00007## (I.sub.MPE is the irradiation produce by the
        devise, and I is the level of irradiance under consideration).
        By substituting n in (1) for (4), the final formula (3) is
        rewritten as </p>
      <center>
        <p><img src="eq5.jpg" height="61" width="310"></p>
      </center>
      <p>For exemplary considerations, this formula was used to
        calculate the time durations necessary to produce visual
        impairment effects at levels equivalent to the single irradiance
        exposure levels of 2.6, 1, 0.5, 0.1 and 0.01 mW/cm.sup.2 for a
        given frequency of pulses. The value of A is 1, 2.6, 5.2, 26 and
        260, respectively. These were selected for providing degrees of
        incapacitation (A, B, C, D and E in Table 1). </p>
      <p>Equation (5) establishes the relationship between the
        irradiance on the target and the flash time, number of flashes
        and the observed clear aperture of the device. </p>
      <p>The results are presented in Table 1. </p>

      <p>Columns (from left to right) in the table represent: </p>
      <p>Column1 lists the varying incapacitating physiological and
        psychological effects produced due the visual impairment of
        bright flashing light (A, B, C, D, and E). The effects are
        classified in accordance to the diagram of FIG. X which is based
        on broad range of experimental data (see reference E). Effects
        are listed in the order from the strongest, A, that are caused
        at the irradiance levels of MPE and progressively down to the
        weaker introduced at lower levels of irradiance, B, C, D, and E.
      </p>
      <p>Column 2 shows the irradiance levels of a single exposure of
        0.25 sec, which introduce the respective effects according the
        diagram in FIG. 5. </p>
      <p>Column 3 and 4 shows the calculated time necessary to produce
        different levels of incapacitating effects with two different
        LED array configurations that were fabricated and tested. These
        prototypes were operated in temporal pulsed mode. The parameters
        of the pulse stated in the table and below the table was
        actually measured. The measured irradiance produced by the pulse
        was considered equal to the MPE, and the number of pulses that
        produces incapacitating effect at this level (highest
        permissible irradiance level) was calculated using Formula 3.
        Formulas 4, and 5 were used to calculate the number of pulses,
        which will produce effects of lower strength. The time was
        calculated by dividing the number of pulses by the flash
        frequency. </p>
      <p>Columns 5 and 6 present the calculated incapacitating time of
        two of many possible devices based on the 37LED array similar to
        the presented in the column 4, but operating in the
        multidirectional strobe mode. The parameters of the device
        provide rapid incapacitating time and produce the strongest
        level of visual impairment. The only difference between them in
        the design is the observed aperture-6'' in one device and 4'' in
        the second one. The other parameters used in the calculations
        are: Operating distance-6 feet; beam divergency-5.degree.;
        irradiance-233 mW/cm.sup.2 (calculated from the experimental
        date for the divergence angle of 25.degree.; spot diameter at
        working distance-0.524 feet; simultaneously covered
        area-3.times.3 feet with 36 flashpoints; .tau.=0.004 sec; F=7
        Hz; d=0.028. Note, that in the multidirectional strobe
        arrangement the exposure time related to the flashing frequency
        as 1/F times the number of flashpoints. </p>
      <p>Referring to Table 1 it is first assumed that for a practical
        apparatus and method of incapacitation, the effect must be
        produced quickly, giving the target insufficient time to evade
        the flashing (whether in by pattern, aimed or held steady).
        Consequently only those entries in the table marked "rapid" are
        regarded as effective for incapacitation. It is appreciated that
        the columns 2, 3, 4, and 5 are constructed with reference to
        selected values for the variables, and that other selected
        combination of values would possibly extend the range of each
        value. To the extent understood from Table 1, using an array of
        at least about 19 LEDs incapacitation can be achieved with an
        aperture at exit of about 4.6 in., incapacitation can be
        achieved with an irradiance of at least about 4.9 mW/cm.sup.2.
        As the aperture is closed as in column 5 to 5.degree. and
        irradiance is increased to about 233 mW/cm.sup.2 a considerably
        more severe level of incapacitation occurs. Applying the
        variables incapacitation can be made to occur in a method and
        apparatus as follows: </p>
      <p>To reach a minimum irradiance of 1/260 of the MPE to cause
        "rapid" incapacitation divide formula (2) by 260. </p>
      <p>Both projected designs are feasible. They require only the beam
        concentration in the smaller angle. Such nonimaging beamformers
        for LED arrays applications were already computed down to
        divergence angles of 2.degree.. A variety of alternative designs
        are possible. They depend on the entry parameters, which are F,
        the required area of coverage, and the operating distance. The
        LED array could operate in the continuous and pulsed mode. In
        the continuous mode the light flashing frequency is provided by
        the predetermined spatial movement of the actuators. In the
        pulsed mode the flashing frequency is provided by the
        synchronous movement of the actuators and electronic control of
        the LEDs light pulses. The pulse mode is preferable because the
        LED could provide few times higher pulse power, compare to the
        continuous mode. A simple range finder, or radiometer similar to
        one used in the photo cameras to determine the exposure time
        could be utilized to adjust the parameters of the device, such
        as pulse duration, frequency and power, dependently at the
        operational distance, in order to provide safe operation below
        MPE. </p>
