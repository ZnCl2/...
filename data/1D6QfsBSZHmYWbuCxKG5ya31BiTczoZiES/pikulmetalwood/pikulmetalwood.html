      Summary: Researchers have built a sheet of nickel with nanoscale
      pores that make it as strong as titanium but four to five times
      lighter. <br>
      <br>
      High-performance golf clubs and airplane wings are made out of
      titanium, which is as strong as steel but about twice as light.
      These properties depend on the way a metal's atoms are stacked,
      but random defects that arise in the manufacturing process mean
      that these materials are only a fraction as strong as they could
      theoretically be. An architect, working on the scale of individual
      atoms, could design and build new materials that have even better
      strength-to-weight ratios.<br>
      <br>
      In a new study published in Nature Scientific Reports, researchers
      at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and
      Applied Science, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
      and the University of Cambridge have done just that. They have
      built a sheet of nickel with nanoscale pores that make it as
      strong as titanium but four to five times lighter.<br>
      <br>
      The empty space of the pores, and the self-assembly process in
      which they're made, make the porous metal akin to a natural
      material, such as wood.<br>
      <br>
      And just as the porosity of wood grain serves the biological
      function of transporting energy, the empty space in the
      researchers' "metallic wood" could be infused with other
      materials. Infusing the scaffolding with anode and cathode
      materials would enable this metallic wood to serve double duty: a
      plane wing or prosthetic leg that's also a battery.<br>
      <br>
      The study was led by James Pikul, Assistant Professor in the
      Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at Penn
      Engineering. Bill King and Paul Braun at the University of
      Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, along with Vikram Deshpande at the
      University of Cambridge, contributed to the study.<br>
      <br>
      Even the best natural metals have defects in their atomic
      arrangement that limit their strength. A block of titanium where
      every atom was perfectly aligned with its neighbors would be ten
      times stronger than what can currently be produced. Materials
      researchers have been trying to exploit this phenomenon by taking
      an architectural approach, designing structures with the geometric
      control necessary to unlock the mechanical properties that arise
      at the nanoscale, where defects have reduced impact.<br>
      <br>
      Pikul and his colleagues owe their success to taking a cue from
      the natural world.<br>
      <br>
      "The reason we call it metallic wood is not just its density,
      which is about that of wood, but its cellular nature," Pikul says.
      "Cellular materials are porous; if you look at wood grain, that's
      what you're seeing? -- ?parts that are thick and dense and made to
      hold the structure, and parts that are porous and made to support
      biological functions, like transport to and from cells."<br>
      <br>
      "Our structure is similar," he says. "We have areas that are thick
      and dense with strong metal struts, and areas that are porous with
      air gaps. We're just operating at the length scales where the
      strength of struts approaches the theoretical maximum."<br>
      <br>
      The struts in the researchers' metallic wood are around 10
      nanometers wide, or about 100 nickel atoms across. Other
      approaches involve using 3D-printing-like techniques to make
      nanoscale scaffoldings with hundred-nanometer precision, but the
      slow and painstaking process is hard to scale to useful sizes.<br>
      <br>
      "We've known that going smaller gets you stronger for some time,"
      Pikul says, "but people haven't been able to make these structures
      with strong materials that are big enough that you'd be able to do
      something useful. Most examples made from strong materials have
      been about the size of a small flea, but with our approach, we can
      make metallic wood samples that are 400 times larger."<br>
      <br>
      Pikul's method starts with tiny plastic spheres, a few hundred
      nanometers in diameter, suspended in water. When the water is
      slowly evaporated, the spheres settle and stack like cannonballs,
      providing an orderly, crystalline framework. Using electroplating,
      the same technique that adds a thin layer of chrome to a hubcap,
      the researchers then infiltrate the plastic spheres with nickel.
      Once the nickel is in place, the plastic spheres are dissolved
      with a solvent, leaving an open network of metallic struts.<br>
      <br>
      "We've made foils of this metallic wood that are on the order of a
      square centimeter, or about the size of a playing die side," Pikul
      says. "To give you a sense of scale, there are about 1 billion
      nickel struts in a piece that size."<br>
      <br>
      Because roughly 70 percent of the resulting material is empty
      space, this nickel-based metallic wood's density is extremely low
      in relation to its strength. With a density on par with water's, a
      brick of the material would float.<br>
      <br>
      Replicating this production process at commercially relevant sizes
      is the team's next challenge. Unlike titanium, none of the
      materials involved are particularly rare or expensive on their
      own, but the infrastructure necessary for working with them on the
      nanoscale is currently limited. Once that infrastructure is
      developed, economies of scale should make producing meaningful
      quantities of metallic wood faster and less expensive.<br>
      <br>
      Once the researchers can produce samples of their metallic wood in
      larger sizes, they can begin subjecting it to more macroscale
      tests. A better understanding of its tensile properties, for
      example, is critical.<br>
      <br>
      "We don't know, for example, whether our metallic wood would dent
      like metal or shatter like glass." Pikul says. "Just like the
      random defects in titanium limit its overall strength, we need to
      get a better understand of how the defects in the struts of
      metallic wood influence its overall properties."<br>
      <br>
      In the meantime, Pikul and his colleagues are exploring the ways
      other materials can be integrated into the pores in their metallic
      wood's scaffolding.<br>
      <br>
      "The long-term interesting thing about this work is that we enable
      a material that has the same strength properties of other super
      high-strength materials but now it's 70 percent empty space,"
      Pikul says. "And you could one day fill that space with other
      things, like living organisms or materials that store energy."<br>

      </b><b> Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><b> </b><br>
      This paper describes a nickel-based cellular material, which has
      the strength of titanium and the density of water. The material’s
      strength arises from size-dependent strengthening of load-bearing
      nickel struts whose diameter is as small as 17 nm and whose 8 GPa
      yield strength exceeds that of bulk nickel by up to 4X. The
      mechanical properties of this material can be controlled by
      varying the nanometer-scale geometry, with strength varying over
      the range 90–880 MPa, modulus varying over the range 14–116 GPa,
      and density varying over the range 880–14500 kg/m3. We refer to
      this material as a “metallic wood,” because it has the high
      mechanical strength and chemical stability of metal, as well as a
      density close to that of natural materials such as wood.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      Cellular materials with spatially organized and repeating pore
      geometries can have dramatic strength improvements as structural
      elements shrink to the nanometer scale1,2,3,4. This paper
      describes a nanostructured cellular material based on
      electroplated nickel (8,900 kg/m3 bulk density), which has the
      strength of titanium and the density of water (1,000 kg/m3). The
      high strength arises from size-dependent strengthening of
      load-bearing nickel struts whose diameter is as small as 17 nm and
      whose strength is as high as 8 GPa. We refer to this material as a
      “metallic wood,” because it has the high mechanical strength and
      chemical stability of metal, as well as a density close to that of
      natural materials such as wood.<br>
      <br>
      Cellular materials with nanometer-scale structural elements
      exhibit remarkable material properties5, for example high
      strength3,6,7,8,9,10, high energy absorption4, ultra-low
      density1,11,12,13,14, and high specific strength1,15,16. To
      understand the origin of these enhanced properties, we can look at
      the performance of single nanopillars which approximate a single
      strut in a nanostructured cellular material. Compression tests on
      nanopillars made from single crystal metals showed that reducing
      pillar diameter increased pillar strength by up to an order of
      magnitude more than the bulk material’s strength17,18,19. This
      size-dependent strength enhancement has been widely studied in
      single crystals17,18,20,21,22. In nanopillars made from
      nanocrystalline metals, however, both an increase in strength (for
      Ni and Au)23,24 and decrease in strength (for Ni and Pt)25,26 have
      been observed as geometric dimensions were reduced to the size of
      a single grain diameter. When nanocrystalline gold was used in the
      struts of a nanostructured cellular material, the cellular solid
      showed dramatic strength enhancement as the strut diameter
      decreased3,6, but the conflicting results in nanopillars make it
      difficult to predict if nanostructured cellular materials made
      from nanocrystalline metals will exhibit a strength enhancement or
      reduction.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to nanoscale enhancement, the macroscopic properties
      of nanostructured cellular materials are important when
      considering them for engineering applications. Most articles on
      nanostructured cellular materials report specific strength below
      100 MPa/(Mg m3), which is comparable to polymers and common
      metals1,3,4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,27,28,29. Materials with
      specific strength above 100 MPa/(Mg/m3) are attractive because
      their strength approaches that of engineering metals and
      ceramics1,15,16. However, the density of these materials can be
      low, in the range of 6–410 kg/m3, which prohibits their use in
      some applications. Consider, for example, a metal panel modeled as
      a simply supported beam with length 1 m, cross-sectional thickness
      1 mm, specific strength 100 MPa/(Mg/m3), and density 100 kg/m3.
      For an application in which the panel supports a 100 N load at the
      center, the sheet would require a minimum width of 15 m. In
      contrast, a panel with specific strength 100 MPa/(Mg/m3) and
      density 1,000 kg/m3 would require a minimum width of 1.5 m, which
      is in general a more reasonable solution. Many structural
      materials have density near 1,000 kg/m3, including engineering
      polymers and naturally occurring materials such as wood. Only a
      few articles report nanostructured cellular materials with density
      near 1,000 kg/m3, and these articles focus on ceramics and carbon
      based materials rather than metals4,16,29,30. In general, there is
      a lack of published research on strong nanostructured cellular
      materials that have enough mass to support loads found in
      industrial applications.<br>
      <br>
      Here we report a cellular material based on nanostructured nickel
      inverse opal materials. The mechanical properties of this material
      are governed by the size-dependent strengthening of
      nanometer-scale structural elements, allowing large specific
      strengths up to 230 MPa/(Mg/m3) in porous nickel. This specific
      strength is larger than most high strength metals including high
      strength stainless steel and Ti-6Al-4V31,32. The mechanical
      properties of this material can be varied between natural
      materials and high strength metal alloys by controlling the
      geometric parameters within the cellular architecture; we
      demonstrate materials with yield strengths over the range
      90–880 MPa, specific moduli 7–25 GPa/(Mg/m3), and densities
      880–14500 kg/m3. Using finite element simulations and well
      established micropillar compression and nanoindentation testing,
      we find that the material strength increases as the
      nanometer-scale strut diameter decreases. The strut yield
      strengths increase from 3.8 to 8.1 GPa as the strut diameter
      decreases from 115 to 17 nm, which is a 4X increase over the 2 GPa
      bulk deposited nickel yield strength.<br>
      Results<br>
      <br>
      Figure 1a shows the fabrication of the inverse opal material.
      First, monodisperse polystyrene (PS) particles of diameter
      260–930 nm were self-assembled onto a gold/chromium coated
      substrate in a face centered cubic (FCC) orientation. The PS was
      sintered at 96 °C to improve stability and increase the
      interconnect diameter between PS spheres. Nickel, 99.9%, was
      electrodeposited into the voids of the PS structure, followed by
      PS etching in tetrahydrofuran. The result was an open cell inverse
      opal material having interconnected spherical pores in a
      face-centered cubic orientation. For some samples, conformal
      electrodeposition of either additional nickel or rhenium-nickel
      alloy (80 wt% rhenium) increased the solids volume fraction, strut
      diameter, and mass. The additional deposited nickel had the same
      composition as the nickel used to fabricate the inverse opal
      structure. Mechanically tested samples with rhenium are labeled
      Re. The average grain sizes of the nickel film and nickel inverse
      opals were 12.4 nm and 15.1 nm, calculated from the XRD data shown
      in the supplementary information using the Scherrer equation. The
      grain size was similar for coated and un-coated nickel samples. A
      15 nm grain size in pure nickel corresponded to a ≈6.4 GPa
      hardness33,34, near the peak hardness values of pure nickel, which
      agreed well with our electrodeposited nickel thin film
      nanoindentation hardness measurements of 5.8 GPa. The
      self-assembly based fabrication method can produce material
      samples larger than 100 mm2, while allowing ~10 nm control of
      structure and chemistry by altering the polystyrene diameter,
      processing temperature, and electroplating parameters. In
      comparison, most methods for fabricating nanostructured cellular
      solids with controlled and repeated unit cell morphologies are
      limited to sample sizes with areas smaller than about 5 mm2
      1,11,12,15,27,28,35. Figure 1b–g show SEM images of the material
      with 500 nm pores fractured on the (111) plane. Figure 1b,c show
      the inverse opal material with no coating and 0.16 solids volume
      fraction. Figure 1d,e show the material uniformly coated with
      21 nm of nickel, which increased the solids volume fraction from
      0.16 to 0.35. Figure 1f,g show the nickel inverse opal material
      uniformly coated with 25 nm of rhenium-nickel alloy, which
      increased the solids volume fraction to 0.46. Figure 1h shows a
      material with 500 nm pores, 2 cm2 area, and 15 µm thickness
      fabricated on a gold/chromium coated glass slide. Figure 1i shows
      a material with 300 nm pores and 20 µm thickness fabricated on
      gold/chromium-coated polyimide. The material is flexible and when
      prepared on a polyimide sheet could be bent past a 0.5 cm radius
      (Fig. 1i). Table 1 shows the fabricated materials and their
      geometric attributes such as coating thickness and volume
      fraction...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      In conclusion, we present metallic wood fabricated from nickel
      inverse opals, which has the strength of titanium and the chemical
      properties of a metal, while having the density of water and the
      cellular nature of natural materials like wood. The high strength
      of the metallic wood results from the size-dependent strengthening
      of the inverse opal struts, which have up to 4X the yield strength
      of bulk electrodeposited nickel and enable high specific strengths
      of 230 MPa/(Mg/m3). The cellular structure can be controlled to
      tune the modulus and strength each by a factor of 10X.<br>
      <br>
      The metallic wood can be easily fabricated over 100 mm2 areas, can
      be processed at room temperature, and can be combined with
      additional functional materials, as demonstrated with the rhenium
      coatings49. The high strength continuous metallic architecture
      with isotropic elasticity, high hardness, and high strain energy
      storage could be important for a variety of applications such as
      energy storage50,51,52, heat transport53, and sensors54,55. Future
      work could explore improvements in specific strength above
      230 MPa/(Mg/m3) by incorporating lightweight metals such as
      titanium or aluminum and developing roll-to-toll processing of
      high strength porous metals from self-assembly..<br>
