      </b><b>...REPLACING CEMENT</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      While cement has long been the go-to binding agent for concrete, a
      failed experiment at the University of Arizona unintentionally
      created a material five times stronger than concrete, with a
      recycled content of 95%.<br>
      <br>
      Ferrock – or iron-rich ferrous rock – is made primarily from steel
      dust, a waste product from various industrial processes, and
      silica made from ground-up recycled glass.<br>
      <br>
      Above: Ferrock is made up of 95% recycled material, primarily
      steel dust and crushed glass and is up to five times stronger than
      concrete ( image courtesy of Guy Shovlin). <br>
      <br>
      When mixed together, the iron in the steel dust reacts with CO2
      and rusts to form iron-carbonate fusing the components together.
      Like concrete, Ferrock cannot return to its liquid state once
      hardened.<br>
      <br>
      However, unlike the manufacturing of cement which creates large
      amounts of carbon dioxide, the hardening process of Ferrock
      actually absorbs and traps CO2, creating a carbon-negative
      product.<br>
      <br>
      While advantageous as a concept, the large-scale implementation of
      Ferrock does have limitations.<br>
      <br>
      While the materials used to create Ferrock are currently cheaper
      than cement, the price of large-scale adoption could become
      uneconomical if demand for steel dust and recycled glass creates a
      lucrative new resource market for waste products...<br>

      <div align="center"><b>An In-Depth Look At Ferrock And How It
          Compares To Concrete<br>

      <b><br>
      </b>Concrete is one of the most common construction materials in
      the U.S., with over 68 million metric tons of the material
      produced in 2004. It's considered the standard building material
      for a wide range of construction projects, from ordinary
      residential homes to towering skyscrapers and massive
      hydroelectric dams.<br>
      <br>
      Recently, a University of Arizona student created an eco-friendly
      alternative that offers its own set of useful benefits. The
      following takes a look at how this new material, known as Ferrock,
      stacks up to traditional concrete.<br>
      <br>
      <b>What Makes Ferrock so Special?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ferrock's origins lie with University of Arizona Ph.D. student
      David Stone, who set out to develop a carbon-neutral material that
      could be used in the same manner as cement. Stone's findings came
      about after years of studying Portland cement's unique properties.<br>
      <br>
      As the name implies, the basic building blocks of Ferrock come
      from iron discards in the form of waste steel dust. A common
      byproduct of numerous industrial processes, the iron in waste
      steel dust reacts with carbon dioxide (CO2) to form iron
      carbonate. The iron carbonate becomes part of the material's
      mineral matrix, adding to its overall strength.<br>
      <br>
      Ferrock's greatest strength lies with its eco-friendly properties.
      Although Ferrock releases CO2 during production, it also absorbs
      large amounts of CO2 as it hardens. This makes Ferrock an
      effective carbon sink that permanently locks in those potentially
      harmful greenhouse gases. This unique trait may prove appealing to
      those who wish to lower their carbon footprint through the use of
      ecologically sustainable materials.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to being eco-friendly, it also possesses incredible
      durability thanks to a unique property. When it hardens, it does
      so in a way that mimics solid rock. This allows Ferrock to resist
      certain forces differently from concrete, giving it excellent
      overall durability and stability. Because of iron carbonate's
      hardening properties, Ferrock can also be used in underwater
      applications in saltwater environments<br>
      <br>
      <b>Downsides to Ferrock</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As a relatively new material that hasn't seen much use in the
      industrial arena, Ferrock's overall capabilities remain largely
      unproven. It's also unknown how Ferrock behaves under a wide range
      of building conditions or whether traditional concrete techniques
      can be used on the new material. On the other hand, concrete is a
      tried-and-tested quantity for the vast majority of builders and
      developers.<br>
      <br>
      Cost is also another factor that puts concrete ahead in most
      construction projects. Given Ferrock's unique production process,
      it's likely that its overall cost will be significantly more than
      that of Portland cement. There's also concern that steel producers
      may catch on to waste steel dust's newfound uses and charge for it
      accordingly. The economics of Ferrock must not only account for
      this potential development, but also for other changes in
      production and marketing methods.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Will It Replace Concrete Anytime Soon?</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The chances of Ferrock completely replacing concrete are pretty
      slim. After all, concrete has a lot going for itself – not only is
      it relatively cheap to purchase, but it's also easy to produce and
      it can be used to build a wide variety of structures. Its sheer
      versatility is what makes it attractive in so many ways.<br>
      <br>
      Concrete can also prove effective when it comes to neutralizing
      CO2 emissions. For instance, magnesium silicate-based cement can
      also absorb large amounts of CO2 as it hardens. The abundance of
      magnesium silicates also makes it a lower-cost alternative to
      Ferrock.<br>
      <br>
      But one shouldn't discount the usefulness of Ferrock as an
      eco-conscious alternative. When used in conjunction with other
      eco-friendly materials and building strategies, it becomes
      possible for entire countries to lower their overall greenhouse
      gas output and create more sustainable environmental conditions
      for future generations to enjoy. <br>

      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)-based materials (in
      particular, conventional cement concretes) are among the most
      common and cheapest ceramic matrices that are widely used for
      buildings and infrastructural applications. It is well recognized
      that OPC production is a significant emitter of CO2, a major
      greenhouse gas, which is responsible for the global warming. The
      global concrete industry has embraced the idea of sustainability
      in construction through the use of waste/recycled materials as
      supplementary cementitious materials. For example, the use of
      materials such as fly ash, blast furnace slag, and limestone
      powder in concrete have reduced the scale of OPC production.
      Several non-conventional means of developing novel and sustainable
      matrix materials for infrastructural composites are also on-going.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Some binder systems can provide multiple environmental
      benefits through trapping of CO2 emitted from industrial
      operations. For example, the utilization of a waste material (iron
      powder) that is otherwise land-filled, can also be used to reduce
      OPC production/use. The anoxic carbonation of (waste) metallic
      iron powder at ambient temperature and pressure has been shown to
      yield beneficial mechanical properties when use as a structural
      binder (see for example Das S, Souliman B, Stone D, Neithalath N.
      Synthesis and Properties of a Novel Structural Binder Utilizing
      the Chemistry of Iron Carbonation. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces
      2014; 6(11):8295-304, and co-pending U.S. Patent Application No.
      62/051,122 filed Sep. 16, 2014).<br>
      <br>
      [0005] One of the major drawbacks of ceramic matrices in general
      and cementitious matrices in particular relate to their low
      toughness. In addition, these low-toughness ceramics lose a
      significant portion of their strength because of service-related
      damage such as crack growth under static load or cyclic fatigue.
      Thus, enhancing the toughness of these materials contributes to
      minimization and control of strength loss. In the synthesis of the
      iron-based binder, metallic iron powder is carbonated only to a
      small fraction (necessitated by limitations in reaction kinetics),
      which results in the presence of large amounts of residual
      metallic powder in the microstructure. The presence of this phase,
      a significant fraction of which is elongated, will likely render
      notable increase in the toughness of this binder because of the
      energy dissipation by plastic deformation imparted by the metallic
      particulate phase. In addition, the matrix contains other
      processing additives including harder fly ash particles, softer
      limestone particles, and ductile clayey phases which influence the
      overall fracture performance of the novel binder significantly.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Further opportunities exist to address the toughness
      performance of this novel binder system using additive
      reinforcement for applications such as building envelope
      components (e.g., exterior wall panels), precast elements,
      architectural claddings, as well as in electrically conductive
      ceramic composite applications.<br>
      <br>

      and/or wires in the form of glass mat, cloth, fabric, mesh, woven
      roving, and/or any sheet of interwoven glass or other fibers with
      various size openings.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] In some embodiments, the fibers can be any length from
      about 3 mm to about 24 mm. Some other embodiments can utilize
      fibers that are less than about 3 mm and/or greater than about 24
      mm. In some embodiments, the volume fraction of glass fibers can
      be from 0.02% to 2% depending on the application. Further, in some
      embodiments, the specific gravity can be about 2.6, and in some
      embodiments, the moisture content can be less than about 0.5%. In
      some embodiments of the invention, the tensile strength can be
      about 1000 to about 1700 MPa. Some embodiments of the invention
      include glass fiber with a modulus of elasticity of about 72 GPa.
      In some embodiments, the glass fiber can comprise glass fibers
      manufactured by Corning Incorporated.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In some further embodiments, other types of fibers can be
      used including inorganic oxide fibers, metal fibers, polymer
      fibers (e.g., polypropylene), carbon fiber, or mixtures thereof.
      For example, other fibers that have been traditionally used in
      conventional concrete can be used including steel, carbon, aramid,
      polypropylene, polycarbonate, polyvinyl alcohol (“PVA”), nylon,
      asbestos, and natural plant-based fibers (e.g., plant derived
      materials comprising cellulose). In some embodiments, the
      reinforcing fibers including nylon, polypropylene, AR glass,
      steel, macro, high-dosage synthetic fibers, PVA, and
      steel/synthetic blends available from Nycon at http://nycon.com/
      can be used. Further, in some embodiments, woven steel wire cloth
      of the type commonly used to make “ferrocement” structures for
      water tanks, boat hulls, and thin shell structures can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] In some embodiments, the carbon dioxide can be waste carbon
      dioxide obtained from one or more industrial processes. Some
      embodiments include methods to form a sustainable binder system
      for concretes through carbonation of iron dust. For example, in
      some embodiments, iron can react with aqueous CO2 under controlled
      conditions to form complex iron carbonates which have binding
      capabilities. Further, some embodiments can include additives
      comprising silica and alumina. In some embodiments, silica and/or
      alumina additives can facilitate iron dissolution, which in some
      embodiments can provide beneficial rheological characteristics and
      properties. In some embodiments, the binder system can rely on the
      effects of corrosion of iron particles to form a binding matrix.
      In this instance, binder formation can result in the consumption
      and trapping of CO2 from an industrial operation and subsequent
      carbonate formation by conversion of at least a portion of the
      iron particles. Further, the binder formation can provide a means
      to reduce the overall ordinary Portland cement production (which
      is itself a significant emitter of CO2) through the use of
      carbonated metallic iron powder as the binder material for
      concrete.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] In some embodiments, dissolution agents (such as organic
      acids) can be added to enhance the corrosion rate of iron.
      Further, in some embodiments, the rheological behavior
      (flowability and castability) and early strength development can
      be improved using one or more additives. For example, additives
      common to Portland cement concretes such as class F fly ash,
      powdered limestone, and metakaolin can be used as minor
      ingredients along with metallic iron powder to form pastes with
      adequate binding capabilities. The fly ash can be added as a
      source of silica to potentially facilitate iron silicate
      complexation. Further, in some embodiments, limestone powder can
      be added to provide additional nucleation sites. Some embodiments
      include one or more “powdered” clays having a layered structure
      which retains water and which can be used to improve the
      rheological properties. For example, in some embodiments, a clay
      source such as kaolinite and/or metakaolin can be used to provide
      consistency cohesiveness as the iron-based mixtures are prepared.
      This added clay source can also minimize the required water
      content.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] Some embodiments provide compositions comprising fly ash,
      limestone, and a clay source such as metakaolin and/or kaolinite
      in various proportions. In some embodiments, the limestone powder
      can comprise a median particle size of about 0.7 µm conforming to
      ASTM C 568. In some embodiments, limestone can be added with a
      particle size that can range from a median size of about 0.7 µm to
      about 20 µm. In some embodiments, the fineness determines its
      nucleation ability. For example, in some embodiments, added
      limestone powder can provide nucleation sites for one or more cure
      reactions within the binder composition. In some embodiments,
      added water can be reduced in chemical reactions within any of the
      disclosed binder compositions (however it does not form part of
      the binder). In some embodiments, to minimize water demand, while
      maintaining binder consistency and cohesiveness, added metakaolin
      can be added to the binder composition. In some embodiments, the
      composition can comprise metakaolin conforming to ASTM C 618.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] Some embodiments of the invention include compositions
      comprising metallic iron powder. In some further embodiments, an
      organic reducing agent/chelating agent of metal cations can be
      included in the binder composition. In some embodiments, the
      organic reducing agent comprises an acid. In some embodiments, the
      organic reducing agent comprises oxalic acid. In some embodiments,
      an organic reducing agent can be added in a powder form to about
      2% of total weight of the constituents. In some other embodiments,
      the organic reducing agent can be added based on the solubility of
      the organic acid in water, and the compressive strength as
      compared to mixtures without dissociating agent.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] In some embodiments, the proportions of iron powder and
      other additives (including for example organic acids as
      dissolution agents) can influence the curing regime (based at
      least in part on the exposure of the mixture to CO2 and/or air).
      In some embodiments, the iron powder comprises about 88% iron and
      about 10% oxygen, along with trace quantities of copper,
      manganese, and calcium. In some embodiments, metallic iron powder
      sizes can range from about 5 µm to about 50 µm. For example, some
      embodiments comprise iron powder with a median particle size of
      about 19.03 µm. Further, in some embodiments, the selection of
      size ranges can facilitate reactivity. In some embodiments, the
      iron particles are elongated and angular in shape. In some
      embodiments, while influencing the rheological properties of the
      fresh mixture, the angular shape also provides benefits related to
      increased reactivity owing to the higher surface-to-volume ratio
      of the particles. In some embodiments, the iron powder can be
      obtained as a by-product of another industry process. For example,
      in some embodiments, the iron powder can be obtained from a
      shot-blasting facility.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] Commercially available Type I/II OPC conforming to ASTM C
      150 was used to prepare conventional cement pastes that were used
      as the baseline system to compare the properties of the novel
      iron-based binder systems. The chemical compositions of OPC, fly
      ash and metakaolin can be found in Vance K, Aguayo M, Oey T, Sant
      G, Neithalath N. Hydration and strength development in ternary
      Portland cement blends containing limestone and fly ash or
      metakaolin. Cem. Concr. Compos., 2013; 39:93-103, and Das S,

      fracture response of blended formulations containing limestone

      entire contents of which are incorporated by reference in their
      entirety. There is no restriction on the type and/or source of
      OPC, fly ash, or metakaolin, and any available conventional
      material can be used.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The particle size distributions (determined using dynamic
      light scattering) are shown in the plot 100 of FIG. 1 for iron
      powder (data line 110), fly ash (data line 115), metakaolin (data
      line 120), limestone (data line 125) and OPC (data line 130). The
      iron powder is coarser than all other ingredients used here. In
      some embodiments, the powder fraction of the iron-based binder
      mixture consists of 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8% limestone,
      10% metakaolin, and 2% organic acid by weight. This combination
      demonstrated the highest compressive strength and lowest porosity
      among a series of trial mixtures prepared as part of material
      design studies. These materials studies can be found in detail in
      Das S, Souliman B, Stone D, Neithalath N. Synthesis and Properties
      of a Novel Structural Binder Utilizing the Chemistry of Iron
      Carbonation. ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces, 2014; 6(11):8295-304,

      [0042] In some embodiments, binder preparation includes a mixing
      procedure that involves initial dry mixing of all the starting
      materials, followed by the addition of water to obtain a
      substantially uniform cohesive mixture. Some embodiments of the
      invention can include a weight-based water-to-solids ratio (w/s)
      of 0.24 to attain a cohesive mix. In other embodiments, at least
      one of the powders forming the binder can be pre-mixed with water,
      and subsequently mixed with the remaining powders, or other
      pre-mixed water-powder mixtures.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Some embodiments include glass fiber reinforcement of the
      iron-based binder systems. In some embodiments, glass fiber can be
      added to improve the mechanical properties of the iron-based
      binder systems. For example, in some embodiments, fiber-reinforced
      binders can be prepared by adding about 0.5% and about 1.0% glass
      fibers by volume to the blends while mixing. In some embodiments,
      the glass fibers can be about 25 µm diameter and about 10 mm
      long). In some embodiments, the fiber reinforced iron-based and
      the OPC binders can be cured in the same way as their
      non-reinforced counterparts.<br>

      [0045] Prismatic specimens measuring about 127 mm (length), about
      25.4 mm deep, and about 25.4 mm (width) were prepared in
      polypropylene molds and immediately placed inside clear plastic
      bags filled with 100% CO2 in room temperature inside a fume hood.
      The samples were de-molded after 1 day of carbonation in order to
      attain enough strength to strip the molds without specimen
      breakage. After de-molding, the beams were again placed in a 100%
      CO2 environment for another 5 days. The bags were refilled with
      CO2 every 12 hours or so to maintain saturation. After the
      respective durations of CO2 exposure, the samples were placed in
      air at room temperature to allow the moisture to evaporate for 4
      days. These CO2 and moisture exposure durations were considered
      because the mechanical properties demonstrated insignificant
      changes beyond these curing times. For the specimen sizes
      evaluated here, it can be safely assumed that these durations
      result in kinetic carbonation limits, and further carbonation
      generally cannot be achieved without changes in process conditions
      (e.g., temperature or pressure). Companion OPC mixtures of the
      same size as mentioned above were prepared with a water-to-cement
      ratio (w/cm) of 0.40, which is common for moderate-strength
      concretes in many buildings and infrastructural applications. The
      OPC beams were de-molded after 1 day and were kept in a moist
      chamber (&gt;98% RH and 23±2° C.) for a total of 28 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The flexural strengths of both iron-based and OPC binders
      were determined using standard center-point loading as per ASTM
      C293/293M-10, on beams having a span of 101.6 mm. The fracture
      properties, viz., the critical stress intensity factor
      (KIC&lt;S&gt;) and the critical crack tip opening displacement
      (hereinafter “CTODC”), were determined from three-point bend tests
      on notched beams using the two-parameter fracture model (herein
      after “TPFM”), described in Jenq Y, Shah S P. Two parameter
      fracture model for concrete. J Eng. Mech. 1985; 111(10):1227-41,
      and Shah S P. Fracture mechanics of concrete: applications of
      fracture mechanics to concrete, rock and other quasi-brittle
      materials. John Wiley &amp; Sons; 1995. For each mixture, four
      replicate beams were tested. The notch depth was 3.8 mm
      (corresponding to a notch depth-to-beam depth ratio of 0.15). The
      beams were tested in a crack mouth opening displacement
      (hereinafter “CMOD”)-controlled mode (CMOD acting as the feedback
      signal) during the loading cycles and in a load-controlled mode
      during the unloading cycles.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Microstructural analysis was performed on small rectangular
      pieces (10×10 mm in size). The samples were from the interior
      portions of the beams. Prior to mounting, the sample was
      ultrasonically cleaned and rinsed with ethyl alcohol and dried
      with compressed air spray to remove debris from
      sectioning/handling. After drying, the sample was placed into a 32
      mm two-part mounting cup, filled with a room-temperature setting
      epoxy, and subjected to 95 kPa of vacuum for 5 minutes to remove
      entrapped air. After hardening, the sample was polished using 600
      grit and 800 grit Silicon Carbide (SiC) abrasive discs, and
      further ground using 3 µm and 1 µm diamond paste. Final polishing
      was accomplished with 0.04 µm colloidal silica suspension.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] Digital Image Correlation (“DIC”) was used for the
      determination of fracture properties. DIC is a non-contact optical
      method to analyze digital images to extract the full displacement
      field on a specimen surface. The beam surface was painted with
      random black and white speckles to improve image correlation. A
      charge coupled device camera was used to record images every 5
      seconds during a loading and unloading sequence, and image
      correlation performed to obtain the displacement fields on the
      specimen surface within a specific analysis region.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIGS. 2A-2C illustrates micrographs showing the
      microstructure of iron-based binders. For example, FIG. 2A shows a
      lower magnification (150×) image 200 (scale bar corresponds to 100
      µm), and FIG. 2B shows a higher magnification (1200×) image 225
      showing an elongated iron particle and the surrounding regions
      (scale bar corresponds to 10 µm). Further, FIG. 2C shows a
      dissolution of Fe&lt;+2 &gt;from iron particle into the
      surrounding matrix (4300×) (image 250 where a scale bar
      corresponds to 1 µm). The images shown are for specimens cured for
      6 days in a CO2 environment. FIG. 2A shows the general appearance
      of the material microstructure with bright (high density) iron
      particles along with the reaction products and pores. The
      unreacted iron particles are, in general, elongated. The dense
      reaction products (the grey phases in the microstructure) are
      formed from the carbonation of smaller iron particles and their
      complexation with the other minor ingredients in the mixture. This
      was confirmed from a thermal analysis study to be belonging to the
      carbonate-oxalate-cancrinite group, and described in Das S,
      Souliman B, Stone D, Neithalath N. Synthesis and Properties of a
      Novel Structural Binder Utilizing the Chemistry of Iron
      Carbonation. ACS. Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2014; 6(11):8295-304. A
      higher magnification image 225 is shown in FIG. 2B where an
      elongated iron particle 227 is at least partially surrounded by
      reaction product 227a, and the surrounding microstructure
      containing spherical fly ash particles is shown (annotated in the
      magnified image 250 of FIG. 2C as fly ash 275). The dark regions
      in this microstructure are the pores (annotated in FIG. 2C as
      pores 270), the volume fraction of which was found to be
      comparable to those of OPC-based systems as detailed in an
      extensive quantification work in the above described reference.
      FIG. 2C also shows the dissolution of iron into the matrix from
      the iron particle 260 and the formation of reaction products 265,
      where the iron carbonate binder (i.e., the reaction product 227a
      shown in FIG. 2B) can be seen at least partially surrounding the
      iron particle 260 as iron carbonate layer 265.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] FIG. 3 illustrates a plot 300 showing the flexural
      strengths of plain (0% fiber) and fiber-reinforced (0.5% and 1%)
      iron carbonate binders after 6 days of carbonation and the
      corresponding OPC pastes after 28-days of hydration for
      comparison. The results presented here suggest that the iron
      carbonate binder (data bars 310) is about four-to-six times
      stronger than the traditional OPC paste in flexure (data bars
      315). This can be attributed to a combination of the stronger
      carbonate matrix along with the presence of unreacted iron
      particles in the microstructure as shown in FIGS. 2A-2C. As
      illustrated, both binders are observed to exhibit increases in
      flexural strength with inclusion of fibers, with the iron-based
      system showing a much pronounced increase. While it has been
      proven that the addition of glass fiber in OPC systems results in
      an increase in toughness with only minor increase in flexural
      strength, the iron-based binder shows a different trend where the
      flexural strength is increased significantly with the
      incorporation of glass fibers into the matrix (e.g., see for
      example Sivakumar A, Santhanam M. Mechanical properties of high
      strength concrete reinforced with metallic and non-metallic
      fibers. Cem Concr Compos 2007; 29(8):603-8, and Altun F, Haktanir
      T, Ari K. Effects of steel fiber addition on mechanical properties
      of concrete and RC beams. Constr Build Mater 2007; 21(3):654-61,
      and Kwan W H, Ramli M, Cheah C B. Flexural strength and impact
      resistance study of fiber reinforced concrete in simulated
      aggressive environment. Constr Build Mater 2014; 63:62-71). An
      enhancement in flexural strength of about 50% is observed for the
      iron-based binder when 0.5% glass fibers by volume is
      incorporated, but further fiber addition does not appear to
      statistically enhance the material behavior, a behavior that is
      also observed for the Mode I fracture toughness of these binder
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The fracture parameters of the iron-based and OPC binder
      systems were studied using the TPFM. TPFM idealizes the pre-peak
      non-linear behavior in a notched specimen through an effective
      elastic crack approach. The beam sizes and the notch depth are
      same for both the systems, thereby rendering the comparisons of
      the fracture parameters free of size effects. The effect of fiber
      volume fractions on the fracture parameters were also evaluated in
      conjunction with the response of the matrix phase. In some further
      embodiments, the cyclic load-CMOD response of notched beams was
      analyzed. The representative load-CMOD responses are shown in
      FIGS. 4A-4C for the iron-based binder and the companion OPC-based
      binder with and without fiber reinforcement, and depict
      representative load-CMOD responses for iron carbonate binder and
      comparison with OPC paste. For example, FIG. 4A shows plot 400
      with data for control materials. FIG. 4B shows plot 425 with data
      for 0.5% fiber volume for iron-carbonate based binder (data line
      430) and OPC-based binder (data line 435). Further, FIG. 4C shows
      plot 450 with data for 1.0% fiber volume fraction, with
      iron-carbonate based binder (data line 455) and OPC-based binder
      (data line 460). Plot 400 of FIG. 4A shows the load-CMOD response
      for the control OPC (data line 415) and iron-based binder without
      fiber reinforcement (data line 410), and clearly illustrates the
      fundamental differences in the flexural response of these
      matrices. The significantly higher peak load and improved post
      peak response of the iron-based binder as compared to control OPC
      binder can be attributed to the presence of unreacted metallic
      iron particles (as described earlier and shown in FIGS. 2A-2C)
      which are inherently strong and ductile. In some embodiments, the
      iron-based binder contains higher amounts of larger pores (average
      size&gt;0.2 µm) even though the total pore volumes are comparable.
      Consequently, some embodiments of the invention demonstrate
      compressive strength that is slightly lower than that of the OPC
      binder. However, the presence of strong and ductile phases in the
      microstructure dominates the flexural response, as shown earlier.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In some embodiments, the incorporation of fibers in an OPC
      matrix makes it ductile, as observed from the post-peak response
      and the larger CMODs for the fiber reinforced systems (as opposed
      to the unreinforced materials shown in FIGS. 4B and 4C). In some
      embodiments, both the peak load and the residual load are
      significantly higher for the iron carbonate binder, with and
      without fiber reinforcement (depicted in FIGS. 5A and 5B). For
      example, referring to FIG. 5A, iron-carbonate based binder (data
      line 510), and OPC-based binder (data line 515) is shown, and FIG.
      5B, where iron-carbonate based binder (data line 530), and
      OPC-based binder (data line 535) is shown.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In some embodiments, the incorporation of glass fibers
      enhances the peak load of the iron-based binder much more than it
      does to the OPC binder, that can indicate the synergistic effect
      on flexural strength from the inclusion of the fiber in the iron
      carbonate matrix (including the unreacted iron particles). The
      residual load for the control binders was measured at a CMOD value
      of 0.12 mm, whereas a CMOD value of 0.25 mm was chosen for the
      binders with fiber reinforcement. In some embodiments, the
      residual loads provide an indication of the crack-tolerance and
      the post-peak response of these systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In some embodiments, an increase in fiber volume fraction
      is found to enhance the toughness of both the binder systems, and
      can be attributed to the crack-bridging effects of the fiber and
      the resultant increase in energy dissipation under load. For
      example, FIG. 6A shows a plot 600 of fracture toughness for iron
      carbonate-based binder (data bar 610), and OPC-based binders (data
      bar 615) in accordance with some embodiments of the invention, and
      FIG. 6B shows a plot 625 of critical crack tip opening
      displacements of iron carbonate-based binder (data bar 630) and
      OPC-based binders (data bar 635) in accordance with some
      embodiments of the invention. This data shows the two major
      fracture parameters of fracture toughness (“KIC&lt;S&gt;”) and
      CTODC derived using TPFM for both the binders, as a function of
      the fiber volume fraction. For example, FIG. 6A shows that the
      fracture toughness values of the iron-based binders are much
      higher than the control OPC binders (about 5-7 times higher)
      irrespective of the fiber volume fraction. In some embodiments,
      the KIC&lt;S &gt;values of the iron carbonate binder range from 30
      MPa·mm&lt;0.5 &gt;to 50 MPa·mm&lt;0.5&gt;, which is approximately
      half of those of glass ceramics, polycrystalline cubic zirconia,
      SiN, alumina, and high-performance structural ceramics such as
      SiC, and about five times larger than the companion OPC binder.
      The ceramic systems mentioned earlier can be ten to thirty times
      more expensive than the iron-based binder.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In the unreinforced OPC matrix, the mechanism of strain
      energy dissipation can include crack extension. In some
      embodiments, the significantly higher KIC&lt;S &gt;of the
      iron-based binder, even for the unreinforced case, as compared to
      the OPC binder can be attributed to the crack bridging and/or
      deflection effects of the ductile, unreacted metallic iron
      particles in the matrix. As illustrated in FIGS. 2A-2C, many of
      the unreacted metallic iron particles are elongated. In some
      embodiments, these particles can function as a reinforcing phase
      that imposes a closing pressure on the crack. In some embodiments,
      this can bridge the cracks and the elastic incompatibility and
      de-bonding between the metallic particle-carbonate matrix
      interfaces can contribute to crack deflection.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In some embodiments of the invention, beyond a certain
      volume fraction of fibers, further toughness enhancement is
      negligible for the iron-based binders because the distribution of
      the unreacted iron particles and the fibers in the matrix is
      expected to be sufficient for crack bridging/deflection. The
      CTODC, which indicates the limit beyond which unstable crack
      propagation begins is shown in FIG. 6B as a function of the fiber
      volume fraction for both the binders. As shown, in some
      embodiments, a uniform increase in CTODC with fiber volume
      fraction can be observed for both the binders. Further, in some
      embodiments, the unstable crack propagation threshold limit
      (CTODC) for the unreinforced iron-based control binder is found to
      be about three times higher as compared to that of the
      corresponding OPC paste. The difference in CTODC between the two
      binder types reduces as fibers are incorporated. Further, in some
      embodiments, the KIC and CTODC values of the two binders indicate
      that the iron-based binder yields significantly improved crack
      resistance and ductility than the conventional OPC systems due to
      the presence of unreacted metallic iron powder surrounded by a
      carbonate matrix.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] The KIC&lt;S&gt;-CTODC relationships of the two binders are
      compared in FIG. 7A, showing a plot 700 of fracture
      toughness-critical crack tip opening displacement relationship
      with change in fiber dosage for iron carbonate-based binder (data
      line 710) and OPC-based binder (data line 715) in accordance with
      some embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, an
      increase in the fracture toughness is observed with an increase in
      the critical opening size of the crack. Further, while the
      increase in KIC&lt;S &gt;is proportional to an increase in CTODC
      for the OPC binders, in some embodiments, for the iron
      carbonate-based binder, the increase in KIC&lt;S &gt;is not
      prominent beyond a certain CTODc value (or fiber volume fraction
      since CTODC-fiber volume fraction relationships are linear for
      both the binder systems. This is illustrated in FIG. 7B, showing a
      plot 725 of variation in critical crack length with change in
      fiber dosage for iron carbonate-based binder (data line 730) and
      OPC-based binder (data line 735) in accordance with some
      embodiments of the invention. In some embodiments, the critical
      crack length increases with increase in fiber volume for both the
      binders. In unreinforced binders, the iron-based system has a
      higher critical crack length owing to the contribution from
      elongated, elastic iron particles. However, at a higher fiber
      volume fraction, the critical crack lengths for both the binders
      are comparable even though KIC&lt;S &gt;and CTODC are higher for
      the iron-based binder. This shows that in the iron-based systems,
      in some embodiments, beyond a certain fiber volume fraction,
      enhancement in fracture properties are negligible even though the
      performance is much better than the corresponding OPC systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] In some embodiments of the invention, the existence of
      unreacted, elongated iron particles and added fibers can influence
      and modify the fracture response. This can be examined using
      resistance curves (“R-curves”), by making use of the multiple
      loading-unloading cycles in the load-CMOD plots. For example, FIG.
      8 illustrates resistance curves (data lines 805, 810, 815, 820,
      825, 830) for the unreinforced and fiber reinforced iron-based and
      OPC binder systems in accordance with some embodiments of the
      invention. FIG. 8 shows the R-curves for both the binder systems
      at all levels of fiber reinforcements. For example, data lines
      805, 810, 815 show OPC-based binder data at 0%, 0.5%, and 1%
      volume fraction of fiber reinforcement, and data lines 820, 825,
      830 show iron-carbonate-based binder data at 0%, 0.5%, and 1%
      volume fraction of fiber reinforcement. “R” is defined as the
      strain energy rate required for crack propagation and it is an
      increasing and convex function for quasi-brittle materials. The
      contributions from both the elastic and inelastic strain energies
      are considered in the development of the R-curve. The elastic
      component can be calculated from the unloading compliances whereas
      the inelastic CMOD is used to calculate the inelastic strain
      energy release rate. Three parameters were obtained for each
      loading-unloading cycle including the compliance, the load at the
      initiation of the unloading, and inelastic CMOD, which is the
      residual displacement when the sample is unloaded. The R-curves
      comprise of a region where the resistance increases with crack
      length denoting the formation of a process zone and an energy
      plateau denoting steady-state crack extension. In some
      embodiments, the location of the transition point between the two
      regions depends on the matrix type and fiber volume. In some
      embodiments, the unreinforced OPC system shows almost negligible
      resistance whereas the corresponding iron-based system
      demonstrates some resistance to crack formation and growth,
      attributable to the reasons described elsewhere in this paper.
      Hence, in some embodiments, the use of fiber reinforcement
      improves the crack growth resistance of OPC systems, but the
      overall resistances are significantly lower than those of the
      iron-based binder systems.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] The elastic and inelastic components of the strain energy
      release rate can be separated to obtain further insights on the
      relative influence of matrix (and the discrete phases in it), and
      the relative influence of matrix fiber reinforcement on the
      fracture response of these widely different material systems. The
      elastic component of the strain energy release rate corresponds to
      the energy release rate due to incremental crack growth whereas
      the inelastic component corresponds to effects such as permanent
      deformation caused due to crack-opening. For example, plot 900 of
      FIG. 9A illustrates elastic and inelastic components of crack
      growth resistance with varying crack extension for iron carbonate
      binder for different fiber dosage in accordance with some
      embodiments of the invention. For example, data lines 905, 910,
      915 comprise elastic component response for iron-carbonate-based
      binder data at 0%, 0.5%, and 1% volume fraction of fiber
      reinforcement, and data lines 920, 925, 930 show the inelastic
      response for iron-carbonate-based binder data at 0%, 0.5%, and 1%
      volume fraction of fiber reinforcement. Further, plot 935 of FIG.
      9B illustrates elastic and inelastic components of crack growth
      resistance with varying crack extension for OPC paste for
      different fiber dosage in accordance with some embodiments of the
      invention. For example, data lines 940, 945, 950 comprise elastic
      component response for iron-carbonate-based binder data at 0%,
      0.5%, and 1% volume fraction of fiber reinforcement, and data
      lines 955, 960, 965 show the inelastic response for
      iron-carbonate-based binder data at 0%, 0.5%, and 1% volume
      fraction of fiber reinforcement. As indicated, in some
      embodiments, the contribution of the elastic component to the
      overall strain energy release rate is found to be higher than the
      inelastic component for the iron-based binder systems (both
      unreinforced and reinforced). However, for the OPC systems, the
      contribution of inelastic component is higher. Further, in some
      embodiments, both the elastic and the inelastic components
      increase with increase in crack extension for the fiber-reinforced
      iron-based system, However, for the fiber-reinforced OPC systems,
      the elastic component remains relatively constant with crack
      extension, and the increase in total strain energy is mainly due
      to increase in the inelastic component.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] In some embodiments, the higher contribution of the elastic
      component in the iron-based systems can be attributed to the
      presence of a stronger matrix along with the presence of elastic
      metallic iron particles that provide crack growth resistance
      through the mechanisms described earlier. On the contrary, the
      brittle OPC matrix cracks easily, and consequently the load is
      carried almost completely by the fibers. The fibers bridge the
      crack, and energy dissipation is obtained through crack opening,
      which is reflected in the form of increased inelastic strain
      energy with increasing crack extension. The R-curve response is
      consistent with the values of fracture parameters (KIC&lt;S
      &gt;and CTODC) of these binders. In some embodiments, the fracture
      toughness of the iron-based systems was found to be much higher
      than the OPC systems whereas the CTODC values demonstrated less of
      a difference. The same trends are reflected in the R-curves: about
      an order of magnitude higher crack growth resistance (elastic
      contribution) observed for the iron-based systems than the OPC
      systems and comparatively lesser improvement (about 60% higher) in
      the crack-opening resistance (inelastic contribution).<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Digital image correlation (“DIC”) can be used to determine
      KIC and CTODc of the binder systems. Two representative iron
      carbonate binders (0% and 1% fiber volume fraction) were examined
      for the extraction of fracture parameters through DIC. For
      example, FIG. 10A shows a load-CMOD response plot 1000 for iron
      carbonate binder with 1% fiber volume fraction in accordance with
      some embodiments of the invention, and FIG. 10B shows a horizontal
      (u) displacement field represented as a 3D surface plot 1025 for
      iron carbonate binder with 1% fiber in accordance with some
      embodiments of the invention. Referring to plot 1000 of FIG. 10A,
      the load-CMOD response for the fiber-reinforced iron-based binder
      can be seen as data line 1005, where the points P1, P2, P3
      correspond to three different stages of crack extension (i.e., in
      the pre-peak, near-peak, and post-peak stages). The compliance
      value obtained by unloading at approximately 95% of the peak load
      in the post-peak region is used for the determination of KIC&lt;S
      &gt;and CTODC using TPFM, which is required in order to compare
      with the corresponding values obtained using the DIC technique.
      The horizontal u-displacement fields (along the crack opening
      direction) are obtained from image correlation. The plot 1025 of
      FIG. 10B shows crack opening behavior curve 1027, denoted by the
      horizontal displacement, and the crack extension, denoted by the
      jump in the displacement above the notch (extracted from the DIC
      data). As can be observed, in some embodiments, the CTOD and ?a
      values can be determined directly using the DIC method without
      instrumenting the crack for precise measurements. A threshold
      value of 0.005 mm is set to qualify the displacement-jump as
      contributing to crack extension. The crack extension corresponding
      to 95% of the peak load in the post-peak region is used to
      determine the DIC-based fracture toughness parameters using a set
      of simplified expressions as shown later.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] FIGS. 11A-11F show horizontal 2D displacement fields and
      the 3D surface plots for unreinforced and reinforced (1% fiber
      volume fraction) iron-based binders in accordance with some
      embodiments of the invention. The plots correspond to: (a) and (b)
      pre-crack stage: P1 (CMOD: 0.0009 mm, Load: 91.4 N, =0 mm, CTOD=0
      mm); (c) and (d) stable crack growth stage: P2 (CMOD: 0.0263 mm,
      Load: 1172 N, =3.95 mm, CTOD=0.0096 mm); (e) and (f) unstable
      crack-propagation stage: P3 (CMOD: 0.2019 mm; Load: 633.8 N;
      =18.58 mm; CTOD=0.156 mm) in accordance with some embodiments of
      the invention. As shown, the 2D displacement fields for the
      iron-based binder are shown for three different CTOD values which
      were selected as shown in FIG. 10A (“P1”, “P2”, and “P3”), where
      FIGS. 11A, 11C, and 11E show the 2D crack opening displacements,
      corresponding to the points P1, P2 and P3 of FIG. 10A. Further,
      FIGS. 11B, 11D, and 11F show the corresponding horizontal
      displacements as 3D surface plots 1120, 1160, 1190 for 2D surface
      regions 1105, 1145, and 1185 respectively. Plot 1100 of FIG. 11A
      corresponds to the case where only a very small load is applied to
      the specimen (point “P1” in FIG. 10A), and the values of both CTOD
      and crack extension are zero, as shown by the uniform horizontal
      displacement fields above the notch as well as a flat surface plot
      (#D plot 1125 of FIG. 11B). FIG. 11C corresponds to 95% of the
      peak load in the post-peak zone (Point “P2” in FIG. 10A). A
      displacement jump is clearly visible above the notch in both the
      2D displacement field (FIG. 11C) and the 3D surface plot (3D plot
      1165 of FIG. 11D). Beyond this point, the crack extension is found
      to be unstable (a large increase in CTOD and crack extension).
      FIG. 11E shows the displacement field corresponding to Point “P3”
      in FIG. 10A, and the 3D surface plot (3D plot 1195 of FIG. 11F).
      The CTOD and ?a values are very high in the post-peak zone.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] CTODC and KIC values are shown Table 2 (obtained using
      calculated TPFM and DIC methods). For the iron-based binders, the
      data indicates a there is a correlation between the KIC and CTODc

      Some embodiments of the invention include a method of producing
      iron carbonate binder compositions including providing a plurality
      of binder precursors including a powdered iron or steel, a first
      powdered additive comprising silica, a second powdered additive
      including calcium carbonate, and a powdered clay. The method
      includes mixing the plurality of binder precursors and a water
      additive to form an uncured product, and feeding at least a
      portion of the uncured product into a curing chamber. The curing
      chamber is fluidly coupled to a CO2 source so that some CO2 from
      the CO2 source reacts with the uncured product to form a cured
      iron carbonate containing product and at least one reaction
      byproduct, where at least some byproduct can be fed from the
      curing chamber to the CO2 source for use as a fuel by the CO2
      source.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0003] Anthropogenic emission of CO2 is accepted as being
      responsible for changes in global climate and potentially
      irreversible damaging impacts on ecosystems and societies. Various
      technologies designed to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases
      such as CO2 in the atmosphere is an active research area through
      the developed and developing world. The sequestration of CO2
      offers the potential to prevent CO2 from entering the atmosphere
      (i.e., by removal of the CO2 from an industrial waste stream), or
      a potential route to extraction of CO2 that is already present in
      the atmosphere. Physical trapping of CO2, such as injection of CO2
      into depleted natural gas reservoirs under the seabed or into the
      deep ocean has not yet been proven to be a leak-proof technology
      option. Chemical sequestration on the other hand offers the
      potential to trap the CO2 virtually permanently. The use of
      mineral rocks (especially alkaline-earth oxide bearing rocks) as a
      feedstock for reaction with CO2 is one of the promising routes for
      reduction of concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. CO2 is passed
      through the rock, and chemically sequestered through mineral
      carbonation. See for example, Klein, E.; Lucia, M. D.; Kempka, T.;
      Kühn, M. Evaluation of Long-term Mineral Trapping at the Ketzin
      Pilot Site for CO2 Storage: An Integrative Approach Using
      Geochemical Modeling and Reservoir Simulation. Int. J. Greenhouse

      <br>
      [0004] Many industrial processes produce metal and metal oxide
      wastes that require disposal. For example, particulate waste that
      includes some metallic iron or steel powder can be generated in
      significant amounts as bag-house dust waste during the Electric
      Arc Furnace (EAF) manufacturing process of steel and from the
      shot-blasting operations of structural steel sections. The
      traditional means of disposing EAF and shot-blasting dust is
      landfilling as it is not economically feasible to recycle the iron
      from the dust. Several million tons of such waste material is
      being landfilled at great costs all over the world. It is known
      that secondary carbonate rocks formed during mineral trapping
      demonstrate mechanical strength, which suggests the possibility of
      using mineral trapping in conjunction with a binder for the
      development of a sustainable construction material.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Several studies on iron carbonate formation by CO2
      corrosion of steel have been reported (see for example, Wu, S. L.;
      Cui, Z. D.; He, F.; Bai, Z. Q.; Zhu, S. L.; Yang, X. J.

      Corrosion on N80 Steel. Mater. Lett. 2004, 58, 1076-1081, and

      Prediction of Corrosion of Mild Steel in Aqueous Carbon Dioxide

      In addition to iron oxidation, dissolved CO2 is also capable of
      reacting with iron. A dense layer of iron carbonate can form which
      adheres strongly to the substrate. For example, CO2 can react with
      iron as outlined in the following reaction equations (1), (2):<br>
      <br>
      Fe+2CO2+2H2O?Fe&lt;2+&gt;+2HCO3&lt;-&gt;+H2?&nbsp; (1)<br>
      <br>
      Fe&lt;2+&gt;+2HCO3&lt;-&gt;?FeCO3+CO2+H2O&nbsp; (2)<br>
      <br>
      [0006] The net reaction then can be defined by the following
      reaction equation (3):<br>
      <br>
      Fe+CO2+H2O?FeCO3+H2?&nbsp; (3)<br>
      <br>
      [0007] However the kinetics of the reaction and the rate of
      product formation are often very slow. To be of any use for
      beneficial industrial applications, a promoter including one or
      more reducing agents can be added to increase the rate of
      reaction. However the handling and processing properties of the
      mixtures of powders can prevent optimal mixing of materials,
      thereby preventing homogeneous reaction and compositional
      development.<br>

      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>

      <b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      [0041] Before any embodiments of the invention are explained in
      detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited
      in its application to the details of construction and the
      arrangement of components set forth in the following description
      or illustrated in the following drawings. The invention is capable
      of other embodiments and of being practiced or of being carried
      out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the
      phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of
      description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of
      “including,” “comprising,” or “having” and variations thereof
      herein is meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and
      equivalents thereof as well as additional items. Unless specified
      or limited otherwise, the terms “mounted,” “connected,”
      “supported,” and “coupled” and variations thereof are used broadly
      and encompass both direct and indirect mountings, connections,
      supports, and couplings. Further, “connected” and “coupled” are
      not restricted to physical or mechanical connections or couplings.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] The following discussion is presented to enable a person
      skilled in the art to make and use embodiments of the invention.
      Various modifications to the illustrated embodiments will be
      readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic
      principles herein can be applied to other embodiments and
      applications without departing from embodiments of the invention.
      Thus, embodiments of the invention are not intended to be limited
      to embodiments shown, but are to be accorded the widest scope
      consistent with the principles and features disclosed herein. The
      following detailed description is to be read with reference to the
      figures, in which like elements in different figures have like
      reference numerals. The figures, which are not necessarily to
      scale, depict selected embodiments and are not intended to limit
      the scope of embodiments of the invention. Skilled artisans will
      recognize the examples provided herein have many useful
      alternatives and fall within the scope of embodiments of the
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] Some embodiments of the invention include various
      compositions and synthesis methods of a structural binder
      utilizing the chemistry of iron carbonation. In some embodiments,
      a structural binder can be formed by reaction of iron with carbon
      dioxide (herein referred to as CO2). In some embodiments, the CO2
      can be waste CO2 obtained from one or more industrial processes.
      Some embodiments include methods to form a sustainable binder
      system for concretes through carbonation of iron dust. For
      example, in some embodiments, iron can react with aqueous CO2
      under controlled conditions to form complex iron carbonates which
      have binding capabilities. Further, some embodiments can include
      additives comprising silica and alumina. In some embodiments,
      silica and/or alumina additives can facilitate iron dissolution,
      which in some embodiments can provide beneficial rheological
      characteristics and properties. In some embodiments, the binder
      system can rely on the effects of corrosion of iron particles to
      form a binding matrix. In this instance, binder formation can
      result in the consumption and trapping of CO2 from an industrial
      operation and subsequent carbonate formation by conversion of at
      least a portion of the iron particles. Further, the binder
      formation can provide a means to reduce the overall ordinary
      Portland cement production (which is itself a significant emitter
      of CO2) through the use of carbonated metallic iron powder as the
      binder material for concrete. As used herein, the term metallic
      iron powder can include powders or particulate compositions
      comprising iron powder, steel powder, mixtures of iron and steel
      powder, fine particulates containing 10% or more reduced or
      metallic iron, or mixtures thereof.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] In some embodiments, dissolution agents (such as organic
      acids) can be added to enhance the corrosion rate of iron.
      Further, in some embodiments, the rheological behavior
      (flowability and castability) and early strength development can
      be improved using one or more additives. For example, additives
      common to Portland cement concretes such as class F fly ash,
      powdered limestone, and metakaolin can be used as minor
      ingredients along with metallic iron powder to form pastes with
      adequate binding capabilities. In some embodiments, fly ash can be
      added as a source of silica to potentially facilitate iron
      silicate complexation. Further, in some embodiments, limestone
      powder can be added to provide additional nucleation sites. Some
      embodiments include one or more “powdered” clays having a layered
      structure which retains water and which can be used to improve the
      rheological properties. For example, in some embodiments, a clay
      source such as kaolinite and/or metakaolin can be added to provide
      cohesiveness as the iron-based mixtures are prepared.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Some embodiments provide compositions comprising fly ash,
      limestone, and a clay source such as metakaolin and/or kaolinite
      in various proportions. In some embodiments, the proportions of
      iron powder and other additives (including for example organic
      acids as dissolution agents) can influence the curing regime
      (based at least in part on the exposure of the mixture to CO2
      and/or air). In some embodiments, the iron powder comprises about
      88% iron and about 10% oxygen, along with trace quantities of
      copper, manganese, and calcium. In some embodiments, a binder
      composition can include class F fly ash. In some further
      embodiments, the composition can comprise metakaolin conforming to
      ASTM C 618.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] In further embodiments, the binder composition can comprise
      limestone powder. In some embodiments, the limestone powder can
      comprise a median particle size of about 0.7 µm conforming to ASTM
      C 568. In some embodiments, limestone can be added with a particle
      size that can range from a median size of about 0.7 µm to about 20
      µm. In some embodiments, the fineness determines its nucleation
      ability.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Some embodiments of the invention include compositions
      comprising metallic iron powder with median particle size of about
      19 µm. In some embodiments, metallic iron powder sizes can range
      from about 5 µm to about 50 µm. Further, in some embodiments, the
      selection of size ranges can facilitate reactivity. In some
      embodiments, the iron powder can be obtained from a shot-blasting
      facility. In some embodiments, the iron powder can be derived from
      waste steel dust (such as so-called “bag house dust” from a shot
      blasting operation). In some embodiments, the waste dust comprises
      fine residue from blasting structural steel components such as
      I-beams with steel shot (round) or grit (angular). In this
      example, the shot and grit break down during numerous cycles of
      being blasted against steel targets. Other sources of the iron or
      steel powder can be from brake drum turnings, mill scale (if
      containing &gt;10% metallic iron), machine shop shavings, finely
      chopped sheet steel and other waste ferrous scrap, and other
      sources of fine particulates containing particles of &lt;50 um in
      size and containing about 10% or more of metallic iron. In some
      further embodiments, synthesized pure metallic iron powder can be
      used such as electrolytic iron powder and hydrogen-reduced iron
      powder.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In some embodiments of the invention, the curing of the
      binder composition can be integrated into a conventional furnace
      process to take advantage of the use of CO2 emitted from the
      convention process, and from the potential to recycle energy,
      reduce waste, and potentially lower costs by recycling gases from
      binder reaction and curing processes described above. For example,
      in some embodiments, CO2 from a conventional process can be used
      to provide a source of reactant in equation (1) or (3) described
      earlier. Further, in some embodiments of the invention, H2 emitted
      from the reactions (1) or (3) can be used within at least one
      reaction and/or process of the convention process.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] FIG. 1 illustrates a schematic of a method of synthesis and
      processing of binder compositions using a recycled reaction
      products integrated within a source of CO2 (such as a conventional
      furnace process) in accordance with some embodiments of the
      invention. In some embodiments of the invention, binder components
      105 can be prepared and fed using a delivery process 107 into a
      mixing process 110. In some embodiments, the binder components 105
      can be mixed using the mixing process 110 to produce any of the
      binder mixtures described herein. The mixing process can comprise
      any conventional mixing process including ball-milling, low-shear
      mixing, high-shear mixing, rotary-blade mixing, acoustic mixing,
      extrusion mixing, shaker-mixing, or any other conventional binder
      mixing process. In some embodiments, binder components 105 can be
      mixed until a binder mixture is produced that is generally
      homogenous. The mixing time can be dependent on the mixer and the
      binder components 105 may be mixed for longer or shorter periods
      based on the composition and the mixer type.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] In some embodiments, a mixture 112 can be transferred to a
      form or mold 120. In some embodiments, water and/or seawater 114
      can be added and an uncured aggregate can be formed into a form or
      mold 120. In some embodiments, uncured forms 130 can be
      transferred (transfer process 116) from the form or mold 120 and
      assembled and/or prepared for transfer 132 to a curing chamber
      140.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] In some embodiments of the invention, the curing chamber
      140 can be fluidly coupled to a CO2 source (such as a conventional
      reactor or furnace 175). For example, in some embodiments, at or
      adjacent to or proximate to a first end 140a of the curing chamber
      140, a fluid coupling 187 can be coupled at one end and coupled to
      a first end 175a of the conventional furnace 175. Further, for
      example, in some embodiments, at or adjacent to or proximate to a
      second end 140b of the curing chamber 140, a fluid coupling 177
      can be coupled at one end and coupled to a second end 175b of the
      conventional furnace 175. In some other embodiments, the CO2
      source can comprise other sources of CO2 including, but not
      limited to, an existing industrial process comprising the CO2
      source such as a furnace of the existing industrial process, a
      furnace, a boiler, a reactor or process vessel, a power station or
      generator, an oil or gas well or field, a natural or synthetic CO2
      aquifer, a CO2 sequestration apparatus, and/or the atmosphere or
      environment.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] In some embodiments, the fluid couplings 177, 187 can
      include at least one meter for metering a fluid flow and/or at
      least one valve for altering or adjusting a fluid flow. For
      example, in some embodiments, the fluid coupling 177 can comprise
      a fluid valve 181. In some further embodiments, the fluid coupling
      187 can comprise a fluid valve 183. In some further embodiments,
      the fluid coupling 187 can comprise a fluid meter 185. In some
      other embodiments, the fluid coupling 177 can comprise a fluid
      meter 179.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In some embodiments of the invention, the fluid valve 181
      can at least partially restrict or stop fluid flow in the fluid
      coupling 177 between the conventional furnace 175 and the curing
      chamber 140. In some further embodiments of the invention, the
      fluid valve 183 can at least partially restrict or stop fluid flow
      in the fluid coupling 187 between the conventional furnace 175 and
      the curing chamber 140.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In some embodiments of the invention, the fluid meter 179
      can measure or monitor a fluid flow in the fluid coupling 177
      between the conventional furnace 175 and the curing chamber 140.
      In some further embodiments of the invention, the fluid meter 185
      can measure or monitor fluid flow in the fluid coupling 187
      between the conventional furnace 175 and the curing chamber 140.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] In some embodiments of the invention, with uncured forms
      130 entering and/or moving, and/or stationary within the curing
      chamber, fluids including H2 and/or CHxOy (where x can be between
      zero and four, and y can be between zero and two) can pass from
      the curing chamber 140 through the fluid coupling 187 into the
      conventional reactor or furnace 175. Further, in some embodiments,
      CO2 producing within the conventional reactor or furnace 175 can
      flow from the conventional reactor or furnace 175 to the curing
      chamber 140. In some embodiments, the flow of CO2 can be measured
      or monitored with the fluid meter 179. In some further
      embodiments, the flow of CO2 from the conventional reactor or
      furnace 175 to the curing chamber 140 can be modified or halted
      using the fluid valve 181.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] In some embodiments, the flow of fluids from the curing
      chamber 140 to the conventional reactor or furnace 175 including
      H2 and/or CHxOy can be measured or monitored with the fluid meter
      185. In some further embodiments, the flow of fluids including H2
      and/or CHxOy from the curing chamber 140 to the conventional
      reactor or furnace 175 can be modified or halted using the fluid
      valve 183.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] In some embodiments of the invention, the flow of fluids
      including H2 and/or CHxOy from the curing chamber 140 to the
      conventional reactor or furnace 175 is based at least in part on a
      cure reaction (e.g., from a reaction shown in equation 1) of the
      uncured products 130 during conversion to a cured product 150 that
      can exit the curing chamber 140 through a process 142. Further, in
      some embodiments of the invention, at least a portion of the
      curing and conversion of the uncured products 130 to cured product
      150 can be dependent at least in part on CO2 delivered from one or
      more reactions or processes of the conventional reactor or furnace
      175.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] FIG. 2 provides an illustrative view of a scanning electron
      micrograph 200 of iron particles (where the scale bar corresponds
      to 20 µm) according to one embodiment of the invention. As shown,
      the iron powder can include elongated and plate-like particles. In
      some embodiments, the elongated and plate-like particles can
      influence the rheological properties of the mixture. Further, in
      some embodiments, the larger surface area-to-volume ratio of this
      shape as compared to spherical shaped particles can improve
      reactivity of the iron powder. In some embodiments, fly ash can be
      used to provide a silica source for the reactions (and to
      potentially facility iron silicate complexation). In some
      embodiments, added limestone powder can provide nucleation sites
      for one or more cure reactions within the binder composition. In
      some embodiments, added water can be reduced in chemical reactions
      within any of the disclosed binder compositions (however it does
      not form part of the binder). In some embodiments, to minimize
      water demand, while maintaining binder consistency and
      cohesiveness, added metakaolin can be added to the binder
      composition. In some further embodiments, an organic reducing
      agent/chelating agent of metal cations can be included in the
      binder composition.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] In some embodiments, various iron-based binder compositions
      were prepared and compared with commercially available type I/II
      ordinary Portland cement (hereinafter “OPC”). For example, in some
      embodiments, OPC conforming to ASTM C 150 was used to prepare
      conventional cement pastes, and the compressive strengths of the
      iron-based binder compositions were compared with those of the
      traditional OPC-based systems. In some embodiments, OPC was also
      partially replaced by class F fly ash and blast furnace slag up to
      about 40% and about 50% respectively by mass for comparison
      purposes. Fly ash generally contains about 60% by mass of SiO2,
      whereas the siliceous content of metakaolin is about 50%. In some
      embodiments, the limestone powder used comprises a nominally pure
      calcium carbonate (about 97% by mass).<br>
      <br>
      [0060] FIG. 3A shows a plot 300 of particle size distribution
      (obtained from a laser diffraction-based particle size analyzer)
      of metallic iron powder (data plot 305), OPC (data plot 309), fly
      ash (data plot 307), metakaolin (data plot 311) and limestone
      powder (data plot 313) in accordance with at least one embodiment
      of the invention. In some embodiments, binder composition
      preparation methods can include dry mixing of all materials (iron
      powder, fly ash, limestone powder, a clay source such as
      metakaolin and/or kaolinite, and an organic reducing agent). In
      some embodiments, water can be added to some of the dry
      ingredients and the other ingredients can then mixed in order to
      obtain a uniform cohesive mixture. In some embodiments, the
      mass-based water-to-solids ratio (hereinafter “w/s”) was varied
      between about 0.22 and about 0.25 depending upon the proportions
      of the constituents in the mixtures to attain a cohesive mix. As
      described earlier, since the carbonation process of iron does not
      incorporate water in the reaction product, the w/s used can be
      primarily based on the criteria of obtaining desired workability,
      casting behavior, and ability to strip the cured composition from
      molds without specimen breakage.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] In some embodiments of the method, the mixture was
      transferred to cylindrical molds (about 32.5 mm diameter and about
      65 mm long) in a Harvard miniature compaction apparatus (ASTM D
      4609—Annex A1) in five layers to fill the mold completely. In some
      embodiments, the specimens were de-molded immediately using a
      specimen ejector for the compaction apparatus, and placed inside
      clear plastic bags filled with 100% CO2 at room temperature
      (between about 18° C. and about 22° C.) inside a fume hood for 1
      to 4 days. In some embodiments, the bags were refilled with CO2
      every 12 hours so as to maintain saturation inside the chamber. In
      some embodiments, after the respective durations of CO2 exposure,
      the samples were placed in air at room temperature (between about
      18° C. and about 22° C.) to allow the moisture to evaporate for 1
      to 30 days. In some embodiments, the OPC-based samples were cast
      in 50 mm cube molds and moist-cured (&gt;98% RH and 23±2° C.) for
      7 days before compressive strength testing. In some embodiments,
      the water-to-cementitious materials ratio (hereinafter “w/cm”)
      adopted for the OPC-based mixtures was about 0.40, which is the
      most common w/cm used for moderate strength (20-35 MPa) concretes.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] As described earlier, some embodiments comprise binder
      compositions including various mixture proportions of iron powder,
      and at least one of fly ash, limestone powder, a clay source such
      as kaolinite and/or metakaolin, and one or more organic reducing
      agents. Further, in some embodiments, binder compositions can be
      cured using various curing procedures. For example, different
      mixtures with varying iron powder, fly ash, limestone, and a clay
      source such as metakaolin and/or kaolinite contents can be
      proportioned to select one or more compositions based on
      compressive strength of the cured binder composition. For example,
      some binder compositions include an iron powder content that
      ranged from about 58 to about 69% by mass. In some embodiments,
      the fly ash content was maintained at about 15% or about 20%.
      Further, in some embodiments, a limestone content of about 8% to
      about 10% was used. Further, some embodiments included a
      metakaolin content of about 6% to about 10%. In some embodiments,
      the w/s ratios varied between about 0.22 and about 0.25. These
      preliminary proportions were arrived at based on several trial
      proportions that used iron powder from about 50 to about 100% of
      the total binder content. Moreover, the binder composition
      included other ingredients at multiple levels beyond the ranges
      described above, and several w/s ratios in the range of about 0.15
      to about 0.30.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] FIG. 3B illustrates a table (375) of compositions
      comprising mixtures of iron powder, fly ash, limestone and
      metakaolin in accordance with at least one embodiment of the
      invention. The proportions of the eight short-listed mixtures are
      shown, and were chosen based on the homogeneous nature of the
      mixture, their ability to be compacted into molds, and their
      ability to be demolded without breakage. As shown, in some
      embodiments, the binder composition can comprise about 64% iron
      powder, about 20% fly ash, about 8% limestone, and about 6%
      metakaolin (“mixture 1” marked as 380). In some further
      embodiments, the binder composition can comprise about 60% iron
      powder, about 20% fly ash, about 8% limestone, and about 10%
      metakaolin (“mixture 2” marked as 382). In some other embodiments,
      the binder composition can comprise about 62% iron powder, about
      20% fly ash, about 10% limestone, and about 6% metakaolin
      (“mixture 3” marked as 384). Some embodiments include a binder
      composition that comprises about 58% iron powder, about 20% fly
      ash, about 10% limestone, and about 10% metakaolin (“mixture 4”
      marked as 386). In some embodiments, the binder composition can
      comprise about 69% iron powder, about 15% fly ash, about 8%
      limestone, and about 6% metakaolin (“mixture 5” marked as 388). In
      some other embodiments, the binder composition can comprise about
      65% iron powder, about 15% fly ash, about 8% limestone, and about
      10% metakaolin (“mixture 6” marked as 390). In some further
      embodiments, the binder composition can comprise about 67% iron
      powder, about 15% fly ash, about 10% limestone, and about 6%
      metakaolin (“mixture 7” marked as 392). Some further embodiments
      of the invention include a binder composition comprising about 63%
      iron powder, about 15% fly ash, about 10% limestone, and about 10%
      metakaolin (“mixture 8” marked as 394). In some embodiments of the
      invention, the binder components 105 can comprise any of the
      mixtures 380, 382, 384, 386, 388, 390, 392.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] In some embodiments, the organic reducing agent comprises
      an acid. In some embodiments, the organic reducing agent comprises
      oxalic acid. In some embodiments, the acid can comprise at least
      one carboxylic acid group. In some embodiments, an organic
      reducing agent can be added in a powder form to about 2% of total
      mass of the constituents. In some other embodiments, the organic
      reducing agent can be added based on the solubility of the organic
      acid in water, and the compressive strength as compared to
      mixtures without dissociating agent. In some embodiments of the
      invention, the binder components 105 can comprise any of the
      mixtures 380, 382, 384, 386, 388, 390, 392 that also comprise 2 wt
      % of an organic acid including, but not limited to oxalic acid or
      any organic carboxylic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] In some embodiments, binder composition samples were kept
      in a 100% CO2 atmosphere for 3 days immediately after casting and
      de-molding, and cured in air for 2 days before they were tested in
      uniaxial compression. In some embodiments, in order to determine
      the optimal combination of CO2 and air-curing durations, the CO2
      curing exposure duration was varied from 1 to 4 days, and the air
      curing duration varied from 1 to 3 days. In some embodiments, the
      upper limit of the carbonation duration was chosen based on the
      thermo-gravimetric analysis which showed similar degrees of
      carbonation in the core and surface of the cylindrical samples
      after 4 days of carbonation. In some embodiments, air-curing was
      extended to 30 days, but no appreciable changes in compressive
      strengths were found after 3 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] Physical characterization was performed on one or more of
      the cured binder compositions described above. For example,
      flexural strength tests were carried out on mixtures under
      compression. Paste beams, 250 mm×25 mm×25 mm in size were prepared
      and cured in a 100% CO2 environment for 2-6 days. The air exposure
      time was maintained constant at 3 days. Three-point bending tests
      were conducted at a displacement rate of 0.375 mm/min until the
      samples failed. Thermo-gravimetric analysis was performed using a
      Perkin Elmer STA 6000 simultaneous thermal analyzer. The analyzer
      was programmed to increase the temperature from 30° C. to 995° C.
      at a rate of 15° C./minute in a N2 environment. The samples were
      obtained from cylindrical samples that were cured for the
      compressive strength tests. Samples from both surface as well as
      core of the cylindrical specimens were analyzed in order to assess
      the influence of CO2 penetration on the degree of reaction.
      Mercury intrusion porosimetry was adopted to study the pore
      structure. The samples for MIP tests were taken from the core of
      the cylindrical sample. The MIP test was done in two steps: (i)
      evacuation of gases, filling the sample holder with mercury, and
      increasing the pressure up to 345 kPa, and (ii) intrusion of the
      mercury into the sample at high pressures (up to 414 MPa). The
      contact angle and surface tension of Hg used for the analysis was
      0.485 N/m. In the absence of a better understanding of the contact
      angle between Hg and the iron carbonate binder, the common value
      used for OPC-based pastes (130°) was used here. The pore diameters
      were evaluated using the Washburn equation based on the assumption
      that the pores are of cylindrical shape. A minimum pore diameter
      of 0.003 µm can be evaluated using MIP. The average pore diameter
      (da) can be estimated for varying carbonation durations using the
      total volume of mercury intruded (V, cm&lt;3&gt;/g) and the pore
      surface area (A, cm&lt;2&gt;/g) obtained from MIP as shown below:<br>
      <br>
      da=(4V/A)<br>
      <br>
      [0067] In some embodiments, the compressive strength of one or
      more of the binder compositions measured to determine the behavior
      of compressive strength for a specific curing duration and
      procedure. In some embodiments, binder composition samples were
      kept in a CO2 environment for 3 days and then cured in air for 2
      days at 23±2° C. to get a comparative measure of the compressive
      strengths of one or more compositions. For example, FIG. 4A
      illustrates a plot of compressive strength values of mixtures
      after 3 days in CO2 and 2 days in air in accordance with various
      embodiments of the invention. The results show compressive
      strength bars 401, 402, 403, 404, 405, 406, 407, 408 corresponding
      to the mixtures shown in table 375, including 380, 382, 384, 386,
      388, 390, 392, and 394 respectively. Further, FIG. 4B illustrates
      a plot of compressive strength values of mixtures showing 7-day
      compressive strengths of plain and modified OPC mixtures for
      comparison with 4-day carbonated iron-carbonate (mixture 2: 60%
      iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8% limestone, 10% metakaolin) in
      accordance with various embodiments of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] The influence of various constituents on compressive
      strength is illustrated in FIGS. 5A-5C. For example, FIG. 5A
      illustrates a plot 500 of the effect of fly ash content on the
      compressive strength of iron carbonate binders in accordance with
      some embodiments of the invention. FIG. 5B illustrates a plot 525
      of the effect of limestone content on the compressive strength of
      iron carbonate binders, and FIG. 5C illustrates a plot 550 of the
      effect of metakaolin content on the compressive strength of iron
      carbonate binders in accordance with some embodiments of the
      invention. The results illustrated in FIG. 5A implies that the
      samples with 20% fly ash (shown as 501, 502) were significantly
      stronger than the samples with 15% fly ash, irrespective of the
      contents of limestone and metakaolin. In this instance, the best
      performing mixtures (mixture 1 shown as 501, and mixture 2 shown
      as 502) contained 20% fly ash by mass. These mixtures also
      demonstrated the lowest porosity (determined from mercury
      intrusion porosimetry), possibly due to the combined effect of
      particle packing and increased reaction product formation. From
      FIG. 5B, it can be seen that in some embodiments, the limestone
      content exerts negligible influence on compressive strength at
      lower fly ash contents, but at higher fly ash contents, a lower
      amount of limestone powder is preferable. Further, in some
      embodiments, the compressive strength is relatively insensitive to
      variations in metakaolin content for the samples containing 20%
      fly ash. Thus, in some embodiments, the synergistic effect of
      silicates and cohesive nature of metakaolin can ensure a denser
      matrix. In some embodiments of the invention, with a binder
      comprising a lower fly ash content, an increase in the metakaolin
      content is associated with significant decrease in the compressive
      strength values. In some embodiments, this can be attributed to
      the increased water retention by metakaolin, and the lack of
      quantity of fly ash to enhance the workability and produce a
      consistent and defect-free mixture.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] In some embodiments, the statistical influence of the
      amounts of fly ash, metakaolin and limestone on the compressive
      strength and the relative sensitivity of strength to these factors
      can be determined using a 2&lt;3 &gt;factorial analysis. For
      example, FIG. 6A illustrates a response surface plot 600 showing
      the statistical influence of amounts of fly ash and metakaolin in
      accordance with some embodiments of the invention. Further, FIG.
      6B illustrates a response surface plot 625 showing the statistical
      influence of amounts of fly ash and limestone in accordance with
      some embodiments of the invention, and FIG. 6C illustrates a
      response surface plot 650 showing the statistical influence of
      amounts of limestone and metakaolin in accordance with some
      embodiments of the invention. It is confirmed that fly ash is the
      dominant factor influencing the compression strength. The
      sensitivity of compressive strength to variations in the amount of
      limestone and metakaolin is relatively low. As described earlier,
      metakaolin is used as a rheology modifier (modifying the overall
      cohesiveness of the binder mixture), and the limestone can
      function as a nucleation site for the reaction products.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] The range of amount of limestone used in the compositions
      described herein (about 8-10%) does not significantly impact the
      strength, however thermogravimetric analysis indicates some
      consumption of limestone in the reaction to form a
      carbonate-containing complex reaction product. As discussed
      earlier, the data illustrated in FIG. 2A does not indicate
      significant differences in compressive strengths between mixtures
      1 and 2 under the chosen curing condition (in a CO2 environment
      for 3 days and air-cured for 2 days). To observe whether changes
      in curing conditions would elicit varied response from these
      mixes, the cylindrical specimens were carbonated for 3 or 4 days
      and air-cured for 1 or 3 days. FIG. 7 shows a bar graph 700 of the
      comparison of compressive strength of mixture 1 (comprising 64%
      iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8% limestone, 6% metakaolin) and shown
      as 710, and mixture 2 (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8%
      limestone, 10% metakaolin) shown as 720, under different curing
      conditions in accordance with some embodiments of the invention.
      Here the number before ‘C’ represents the days of carbonation
      whereas the number before ‘A’ represents the air exposure time in
      days. Therefore, as an example, “3C-1A” represents three days of
      carbonation and one day of air exposure time.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The effects of curing procedure and duration on compressive
      strengths of the iron carbonate binders are shown in FIGS. 8A and
      8B. For example, FIG. 8A illustrates a surface plot 800 of the
      effect of curing procedure and curing duration in accordance with
      some embodiments of the invention. Further, FIG. 8B shows a bar
      graph 825 of the effect of air-curing duration on compressive
      strength of mixture 2 (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8%
      limestone, 10% metakaolin), and carbonated for 4 days in
      accordance with some embodiments of the invention. In some
      embodiments, the samples were cured in CO2 for 1 to 4 days and in
      air for 1 to 3 days thereafter. Referring to FIG. 8A, the strength
      values are shown in a response surface plot as function of CO2 and
      air-curing durations. As illustrated, in some embodiments, the
      influence of CO2 curing duration shows low compressive strength
      values for the samples cured in CO2 for 1 day only (due to the
      very low degree of carbonation). In some embodiments, the
      carbonation provides mechanical strength in the binder
      compositions. Moreover, in some embodiments, there is no
      discernible strength increase when the moisture leaves the system
      through air exposure. This can be seen where for 1 day of
      carbonation, increasing the air exposure duration from 1 to 3 days
      does not impact the compressive strength positively. However, the
      effect of air-curing is evident when the carbonation duration is
      increased. In some embodiments, a significant increase in strength
      is observed for specimens carbonated for a longer duration when
      the air curing time was increased. This can be attributed to the
      fact that the average pore sizes decrease with increased
      carbonation duration as shown in FIG. 9, which illustrates plot
      900 showing variations in average pore diameter with varying
      carbonation durations for mixture 2 (60% iron powder, 20% fly ash,
      8% limestone, 10% metakaolin).<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In some embodiments, the average pore size of the 1-day
      carbonated samples is larger, which in some embodiments can
      consequently exert less internal moisture pressure under a
      compression test (pressure is inversely proportional to the pore
      size). Therefore, in some embodiments, the loss of moisture
      through air exposure does not have a larger effect on internal
      pressure (and thus the compressive strength). Further, in some
      embodiments, the pore sizes of samples carbonated for a longer
      duration are lower due to increased reaction product formation,
      which in some embodiments, results in an increased sensitivity of
      compressive strength to the loss of moisture.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] In order to further illustrate the effect of air exposure,
      FIG. 8B plots the compressive strengths as a function of air
      exposure duration after the samples were carbonated for 4 days. As
      illustrated, in some embodiments, the first three days of exposure
      to air results in an enhancement in the compressive strength.
      Further, as the moisture dries out completely, there is no
      significant change in compressive strength which signifies that
      the reaction product is passive and stable in air, and does not
      cause deterioration when exposed to air for longer time periods.
      Thus, in some embodiments, the air exposure duration (which is
      dependent on the pore structure that can allow moisture to escape
      from the bulk of the material) can influence the compressive
      strength at longer carbonation durations.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] FIG. 10A shows graph 1000 showing the variation in flexural
      strength of iron carbonate binders (for mixtures 1, shown as plot
      1010 and mixture 2, shown as plot 1020) with an increase in
      carbonation duration. As shown, in some embodiments, the flexural
      strengths are very similar for both the mixtures, which is
      consistent with the trends for compressive strength. Further, a
      carbonation duration of six days can result in a relatively high
      flexural strength of about 8 MPa. In comparison, typical OPC-based
      systems demonstrate a flexural strength of 3-4 MPa. Therefore, in
      some embodiments of the invention, the increased flexural strength
      of the binder compositions provides options for several
      applications that require improved flexural properties (such as
      beams, pavement slabs, and the like). FIG. 10B shows a graph 1050
      with the relationship between flexural strength and density for
      mixture 1 (shown as plot 1052) and mixture 2 (shown as 1051). In
      some embodiments, higher carbonation durations results in more
      reaction product formation and increased density as the reaction
      product fills the pores more efficiently. Further, in some
      embodiments, the iron-based binder paste is only about 20-25%
      denser that common Portland cement-based pastes. In some
      embodiments, concretes that contain about 70% aggregates by
      volume, the density differences drops down to about 10%.<br>
      <br>
      [0075] In some embodiments, thermo-gravimetric analysis was
      performed on powdered samples extracted from the surface and core
      of cylindrical specimens prepared from various binder compositions
      disclosed herein to investigate the degree of reaction responsible
      for differences in mechanical properties. The thermal analysis
      results of mixtures 2 and 6 were compared in order to understand
      the differences in product constitution between samples with the
      best and worst compressive strength. FIG. 11A shows a plot 1100
      including thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric
      (DTG) curves corresponding to the core and surface of mixture 2
      (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8% limestone, 10%
      metakaolin), carbonated for 3 days. For example, plot 1105 shows
      data for the surface of mixture 2, and plot 1110 shows the data
      for the core of mixture 2. The corresponding DTG curves are shown
      as plots 1107, 1112. Further, FIG. 11B shows a plot 1150 including
      thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric curves
      corresponding to the core and surface of mixture 6 (comprising 65%
      iron powder, 15% fly ash, 8% limestone, 10% metakaolin),
      carbonated for 3 days in accordance with some embodiments of the
      invention. For example, plot 1155 shows data for the surface of
      mixture 2, and plot 1160 shows the data for the core of mixture 2.
      The corresponding DTG curves are shown as plots 1157, 1162.<br>
      <br>
      [0076] A comparison of FIGS. 11A and 11B suggests that the total
      weight loss for mixture 2 is significantly higher than that for
      mixture 6, indicating that in some embodiments, the overall degree
      of reaction and product formation is lower under the chosen
      carbonating conditions for the starting material combination of
      mixture 6. Further, in some embodiments, the total weight loss of
      the sample from the surface of mixture 6 cylinder is slightly
      lower than the weight loss from the core sample of mixture 2. This
      shows that the constitution of mixture 6 is not reactively
      sensitive to desirable levels of carbonation and product
      formation, which reflects in the compressive strength of the
      binder. This observation also indicates that in some embodiments,
      the carbonation efficiency and mechanical properties of iron
      carbonate binders are very sensitive to the overall starting
      material composition. From a compositional viewpoint, the
      differences between mixtures 2 and 6 are not very large (the range
      of iron powder contents that provided reasonable strengths were
      between about 60% and about 69%). In some embodiments, the DTG
      curves include three distinct peaks for the binder samples. In
      some embodiments, the peak at around 110° C. can be attributed to
      evaporable water, and the peak at around 300° C. can be attributed
      to products belonging to the carbonate-oxalate-cancrinite group.
      In some embodiments, and the peak at around 740° C. can be
      attributed to calcium carbonate. The DTG curve for mixture 2 shows
      a strong, distinct peak at about 300° C. (for samples from both
      the core and the surface) whereas the intensity of the peak
      reduces for samples from mixture 6. The peak is almost
      non-existent for the sample from the core of mixture 6, indicating
      that in some embodiments, the carbonation efficiency for that
      mixture constitution is low.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] Further, in some embodiments, the effect of carbonation
      duration on reaction product formation can be evaluated for one or
      more of the binder compositions described herein. For example,
      FIG. 12A illustrates thermal analysis results 1200 of samples from
      mixture 2 (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash, 8% limestone,
      10% metakaolin) carbonated for 1 day, where samples were exposed
      to air for 3 days after carbonation. For example, plot 1205 shows
      thermogravimetric data for surface, and plot 1210 shows
      thermogravimetric data for core, with DTG plots shown as 1207,
      1212 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] FIG. 12B illustrates thermal analysis results 1225 of
      samples from mixture 2 (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash,
      8% limestone, 10% metakaolin) carbonated for 2 days, where samples
      were exposed to air for 3 days after carbonation in accordance
      with some embodiments of the invention. For example, plot 1230
      shows thermogravimetric data for surface, and plot 1235 shows
      thermogravimetric data for core, with DTG plots shown as 1232,
      1237 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] FIG. 12C illustrates thermal analysis results 1250 of
      samples from mixture 2 (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash,
      8% limestone, 10% metakaolin) carbonated for 3 days, where samples
      were exposed to air for 3 days after carbonation. For example,
      plot 1255 shows thermogravimetric data for surface, and plot 1260
      shows thermogravimetric data for core, with DTG plots shown as
      1257, 1262 respectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] FIG. 12D illustrates thermal analysis results 1275 of
      samples from mixture 2 (comprising 60% iron powder, 20% fly ash,
      8% limestone, 10% metakaolin) carbonated for 4 days, where samples
      were exposed to air for 3 days after carbonation in accordance
      with some embodiments of the invention. For example, plot 1280
      shows thermogravimetric data for surface, and plot 1285 shows
      thermogravimetric data for core, with DTG plots shown as 1282,
      1287 respectively. In some embodiments, the peak at 110° C. in the
      thermal analysis plot (due to evaporation of water) reduces in
      magnitude with increases in carbonation duration (especially after
      2 days of carbonation), whereas the peak at 300° C. (attributable
      to carbonate-oxalate cancrinite group materials) increases in
      magnitude significantly when the carbonation period is increased.
      Further, it can be observed that the difference in final weight
      loss between surface and core reduces as the carbonation duration
      is increased. In some embodiments, this indicates that CO2
      diffusion extends to the core with an increase in exposure
      duration as expected. After 4 days (the data shown in FIG. 12D),
      it can be observed that there is virtually no difference in the
      thermogravimetric and differential thermogravimetric signatures
      between the core and the surface indicating that complete
      carbonation can be achieved in these samples. These results are a
      function of specimen size, constitution, and the carbonating
      environment. While the thermal signatures indicate similar levels
      of carbonation in the core and surface of these samples, in some
      embodiments, the iron particles are not completely converted into
      iron carbonates. Moreover, as the reaction products form around
      these particles and the moisture content in the specimens drop,
      the ionic diffusion coefficient decreases and the reaction becomes
      extremely slow.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] Carbonation duration-dependent mass loss patterns can be
      further examined in FIGS. 13A and 13B. For example, FIG. 13A
      illustrates a plot 1300 of the effect of carbonation duration on
      mass loss in the 250-400° C. range in thermogravimetric analysis
      with core data 1310 and surface data 1305, and FIG. 13B
      illustrates a plot 1350 of the effect of carbonation duration on
      the amount of CaCO3 remaining in the 250-400° C. range in
      thermogravimetric analysis with surface data 1355 and core data
      1360. In some embodiments, the carbonation degree is shown to
      increase with carbonation duration, with a significant increase in
      reaction product formation in the specimen core between 2 and 3
      days of CO2 exposure. In some embodiments, the mass loss observed
      in the 650-800° C. range corresponds to thermal decomposition of
      calcium carbonate (from the added limestone) into calcium oxide.
      In some embodiments, the amount of calcium carbonate remaining in
      the system can be calculated based on the stoichiometry of the
      thermal decomposition reaction of calcium carbonate. In some
      embodiments, the percentage of unreacted calcium carbonate present
      in the system for various carbonation durations (shown in FIG.
      13B) illustrates a significant difference in the amount of
      unreacted CaCO3 between the core and the surface in the first two
      days of carbonation. However, in some embodiments, this difference
      is reduced as the carbonation period is increased to 3 to 4 days.
      In some embodiments, the amount of unreacted CaCO3 is generally
      the same at the specimen surface at all carbonation durations as
      can be observed from FIG. 13B. In some embodiments, as carbonation
      proceeds, the amount of CaCO3 remaining in the core drops because
      of the consumption of some limestone in the reaction product
      formation. In some embodiments of the invention, between two and
      three days, there is a reduction in the amount of calcium
      carbonates present in the core, which corresponds to the increase
      in the amount of carbonate complex (shown in FIG. 13A). Thus in
      some embodiments, it can be inferred that some portion of calcium
      carbonate is utilized to form the carbonate-oxalate complex, and
      the remaining unreacted limestone is decomposed in that
      temperature range. In some embodiments, this can be evidenced by
      the fact that the thermal analysis study confirms a substantially
      similar degree of carbonation of core and surface after 4 days of
      carbonation, restricting the upper limit of carbonation duration
      to 4 days.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] As evidenced by the results described herein, in some
      embodiments, the compressive strength of binder compositions
      described herein can be significantly influenced by the fly ash
      content. In some embodiments, while limestone in the chosen range
      did not influence the strength at lower fly ash contents,
      synergistic effects were evident at higher fly ash contents.
      Further, in some embodiments, metakaolin primarily influenced the
      processing of the binder by providing cohesion to the mixtures,
      and generally improving the process rheology. Moreover, in some
      embodiments, CO2 exposure duration and air curing duration were
      also found to be influential on the mechanical properties of the
      one or more binder compositions. In some embodiments, the effect
      of air exposure time on compressive strength was found to be
      negligible at lower levels of carbonation (1-2 days), although the
      sensitivity increased significantly at higher carbonation
      durations (3-4 days). Thermo-gravimetric analysis showed that in
      some embodiments, the carbonation efficiency of iron carbonate
      binders is very sensitive to the overall starting material
      composition. Further, in some embodiments, the difference in mass
      loss between surface and core reduced significantly as the CO2
      diffusion is extended to the core with an increase in carbonation
      duration. In some embodiments, the distinct differential
      thermogravimetric analysis peak at 300° C., common for
      carbonate-oxalate cancrinite group materials, was evident in the
      signals from one or more of the disclosed binder compositions.
      Further, in some embodiments, the mass loss in the temperature
      range of 250-400° C. increased as the carbonation duration
      increased, indicating the formation of more carbonate-bearing
      binding products. Further, in some embodiments, calcium carbonate
      content in the specimen core decreased when the carbonation was
      increased, that in some embodiments, indicates the consumption of
      limestone in reaction product formation. Moreover, the results
      indicate that reaction product formation increases as the
      carbonation progresses, which in some embodiments, can result in a
      denser structure that can possess improved mechanical properties.<br>
