        <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
          The Atlas Power Ascender, now known in the U.S. Military as
          the APA, is a powerful tool that enables “reverse rappelling”
          up buildings and other vertical surfaces at unprecedented
          speeds.<br>
          <br>
          Using Atlas Devices' patented rope interaction design, the
          lightweight APA can pull a fully-loaded soldier or firefighter
          up a rappelling line at up to 10 ft/sec, as well as tow
          vehicles and even remotely move equipment and casualties.<br>
          <br>
          With the capability to reach the top of a building or cliff in
          only seconds, new advantages are gained in urban warfare,
          rescue operations, industrial access, and beyond.<br>

      <br>
      Nathan "Nate" Ball's passion for invention was coursing through
      his veins long before he could define the word. He recalls digging
      up the family garden at two years old to build, wreck and rebuild
      mud dams and underground forts. In fourth grade he created a
      bottle-rocket launcher that shot two-liter bottles of water 100
      feet skyward. This was followed by a hovercraft powered by a
      vacuum cleaner motor that he constructed in sixth grade.<br>
      <br>
      By the time Ball was in the eighth grade, he was attempting to
      build a Tesla coil in his parent's garage, making capacitors out
      of glass bottles and aluminum foil. "I saw Tesla coils on the
      Internet shooting lightening," said Ball. "It was the coolest
      thing I'd ever seen, and I knew I had to build one."<br>
      <br>
      Amazingly, Ball never touched a machine tool until he reached
      college. He credits limited resources during his formative years
      to his ability to think unconventionally about problems and
      engineer efficient solutions.<br>
      <br>
      Now 23, Ball is pursuing his Master of Science in Mechanical
      Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and
      intends to graduate in 2007. He earned his Bachelor of Science in
      Mechanical Engineering from MIT in 2005.<br>
      <br>
      He currently researches his master's thesis at MIT's
      BioInstrumentation Laboratory, which is run by his advisor,
      Hatsopoulos Professor of Mechanical Engineering Ian W. Hunter.
      Under Hunter and Research Scientist Andrew Taberner, another
      advisor, Ball was challenged to use the lab's novel Lorentz-force
      actuator to create a dual-action, rapid-fire delivery technology
      that increased drug volume delivery, which he created within two
      months.<br>
      <br>
      Now awaiting livestock trials, Ball and his colleagues anticipate
      the needle-free injection technology having applications in animal
      husbandry, and they hope it may someday be employed for safe,
      inexpensive, mass inoculation of humans in developing and
      developed countries. Commercialization of the work is funded in
      part by partner Norwood Abbey, Inc. of Melbourne, Australia.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, in 2004, Ball founded Atlas Devices, LLC with three
      other mechanical engineering students at MIT to develop and
      commercialize the ATLAS Powered Rope Ascender, which uses a
      rope-handling mechanism conceived by Ball. This portable device
      can raise more than 250 pounds at 10 feet per second, giving
      rescuers, emergency personnel and soldiers faster and more
      controllable climbing capabilities. The U.S. Army recently awarded
      funding for their invention.<br>
      <br>
      Ball is a co-applicant of six patents and the co-author of
      numerous peer-reviewed articles. His awards and achievements
      include the SAIC Award in the 2005 Soldier Design Competition,
      sponsored by the Institute for Soldier Nanotechnologies at MIT,
      for his team's ATLAS Powered Rope Ascender. He also won the Luis
      DeFlorez Award for outstanding ingenuity and creativity from MIT's
      Department of Mechanical Engineering in 2005 for an electric
      scooter.<br>
      <br>
      Inspired by his mother, who is a music teacher, and father, who is
      an engineer, Ball also enjoys sharing his passion for science and
      invention with others. In February 2007, Ball will be featured as
      a mentor to eight budding engineers as co-host of PBS’s new series
      "Design Squad." The show aims to excite middle-school students
      about science and engineering by combining elements of reality TV
      with fun and educational engineering challenges. Additionally,
      Ball also mentors fifth grade boys in science and engineering at
      Fletcher Maynard Academy in Cambridge, Mass.<br>
      <br>
      Ball is a native of Newport, Oregon where he was raised with his
      two sisters. He is a two-time NCAA All-American pole-vaulter and
      MIT’s indoor/outdoor record holder in the sport (16' 6" indoor,
      16' 8 ¾" outdoor). He currently serves as the school's head pole
      vault coach.<br>
      <br>
      Ball is also trained in classical piano. For fun, he enjoys
      playing jazz keyboard and beat-boxing.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Nathan Ball's inventions include
        a device to "fly" to tops of buildings and another to
        significantly improve mass inoculations</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (February 14, 2007) – The ability to leap tall
      buildings in a single bound used to be the stuff of comic-book
      fantasy. Nathan Ball, a 23-year-old graduate student at the
      Massachusetts Institute of Technology and this year’s winner of
      the $30,000 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize, has invented a device that
      makes the fantasy a reality.<br>
      <br>
      With the help of Ball's ATLAS Powered Rope Ascender, a fully
      loaded firefighter could reach the top of a 30-story building in
      only 30 seconds, compared to the six minutes or more it often
      takes to trudge up stairs with 80 to 100 pounds of equipment. The
      device, which is the size of a hand-held power tool, can lift a
      250-pound load more than 600 feet into the air at nearly 10 feet
      per second, all on a single battery charge.<br>
      <br>
      "Ingenuity, creativity and passion seem to course through Nate's
      blood," said Merton Flemings, director of the Lemelson-MIT
      Program, which sponsors the annual award. "His battery-powered
      rope ascender and needle-free injection technology both have
      life-saving capabilities and many commercial applications."<br>
      <br>
      "Nate is also an inspiring and committed mentor for young
      inventors. This combination of attributes made him our top choice
      for this year’s $30,000 Lemelson-MIT Student Prize," Flemings
      added.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Up, Up and Away!</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In November 2004, Ball and three colleagues entered the Soldier
      Design Competition sponsored by the MIT Institute for Soldier
      Nanotechnologies. The competition called for a high-powered device
      to enable rapid vertical mobility.<br>
      <br>
      Ball called the challenge unprecedented, as the original
      specifications called for a device that weighed less than 25
      pounds and could lift 250 pounds 50 feet into the air, in five
      seconds. "That's more than five horsepower in a 25-pound package,"
      he explained. "That's a power-to-weight ratio higher than a Dodge
      Viper's — we did the math. To have that much power in that small
      of a package is a heck of a challenge."<br>
      <br>
      Through a combination of resourcefulness and "the highest-tech
      equipment we could afford," such as drill batteries and a few
      high-power density motors, Ball and his colleagues invented a
      device that could hoist 250 pounds of weight 50 feet into the air
      in seven seconds — only two seconds slower than the competition's
      specification.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The novel aspect of the ATLAS
        ascender is its rope-handling mechanism. Similar to the way an
        anchor is raised and lowered on a ship, the device relies on the
        capstan effect, which produces a tighter grip each consecutive
        time a rope is wrapped around a cylinder. The grip continues to
        tighten as more weight is applied to the line.</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      In his design, a standard-sized rope (between three-eighths and
      five-eighths of an inch) is weaved between a series of specially
      configured rollers that sit on top of a turning spindle. As the
      battery-powered spindle rotates, it continuously pulls rope
      through the device. "We currently have three patents pending for
      the rope interaction and other iterations on the device" said
      Ball.<br>
      <br>
      Ball and his colleagues founded Atlas Devices, LLC to develop and
      market the ATLAS Powered Rope Ascender. He has upgraded the
      original design, and the device is now powered by high-density,
      lithium-ion batteries created by A123Systems. Ball said the new
      power system immediately dropped the device's weight by several
      pounds and significantly increased its speed.<br>
      <br>
      "The latest configuration weighs 20 pounds and peaks at 10 feet
      per second," he said. "A123Systems has a 150-foot steam tower we
      were able to use for testing. We successfully completed a 100-foot
      continuous ascent to the tower’s platform in 14 seconds."<br>
      <br>
      Ball envisions his invention having practical applications in
      rescue work, recreational climbing and cave exploration, as well
      as urban warfare situations. "It can help people complete tasks
      more efficiently and without depleting energy they would otherwise
      use climbing ladders and carrying heavy gear," he said.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Hit Me With Your Best Shot</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Another of Ball's stand-out inventions is an improvement in the
      needle-free injection technology developed at MIT's
      BioInstrumentation Laboratory. Under the direction of his advisors
      Ian W. Hunter and Andrew Taberner in the BioInstrumentation
      Laboratory, Ball was challenged to use the lab's novel
      Lorentz-force actuator to create a dual-action, rapid-fire
      delivery technology that increased drug volume delivery.<br>
      <br>
      Within two months, he had not only come up with a solution to the
      problem, but had built and tested a prototype device.<br>
      <br>
      "Nate's achievement is simply breathtaking and will have
      potentially a huge impact on drug delivery and, hence,
      healthcare," said Ball's advisor Professor Hunter.<br>
      <br>
      Now awaiting livestock trials, Ball and his colleagues anticipate
      the needle-free injection technology having applications in animal
      husbandry. Beyond that, they hope the device may someday be
      employed for safe, inexpensive, mass inoculation of humans in
      developing and developed countries. Commercialization of the work
      is funded in part by partner Norwood Abbey, Inc. of Melbourne,
      Australia.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Inventor, Student, Reality-Show
        Host</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Ball's interest in invention does not stop with his own creations;
      he also dedicates himself to mentoring and advising aspiring
      inventors.<br>
      <br>
      "Coming from a family of teachers and having such strong support
      from my parents, I felt it imperative to share that with other
      young inventors," he said. "My parents helped me find my passion
      early in life and instilled in me a way to maintain it. To help
      other young inventors discover science is amazing and watching
      their first moment of discovery is very rewarding."<br>
      <br>
      Ball has been deeply involved as a technical advisor and co-host
      of "Design Squad," a new engineering-based reality show for kids
      ages 9-13 that will air nationally on PBS beginning in February
      2007. He helped brainstorm and test challenge ideas that he said
      would "require clever problem solving, ingenuity, and some classic
      mess-making." Ball hopes that through this program, kids will be
      empowered to explore and embrace the elements of engineering that
      surround them each day.<br>

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      A device capable of pulling an object (e.g., a person) by or up a
      tensioning member (e.g., a rope) is provided. The device can be
      configured to mate to any location of the tensioning member, and
      subsequently interface with a rotational power source (such a
      mechanical drill). Once interfaced, an output of the rotational
      energy source can be rotationally coupled to a rotating drum of
      the device wherein the drum is in communication with the
      tensioning member. With the addition of power, the drum(s) can
      pull the tensioning member through the device and allow for a
      continuous force to be applied to an object attached to the device
      or attached to the tensioning member. The use of such a convenient
      and low-cost power source allows for an economic, portable, and
      simple to use device capable of lifting and/or pulling heavy
      loads.<br>

      [0004] Winches are typically used to lift heavy loads or pull
      loads across horizontal obstacles. Winches are either motor-driven
      or hand powered and utilize a drum around which a wire rope (i.e.
      metal cable) or chain is wound. Manually lifting or pulling heavy
      objects is not a viable option due to the strength required to
      lift or pull such objects. Often, fatigue and injury result from
      manually lifting or pulling such objects. This is why winches are
      used; they possess massive pulling and towing capabilities, and
      can serve well for handling heavy objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] However, winches are limited in their usefulness for
      several reasons. First, the cable or rope is fixed permanently to
      the drum, which limits the maximum pull distance and restricts the
      towing medium to only that rope or cable. Second, the winch must
      be permanently or semi-permanently fixed to a solid structure to
      be used, limiting its placement and usability. Third, controlled
      release of tension is not a capability of many winches, further
      limiting usability.<br>
      [0006] As such, there is a need in the art for a versatile,
      portable, low cost, and easy to use device capable of lifting or
      pulling a load a desired distance and/or height.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0007] The presently disclosed embodiments provide devices capable
      of lifting or pulling an object (e.g., a person) up or along a
      tensioning member (e.g., a rope). More specifically, the device is
      capable of mating to any location of the tensioning member thereby
      eliminating the need to thread an end of the tensioning member
      through the device, and the device is further capable of being
      powered by a rotational power source (portable or fixed) such as a
      mechanical drill. The use of such a convenient and low-cost power
      source allows for an economic, simple to use, and easy to carry,
      portable device capable of lifting and/or pulling heavy loads.
      Various aspects of the device are disclosed below.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In one aspect, the device includes an input for rotational
      power wherein the input includes an interface capable of removably
      engaging a rotational power source. The rotational power source
      can be any device (portable or fixed) capable of supplying a
      rotational power to the device. For example, the rotational power
      source can include a mechanical power drill, a hand crank, an air
      wrench, or any device having a mechanically powered rotating
      shaft. Additionally, the device can include a physical attachment
      capable of attaching the device to the rotational power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] The device can further include a rope pulling mechanism
      which includes at least one rotating drum (or a plurality of
      rotating drums) having a longitudinal axis and a circumference,
      and a guide mechanism configured to receive a tensioning member
      (e.g., a rope). The guide mechanism can be further configured to
      guide the tensioning member onto, around at least a portion of the
      circumference of, and off of the rotating drum as the drum
      rotates. In one embodiment, the longitudinal axis of the rotating
      drum is parallel with a longitudinal axis of the tensioning member
      thereby allowing the drum to act, in general, as a capstan. In
      another embodiment, a plurality of rotating drums can be utilized
      wherein the longitudinal axis of each drum is substantially
      perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the tensioning member
      thereby allowing the drums to act, in general, as a pulley system.
      In an exemplary embodiment, an outer surface of the rotating drum
      has a surface characterized by a anisotropic friction.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In any of these embodiments, the rotating drum(s) can be
      configured to receive an output (i.e., a rotating force) from an
      engaged rotational power source capable of rotating the drum at a
      desired speed. In response to the output of the rotational power
      source, the rotating drum can continuously pull the tensioning
      member through the device. The device can couple the rotating drum
      to the output of the rotational power source via a gear box, or
      the rotating drum can be coupled directly to the rotational power
      source.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] The device can include various safety features capable of
      locking the device at a desired position along the length of the
      tensioning member. For example, the device can include a gearbox
      having a worm gear, and/or the device can include a cam-lock
      positioned at various locations of the device and in communication
      with the tensioning member.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Additionally, the device can further include an attachment
      point capable of attaching an object to the device. For example,
      the object can be a person (in the case of lifting a person along
      a length of the tensioning member), or the object can be a
      non-movable object (such as in the case of utilizing the device as
      a portable winch).<br>
      <br>
      [0013] In another aspect, the device can include a rope pulling
      mechanism including a rotating drum wherein the rope pulling
      mechanism can be coupled to a tensioning member at any position
      along a length of the tensioning member thereby eliminating the
      need to thread an end of the tensioning member through the device.
      Further, the device can include an input for rotational power
      which includes an interface capable of removably engaging a
      rotational power source. The input can further be configured to
      couple an output of the rotational power source (i.e., a
      rotational power) to the rope pulling mechanism thereby enabling
      the device to apply a tension to the tensioning member in response
      to an output from the rotational power source.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] These aspects and others will be discussed in detail below.<br>

      <br>
      [0025] The presently disclosed embodiments provide devices capable
      of lifting or pulling an object (e.g., a person) up or along a
      tensioning member (e.g., a rope). More specifically, the device is
      capable of mating to any location of any type of tensioning member
      (e.g., various types, various lengths, various diameters, etc.),
      and subsequently being interfaced with and powered by a rotational
      power source (such a mechanical drill). The use of such a
      rotational power source allows for a low cost, simple to use, easy
      to carry device capable of lifting and/or pulling heavy objects.
      In use, the device can be clipped to either a climbing harness or
      Swiss seat, or can be attached to a grounded object to act as a
      winch.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As will be discussed in detail below, the device can
      provide a smooth, controlled, continuous pull while raising (or
      lowering) an object (e.g., person). Further, the device can be
      easy and intuitive to use by minimally trained or untrained
      personnel. In order to perform various functions, the device can
      apply its pulling force both at high force levels, for portable
      winching applications, or at fast rates, for rapid vertical
      ascents. As a safety feature, the device can include a safety lock
      mechanism that prevents unwanted reverse motion of the rope or
      cable. These and other aspects of the presently disclosed device
      will be discussed in detail below.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] FIG. 1 diagrammatically illustrates an exemplary embodiment
      of the presently disclosed device 1. As shown, a rotational power
      source (e.g., a power drill) 2 can interface with the device 1.
      The rotational power source 2 can be a portable device or a fixed
      device. Typically, the rotational power source 2 can include a
      housing 2a and a drill output 2b. In an exemplary embodiment, the
      rotational power source is a mechanical drill. The ability to
      interface a low cost, every day power drill 2 to the device 1 can
      provide significant cost savings and simplicity to use of the
      device 1.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] Depending on the rotational power source 2 used to power
      the system, different pulling rates and load capabilities can be
      achieved. Also, as will be discussed below, adjusting components
      of the gearbox 3 can produce a desired pulling force. Exemplary
      embodiments of the rotational power source 2 include a DeWalt 36V
      cordless hammer drill, p/n DC900KL, the DeWalt 36V cordless rotary
      hammer, p/n DC232KL, or the DeWalt 36V cordless impact wrench, p/n
      DC800KL, all as powered by 36V high-power Lithium Ion battery
      packs, manufactured by A123 Systems, Inc, of Watertown, Mass. The
      extremely high power to weight ratio (3000 W/kg) of these battery
      packs makes the DeWalt 36V cordless tools allows for high loads
      and high pulling rates, and allows for maximum versatility as a
      cordless power tool. In alternative embodiments, the rotational
      power source 2 can include the 24V Panasonic cordless rotary
      hammer, p/n EY6813NQKW, or other 28V, 24V, 18V, 14.4V or 12V
      cordless drill systems. Those skilled in the art will appreciate
      that various other power drills are within the spirit and scope of
      the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Various other types of rotational power sources 2 can be
      utilized by the presently disclosed device. For example, the
      rotational power source 2 can be a hand crank, an air wrench,
      rotary saw, rotary hammer, or any device having a rotating shaft.
      As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, various other
      rotational power sources are within the spirit and scope of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The output of the rotational power source 2 can be coupled
      to a rotating drum 8 of the device 1. The output of the rotational
      power source 2 is the rotating shaft of the rotating power source
      2. As such, coupling the output of the rotational power source to
      the rotating drum provides a rotating force to the rotating drum.
      FIG. 1 illustrates an exemplary embodiment wherein the output is
      coupled to the rotating drum via a gear box 3. As will be
      appreciated by those skilled in the art, the gears of the gearbox
      3 can be selected in order to provided a desired force from the
      rotational power source 2 to the rotating drums 8 (and ultimately
      to the tensioning member 6). The rotational coupling between the
      rotational power source 2 and the gearbox 3 can be accomplished
      via the chuck of the rotational power source 2, or by various
      other means known in the art. In an alternative embodiment, as
      shown in FIG. 2, the rotational power source 2 can be coupled
      directly to the rotating drum(s) 8 thereby eliminating the need
      for the gear box 3. Such coupling can be achieved via a drill
      chuck or as otherwise known in the art. Those skilled in the art
      will appreciate that the rotating drum(s) 8 of the device 1 can be
      mated to the output of the rotational power source 2 in a variety
      of manners and remain within the spirit and scope of the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] Next, FIG. 1 illustrates that the rotational power source 2
      additionally includes a physical attachment 5 to the device 1. The
      physical attachment 5 allows the rotational power source 2 to
      apply a directional torque to the rope pulling mechanism 4 with
      respect to the body of the rotational power source 2. Further, the
      physical attachment 5 allows for added stability and safety in
      order to ensure that the rotational power source 2 does not detach
      from the device while in use. As will be apparent to those skilled
      in the art, the physical attachment 5 can include various forms.
      For example, the physical attachment 5 can include a direct
      attachment of a drill chuck (not shown) of the rotational power
      source 2 to the device 1. Further, the rotational power source 2
      can include an extension (not shown) which can be received in a
      "key-hole" element (not shown) of the device 1 so as to lock the
      device 1 to the rotational power source. In one example, clearly
      shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, the physical attachment 5 can include a
      first circular element 5a and a second circular element 5b capable
      of encircling portions of the rotational power source 2 so as to
      maintain the rotational power source 2 in communication with the
      device 1. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, the
      physical attachment 5 of the device 1 to the rotational power
      source 2 can be accomplished in a wide variety of manners.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] FIG. 1 further diagrams the tensioning member 6 being acted
      upon by the device 1. The tensioning member 6 can include any
      elongate resilient element capable of withstand a tension. For
      example, the tensioning member 6 can include strings, ropes,
      cables, threads, fibers, filaments, etc. Furthermore, the
      tensioning member 6 can be of any diameter and/or length. Those
      skilled in the art will appreciate that various examples of such
      tensioning members 6 are within the spirit and scope of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the device 1 can include a
      tensioning member guide mechanism 9 which allows for proper
      positioning of the tensioning member 6 on the rotating drum(s).
      Once properly positioned, a rope pulling mechanism 4 can be
      activated by the rotational power source 2 to provide a controlled
      and continuous force on the tensioning member 6 thereby allowing
      for a object attached to the tensioning member 6 or,
      alternatively, an object (e.g., a person) attached to the device
      to be raised or pulled a desired distance. As will be discussed
      below, an advantage of the presently disclosed device is that the
      rope pulling mechanism 4 (including the guide mechanism 9 and
      rotating drum(s) 8) can be mated to any location of the tensioning
      member 6. As such, the present device 1 eliminates the need to
      thread an end of the tensioning member 6 into the device prior to
      use.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the device 1
      in use. As shown (see arrows), the tensioning element 6 can enter
      the device 1 and be guided into a rope pulling mechanism 4. The
      rope pulling mechanism 4 comprises a tensioning member guide
      mechanism 9 (as diagrammed in FIGS. 1 and 2) and at least one
      rotating drum 8 wherein the guide member 9 can properly position
      the tensioning member 6 onto the rotating drum(s). Next, the
      device can include an attachment point 7 capable of anchoring the
      device to a grounded body (e.g., a load when pulling a load up the
      tensioning member, or a stable body when acting as a portable
      winch). This attachment point 7 can allow all tension imposed by
      the rope pulling mechanism 4 on the tensioning member 6 to be
      relayed to the grounded body through the device 1 itself, rather
      than through the body of the rotational power source 2. In the
      embodiment of FIG. 3, the attachment point 7 can be positioned
      collinear with the tensioning element 6 and with the longitudinal
      axis of the output of the rotational power source 2 so as to
      increase the ease of use and ergonomics of the device 1. In such
      an embodiment, when the tensioning member 6 is under tension, the
      system, comprising the device 1 and rotational power source 2,
      will be suspended in a neutrally stable orientation between the
      distal end of the tensioning element 6 and the attachment point 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0035] Looking in more detail at FIG. 3, the elongate tensioning
      member 6 enters the device 1 horizontally, in accordance with the
      primary longitudinal axis of the drive of the device 1, the device
      comprising the rope pulling mechanism 4 and gearbox 3 (optional).
      The device can be further capable of receiving and mating to the
      rotational power source 2. Once the tensioning member is
      positioned and the rotational power source 2 activated, the
      tensioning member 6 can be pulled into the device 1 as indicated
      by the directional arrow. The tensioning member 6 exits the device
      1 via the rope pulling mechanism 4 in a vertical orientation. As
      indicated, the tensioning member 6 is free of any additional
      imposed tension as the member 6 leaves the device 1. Tension in
      the tensioning member 6 is relayed to ground via the attachment
      point 7. In this embodiment, the device 1 and rotational power
      source 2 can rest in a neutrally stable orientation, suspended
      between the tensioning member 6 and the attachment point 7.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] The device can additionally include various safety features
      capable of preventing the device from unwanted backward motion
      relative to the tensioning member 6. For example, the gearbox 3
      can include a worm gear. As will be appreciated by those skilled
      in the art, if the gearbox 3 includes a worm gear on the input
      side which is coupled to a spur or other gear as part or all of
      the output side of the gearbox 3, the device 1 will not be
      back-drivable, meaning the rope pulling mechanism 4 will remain
      locked to all imposed tension in the system even if the rotational
      power source 2 is removed. As will be discussed in relation to
      FIG. 8, the capability to disengage the rotational power source 2
      from the device 1 while leaving the device 1 under tension enables
      multiple devices 1 to be utilized in tandem, all powered by moving
      the rotational power source 2 from device to device, increasing
      the tension in each respective tensioning member 6 along the way.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] As a further safety feature, equal facility for locking the
      device 1 against back-tension may be enabled by placing a
      frictional cam-lock 10 where the tensioning member 6 enters the
      device 1. This cam-lock 10 utilizes self-help to increase gripping
      force against the tensioning member 6 in response to increased
      tension, thereby locking the tensioning member 6 against movement
      out of the device 1, and allowing movement into the device 1 as
      depicted by the arrow. As will be appreciated by those skilled in
      the art, the cam-lock 10 can also be placed at different locations
      in the device 1, such as after the rope pulling mechanism 4, with
      the same functionality being enabled. Furthermore, those skilled
      in the art will appreciate that various other safety/locking
      devices can be incorporated in the device 1 while remaining within
      the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0038] FIG. 4 depicts an alternative embodiment of the device with
      a rearranged component configuration. As shown, the tensioning
      member 6 can enter the device 1 vertically, in accordance with the
      directional arrow. The tensioning member 6 then can exit the rope
      pulling mechanism 4 and device 1 vertically and without tension,
      in accordance with the second directional arrow. Tensile force
      imposed by the rope pulling mechanism 4 on the tensioning member 6
      can be relayed through the device 1 to the attachment point 7'
      which can provide an anchor to a grounded body, and which may be
      oriented collinear with the taut side of the tensioning element 6,
      to allow the device 1 and rotational power source 2 to rest in a
      more usable neutral orientation during use.<br>
      <br>
      [0039] As described above, the rope pulling mechanism 4 of the
      device 1 is capable of engaging and pulling the tensioning member
      6 through the device. Various exemplary embodiments of the rope
      pulling mechanism 4 are described in U.S. Provisional Patent
      Application 60/717,343, filed September 2005, entitled "Powered
      Rope Ascender and Portable Rope Pulling Device," and U.S. patent

      utilizing an exemplary embodiment of the rope pulling mechanism as
      disclosed in the above-identified incorporated applications. As
      shown, the rope pulling mechanism includes a rotating drum 8 and a
      guide mechanism 9. The rotating drum 8 includes a longitudinal
      axis and a circumference wherein the longitudinal axis is
      positioned substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the
      tensioning member thereby allowing the drum 8 to act, in general,
      as a capstan. Further, the guide member 9 is configured to receive
      the tensioning member 6, and further configured to guide the
      tensioning member 6 onto, around at least a portion of the
      circumference of, and off of the rotating drum 8.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] FIGS. 6A and 6B show views of an exemplary embodiment of
      the rotating drum. In this embodiment, the operation of a rope
      pulling device 1 can be aided by designing the surface of the
      rotating drum 8 to have anisotropic friction properties. In
      particular, the drum can be designed to have a high friction
      coefficient in a direction substantially about its circumference
      and a lower friction coefficient in a substantially longitudinal
      direction. In an exemplary embodiment, the rotating drum is a
      cylinder; however, as will be apparent to those skilled in the
      art, various other shapes can be used and are meant to be
      encompassed by the word "drum". As shown in FIG. 6A, the surface
      of the drum 8 can include longitudinal splines to create this
      anisotropic friction effect. In this embodiment, a cylinder,
      preferably constructed of aluminum or another lightweight metal or
      material, is extruded to include the illustrated longitudinal
      splines. More specifically, as clearly shown in FIG. 6B, the
      rotating drum 8 can include longitudinal shaped-shaped splines 20
      and a hole for a shaft with a keyway cutout 24. Forming the
      longitudinal splines as shaped features angled into the direction
      of motion of the rotating drum 8 further enhances the friction
      between the rope and the drum. Additionally, various
      weight-reducing holes 22 can also be utilized to minimize weight
      of the entire device.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] FIG. 7 shows an alternative embodiment wherein the rope
      pulling mechanism 4 can include a plurality of rotating drums 8,
      generally acting in the manner of pulleys, which interact with the
      tensioning member 6 to pull the tensioning member 6 through the
      device 1. As shown, the longitudinal axis of the rotating drums 8
      are positioned substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal
      axis of the tensioning member 6. In this embodiment, the output of
      the gearbox 3 is coupled rotationally to at least one of the
      rotating drums 8. When an initial tension is imposed on the
      tensioning member 6, either by the working load or by the rope
      pulling mechanism 4, a partial or full wrap of the tensioning
      member 6 around each drum 8 provides an amplified tensile force
      due to the capstan effect, and thereby increases the frictional
      force between the rotating drums 8 and the tensioning member 6.
      Alternatively, the output of the drill 2 can be rotationally
      coupled directly to one or more of the rotating drums 8 without
      going through an additional gearbox 3.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the
      various embodiments of the device can allow for a variety of uses.
      For example, in one embodiment, the object can be attached to the
      distal end of the tensioning element 6 with the attachment point 7
      of the device 1 anchored to a grounded point, thus pulling the
      object toward the stationary device 1. In an alternative
      embodiment, the object can be connected to the attachment point 7
      of the device 1, with the distal end of the tensioning element 6
      being fixed to a grounded point, in operation thereby pulling the
      device 1 and its load along the tensioning element 6 toward the
      fixed distal end. As such, the device 1 and rotational power
      source 2 can be suspended in a stable orientation between the
      distal end of the tensioning element 6 and the attachment point 7,
      regardless of the relative orientation of those two points. This
      allows loads to be pulled horizontally, vertically, or at any
      angle in between, with the weight of the rotational power source 2
      imposing minimal off-axis moments to the tensioning element 6, and
      thereby positioning the device 1 and rotational power source 2
      suspended in an orientation of higher ergonomic usability to the
      operator.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] As briefly mentioned above, while in use, the device 1 can
      be disengaged from the rotational power source 2 while keeping a
      desired tension on the tensioning member 6. FIG. 8 shows such an
      embodiment wherein the tension between the tensioning member 6 and
      the ground 11 can be maintained due to the restriction of backward
      motion of the tensioning member 6 by either a cam-lock 10 or by a
      non-backdrivable gearbox 3 (each discussed above). The
      functionality enabled by this configuration is such that multiple
      devices 1 can be used in tandem with the same rotational power
      source 2 moving between devices 1 to increase tension sequentially
      in multiple tensioning members 6, such as in tent guys, or truck
      tie-downs.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that
      the configurations described above are not the only configurations
      that can employ the principles of the invention. The system and
      method described above, utilizing a rope pulling mechanism
      comprising a rotating drum and a rope guide mechanism, powered by
      a rotational power source such as a motorized drill or other
      rotational device, can be practically employed in various other
      configurations. As such, any configuration or placement of all the
      parts, rotational power source, gearbox, and rotating drum/guide
      assembly with relation to one another could be deployed by a
      person of ordinary skill in keeping with the principles of the
      invention. Additionally, various components can be added or
      subtracted to the device and/or system while remaining within the
      spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] The lifting and pulling of heavy objects is a wide-ranging
      task inherent in many endeavors, commercial, domestic, military,
      and recreational. The presently disclosed device, a portable rope
      pulling and climbing device, can solve many problems associated
      with using current lifting and pulling technology, including but
      not limited to: accommodating multiple types and diameters of

      tensioning member without threading a free end through the device,
      and being capable of providing a smooth continuous pull.
      Furthermore, the presently disclosed embodiments provide a device

      rescue, manufacturing, military, and other applications.<br>
      <br>

      A device for pulling an elongate member includes a powered
      rotational motor having an output and a rotating drum connected to
      the output of said rotational motor where the rotating drum has a
      longitudinal axis and a circumference. The device further includes
      a guide mechanism for guiding the resilient elongate element onto,
      around at least a portion of the circumference of, and off of, the
      rotating drum. When the powered rotational motor turns the
      rotating drum, the rotating drum thereby continuously pulls the
      resilient elongate element through the device<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">FIELD OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] This invention relates to devices for moving an object by
      pulling on an elongate element to which the object is attached.
      More particularly, the invention relates to a device that can lift
      or pull heavy objects by pulling on a rope or cable.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0003] Winches are typically used to lift heavy loads or pull
      loads across horizontal obstacles. Winches are either motor-driven
      or hand powered and utilize a drum around which a wire rope (i.e.
      metal cable) or chain is wound. Manually lifting or pulling heavy
      objects is not a viable option due to the strength required to
      lift or pull such objects. Often, fatigue and injury result from
      manually lifting or pulling such objects. This is why winches are
      used; they possess massive pulling and towing capabilities, and
      can serve well for handling heavy objects.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] However, winches are limited in their usefulness for
      several reasons. First, the cable or rope is fixed permanently to
      the drum, which limits the maximum pull distance and restricts the
      towing medium to only that rope or cable. Second, the winch must
      be fixed to a solid structure to be used, limiting its placement
      and usability. Third, controlled release of tension is not a
      capability of many winches, further limiting usability.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Current technology in rope ascenders used by people for
      vertical climbing consists of passive rope ascenders which must be
      used in pairs. These rope ascenders function as a one-way rope
      clamp, to be used in pairs. By alternating which ascender bears
      the load and which ascender advances, upward motion along a rope
      can be created.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Passive ascenders such as these are severely limited in
      their usefulness for several reasons. First, they rely on the
      strength of the user for upward mobility. Thus, passive ascenders
      are not useful in rescue situations where an injured person needs
      to move up a rope. Second, the need to grip one ascender with each
      hand limits multi-tasking during an ascent because both hands are
      in use. Third, the rate and extent of an ascent are limited to the
      capabilities of the user. Fourth, the diamond grit used to grip
      the rope is often too abrasive, destroying climbing ropes for
      future use. Fifth, the type of rope to be used is limited by what
      the ascenders' one-way locks can interact properly with.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Raising heavy loads upward via cable is accomplished by
      winches pulling from above the load, or by a device such as a
      hydraulic lift that pushes from below. Passive rope ascenders are
      useless for moving a dead weight load upward along a rope. U.S.
      Pat. No. 6,488,267 to Goldberg et al., entitled "Apparatus for
      Lifting or Pulling a Load" is an apparatus which uses two passive
      ascenders along a rope with a pneumatic piston replacing the power
      a human would normally provide. Thus, this powered device is
      limited in its usefulness by the same factors mentioned above. In
      addition, the lifting capacity and rate of ascent are is limited
      by the power source that fuels the pneumatic piston.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] A further drawback of this design is that at any reasonable
      rate the load will experience a significant jerking motion in the
      upward direction during an ascent. Therefore, fragile loads will
      be at risk if this device is used.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] It is therefore an object of the present invention to
      provide an apparatus for lifting or pulling heavy loads which
      solves one or more of the problems associated with the
      conventional methods and techniques described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] It is another object of the present invention to provide an
      apparatus for lifting or pulling heavy loads which can be
      manufactured at reasonable costs.<br>
      <br>
      [0011] It would also be desirable as well to be able to attach any
      such rope pulling device to a rope at any point along that rope
      without having to thread an end of the rope or cable through the
      device. This would increase the usability of such a device
      considerably over other rope pulling and climbing devices,
      allowing for instance a user to attach himself for ascent at a
      second story window past which a rope hangs.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Other objects and advantages of the present invention will
      be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the
      ensuing description of the present invention. One or more of these
      objectives may include:<br>
      <br>
      (a) to provide a line pulling device that can handle a range of
      rope types, cables, and diameters;<br>
      <br>

      or cable to be fixed to the device;<br>

      <br>
      (e) to provide a device which is easy and intuitive to use by
      minimally trained or untrained personnel;<br>
      <br>

      unwanted reverse motion of the rope or cable;<br>
      <br>

      point without having to thread an end of the rope or cable through
      the device;<br>

      j) to provide a device that is not limited in its source of power
      to any particular type of rotational motor; and<br>
      <br>
      (k) to provide a device that is usable in and useful for
      recreation, industry, emergency, rescue, manufacturing, military,
      and any other application relating to or utilizing rope, cable,

      <br>
      [0024] Still further objects and advantages are to provide a rope
      or cable pulling device that is as easy to use as a cordless power
      drill, that can be used in any orientation, that can be easily
      clipped to either a climbing harness or Swiss seat, that can be
      just as easily attached to a grounded object to act as a winch,
      that is powered by a portable rotational motor, and that is
      lightweight easy to manufacture.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0025] The invention provides a rope or cable pulling device that
      preferably accomplishes one or more of the objects of the
      invention or solves at least one of the problems described above.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] In a first aspect, a device of the invention includes a
      powered rotational motor having an output and a rotating drum
      connected to the output of said rotational motor where the
      rotating drum has a longitudinal axis and a circumference. The
      device further includes a guide mechanism for guiding the
      resilient elongate element onto, around at least a portion of the
      circumference of, and off of the rotating drum. When the powered
      rotational motor turns the rotating drum, the rotating drum
      thereby continuously pulls the resilient elongate element through
      the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] A device of the invention can conveniently be configured as
      a portable hand-held device, and in particular, can be configured

      <br>
      [0039] Referring now to FIG. 1, a device 100 of the invention for
      pulling a resilient elongate element such as a cable or a rope 114
      is illustrated diagrammatically. The device includes a rotational
      motor 102 from which the pulling motion of the device is derived.
      A number of different types of motors, such as two or four stroke
      internal combustion engines, or ac or dc powered electric motors,
      could be employed to provide the rotational motion desired for
      pulling the rope or cable. A motor power source 104 can also be
      included that is appropriate to the rotational motor used, such as
      gasoline or other petroleum products, a fuel cell, or electrical
      energy supplied in ac (such as from a power outlet in a typical
      building) or dc (such as from a battery) form. In one preferred
      embodiment, the rotational motor is a dc electric motor and the
      motor power source is one or more rechargeable lithium ion
      batteries.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The rotational motor can also have speed control 106 and/or
      a gearbox 108 associated with it to control the speed and torque
      applied by the rotational motor to the task of pulling a rope.
      These elements can be integrated into a single, controllable,
      motor module, be provided as separate modules, or be provided in
      some combination thereof. In one embodiment, speed control
      elements can be provided integrally with a dc rotational motor,
      while a separate, modular gearbox is provided so that the gearing,
      and thus the speed and torque characteristics of the rope pulling
      device, can be altered as desired by swapping the gears.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] A rotating drum 110 is connected to the rotational motor,
      either directly or through a gearbox (if one is present). It is
      the rotating drum, generally in the manner of a capstan, that
      applies the pulling force to the rope that is pulled through the
      device 116. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the
      rotating drum provides anisotropic friction gripping 112 of the
      rope. In particular, in a preferred embodiment, the surface of the
      rotating drum has been treated so that large friction forces are
      created in the general direction of the pulling of the rope
      (substantially around the circumference of the drum), and smaller
      friction forces are created longitudinally along the drum so that
      the rope can slide along the length of the drum with relative
      ease.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] In the alternative embodiment of the rope interaction
      assembly depicted in FIGS. 9, 10 and 11, the rotating drum is
      split into sections. These sections rotate between stationary
      sections which contain guide rollers that move the rope from one
      wrap to the next. This embodiment also makes use of the splined
      drum to exploit the anisotropic friction when advancing the rope
      from each wrap to the next.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] A rope or cable is also referenced in FIG. 1. The device of
      the present invention is intended to be able to be able to pull
      any elongate resilient element that can withstand a tension.
      Cables and ropes are the most common of these, but the invention
      is not meant to be limited by the reference to ropes or cables.<br>
      <br>
      [0044] A preferred embodiment of a rope pulling device 100 of the
      invention is shown in FIGS. 2 (Isometric view), 3 (front view) and
      4 (side view). In this embodiment, rotational motor 4 applies
      rotational power to rotating drum 8 via gearbox 6. Batteries 3
      apply necessary power to motor 4. A rope handling mechanism guides
      a rope to and from the rotating drum. In particular, rope 21
      enters through rope guide 1 and continues through safety clamp 2.
      The rope is further guided tangentially onto the rotating drum 8
      by a pulley 7 and rotating guide 15. Once the rope is on the drum
      8 it is guided around the drum 8 by the rollers 9 (and non-labeled
      adjacent rollers). On the last turn, the rope passes between the
      tensioning roller 10 and the drum 8. A user attaches to the
      device, such as by a tether, at attachment point 11.<br>
      <br>
      [0045] As noted above, the operation of a rope pulling device of
      the invention can be aided by designing the surface of the
      rotating drum 8 to have anisotropic friction properties. In
      particular, the drum can be designed to have a high friction
      coefficient in a direction substantially about its circumference
      and a lower friction coefficient in a substantially longitudinal
      direction. In the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2 through 4, the
      surface of the drum is provided with longitudinal splines to
      create this anisotropic friction effect. A preferred embodiment of
      such a splined drum is shown in FIG. 5. In this embodiment, a
      cylinder, preferably constructed of aluminum or another
      lightweight metal or material, is extruded to include the
      illustrated longitudinal splines. More specifically, the rotating
      drum 8 embodiment of FIG. 5 can include longitudinal shaped-shaped
      splines 12 and a hole for a shaft with a keyway cutout 14. Forming
      the longitudinal splines as shaped features angled into the
      direction of motion of the rotating drum 8 further enhances the
      friction between the rope and the drum. A person skilled in the
      art will recognize that the drum of FIG. 5 is one preferred
      embodiment and that other features or methods of manufacture can
      be used to create the desired anisotropic friction effect.<br>
      <br>
      [0046] Weight-reducing holes 13 can also be utilized to minimize
      weight of the entire device.<br>
      <br>
      [0047] Returning now to FIGS. 2-4 to further describe the features
      and operation of this embodiment of a rope pulling device of the
      invention, rope 21 enters the device through the clip-in rope
      guide 1. As illustrated, a solid loop is provided, however, the
      rope guide 1 is preferably a carabiner-type clip into which the
      rope is pushed, rather than having to thread the rope through by
      its end. The rope then passes through the safety clamp 2, which
      allows rope to only move through the device in the tensioning
      direction.<br>
      <br>
      [0048] In the case that rope is pulled backward through the device
      by any means, the safety clamp 2 grips the rope and pinches it
      against the adjacent surface. The handle on the safety clamp 2
      allows a user to manually override that safety mechanism, by
      releasing the self-help imposed clamping force which the clamp
      applies to the rope against the body of the device. The safety
      clamp 2 is simply one as used in sailing and rock climbing, and
      uses directionally gripping surfaces along a continuously
      increasing radius to apply a stop-clamping force proportional to
      the rope tension which squeezes the rope against its guide.<br>
      <br>
      [0049] After passing through the safety clamp, the rope is wrapped
      past the pulley 7 which guides the rope tangentially to the drum.
      The set of rollers 9 folds away from the drum, allowing the user
      to wrap the rope the designated number of times around the drum
      (in this case 5). After having wrapped the rope to the specified
      spacing, the rollers 9 fold back against the drum and are locked
      in place. The tensioning roller 15 squeezes the last turn of the
      rope against the splines in order to apply tension to the free end
      of the rope. Since the capstan effect occurs as:<br>
      <br>
      T1=T2e&lt;([mu][theta])&gt; [1]<br>
      <br>
      Where T2 is the tension off the free end (exiting tensioning
      roller 15), T1 is the tension in the rope as it enters through the
      rope guide 1, [mu] is the frictional coefficient between the rope
      and the rotating drum 8, and [theta] is the amount the rope is
      wrapped around the rotating drum 8 in radians. An initial tension
      in the free end exiting roller 10 is necessary to achieve any kind
      of circumferential gripping of the rope around the capstan, i.e.
      T2 cannot be 0. By squeezing the rope against the capstan splines
      1 with the tensioning roller 10, T2 tension is created by the last
      turn as it makes a no-slip condition which is reflected back
      through each turn to achieve a large tension at the first turn,
      T1.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] Since the rope guide 1 has a clip-in and the rollers 9 and
      tensioner 10 attached to roller support 18 fold away from the drum
      via pivot 17 (a person of skill in the art will note that the
      roller support is not limited to pivotal movement-any sliding
      motion, rotation, or combination thereof can suffice to move
      roller support 18 away), loading the rope into the device does not
      require stringing a free end through the device. The device can
      thus accommodate any length of rope and can join or detach from
      the rope at any point. This is a significant advantage over
      standard winch systems which must only use the length of rope or
      cable that is already attached, and which must be confined to one
      particular position and orientation for operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] A person skilled in the art will also note that the rollers
      9 can be held from within the rotating drum 8, positioned and held
      by stationary cylindrical segments fixtured to the gearbox 6 from
      solid supports located within rotating drum 8. Rotating drum 8
      could thus be segmented with rollers 9 positioned in between
      segments of drum 8 at the same interval as in FIGS. 2-4. This
      circumvents the need for an external roller support 18, allowing
      for a elongate tensioning member to be wrapped around drum 8 and
      guided by rollers 9 roller support 18 in the way. An embodiment
      that utilizes this configuration is depicted in FIGS. 10
      (isometric view), 11 (side view), and 12 (side view including rope
      illustration).<br>
      <br>
      [0052] Longitudinal splines 12 on drum 8 improve the operation of
      the illustrated embodiment. These features create and use the
      anisotropic friction behavior along the drum which allows a wrap
      of a rope or cable to grip the drum circumferentially while moving
      readily along that drum axially. Exemplary splines 12 are jagged
      in the forward rotational direction in FIG. 5 where the
      illustrated drum is intended to apply force in a counterclockwise
      direction. The additional grip provided by the exemplary drum 8
      maximizes the capstan effect in equation [1] created by a
      tensioned cable wrapped around a drum, significantly increasing
      the circumferential gripping, while still allowing axial motion of
      the wrap along the drum. This, combined with the axial force
      applied by rollers 9, overcomes a significant problem faced by
      others attempting to use a turning capstan (cylindrical drum) to
      advance a rope while maintaining a free end.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] In a standard winch, rope is progressively built up on the
      rotating drum. If one were to attempt to maintain a free end of
      the rope and have the rope travel through the winch and exit
      continuously, a problem would arise. First, as shown by equation
      [1], without tension T2 on the free end, no pulling force can be
      applied to the rope. Additionally, since the rope grips around the
      drum circumferentially while under tension, even if T2 is
      artificially created, the rope will wrap back on itself because of
      spiraling of the wraps. Due to the uneven tension and uneven
      placement of that tension along the drum, an axial restoring force
      appears which pulls the taut first wrap (T1) toward the loose wrap
      at tensioner 10. When the rope wraps back on itself, it binds,
      preventing any further pulling.<br>
      <br>
      [0054] In the illustrated device, the rollers 9 positioned along
      the capstan provide a restoring force in the axial direction to
      keep the wraps from backing up and binding. The rotating guide 15
      applies back-force to the first (and tightest) wrap where tension
      is T1 (and therefore the most force is necessary to move that wrap
      down the drum). The splines 12 facilitate the use of the rollers 9
      and rotational guide 15 by allowing circumferential gripping and
      torque application in the correct rotational direction, while
      allowing the tensioned wraps to be moved axially along the drum as
      they enter and exit the device. While this particular embodiment
      works well as illustrated, any sort of material or feature (such
      as other edge profiles, re-cycling sliders, pivots, and rollers)
      providing similar anisotropic friction conditions could be used as
      effectively.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] An additional embodiment of the splined drum is one that
      changes diameter along its longitudinal axis in order to aid axial
      movement of wraps along its body. This could aid in the movement
      of the high-tension wraps as pushed by the rollers 9.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] This illustrated embodiment of the rope pulling device
      enables new capabilities in pulling ropes and cables at high
      forces and speeds. The embodiment described utilizes a high-power
      DC electric motor 4, as built by Magmotor Corporation of
      Worcester, Mass. (part number S28-BP400X) which possesses an
      extremely high power-to weight ratio (over 8.6 HP developed in a
      motor weighing 7 lbs). The batteries 3 utilized are 24V, 3AH
      Panasonic EY9210 B Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. The device
      incorporates a pulse-width modulating speed control, adjusted by
      squeezing the trigger 16, that proportionally changes the speed of
      the motor. This embodiment is designed to lift loads up to 250 lbs
      up a rope at a rate of 7 ft/sec. Simple reconfigurations of the
      applied voltage and gear ratio can customize the performance to
      lift at either higher rates and lower loads, or vice-versa.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Any embodiment of the design as described above can be used
      to apply continuous pulling force to flexible tensioning members
      (strings, ropes, cables, threads, fibers, filaments, etc.) of
      unlimited length. Also since the design allows for attachment to
      such a flexible tensioning member without the need of a free end,
      significant versatility is added. The design allows for a full
      range of flexible tensioning members to be utilized for a given
      rotating drum 8 diameter, further enhancing the usability of such
      a pulling device.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] A further embodiment of the invention is illustrated in
      FIGS. 6, 7 and 8. This embodiment operates on a number of the same
      simple principles as the embodiment of FIGS. 2 though 4, but
      relies on slightly different implementations of those principles.
      Rope enters the device by wrapping around the safety cam 2. This
      cam is a modified version of a Petzl Grigri rope
      belayer/descender, and uses a self-help pinching mechanism to
      prevent unwanted backward motion of a rope or cable. The handle
      allows the user to manually override that safety clamp in order to
      control a descent or back-driving of the rope through the device.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] After the safety cam 2, the rope is wrapped around the
      pulleys 7 to be guided tangentially onto the rotating drum 8
      within the spiral of the helix guide 19. The rope is wrapped
      through the turns of the helix guide 19, and the tensioning roller
      housing 20 is opened away from drum 8 to accept the rope as it
      goes through. Then the tensioning roller housing 20 is closed and
      clamped tight to the base of the helix guide S, which applies
      pressure from the tensioning roller 10 to the rope, clamping the
      rope against the tensioning drum 22.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Operation of this embodiment by a user is identical to that
      of the embodiment described above; the trigger 16 is squeezed,
      controlling the speed of the motor 4, which applies torque to the
      rotating drum 8 through the gearbox 6. The rope is gripped around
      the rotating drum 8 by the tension T1 on the rope entering the
      device, as guided by the safety cam 2 and pulleys 7, and according
      to equation [1]. The tension T2 which is necessary to make the
      device work is applied via the tensioning roller 10, as it is
      clamped by the tensioning roller housing 20. However, unlike the
      previous embodiments, instead of creating a no-slip condition to
      achieve T2, a dynamic friction is utilized to tug on the rope,
      creating the needed tension in the free end.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] This is accomplished by the tensioning drum 22 having a
      larger diameter than the rotating drum 8. Since both are attached
      to the same drive shaft out of the gearbox 6, they have the same
      rotational velocity. But because of the bigger diameter on the
      tensioning part of the drum 22, the surface velocity is greater.
      Because more turns (and the higher tension turns) in the rope are
      along the original diameter on the drum 8, rope is fed at the
      rotational velocity times the diameter of drum 8. Since the
      tensioning drum 22 has a greater diameter, it constantly slips
      against the surface of the rope. The normal force of the rope
      against drum 22 is increased by the tensioning roller, allowing
      for a greater pulling force to be created by drum 22. Thus, the
      dynamic friction against the last turn of the rope creates a
      constant T2 which is the basis for the operation of the device, as
      per equation [1].<br>
      <br>
      [0062] The problem of the rope wrapping back on itself is solved
      with the helix guide 19, which guides the rope onto and off of the
      rotating drum 8. Splines may not be used in this version, since it
      is more useful for smaller loads and the anisotropic friction is
      not a required feature. The helix guide 19 continually pushes the
      wraps axially down the drum 8, since the helix 19 is stationary
      and the rope must move. It provides the same function as the
      rollers 9 in the preferred embodiment, however with more friction.
      The helix 19 also still accommodates utilization of the rope or
      cable at any point, and the design for this embodiment does not
      require a free end of the rope to be strung through.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] A user attaches to the device (or attaches an object to the
      device, or the device to ground) via the attachment point 11 as in
      the previous embodiment. The ergonomic handle 5 with
      speed-controlling trigger 16 provide easy use similar to that of a
      cordless drill. The batteries and motor can be the same as in the
      previous embodiment. This embodiment of the design, however, may
      be less expensive to manufacture and more useful in applications
      where continuous pulling of a flexible tensioning member is
      necessary under lower loads (e.g., less than 250 lbs).<br>
      <br>
      [0064] An alternative embodiment depicted in FIGS. 9 (isometric
      view), 10 (side view) and 11 (side view including rope
      illustration). As previously noted with respect to FIGS. 2 through
      4, the guide rollers 9 are mounted to a non-rotating section of
      the device in order to guide the wraps of the rope down the
      rotating drum 8. In that embodiment, the rollers 9 are mounted to
      the roller support 18. However, this embodiment requires the
      support 18 to be moved away from the rotating drum 8 in order to
      wrap the rope onto the capstan.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] An alternative is to mount the guide rollers 9 to
      stationary mounts 25 placed between rotating drum sections 8 as
      depicted in FIGS. 10, 11 and 12. These stationary mounts are held
      stiff with respect to the device via the rotational constraints
      24. The contour of the rotational constraints 24 allows for the
      rope to be wrapped around the capstan in a spiral fashion, with
      the wraps guided from one to the next by the guide rollers 9. The
      rollers 9 in this embodiment are held in place by the guide roller
      bolts 27. The axis of the bolts is oriented radially inward to the
      rotational axis of the rotating drum 8. A person skilled in the
      art will note that the orientation of the guide rollers 9 with
      respect to the circumference and rotational axis of the rotating
      drum sections 8 is not limited to that of this particular
      example-other roller orientations will still accomplish the task
      of moving the rope through each wrap.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] The mounting of the entire capstan assembly embodiment is
      such that it replaces everything below the gearbox 6 in either of
      the two aforementioned embodiments. The capstan assembly base 23
      mounts to the gearbox 6, with a drive shaft extending through
      both, all the way to the capstan end plate 28. The rotating drum
      sections 8 are locked to the drive shaft, and radial bearings are
      inside each stationary section 25, the capstan assembly base 23,
      and the capstan end plate 28.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] The rope is guided onto the first rotating section 8 by the
      same guide pulley 7, and is then wrapped in a helical fashion
      around the assembly, going through each gap between the guide
      rollers 9. Finally, it is slipped between the tensioning roller 10
      and the final stationary section 25, and the tensioner lever 26 is
      closed. The tensioning roller 10 is pressed against the rope, and
      is held in place by a latch that keeps the tensioner lever 26
      tight against the capstan end plate 28.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] After the tensioning roller 10 is closed and force is thus
      applied to the last wrap of the rope on the capstan, the devices
      is ready to be used. Using this embodiment, the rope can be fully
      engaged and disengaged from the device without threading an end
      through the mechanism.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] A smaller version of this device could use the same sort of
      helical guide 19 and dynamic friction tensioner 10 to advance
      unlimited lengths of any sort of tensioning material, and could be
      particularly useful in the manufacture of cord materials such as
      steel cable, rope, thread, yarn, dental floss, and electrical
      conductors.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that
      the configurations described in FIGS. 1-11are not the only
      configurations that can employ the principles of the invention.
      The system and method described above, utilizing circumferential
      gripping of a rotating drum while pulling with a free end of a
      tensioning member can be practically employed in other
      configurations. While certain features and aspects of the
      illustrated embodiments provide significant advantages in
      achieving one or more of the objects of the invention and/or
      solving one or more of the problems noted in conventional devices,
      any configuration or placement of all the parts, motor, battery,
      gearbox, and rotating drum/guide assembly with relation to one
      another could be deployed by a person of ordinary skill in keeping
      with the principles of the invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0071] The lifting and pulling of heavy objects is a wide-ranging
      task inherent in many endeavors, commercial, domestic, military,
      and recreational. Current technology for portable lifting and
      pulling devices is limited to passive rope ascenders, as in
      climbers'equipment, and winches and come-alongs, which all have
      severe limitations for the power sources, rate of pulling, and
      types of tensioning members they can utilize.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] The present invention, a portable rope pulling and climbing
      device, can solve many problems associated with using current
      lifting and pulling technology, including but not limited to:
      accommodating multiple types and diameters of flexible tensioning
      members, being able to attach to the flexible tensioning member
      without threading a free end through the device, providing a
      smooth continuous pull, providing a device which itself can travel
      up or along a rope, to provide a device which is easy and
      intuitive to use, to provide a device which can let out or descend
      a taut flexible tensioning member at a controlled rate with a
      range of loads, and to provide a device and method that is usable
      in and useful for recreation, industry, emergency, rescue,
      manufacturing, military, and other applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] A person of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate
      further features and advantages of the invention based on the
      above-described embodiments. For example, specific features from
      any of the embodiments described above as well as in the Appendix

      as a trigger or a joystick, and activates electronically
      controlled motors that drive one or more rope pulling mechanisms,
      such as winches. When the winches pull in or pay out cable in
      accordance with the controller's demand, the load is moved along

      This invention relates to devices for moving an object by pulling
      on two or more tensile elongate elements to which the object is
      attached. More particularly, the invention relates to a device
      that attaches to and preferentially pulls on multiple ropes or

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Existing methods of gaining access to large vertical faces such as
      the sides of buildings or rock faces are limited to either minimal
      1 -dimensional access capabilities, such as single rope rappelling
      systems for climbers, rescuers, or window washers, or large, bulky
      installations such as cranes, scaffolding, or external elevators.<br>
      <br>
      Window washing systems that utilize standard rappelling equipment
      are limited in their access to the side of a building by the
      single line from which the operator hangs. In order to move
      laterally for any significant distance, the operator must descend
      to the bottom of the building, return to the rooftop and
      reposition his line, and then re-descend to the desired position.
      Similarly, climbers and rescue personnel who wish to access a
      specific point on a rock face or other vertical site must descend
      from directly above the desired position. When access to the ideal
      starting position above the target is not available, the operator
      may face extreme difficulty in accessing the desired position and
      must resort to additional support personnel or equipment to
      provide lateral movement capabilities.<br>
      <br>
      For large buildings where it may be appropriate to do so,
      scaffolding systems can be set up, either stationary or movable,
      to provide 2 dimensional access to the entire building face where
      needed. However, any system capable of providing such access
      requires significant cost, space, setup time, and operation time.
      Alternatively, ground lift systems such as cranes or vertical
      hoists can be used, but face similar limitations of cost, space,
      and access provided. A device that can be quickly, cheaply, and
      easily deployed which can give an operator precise, safe, and
      reliable access to vertical workspaces, such as sides of buildings
      and rock faces, would be of significant benefit to a variety of
      users. Rescue personnel could descend from a high point adjacent
      to the victim, instead of directly from above, and approach them
      laterally without disturbing loose and potentially dangerous
      objects, overhead obstacles, or the victim. Window washers could
      access an entire building face without needing to reset overhead
      lines, and construction workers could deliver equipment and
      personnel quickly and easily to many points on a high worksite.
      Additional functionality could be found in the entertainment
      industry, running high wires to pull actors into the air and
      manipulate their position in 2 dimensions remotely without the
      need for overhead rolling track carrier systems, as well as other
      setups where such carrier systems are needed. Other uses include
      installing, positioning and uninstalling overhead speaker and
      light systems at concerts and sporting events, as well as
      positioning camera systems.<br>
      <br>
      Similarly, positioning loads in 3 dimensional spaces is commonly
      accomplished by large, bulky systems such as overhead gantries or
      cranes that are not designed for portability or low cost. The
      ability to use a single low-cost device to accurately position
      loads, including workers, could be significantly advantageous for
      situations where a load manipulation system must be modular,
      quickly deployable, or able to fit and maneuver in confined
      spaces. Still another application where a 2 or 3 dimensional load
      positioning system would have further advantages over existing
      load positioning technology such as conventional hoists with
      swinging booms is in a hospital, where heavy patients must be
      maneuvered from stretchers to operating tables. Conventional
      hoists with swinging arms are impractical because the trajectory
      of the boom and the patient require that the entire area be clear
      to avoid collisions with equipment. It is therefore an object of
      the present invention to provide an apparatus for lifting or
      pulling heavy loads and controlling their position in 1, 2 or 3
      dimensions which solves one or more of the problems associated
      with the conventional methods and techniques described above.
      Another object of the present invention is to position loads
      vertically by ascending or descending a rope or cable fixed above
      the load.<br>
      <br>
      Another object of the present invention is to optionally utilize
      one or more ropes or cables affixed overhead and at a distance
      from one another in order to facilitate two dimensional or three
      dimensional positioning of a load, be it a person or an object.<br>
      <br>
      It is also an object of the present invention to be able to
      manipulate a single rope, so that if multidimensional positioning
      is not required, the same device can still be utilized for powered
      ascent and descent in a single dimension. It would also be
      desirable to be able to attach any such rope pulling device to a
      rope at any point along that rope without having to thread an end
      of the rope or cable through the device. This would increase the
      usability of such a device considerably over other rope pulling
      and climbing devices, allowing for example a user to attach the
      load or himself to the device for ascent that starts at an
      elevation well above the lower end of the rope.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be
      apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art in light of the
      ensuing description of the present invention. One or more of these
      objectives may include:<br>

      grounded object to act as a winch, that is powered by a portable
      rotational motor, and that is lightweight and easy to manufacture.
      While a number of objectives have been provided for illustrative
      purposes, it should be understood that the invention described
      below is not limited to any one of the illustrative objectives. It
      should further be understood that these illustrative objectives
      are stated in terms of the inventors' view of the state of the
      art, the objectives themselves are thus not prior art or
      necessarily known beyond the inventors. <br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The invention provides a multiple-rope or multiple-cable pulling
      device that preferably accomplishes one or more of the objects of
      the invention or solves at least one of the problems described
      above.<br>
      <br>
      In a first aspect, a device of the invention includes an
      electronic controller that interprets a user's input from an
      interface such as a trigger or a joystick, and preferentially
      activates electronically controlled motors that drive one or more
      rope pulling mechanisms, such as winches. When the winches pull in
      or pay out cable in accordance with the controller's demand, the
      load is moved along the desired trajectory as specified by the
      user through the device interface.<br>
      <br>
      An embodiment of the invention can be incorporated into a
      convenient portable hand-held motorized device, and in particular,
      can be configured as a portable hoist. Further aspects of the
      invention will become clear from the detailed description below,
      and in particular, from the attached claims.<br>
      <br>
      The present invention can provide a useful solution because at
      minimum, its operation only requires the space of the
      straight-line trajectory through which the load and the ropes must
      move, as opposed to conventional boom hoists which require a
      larger work volume to accomplish the same movement. Additionally,
      the installation of the present invention to accomplish
      multidimensional load movement can be much lower profile and lower
      impact than that of a conventional hoist, by requiring only either
      2 or 3 stationary fixture points for operation.<br>
      <br>
      By utilizing a two-rope device, the operator can position the load
      or himself anywhere along a vertical plane passing through the two
      rope connection points by independently and simultaneously
      controlling and adjusting the lengths of the ropes actively fed
      through the device during its operation. Note that the load, here,
      can be an object, a person, or the operator, and that the ropes
      can be replaced by cables or other tensile elongate elements.<br>
      <br>
      By utilizing a three-rope device, the user can position the load
      anywhere within a three dimensional space. By adjusting the
      relative lengths of rope above the device, its position can be
      controlled to anywhere within the volume of space projected
      downward from the three rope attachment points. Note again that
      the load, here, can be an object, a person, or the operator, and
      that the ropes can be replaced by cables or other tensile elongate
      elements. For greater load carrying capacity or movement within
      geometrically constrained spaces, such as a warehouse with tall
      items obstructing the desired path of the load, a device capable
      of manipulating 4 or more ropes could be utilized to provide added
      positional control beyond the capability of a 2 or 3 -rope device.<br>
      <br>
      The control of a multiple rope device can be achieved through a
      variety of configurations. One configuration consists of the
      device presenting to the operator one interface for each of the
      ropes passing through the device, be it a trigger, a switch, or a
      joystick. In this case, the operator manually controls the
      relative lengths and speeds of the ropes passing through the
      device, causing the ropes to move in the upwards or downwards
      directions as needed.<br>
      <br>
      A second configuration consists of the device presenting to the
      operator an interface, for example a joystick, that allows the
      operator to input his intended direction for the load, whereby the
      device computes and automatically adjusts the incoming and
      outgoing rope lengths and speeds to accomplish the task. In the
      two rope device case, with the device and operator positioned with
      one attachment point above and to the left and the other
      attachment point above and to the right, the operator can input,
      for example, an up, down, right, or left intended direction on the
      interface in order to move in that direction. Intended diagonal
      directions, such as up-left, up-right, down-left, and down-right
      could also be accepted and delivered by the device. Such a
      configuration would be very useful for positioning the load within
      a plane, for example against a wall.<br>
      <br>
      This configuration can be extended to three dimensional
      positioning within a volume, where again the operator inputs an
      intended direction and speed, and the device computes and delivers
      the corresponding three rope feed rates to move the load in the
      intended direction at the intended speed.<br>
      <br>
      A third configuration consists of the device operator himself
      acting as the device controller. The operator may manually
      indicate rope directions and speeds independently of one another
      by squeezing a single trigger associated with each rope, or by
      manually activating each respective motor controller by some other
      means. One such configuration for 2 dimensional movement would
      comprise 2 triggers, each corresponding to one rope. The operator
      would pull a trigger to pull in rope, and pull a second trigger or
      button to release that rope. A parallel setup would correspond to
      the second rope. By preferentially pulling in and paying out ropes
      via manual control, the operator can move himself or the load
      along the desired trajectory. This means of control may also serve
      useful as a backup in conjunction with any automated controller
      associated with the device. A person of ordinary skill in the art
      will note that this manual control setup can be extrapolated to 3
      rope, and thus 3 dimensional control, and even additional ropes
      beyond 3 as a situation may call for.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Referring now to Figures 1 and 2, a device 100 of Ihe invention
      for positioning a load 110 in 2 dimensions is illustrated
      diagrammatically.<br>
      <br>
      A user of device 100 provides an input to the device through the
      user interface 112 in accordance with the direction he wants to
      move the load, be it an object, another person, or himself. The
      device control 114 interprets the command and sends applicable
      signals to the speed controls 116,118 in charge of each of the
      rope interaction mechanisms 120,122. The signals are such that
      each of the mechanisms will create a velocity vector Vi5V2 along
      its own rope 124,126, which will sum with the velocity vector of
      the other rope or ropes to create the desired load trajectory.
      Sensors 128,130 detecting the angle [theta]i, [theta]2 of the
      ropes with respect to vertical to provide position feedback to the
      device controller 114, which then updates the necessary speed of
      each rope feed 132,134 to maintain the desired trajectory. The
      equation describing the velocity vectors of each rope as dependent
      on the respective angles of each rope to vertical is as follows:<br>
      <br>
      Equation 1: Rope velocity calculation from rope angles with
      respect to vertical<br>
      <br>
      Where Vx is the velocity of the first rope being pulled toward the
      device, V2 is the velocity of the second rope being pulled toward
      the device, [theta]\ is the angle that the first rope enters the
      device, 02 is the angle that the second rope enters the device, Vx
      is the component of the intended velocity in the X direction, and
      V[gamma] is the component of the intended velocity in the Y
      direction. Note that [theta]\ and 02 are measured clockwise from
      vertical at the points where the first rope and second rope enter
      the device, respectively. The intended velocity, FLOAD, is
      inputted by the operator through the user interface 112, via a
      joystick for example, and is proportional to the degree to which
      the joystick is pressed by the operator in a given direction.
      FLOAD is then decomposed into velocity components Vx and Vy. At
      times, Vx and Fy can be negative or zero.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 2 provides a diagrammatic view of a 2 dimensional device
      100 and provides a pictographic description of the angles and
      variables in Equation 1, as described above. A person of ordinary
      skill in the art will note that the corresponding velocity
      equation pertaining to 3 dimensional movement must reference 2
      angles for each rope in order to fully define the load's position
      with respect to ground. These angles would be measured by angular
      sensors positioned on the device and in contact with the ropes, as
      in the 2 dimensional case. Lastly, because the orientation of the
      device 100 may change with respect to ground, it is highly
      advantageous to include a tilt sensor, accelerometer, or other
      means of detecting the device's orientation in space, in order to
      correct for any off-axis positioning of the device itself that may
      occur during movement. While closed loop feedback control could be
      used with this embodiment of the invention, it is not required for
      operation of device 100. With each side of the device under manual
      control, for example, offering a proportional speed trigger for
      each rope interaction as the user interface, a user could still
      achieve satisfactory 2 or 3 dimensional positioning capability by
      controlling each vector separately. Once the device controller 114
      determines the requisite motor speeds to accomplish the desired
      trajectory, it sends velocity signals to the respective speed
      controllers 116,118, which then activate the motors 136,138, and
      optionally gearboxes 140,142, accordingly. The motors 136,138 and
      gearboxes 140,142 then provide rotational power to the rope
      pulling mechanisms 132,134, which pull the ropes through the
      device 144,146. A person skilled in the art will note that it is
      easy to enable remote operation of the device by separating the
      user input physically from the invention itself. User input would
      then be relayed to the device either through a remote cable, a
      wireless communication device, or other remote means. In a
      preferred embodiment of the invention, DC motors are utilized for
      their high power and low weight, though a person skilled in the
      art will note that the functionality of the device can be enabled
      by any powered rotational motor, or other power delivery
      mechanism. An exemplary power source 148 for powering the motors,
      as well as the device controller, could be a battery, especially a
      rechargeable batter such as a lithium ion battery.<br>
      <br>
      A rope pulling mechanism is referenced in Figure 1. The device of
      the present invention can function with this rope pulling
      mechanism comprising any one of a variety of existing mechanisms
      designed to pull in and pay out ropes, cables, or other tensile
      elongate elements under load, including but not limited to:
      conventional cable winches, capstan winches, self-tailing winches
      or mechanisms, grooved or splined pulleys, and other friction
      drives. In a preferred embodiment, the mechanisms for pulling
      ropes or other elongate tensile elements are constructed using the
      principles of published PCT application no. WO 2006/113844
      entitled "Powered Rope Ascender and Portable Rope Pulling Device,"
      which application is incorporated herein by reference. In one
      embodiment, the devices of WO 2006/113844 could be used as the
      rope interaction devices 120,122 of unit 100.<br>
      <br>
      In one embodiment, the rope pulling mechanisms comprise a rotating
      drum that is connected to the motor, either directly or through a
      gearbox (if one is present). It is the rotating drum, generally in
      the manner of a capstan, that applies the pulling force to the
      rope that is pulled through the device 100. In one embodiment, the
      rotating drum provides anisotropic friction gripping of the rope.
      In particular, the surface of the rotating drum can be treated or
      configured so that large friction forces are created in the
      general direction of the pulling of the rope (substantially around
      the circumference of the drum), and smaller friction forces are
      created longitudinally along the drum so that the rope can slide
      along the length of the drum, particularly when guided in such a
      manner by a rope guide, with relative ease. In other
      configurations, including when the rope runs over the drum for
      less than one full revolution of the drum, vanes on the drum can
      guide the rope to the center of the drum where those or other
      vanes help to grip the rope for pulling by the rotating drum. Such
      vaned drums are illustrated in Figures 9 to 11 below along with
      exemplary rope guides for guiding the rope onto and off of the
      rotating drum. The rope pulling mechanism, any associated rope
      guide, or the device 100 itself or one of its elements, may also
      include a brake for holding the rope or ropes The brake may be
      manual actuated, electrically actuated upon a signal from the
      device controller 1 14, and/or may operate continuously in a one
      way or ratchet mode in which the rope may be pulled through the
      device in a direction that allows the load to be lifted, but grabs
      or brakes movement of the rope if the device begins to slip down
      the rope or ropes<br>
      <br>
      In the illustrated embodiment, the rope pulling mechanisms 132,134
      and control elements 114,116, 118 are integrated into a single
      unit 100 This embodiment can provide advantages when the operator
      is the "load" 110 That is, a single integrated unit 100 for
      lifting or moving the operator is advantageous in that the
      operator can use the user interface 112 to operate the device
      while the operator is being lifted or moved In other embodiments,
      the user interface 112, for example, could be separated from the
      device 100 so that an operator could operate the device 100
      remotely to lift or move a load 1 10 other than the operator
      Similarly, the rope interaction mechanisms 120,122 could be
      separated and not provided in an integral unit 100 Such an
      embodiment might be useful under certain circumstances to provide
      o[pi]entational stability for a large load - for example, a large
      rectangular load might have four rope pulling mechanisms, one on
      each top comer of the load, with all of the rope interaction
      mechanisms communicating with a common user interface 112 and
      controller 1 14 In such an embodiment, each rope interaction
      device 120,122 could be provided with its own power source 148<br>
      <br>
      A rope or cable 124,126 is also referenced in Figure 1 The device
      of the present invention is intended to be able to pull any
      elongate resilient element that can withstand a tension Cables and
      ropes are the most common of these, but the invention is not meant
      to be limited by the reference to ropes or cables<br>
      <br>
      A further embodiment of a device for positioning a load 200 is
      illustrated by reference to Figure 3 This device 200 is set up for
      3 dimensional positioning of a load or operator within a volume
      The relationship between the user input 212, device controller
      214, and rope interaction mechanisms 220,222 is the same as in the
      embodiment of Figure 1, but this embodiment includes an additional
      rope interaction mechanism 224 in parallel with the first two,
      enabling a third dimension of load positioning by pulling three
      ropes 226,228,230 through the rope interaction mechanisms
      illustrated as 232,234,236. A power source 248 can also be
      provided for all of the device controller and the rope interaction
      mechanisms, or separate power sources can be provided. A person of
      ordinary skill in the art will note that where it may be
      applicable, additional rope interaction mechanisms may be added in
      parallel with the first three to enable more precise movement
      where needed, such as movement around obstacles in a warehouse, or
      when overhead attachment points for load suspension limit the
      capability of a three rope device.<br>
      <br>
      In a further embodiment of the invention, as shown in Figure 4,
      the device 300 may be split into separate segments, with each rope
      interaction mechanism 332,334 located at the overhead fixture
      point 336,338 of each rope or cable 324,326. The load 310 is
      suspended between the fixture points by the ropes or cables. To
      achieve multidimensional load positioning, the fixture points of
      the rope handling mechanisms must be placed some distance apart.
      Sensors on the device, in contact with the ropes, indicate the
      rope angle with respect to a fixed axis to provide position
      feedback to the device controller 314, as in the embodiment of
      Figure 1. The user inputs through user interface 312 his desired
      trajectory into the device controller 314, which either remotely
      or directly sends velocity signals to each of the overhead rope
      pulling mechanisms. As the rope pulling mechanisms appropriately
      pull in or pay out rope, the suspended load is moved along the
      desired trajectory. This embodiment may be suitable for more
      permanent installations, or situations where having the load
      positioning device travel along with the load is unfeasible. A
      power source 348 in this embodiment could be centrally located for
      connection to the cable interaction mechanisms 332,334 and
      controller 314, or, each device could have its own power source.
      Especially in the latter case, the user interface and controller
      could be provided, for example, by a personal computer, or a
      handheld digital device such as a PDA.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, the device may be fixed with respect to
      ground, and the ropes or cables are guided to the load via pulleys
      located on ceilings, walls, or other fixture points. In cases such
      as this, where the cable position with respect to the device would
      not change as a function of load position due to both the device
      and the first pulleys being fixed with respect to ground, the
      angular position feedback sensors would need to be located either
      at the load attachment point or at the last pulley before the
      load, where the angles of the ropes with respect to a fixed
      reference such as horizontal or vertical would change as a
      function of the load's position.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 5 shows a schematic view of an operator moving in 2
      dimensions using the device of Figure 1. The device 1 is attached
      to a point on the load, or the harness on the operator in this
      case, via the clip-in point 2. Upon the operator's input to the
      device 1 to move left, the left rope in neutral position 7 is
      pulled into the device 1, and the right rope in neutral position
      10 is paid out of the device 1, and the operator advances toward
      the left position 3. After the operator has reached the desired
      left position 3, the left rope has been advanced to its left
      position 6 and the right rope has also been moved to its left
      position 9. Upon the operator's input to the device 1 to move
      toward the right, the left rope 6 is now paid out of the device,
      and the right rope 9 is pulled into the device, thereby
      translating the operator toward the right position 5. At this
      final point, the right rope is now in its right position 11, and
      the left rope is also in its right position 8, and the operator 5
      is suspended in his desired place.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 6 depicts a three-dimensional view of the device operator
      4, hanging in neutral position from a preferred embodiment of the
      device 1. The operator 4 is tethered to the device's clip-in point
      2 via a tensile lanyard 18, both of which are visible in Figure 7,
      as well as other Figures. The device is high enough above the
      operator that he can utilize the device for positioning without
      the device obstructing his work envelope. As depicted in Figure 5,
      the left rope 7 goes into the left rope interaction 12, and the
      right rope 10 goes into the right rope interaction 13. Control is
      achieved by adjusting the joystick 17 on the control box 16, which
      is attached by a short coiled remote cable 15 to the device 1.
      This allows the device to remain overhead and out of the way,
      while still allowing easy controllability for the operator.<br>
      <br>
      Figures 7 and 8 show an embodiment of the invention. The ropes
      enter the left rope interaction 12 and right rope interaction 13,
      and exit each respective pulling mechanism on each side. A plastic
      housing 14 covers the chassis and internal components of the
      device for ruggedness and safety. A coiled remote cable 15 brings
      electrical signals back and forth from the control box 16 into the
      device, and the joystick<br>
      <br>
      17 shown on the control box 16 is a preferred method of control
      for 2 or 3 dimensions. The operator attaches himself to the
      clip-in point 2 via some tensile lanyard 18, which may be long
      enough to hang the operator well below the device such that his
      work envelope is not obstructed by the device. A carrying handle
      19 offers easy transport to and from a work or rescue site.<br>
      <br>
      Figure 9, 10 and 11 depict an embodiment of the invention without
      the plastic housings 14 installed. The left and right rope
      interactions 12 and 13 are shown without their safety covers, and
      all underlying components are exposed for viewing. The battery
      pack 24 supplies electrical power to the motor controller 25,
      which may contain two or three separate channels, depending on the
      number of separate rope interactions in the device. One channel is
      required for each interaction. In this case, a dual channel
      controller is utilized. The motor controller 25 preferentially
      applies power to one motor<br>
      <br>
      22 or the other so as to move the load along the desired
      trajectory. Referring to the left side only for the purpose of
      this description, the motor 22 applies a rotational torque at a
      velocity to the backside of the gearbox 21, which then applies a
      different torque at a different velocity into the left rope
      interaction 12. Operation is identical for the right side, but
      with the motor, gearbox, and rope interaction pertaining to that
      side. The chassis structure 20 holds the components together and
      provides the tensile elements from which the load hangs.<br>
      <br>
      For safety, an electromechanical safety brake 23 is attached to
      the back of each motor 22. Such a safety brake requires electrical
      power to disengage. Before applying power to the motor 22, the
      motor controller 25 must apply power to the safety brake 23 to
      release its grip on the back end of the motor shaft. Upon release,
      the motor 22 can rotate and power the rope interaction to which it
      is attached. When in the unpowered locked position, the brakes
      provide a mechanical lock to the rope interaction mechanisms that
      prevents unwanted motion of the device and load. Thus, even upon
      power failure, the device and load will remain safely held in
      place. A person skilled in the art will note that such a brake
      could be installed on either end of either the motor or gearbox to
      achieve this safety functionality. Additionally, any suitable
      power-off brake, whether pneumatically, mechanically, or otherwise
      released, can provide the same safety functionality as described.
      The illustrated embodiments can utilize a high-power DC electric
      motor, as built by Magmotor Corporation of Worcester, MA (part
      number S28-BP400X, for example) which possesses an extremely high
      power-to weight ratio (over 8.6HP developed in a motor weighing 7
      lbs). The power source can include batteries such as 24V, 3AH
      Panasonic EY9210 B Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. The device
      incorporates a pulse- width modulating speed control, adjusted by
      the device controller, that proportionally changes the speed of
      the motor. The controller can be implemented on a variety of
      digital microprocessor devices with instructions and calculations
      coded in software, firmware, or the like.<br>
      <br>
      A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a
      variety of sensors will suffice to provide positional feedback to
      the device controller. In the preferred embodiment, angular
      sensors located on the device indicate the rope's angle with
      respect to a fixed reference, such as horizontal or vertical. In
      the alternative embodiment, the angular sensors can be located on
      the overhead rope pulling mechanisms or at the load attachment
      point. Other examples of sensors that could work include but are
      not limited to: rotary encoders on the motors or the outputs of
      the rope pulling mechanisms, linear or rotary sensors in contact
      with the rope, optical sensors on the device detecting the length
      of rope pulled through, and accelerometers on the device that
      provide inertial position, velocity or acceleration feedback.<br>
      <br>
      A person of ordinary skill in the art will also recognize that the
      configurations described above are not the only configurations
      that can employ the principles of the invention. The system and
      method described above, utilizing multiple rope or cable pulling
      mechanisms to position loads in 2 and 3 dimensions, can be
      practically employed in other configurations. While certain
      features and aspects of the illustrated embodiments provide
      significant advantages in achieving one or more of the objects of
      the invention and/or solving one or more of the problems noted in
      conventional devices, any configuration or placement of all the
      parts, user interface, device controller, speed controller, power
      source, gearbox, sensors, and rope pulling mechanisms with
      relation to one another or to ground could be deployed by a person
      of ordinary skill in keeping with the principles of the invention.<br>
