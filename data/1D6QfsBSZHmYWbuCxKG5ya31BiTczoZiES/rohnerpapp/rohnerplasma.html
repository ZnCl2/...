      <b>BREAKING NEWS -- GETTING IN GEAR!! STARTUP NEWS!</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The New International Corporation, which will continue the work
      Rohner has been doing the last 5 years, has been offered two sites
      on the Caribbean beach, for the one or maybe two new R &amp; D
      sites needed to get the technology rapidly to manufacturers and
      production. Rohner will do the initial evaluation later this month
      or early next. The Corp team will then visit each to chose a site
      later this month.<br>
      <br>
      The first site is North Of Can Cun, Mexico, by Merida and the
      other is south of Can Cun, by Tulum, "Caribbean Maya" area. Both
      Facilities will provide a great work environment, amenities and
      perks to the Engineers and Physicists working on the various
      projects there.<br>
      <br>
      As soon as the site is chosen, We will HOST an "OPEN" conference
      for prospective, or licensed, users and "JOB FAIR" to fill the
      many openings needed to speed up the "to market" time.. Engineers
      from as far away as Russia, Germany, China and Ukraine will be
      attending. Look for that announcement if you wish to provide a
      resume early to get travel assistance. After The Conference and
      "Job Fair" there will be a "free to all Dinner and Dance party".
      (Celebration) Target is to get the first engines in products by
      January.<br>
      <br>
      "WHAT IF this TECHNOLOGY was "OPEN" like LINUX?<br>
      Any member could use it without Cost &amp; all would SHARE".<br>
      <br>
      John Rohner is wondering why the manufacturers, who are now
      spending billions to ready "BATTERY" cars, that would hurt the
      ecology and cause huge problems for "blowing up", contaminating
      waste facilities etc.. ALL the bad things we already know about
      batteries, plus could cost a end user thousands of dollars every
      other year to replace, are doing this?<br>
      <br>
      Here is a proven technology, ran once for DR Girouard who stole
      Rohners PlasmERG company in 2011, was running and testing as early
      as the Power Gen Show, when some of Rohner's employees told the
      engine manufacturers to disregard Rohner's order that every one
      would have 10 engines ready or he would not run one at the show,
      so he did not. These are the same folks that because they failed
      to grab the company became the SEC's stooges and rats. But most
      importantly the running and testing engines Rohner was preparing
      to show his investors March 23 rd, 2013, to get the final meeting
      to transform "Investors" into "Stockholders" for the final
      creation meeting and list that would have made it a Corporation.
      FYI on April 1, 2013 it was defunct, not that the SEC cared.<br>
      <br>
      Luckily Rohner removed the electronics from these test engines
      Sunday night after his tests so they were "incomplete" when
      grabbed and such. Only Rohner can resurrect them, but after nearly
      5 years even that would be tough.<br>
      <br>
      There is no question the technology is sound and can be used. The
      problem is restarting from scratch, as Rohner did after PlasmERG,
      to insure no consideration of Copyright infringement. ie.
      Inteligentry hardware and electronics are different from PlasmERG.
      As they should be from the experience learned and brought forward.<br>
      <br>
      John Rohner does not know the "proper" way to set up such a
      consortium. It may be a corporation or a foundation or something.
      But it would be "OIL" Proof.<br>
      <br>
      Consider that a small engine of less than 2 liters would require
      about one "RECHARGE CYLINDER" the size of a CO2 unit from a pellet
      gun, expected cost less than $8, and the BIG 6 Cylinder TRUCK,
      TRAIN, TANK or Ship size, 6 liters plus would require a refil tank
      about the size of a paint ball unit, cost $30, to run 24/7/365.
      That means you could power a home for a year at less than $8 or
      drive your truck for a year for less than $30.<br>
      <br>
      Add to that there is no intake/exhaust/noise/heat pollution. So a
      trucker could run his engine without complaints in the winter.<br>
      <br>
      If all the prospective users got together the development costs
      could be less, roughly 4 million to build a center south of Can
      Cun, Mexico, a happy place to visit and live. A good deal of the
      MEMBER COMPANIES Internal engineering departments, currently being
      used for combustion could be reorganized to work with the R &amp;
      D center to create specific products it may need internally to
      create product.<br>
      <br>
      Imagine personal home electricity for everyone, and Small cars at
      $10,000 or less and trucks that make money, or Ships and rail
      engines without smoke. and this first engine is the tip of the
      iceburg.<br>
      Anyone know how to get this done or would like to be a part of it?
      LET ME KNOW?<br>

      LET's GET THE WORLD CHANGED..... THERE IS NO LAW AGAINST USING THE

      <b>No intake. No exhaust. NO POLLUTION!!! Welcome to the Evolution
        of Power!</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The Plasmic Transition Technology is a very simple new discovery
      that uses the advantages of a "natural" act to provide a new
      "result", Much as "Solar Energy" is a new way to redirect the
      simple fact that we knew it was warm for nearly forever and now
      that "side effect" is being developed to provide new outcomes,
      just look at all the failed plants outside Las Vegas and Yuma etc.
      they are "DEVELOPING" it. So, is the Physical Fact that when a Gas
      Transitions to a Plasma it provides an expansion, the "Thunder",
      from lighting, is something we have all seen and heard. This
      expansion in the gas mixtures being used for our developments
      average a 5 to 1 expansion, different mixtures provide other
      results and some are faster reacting than other mixtures but this
      is a good average.<br>
      <br>
      This Plasmic Transition was originally stumbled upon, as MOST new
      technology is, in a lab experiment, by Joe Papp in the early 70's.
      It was something never understood till his death and something
      most of the leaches and TROLLS for the last 35 years also have no
      clue about, altho I see just lately a video was posted about what
      we saw in 2009 and Jimmy Sabori showed for years.<br>
      <br>
      It is also something that John Rohner actually "discovered" in his
      experiments and research, between 2005 and 2009, that lead to the
      patent he filed in 2009. The technology was in very active, nearly
      finalized, development, at evident from his live engine tests as
      he readied the "show and tell" GEN SET for investors, at his
      company, Inteligentry.<br>
      <br>
      The US Government, and his competitors, sought to stop it forever
      in 2013. But, by then enough of the "cat" was out of the "Bag"
      that those with proper Physics and education or inteligence to
      understand how "lightning" worked, could see How and Why and are
      finishing development all over the world, EXCEPT the USA, NOW!. So
      they stopped ONE and got back many.. It should be noted that any
      development using Plasma as a fuel is now, by court order, illegal
      in the USA.<br>
      <br>
      The purpose of this new Web Site is to "leave no man behind" from
      the onslaught of the FBI/SEC raid and closure of Inteligentry AND
      and to carry forward the dreams of John Rohner, the Inteligentry
      investors, and those that DREAM for a better Planet using the
      planet saving work already done and investigate the technologies
      past this "Tip of the Iceberg".<br>
      <br>
      Plasmic Transition is ONE "LOGICAL", extension of the Inteligentry
      Research &amp; Design work that was taken from the world just
      before birth by the US Government. It is made up of a majority of
      EX Inteligentry investors, employees and foreign "Master license
      Holders" that do believe in the development of the Plasmic
      Transition process and technology and that it needs to be
      completed and provided to help the world.<br>
      <br>
      <b>NOTICE:</b> John Rohner has been Contracted, thru a offshore
      third party, to rewrite some of his early documents for us. So
      there is a NEW "HOW IT WORKS" Page on this site, soon several TV
      accounts and an upcoming book, complete with updated information.<br>
      <br>
      Here is his "OLD" description...<br>
      <div align="center"><b>How the Plasmic Transition Process system
          works.</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      To start this discussion, this Engine is not, just as the original
      Papp engine was not, a Pulsed Plasma motor.&nbsp; Plasma is not
      retained and pulsed as many others have stated. The plasma is
      recreated with each power stroke and returns to a steady state gas
      on each return stroke thus the name Plasmic Transition Process .
      The initial power event and creation of plasma, for expansion, is
      derived from a actuation event within the cylinder, a very high
      voltage ball, similar to a lightning ball, is created at Top Dead
      Center (TDC) which creates a Plasmic Transition, an expansion of 5
      to 1,&nbsp; which is contained in a sealed cylinder thus pushing
      the Piston and rotating the crankshaft system via a push rod.<br>
      <br>
      In a single cylinder engine there are only 3 moving parts so the
      addition of a flywheel is required to provide the kinetic energy
      to complete the non powered cycle. There is no need to recycle
      electrons from one cylinder to another unless you are looking for
      a perpetual motion machine.<br>
      <br>
      This is a new system that crosses the previous borders the science
      of Physics as it is part Fusion, fission and plasma working
      together utilizing elements of each to the advantage of the
      result. this result is power.<br>
      <br>
      The output Torque is steady over the range of the Rotation of the
      engine, roughly 400 Ft Lbs in a 500 CC engine, at any engine
      rotational speed. So Horse Power is a straight rising line.<br>
      <br>
      There are two parallels to explain the Plasmic Transition and
      power production of this motor in our world. First is natural
      lightning, which uses a almost identical or similar process as
      does the Plasmic Transition Process .&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The second is Live steam which provides the same torque over
      rotational speed event characteristics. There is nothing
      comparable in our current internal combustion motors operation. <br>
      <br>
      The single most crucial part of this motor's operation is the
      Electronic Control System. Our Modern&nbsp; ECS comprises multiple
      programmable micro computer controllers, a Radio Frequency Power
      generator, a HV Spark Coil initiation driver, various electro
      magnetic Coil voltage switches providing a base (resting) or
      variable (engine speed) voltage for all cylinder or reaction
      chamber electro magnetic coils, a DC to 12 Volt DC output
      converter, a engine speed DC to programmed Variable voltage (3 to
      48 Volt) DC converter, a inter controller communications port, a
      instrument support CAN port, for user panel etc, and action port
      which receives commands from the user comprising, by not limited
      to, things like Run, Start, Throttle position, hold speed, Brake
      application, Brake hard, various motor inputs and Fuel container
      information. Pretty complex when you consider the first one John
      Rohner designed in the 80s. <br>

      - <b>Dan Glover of Inteligentry</b> provides an overview of the
      company's work in Papp engine research. Led by founder John
      Rohner, the firm claims to have not only recreated the Papp
      Engine, but also improved upon the original process by removing
      dangerous &amp; unsafe elements in addition to making a number of
      modifications of their own.<br>
      <br>
      Inteligentry's Plasmic Transition Process technology couples a
      refined noble-gas piston arrangement with a sophisticated onboard
      electronics suite that delivers precision timing to the Papp
      Engine to produce nearly 300 horsepower output.<br>
      <br>
      Inteligentry plans to license Plasmic Transition Process
      technology in a novel manner by making the noble-gas cylinder
      technology open-source while retaining their intellectual property
      in electronics-suite enhancements for their dealer network. Dan
      Glover claims this recognizes the fact that Papp's original work
      is already open-source as the patents on it have long expired.<br>

      and that they are in process of compiling the information needed
      to enable craftsmen to build what they call a “popper”, which
      demonstrates the principle to show scientists that it does work,
      and to aid in research and development of the core principles

      technology. The noble-gas engine, demonstrated at TeslaTech 2012,
      is claimed to generate 270 horsepower with a completely reversible

      A cylinder (similar to one that can be found in an internal
      combustion engine) is filled with a mixture of cheap and inert
      gases, then sealed. <br>
      A magnetic field produced by a coil wrapped around the cylinder is
      turned on to "pinch" or compress the mixed gases.&nbsp; PlasmaERG
      Engine Piston Cylinder Coil section<br>
      High frequency radio waves are emitted into the cylinder to ionize
      the gases. <br>
      A high voltage (300,000 volt or more) ball of electricity is
      formed between four electrodes on the cylinder head. <br>
      <br>
      This sequence of events creates a plasma ball that starts to grow.
      This ball of plasma expands, and produces a linear force against
      the piston. As the piston cycles, only the magnetic field is
      maintained. The ionization field on the transition coil is reduced
      to the voltage on the cylinder coil. The RF is also turned off.
      The electrodes controller watches the cylinder to detect the
      starting signature of the event and it turns off the high voltage
      and tells the master controller to switch the others out as well.<br>
      <br>
      <b>PlasmaERG Engine Piston</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Engines utilizing the "Plasmic Transition Process" are unique in
      many ways, and offer many advantages over internal combustion
      engines, electric motors, and turbines. Their capabilities are
      simply light years beyond any current "mainstream" technology.<br>
      <br>
      For example, engines utilizing this process need very little fuel.
      Only small amounts of noble gases (although other gases such as
      hydrogen and nitrogen can also be used) are put into the cylinders
      of an engine, and one charge of gas can last for months of
      continuous use before another is needed. The reason such an engine
      would need to be refueled is because the gas mixture does get
      consumed and "wear out".&nbsp; Another reason for the recharge is
      that over a period of time the gas may leak out. It is difficult
      to create a perfect seal between the piston, cylinder and block in
      any type of engine. <br>
      <br>
      It is also important to note these engines produce massive amounts
      of horsepower and torque. They are extremely powerful. A small two
      cylinder 1000 cubic centimeter displacement engine can produce
      hundreds of horsepower, and hundreds of foot pounds of torque.
      This is of course while producing zero emissions, zero carbon
      dioxide, and zero particulate matter. In addition, no
      radioactivity is emitted from the engine. These engines are the
      ultimate "green machines."<br>
      <br>
      Even though skeptics may think this is impossible, the engine
      remains cool even when producing hundreds of horsepower. This is
      possible, because when the plasma ball contracts and the gases
      return to their normal state, any heat produced is absorbed. Due
      to this aspect of the process, these engines do not need cooling
      systems. This eliminates unwanted components, reduces the price of
      the system, saves space, and eliminates an engine system that
      could potentially break down. Additional components are also not
      required. For example, the fuel tank, fuel pump and exhaust
      system, among others. <br>
      <br>
      The power, features, and benefits of these engines are amazing.
      What is even more exciting, is that these engines are about to be
      commercialized in the coming months! Instead of just being
      designed and tested, they will be put to use in practical
      applications. The remainder of this article will cover the uses of
      these engines, their potential, and how they can benefit all of us
      in very practical ways.<br>
      <br>
      <b>An Automobile Coming to Your Local Dealership</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The PlasmERG technology can be used in cars, trucks, motorcycles,
      vans, buses, and any vehicle that people currently use to get from
      point "A" to point "B." The biggest difference is that instead of
      burning gasoline, a vehicle utilizing a Plasmic Engine would
      consume tiny quantities of inert gases. Instead of spending
      thousands of dollars a year to fuel the vehicle, the owner would
      pay tens of dollars. This would save the driver massive amounts of
      money each year. Over the lifetime of the vehicle, the savings
      could be enormous. Perhaps even enough to purchase a home with, or
      put a child through college! And the price of the engine will be
      about one third of the engine it is replacing, and could
      potentially last longer, given its simplicity.<br>
      <br>
      There would of course be other benefits to owning such a vehicle.
      It would emit no pollution, would run very quietly, and would not
      need oil changes (another cost savings). The oil is synthetic and
      the bearings are roller, so a very low pressure system is used to
      provide oil as needed. Without heat and contaminants the oil never
      looses its ability to provide lubrication. The regular maintenance
      needed would be minimal, although it would still be important to
      check the air pressure of your tires, take a look at your break
      fluid from time to time, replace break pads if they get worn, add
      wind shield wiper fluid, etc. <br>
      <br>
      The performance of the vehicle would be very high, in that it
      would have lots of get up and go! Engines utilizing this
      technology have a flat torque curve, which means all the torque is
      present at low RPMs (just like an electric motor). The moment you
      press the accelerator, your vehicle would scoot! In fact, the
      smallest engine that would be used in a vehicle (at least at
      first) would be capable of producing over 300HP and hundreds of
      foot pounds of torque! But the engine is also very much like a
      Diesel Engine as it is limited to a top rotational speed of 3000
      RPM. <br>
      <br>
      Now, what could you do with this vehicle? There are many
      possibilities! You could drive it across the country ten times or
      more without refueling , take a trip to Alaska in the middle of
      winter without having to buy anti-freeze, or take a drive to
      Mexico in the summer without having to put a drop of water in a
      radiator. Computations show over 144,000 miles per fueling<br>
      <br>
      Another interesting possibility is the idea of taking the output
      of the vehicle's alternator, or generator and using it to power
      your home whenever your not driving! Whatever electrical power you
      do not use, could be sold back to the grid (for as long as it
      exists after this technology launches). Perhaps such a vehicle
      could allow you reduce your electric bill, or even make money!<br>
      <br>
      Finally, such a vehicle would probably be cheaper than the
      equivalent with an internal combustion engine or even an electric
      motor. In a conventional vehicle that gets 30 miles per gallon,
      paying $3.31/gallon (current low price in Utah) the cost of gas to
      run 144,000 miles is nearly $16,000. The previously mentioned two
      cylinder 1000cc engine, when mass produced, is expected to cost
      around $500 dollars retail. This is a fraction of the cost of a
      traditional engine. It is also much less than the huge battery
      packs needed in electric vehicles. Basically, for less money, you
      would get a vehicle that consumes almost no fuel, has better
      performance, fewer parts, emits no pollution, runs quietly, and
      has almost infinite range! <br>
      <br>
      <b>A Generator for Your Home</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      A Plasmic Transition Process Engine connected to a generator could
      be used to produce all the energy needed to power your home. In
      fact, a small two cylinder 1000cc engine can produce over 200
      kilowatts when connected to an electrical generator capable of
      generating this amount. This is far more electricity than is
      needed to power the average home that uses an average of 1
      kilowatt. (Link) With that kind of generating capability, a single
      engine could power a neighborhood! <br>
      <br>
      Realistically, a normal home may use a maximum peak power of
      around 10 kilowatts or so. To be on the safe side, let's assume a
      home utilized 20 kilowatts when the demand was greatest (nearly
      everything running). An engine much smaller than 1000cc (which is
      already small) would be capable of producing the output required
      for the energy needs of the home. Once this technology is mass
      produced, such a small engine and generator might only cost a few
      hundred dollars. The fuel cost would be minimal, and the engine
      would require little maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      The result of such a home power system would be tremendously
      reduced energy costs. In a few months, the system could pay for
      itself. After that, the energy could be almost free or at a
      minimum, dirt cheap. Considering the current price of dirt it may
      even be cheaper that that!<br>
      <br>
      Another important benefit of owning such a system, is that you
      would have power even if the grid failed. There are many events
      that could cause a loss of power including hurricanes, tornadoes,
      thunderstorms, or earthquakes. By owning such a system, you would
      have electricity regardless the state of the grid. <br>
      <br>
      <b>A New Age of Aviation</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The PlasmERG technology has the ability to spark a new age of
      aviation. Currently, a big part of the cost of flying is the fuel.
      Planes consume lots of fuel, and it can be very expensive. If you
      notice, when oil prices go up airline stocks go down! <br>
      <br>
      Utilizing Plasmic Transition Process Engines, planes will have
      near zero fuel costs. This will make aviation much more
      affordable. It could make airline ticket prices go down, and make
      owning a private aircraft more economical for the average person.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, PlasmERG's technology could benefit aircraft in many
      other ways. <br>
      <br>
      The engine does not need air, so it would work equally well at any
      altitude.<br>
      Many components such as exhaust systems and fuel tanks will not be
      needed, which will reduce the weight of an aircraft.<br>
      A smaller and lighter weight Plasmic Engine would produce the same
      power as a larger conventional engine. <br>
      The engine will be quieter, which would allow for a more pleasant
      flight.<br>
      The plane would have an almost infinite range. A small private
      aircraft with one of these engines could fly around the world
      multiple times without stopping to refuel! <br>
      Due to having fewer moving parts and components, there will be
      less to "go wrong" with the engine than with a conventional
      engine. This enhances the safety of the aircraft.<br>
      Using the Engine in Boats will allow Fishermen longer times on
      station to get more fish and at the same time drastically reduce
      their fuel tanks and fuel bills, which will reduce the price. Same
      is true of nearly any Boat.<br>
      Another terrific use is for the oil companies. These engines do
      not create heat or sparks, and on a drilling rig that means
      safety. Also as pump motors the oil can be pumped at places
      currently not available because of getting electric or diesel fuel
      there. <br>
      <br>
      Also there is the possibility of replacing massive generation
      facilities with what John calls a "Power Farm". This is a network
      of smaller generators that are controlled by load and switched on
      or off as needed at a substation. If a generator goes bad it is
      removed from the network, fixed and then replaced onto the
      network. What a boon for those above the artic circle or medium
      sized communities all over. The transmission lines can come down.<br>
      <br>
      One particular hope of mine is that this technology could be used
      to make a personal flying device similar to a jet pack. I can
      imagine strapping into such a "Plasmic Flight Pack", and soaring
      through the sky. Unlike traditional jet packs that can only remain
      in the air several minutes (at most) before running out of fuel, a
      "Plasmic Flight Pack" could stay aloft for an indefinite period of
      time. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Environmental Panacea</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The PlasmERG technology has the capability to quickly end the use
      of fossil fuels. It will be able to power the world's vehicles and
      produce the electricity our civilization consumes, without
      producing any pollution. Smog could become a thing of the past and
      carbon dioxide emissions would suddenly be a non-issue. Since we
      would not be drilling for as much oil (it would only be used as
      feedstock for plastics, lubricants, fertilizers and other
      products), there would be fewer spills such as the one that took
      place in the Gulf of Mexico.<br>
      <br>
      With all the cheap energy produced we could do many times to
      protect, repair and enhance the environment.<br>
      <br>
      We could build Plasmic powered robots that could digg up
      landfills, and sort the materials for recycling. With cheap
      energy, recycling will become much more economical. This would
      reduce the need for mining.<br>
      We could build robotic, remote controlled boats to collect all the
      plastic and other trash that is currently collecting in our
      oceans.<br>
      We could use the cheap energy to desalinate salt water, and turn
      deserts into farm land. <br>
      We could phase out all existing nuclear power plants that use
      dangerous uranium and plutonium as fuel, and replace the lost
      electrical generation with energy produced from Plasmic Engines.<br>
      We could stop destroying the surface of the earth for agriculture,
      and start growing food indoors. By using full spectrum lighting
      and other modern technologies, massive amounts of food could be
      produced. <br>
      <br>
      Simply put, once proliferated, the PlasmERG technology would solve
      the vast majority of environmental issues facing our planet. Those
      who are pushing for carbon taxes and new regulations to fight
      global warming, will have to find another job! <br>
      <br>
      <b>Economic Revitalization</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The world is in a major economic slump. In fact, some call it a
      depression. Although the media claims "green shoots" are popping
      up everywhere, jobs are still hard to find, companies are going
      bankrupt, food stamp use is at record highs, and millions of
      people are facing serious hardships. In addition, the United
      States and many other nations are in massive debt, and the central
      banks are addressing the issue by printing more and more money out
      of thin air. <br>
      <br>
      The PlasmERG technology could be utilized to revitalize the global
      economy. It could actually bring the world out of recession or
      depression, and into economic prosperity.<br>
      <br>
      It would create many jobs and careers, because potentially
      billions of engines and related devices (such as generators) would
      need to be manufactured.<br>
      It would reduce the cost of transportation due to the near zero
      fuel cost. This would make shipping goods and products more
      affordable.<br>
      It would put more money in everyone's pocket, by cutting their
      fuel costs and electric bills. They could then spend the saved
      money, and put it back into the economy.<br>
      It would inspire other exotic technologies to be developed, which
      would create even more jobs.<br>
      It would decrease the cost of every good and service (energy
      increases the cost of everything), so a dollar or euro would go
      further.<br>
      <br>
      The "mainstream" has no clear answer to the economic disaster the
      world is facing. However, PlasmERG has an answer, and it is coming
      soon!<br>
      <br>
      <b>Paradigm Shifts</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In addition to all the direct uses of the PlasmERG technology, the
      mere existence of it will shatter the current paradigm of
      mainstream science. According to many mainstream scientists, a
      technology like PlasmERG's simply should not work! However, it
      does work, and this fact will force the entire scientific
      community to re-think what is possible, reconsider the validity of
      other exotic technologies, and to be more open minded! <br>
      <br>
      Perhaps the next exotic technology to emerge after the PlasmERG
      engine could be an anti-gravity device, force field generator,
      anti-aging drug, or something we cannot even fathom yet! These
      breakthroughs could lead to others, and in no time at all we could
      live in an age more technologically advanced than the fictional
      world of Star Trek!<br>
      <br>
      COMMENTARY:&nbsp; On Nov. 19, 2009, John Rohner of PlasmERG Inc.
      announced that their patent has been accepted for their
      revolutionary Plasmic Transition Process in which noble or inert
      gas is used to run an engine. The patent has been peer and
      examiner reviewed, and is expected to be awarded in a couple of
      months.<br>
      <br>
      This noble (inert) gas engine, with just five moving parts, would
      cost 1/3 what a regular engine of comparable output would cost.
      Meanwhile, its fuel cost is nearly negligible. It's kind of like a
      Stirling engine -- a sealed system -- except that the expanding
      component is internal, and comes by way of a plasma form of inert,
      noble gasses, which are not consumed in the process, and which are
      environmentally benign.<br>
      <br>
      PlasmERG has also secured a registered trademark of the phrase
      "Plasmic Transition Process" as the standard description of the
      way the motor works. <br>
      <br>
      They were attentive in the patent to see that every form is
      covered and that the controller will be flexible enough to adapt
      to various iterations and hardware design changes. <br>
      <br>
      The Plasmic Transition Process is the subject of various patents
      pending byPlasmERG Inc. of Iowa. John Rohner founded this company
      in 2008 to be the means to disseminate, develop and license this
      technology to other motor manufacturers for their own use. <br>
      <br>
      This process originally called the "Papp Engine" did run in 1982
      and was then lost until John, and his partner Haik Biglari
      rediscovered it and applied modern science to the system to
      explain the process and filed their patents, presently pending.
      The original process was based on information originally patented
      by the late Joseph Papp, whose patents are now expired. <br>
      <br>
      John Rohner, a well-known new product design engineer, was
      originally contacted in 1979 by Robert Rohner, his brother, with a
      schematic for the controller Papp had designed. Unfortunately,
      John was busy with several other projects so he turned it over to
      his brother Tom. That controller, or a best guess at it, is shown
      in the following schematic.&nbsp; It is a simple crude system, by
      today's standards but very modern for 1982, and easy to
      understand. It was the key element to the motor running, at that
      time.<br>
      <br>
      PlasmERG has designed two motors for OEM use. One is an opposed 2
      cylinder, 120 cubic inch engine and produces a maximum of ~300 HP.
      The second is a 6 Cylinder 360 cubic inch engine and produces a
      maximum of ~1500 HP. (Ref.)<br>
      <br>
      The motors are also being co-developed with a sister company in
      Canada. John Rohner has personally fronted the total investment
      for this development thus far. As the company moves toward
      manufacturing they are seeking investment partners by trading
      stock for investment. Their first "real" manufacturing plant will
      cost about 10 million dollars. The alternative is to simply go as
      they are and create licenses from automotive and truck motor
      makers until they can get OEM production up.<br>
      <br>
      The current plan is to provide 500 to 1000 test sites in
      underdeveloped nations for water pumping and power generation as
      "humanitarian" test sites. This should allow the time needed to
      get production understood and patents completed. <br>
      <br>
      The company believes the Plasma Transition Process motors will
      create a direct replacement for the internal combustion engine,
      with no pollutants and greatly reduced noise. "It is PlasmERG's
      dream to make the world a better place to live without having to
      use Petroleum or even Biofuels," says Rohner. <br>
      <br>
      The expected run time of a motor from a single cylinder charge is
      over 3 months continuous, so significant money can be saved as
      well by not having to purchase fuel except rarely. To relate that
      to a typical consumer, this is about the same amount of time they
      drive now in a year, and the fuel should cost less than $50 per
      refuel. <br>
      <br>
      Ironically, as evidence for their design, they reference their
      competitor brothers' Papp Engine, as a "proof of concept" video,
      to show that "the Plasmic Transition Process is real and does work
      as expected." It is based loosely on the 1983 Joseph Papp patent
      which was the starting point for their discovery of the process. <br>
      <br>
      The competitor brothers, Bob and Tom Rohner, apparently
      implementing the suggestions from their estranged brother John,
      have simplified the fuel mixer, reduced the coils, and made it a
      simple single cylinder – which is similar to the design John's
      group is pursuing as well. The Papp patent assumed that a single
      cylinder engine would not be possible, stating that only "paired"
      cylinders will work. John Rohner says he was the first to try this
      configuration and prove it.<br>
      <br>
      PlasmERG is expecting completion of a new set of motors and
      generators by around Christmas at which time they will begin
      analysis of complete systems, to test various gas mixes to see how
      the controller must be adjusted to provide best operation from
      each. They have copyrighted over 30 such gas mixtures already.
      Their firmware is registered as a "Company Secret". It will not be
      public for safety reasons.<br>
      <br>
      They have also started working on a mini single cylinder 250cc for
      use in smaller applications and gensets, and they expect to test
      it around January as well. <br>
      <br>
      In January, they plan to have a license manager coming on board to
      get other countries started as co-developers as well. The company
      is starting to staff up now. They are inviting interested parties
      to contact them in January about working with them.<br>
      <br>
      The company now has a research facility where their tests will be
      done and the firmware built and tested. The facility has a numeric
      control machine shop with about 100 square yards of floor space,
      along with a two story office space with a conference room and
      several drawing rooms, one of which now has their CAD system
      running. The new test bays will be remote controlled and will
      collect data on the fly. They have allocated 18 terabytes of file
      server storage for their data collection efforts. <br>
      <br>
      According to John Rohner, the PlasmERG has brought this technology
      to the point it is ready for mass manufacturing.&nbsp; PlasmERG is
      about to launch an engine using the "Plasmic Transition Process"
      technology.&nbsp; It is about to go into production in Hendersen,
      Nevada. A factory is being setup to manufacture the control
      electronics, while local partners will fabricate the engine parts
      for five prototype motors.&nbsp; These prototype motors will
      demonstrate to stockholders, investors, and potential licensees
      what PlasmERG has so far only been able to produce in house (for
      security reasons). These prototype engines can then be mass
      produced by those companies who purchase a license to manufacture
      them.<br>
      <br>
      *** John Rohner described how the PlasmERG Plasmic Transition
      Process engine works during an&nbsp; interview on March 22, 2011
      by Sterling Allen of FreeEnergyNow.com.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Mr. Rohner makes a number of incredible claims about his PlasmERG
      Nobel Gas engine, but all we have seen so far are a few pictures
      of a crude two-cylinder prototype, but no video of the engine
      actually running and producing energy.&nbsp; The video provided
      above is from the Papp Plasma Gas Engine when goes back to 1982,
      from which the PlasmERG Nobel Gas engine is based.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      It would be nice to see and hear the PlasmERG Novel Gas engine

      An internal expansion engine having a housing. Secured to the
      housing is a cylinder defining an expansion chamber. A piston is
      provided within the cylinder defining a wall of the expansion
      chamber. A charge of noble gas is provided within the expansion
      chamber. A magnetic field generator and radio frequency power
      generator is provided around the expansion chamber and an
      initiator system is located within the expansion chamber. The
      magnetic field generator, radio frequency power generator and
      initiator system coact to cause the noble gas to expand, pushing
      against the piston and generating work. The actions of the engine
      are monitored and controlled by an intelligent electronic control
      system that provides all switching needed to operate the engine
      and communicate with outside elements providing external control
      of information sources.<br>
      <br>
      [0001] This application is a Divisional application of U.S. Ser.
      No. 12/592,117.<br>
      <br>
      [0002] This patent application claims priority to U.S. Provisional
      Patent Application Ser. No. 60/412,230 filed Nov. 19, 2008.<br>
      <br>
      <b>TECHNICAL FIELD</b><br>
      <br>
      [0003] The present invention relates to an engine and more
      particularly to an engine utilizing the Plasmic Transition Process
      and controlled by a flexible electronic control system.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
      <br>
      [0004] Internal combustion engines are well known in the art. The
      operation of such engines involves the combustion of a fossil fuel
      within a cylinder to drive a piston to generate work. Such prior
      art internal combustion engines have several drawbacks. One
      drawback is the inefficiency of such engines. As it is difficult
      to translate all of the power from the combustion into work,
      commercial internal combustion engines typically have less than
      fifty percent efficiency. Another drawback is the pollution
      created when internal combustion engines expel carbon dioxide and
      other damaging material into the air. Yet another drawback of
      prior art internal combustion engines is the heat generated by the
      engines, which requires a separate cooling system to prevent
      damage to the engine during operation.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] It is also known in the art to provide an engine utilizing
      non-combustible gases in lieu of combustible gases. Examples of
      such devices can be found in<b> U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,670,494;
        4,428,193; and 7,076,950</b>. One drawback associated with such
      prior art devices is the difficulty associated with operating them
      continuously for a long period of time. The temperamental nature
      of the ionization process involved with such prior art devices
      makes it difficult to incorporate them into vehicles and other
      items which require a minimum level of reliability. The
      difficulties encountered in the prior art discussed hereinabove
      are substantially eliminated by the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSED SUBJECT MATTER</b><br>
      <br>
      [0006] In an advantage provided by this invention, an internal
      expansion engine is provided which is of a low-cost, lightweight
      manufacture.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Advantageously, this invention provides a sealed
      environment with substantially no harmful exhaust.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] Advantageously, this invention provides an engine which
      requires little fuel.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] Advantageously, this invention provides an engine which
      requires little maintenance.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] Advantageously, in the preferred embodiment of this
      invention, an internal expansion engine is provided. The engine is
      provided with a housing having a cylinder defining an expansion
      chamber. Provided within the cylinder is a piston forming a wall
      of the expansion chamber. Provided within the expansion chamber is
      a charge of a gas mixture. A magnetic field generator is provided
      around the expansion chamber, and Radio Frequency power input is
      coupled to the expansion chamber. An initiator system is located
      within the expansion chamber to coact with the magnetic field
      generator and Radio Frequency power input to generate a plasma and
      generate work in the form of movement of the piston.<br>

        <br>
        DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</b><br>
      <br>
      [0020] A motor according to the present invention is shown
      generally as 10 in FIG. 1. The motor (10) comprises a casing (12)
      housing a cylinder (14). The cylinder (14) is constructed of a
      non-ferrous material, such hard coat aluminum, and has no air
      intake or exhaust. The cylinder (14) is sealed on one end by a
      circular seal (16) to a cylinder head (18) on the other end by the
      head (20) of a piston (22). (FIGS. 1 and 2). The cylinder head
      (18) and piston (22) are constructed of a Ferro-magnetic material
      such as Grade 416 stainless steel. The cylinder (14), circular
      cylinder head (18) and circular head (20) of the piston (22) form
      the walls of an expansion chamber (24). When the piston (22) is at
      the top dead center (TDC) position as shown in FIG. 2, the
      circular cylinder head (18) and circular head (20) of the piston
      (22) form a toroidal transition chamber (25). The cylinder head
      (18) and head (20) of a piston (22) are provided with a mirrored
      finish to increase the efficiency of the transition chamber (25).<br>
      <br>
      [0021] The piston (22) is provided with ring grooves (26) and
      (28), within which rest piston rings (30) and (32), such as those
      known in the art. The piston rings (30) and (32) form a seal
      between the piston (22) and cylinder (14), preventing the passage
      of gases thereby. The piston (22) is pivotally coupled to a
      connecting rod (34). The connecting rod (34) is coupled to a
      crankshaft (36), which is journaled to a crankcase (38). The
      crankcase (38) is coupled to the casing (12). Coupled to one end
      of the crankshaft (36) is a flywheel (40). Coupled to the other
      end of the crankshaft (36) is a V-belt drive pulley (42) provided
      with a V-belt (44).<br>
      <br>
      [0022] As shown in FIG. 1, provided between the casing (12) and
      the cylinder (14) are three coils (46), (48) and (50). The
      supplemental coil (46) is preferably constructed of between 100
      and 500 turns, and most preferably 220 turns, of 20 gauge wire.
      The supplemental coil (46) is approximately 20 centimeters long.
      The cylinder coil (48) is preferably constructed of between 200
      and 900, and most preferably 600 turns of 18 gauge wire. The
      cylinder coil (48) is approximately 15.0 centimeters long. The
      transition coil (50) is preferably constructed of between 50 and
      100, and most preferably 80 turns of 18 gauge wire. The transition
      coil (50) is approximately 4.5 centimeters long. The supplemental
      coil (46) may act as a capacitor when charged, or as an
      electromagnetic shield when uncharged. When the piston (22) is at
      TDC the cylinder coil (48) is located completely below the head
      (20) of the piston (22) and the transition coil (50) completely
      surrounds the transition chamber (25). The cylinder coil (48) acts
      as a magnetic field generator on the interior of the cylinder
      (14). The transition coil (50) also acts as a magnetic field
      generator on the interior of the cylinder (14), but is primarily
      focused to generate a predetermined magnetic field within the
      expansion chamber (24) when the piston (22) is near the TDC
      position. In the preferred embodiment, only the cylinder coil (48)
      and transition coil (50) are used.<br>
      <br>
      [0023] A ionization generator, such as a radio frequency generator
      (52) coupled to a high frequency antenna (54) is provided to act
      on the gas within the transition chamber (25) to Ionization. The
      antenna (54) is preferably constructed of 18 gauge wire between
      5.0 and 10.0 centimeters in length and most preferably 8.1
      centimeters in length wrapped 60% around the Transition chamber at
      mid point within the torodial structure. An alternate way to
      perform this function could also be to modulate the transition
      coil (50) with this RF power.<br>
      <br>
      [0024] As shown in FIG. 1, the high frequency antenna (54) is
      secured through the cylinder head (18) and extends into the
      expansion chamber (24). An initiator system is provided, such as a
      high voltage coil (58) or multiple coils (58), (60), (62), (64),
      such as “coil on plug” spark coils, such as those known in the
      art, provided with a 55 KV output sufficient to generate a arc of
      140 KV and long enough duration to induce transition of the
      ionized gas mixture within the transition chamber (25).<br>
      <br>
      [0025] If desired, the cylinder head (18) may be provided with a
      clear glass port (56) to allow visual access to the expansion
      chamber (24). An initiator system, such as four high voltage coils
      (58), (60), (62) and (64) and an arc return element (66) are
      secured to the cylinder head (18). (FIGS. 1-4.) Four high voltage
      electrodes (68), (70), (72) and (74) depending from the four high
      voltage coils (58), (60), (62) and (64), extend through the
      cylinder head (18) and into the expansion chamber (24). The arc
      return element (66), which is a 0.6 centimeter diameter copper
      screw, also extends through the cylinder head (18) into the
      expansion chamber (24). An alternate to this is to use an aluminum
      post with a small pod at the end within which would be strontium
      or a similar accelerant.<br>
      <br>
      [0026] As shown in FIG. 1, provided on the cylinder head (18) is a
      refueling port (76), provided with a valve (78) to allow infusion
      of a gas into the expansion chamber (24) without having to
      disassemble the motor (10). Also provided on the cylinder head
      (18) is a system sensor (80). The sensor (80) is an insulated
      length of 18 gauge copper wire that protrudes 2 mm into the
      transition chamber. This sensor (80) connects to the Electronic
      Control System (84) and detects the status of Plasmic Transition
      Process sequence.<br>
      <br>
      [0027] A sensor (82) such as those known in the art, is coupled to
      the crankshaft (36) to indicate the position of the piston (22)
      relative to the TDC position. Alternatively, a magnet may be
      mounted to the flywheel (40) and a Hall Effect switch mounted in a
      stationary position in the crankcase (38), and actuated by the
      magnet as the magnet comes into proximity with the Hall Effect
      switch.<br>
      <br>
      [0028] The electronic control system (ECS) of the present
      invention is shown generally as (84) in FIG. 5. The ECS (84)
      includes an embedded control system (86), provided with a central
      processing unit, such as a microprocessor (88), onboard RAM (90)
      and flash memory (92). In this embodiment the 8-bit microprocessor
      (88) can control 24 lines providing selective switching of up to 8
      Coils and 8 voltage lines. As shown in the schematic of FIG. 6, to
      accommodate more lines, additional processors (100) may be used.
      Alternatively, larger 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit processors may be
      used.<br>
      <br>
      [0029] Coupled to the embedded control system (86) are two DC to
      DC converters (94) and (96) which are in turn coupled to a battery
      (98). (FIG. 5). The battery (98) is preferably between 9-38 VDC.
      The first converter (94) converts voltage from the battery (98) to
      12, 24, 36 or 48 VDC. The second converter (96) is digital
      programmed variable, configured to convert voltage from the
      battery (98) to 6 to 48 VDC as desired to control the speed
      voltage used by the engine electromagnetic coils for operation of
      the variable speed of the motor (10) and to accommodate various
      fuel mixtures wherein. The embedded control system (86) uses
      selector/buffers (102) and (104) coupled to the converters (94)
      and (96) to vary the voltage output to the switch controller
      (106). The switch controller (106) is an 8-bit microprocessor
      which controls the switching of the various components of the
      motor (10). The switch controller (106) is buffered from the high
      energy switching of Coils, IGBT, and expansion chamber
      electromagnetic coils and DMOSFET, by driver buffer circuits to
      insure safety.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] The ECS (84) is coupled to the crankshaft sensor (82) and
      the sensor (80) provided within the transition chamber (25) to
      allow the ECS (84) to determine the status of plasma transition.
      (FIGS. 1-5). The ECS (84) may also be coupled to other
      instruments, such as the valve (78) coupled to the refueling port
      (76), to allow the ECS (84) to trigger automatic refueling of the
      motor (10). The ECS (84) is coupled to a starter (108) which in
      turn is coupled to an electric motor (110) coupled to the flywheel
      (40). The radio frequency generator (52) is coupled to the ECS
      (84), allowing the ECS (84) to be programmed to generate various
      radio frequencies for use as speed changes and to accommodate
      various designs of the motor (10), fuel mixtures.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] The second selector/buffer (104) and ECS (84) are coupled
      to a high voltage controller (112), which in turn is coupled to
      the four high voltage coils (58), (60), (62) and (64). The switch
      controller (106) and the selector/buffers (102) and (104) are
      coupled to a male connector (114) to allow the ECS (84) to be
      connected to the coils (46), (48) and (50) and any other
      components of the motor (10) desired to be controlled by the ECS
      (84). These switches are high power IGBT devices to control the
      coil dwell or high power DMOSFET switches for the electromagnetic
      coils.<br>
      <br>
      [0032] As seen from FIG. 5, the ECS (84) controls the conversion
      of input voltage from the battery (98) to the voltage for
      recharging the four high voltage coils (58), (60), (62) and (64),
      as well as the variable voltage output to the coils (46), (48) and
      (50), to control the speed of the motor (10). The ECS (84) also
      controls the power and frequency of the RF signal generated by the
      radio frequency generator (52) to accommodate motor design,
      desired speed and fuel mixture requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [0033] FIGS. 6-8 show schematics of the ECS (84) for motor (10) of
      the present invention provided with the supplemental cylinder
      assembly (118), of a construction similar to that described above
      and controlled by the ECS (84). The supplemental cylinder assembly
      (118) is positioned parallel to the cylinder (14), having a piston
      (119) offset one stroke from the piston (22) and coupled to the
      crankshaft (22) to drive the crankshaft (22) and flywheel (40)
      when the piston (22) is on its recovery stroke. (FIG. 1). As shown
      in FIG. 6, the ECS (84) has a Controller Area Network (CAN) bus
      interface (120), allowing various components of the motor control
      systems (10) to communicate directly with one another, or with
      components of a vehicle (not shown) associated with the motor
      (10). The ECS (84) is also provided with a debug/program interface
      (122) to allow software bug fixes and programming of the ECS (84).
      This programming port allows the test engineer to fine tune the
      controller functions to fit the specific engine, initiator, gas
      mixture or other variation that will be needed as new instances
      are created and once complete to store that program for future
      use. This provides a very large economy of use on the
      manufacturer.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] As shown in FIG. 7, the ECS (84) accomplishes power
      switching of the controls the four high voltage coils (58), (60),
      (62) and (64) using insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT)
      devices (124), (126), (128) and (130) comprising 500 to 800 Volts
      at 10 to 40 Amp 50 KW to 320 KW switches. The ECS (84)
      accomplishes the power switching of the coils (46), (48) and (50),
      using metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET)
      devices (132), (134), (136) and (138). FIG. 8 shows the ECS (84)
      schematic of the starter control (140) and refueling control
      (142). FIG. 8 also shows the ECS (84) schematic for the radio
      frequency power generator (144) and (146) for the radio frequency
      generator (52) described above and the radio frequency generator
      (147) associated with the supplemental cylinder assembly (118).
      (FIGS. 1-8).<br>
      <br>
      [0035] When it is desired to operate the motor (10), the expansion
      chamber (24) is evacuated and the ECS (84) is programmed using the
      debug/program interface (122) to operate as follows: The ECS (84)
      actuates the valve (78) to dose the expansion chamber (24) with
      fuel until the pressure within the expansion chamber (24) is
      approximately one atmosphere. The fuel may be any desired
      combination of the noble gases: helium (He), neon (Ne), argon
      (Ar), krypton (Kr), xenon (Xe), and radon (Rn). One fuel mixture
      known in the art is a combination by volume of 35.6% helium, 26.2%
      neon, 16.9% argon, 12.7% krypton and 8.5% xenon. While radon may
      be used, it is inherently unstable and may cause an undesirably
      large release of energy. Similarly, hydrogen may be used in the
      mixture if it is desired to speed up the reaction or generate
      additional power as may be the case with larger displacement
      engines.<br>
      <br>
      [0036] After dosing the expansion chamber (24) with fuel, the ECS
      (84) actuates the electric motor (110) coupled to the flywheel
      (40) to turn the crankshaft (36) and drive the connecting rod (34)
      and piston (22) until the motor (10) begins to operate under its
      own power. While the electric motor (110) is engaged, the ECS (84)
      monitors the crankshaft sensor (82) to determine when the piston
      (22) is at TDC and start the excitation cycle while applying a
      recharge cycle to the supplemental cylinder assembly (118) as it
      returns from bottom dead center (BDC) toward TDC.<br>
      <br>
      [0037] The ECS (84) begins the excitation cycle by supplying the
      variable or “speed” voltage to the supplemental, cylinder and
      transition coils (46), (48) and (50) creating an electro magnetic
      field, so that the north pole of the electro magnet over the
      cylinder (14) is on the same end as the high voltage electrodes
      (68), (70), (72) and (74). The change in voltage to these coils
      (46), (48) and (50) “squeezes” the fuel within the cylinder (14),
      compressing the fuel mixture within the cylinder (14) to the
      center and presetting the ionic form of the lighter gases. By
      varying the voltage supplied to the coils (46), (48) and (50) the
      ECS (84) controls the speed at which the motor (10) operates.
      Increasing the voltage packs the fuel more tightly, increasing the
      eventual rate of transition of the plasma fuel and with it the
      linear movement of the piston (22) toward BDC, which the
      connecting rod (34) translates into increase speed of rotation of
      the crankshaft (36).<br>
      <br>
      [0038] As the piston reaches ̃5 degrees from TDC, the ECS (84)
      actuates the four high voltage coils (58), (60), (62) and (64),
      initiating a simple high voltage, 100 KV, arc within the expansion
      chamber (24). At the same time, the ECS (84) initiates the
      addition of 2.05 to 47.12 MHz radio frequency (RF) energy into the
      expansion chamber (24) by providing the radio frequency generator
      (52) with 12 volts at 8.2 amps (−100 W) to introduce RF energy
      into the expansion chamber (24) via the high frequency antenna
      (54).<br>
      <br>
      [0039] As the piston reaches ̃45 degrees past TDC, the ECS (84)
      increases or decreases the voltage applied to the coil (48) as
      desired to either speed up or slow down the reaction within the
      cylinder. The specific expansion coefficient is a variant of the
      gas mixture. Expansion for the fuel mixture listed above is about
      five times its original volume.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] The heavier elements in the fuel will not be a part of this
      reaction as the excitation is removed before it has time for them
      to be effected. The heavier elements act as a buffer between the
      plasma, the piston and cylinder wall, allowing a targeted push on
      the piston by the Plasmic transition. The heavier elements are in
      the mix as a buffer to isolate the plasma from anything that could
      disrupt the transformation. For example, if the plasma was to
      touch the interior of the cylinder (14), it would lose the ongoing
      ability to expand and would immediately retract, so the buffering
      is important.<br>
      <br>
      [0041] The ECS (84) also supplies a recharge voltage to the
      supplemental cylinder coil assembly (118) to help regenerate the
      fuel into gas to get it recombined and ready. As the fuel converts
      back to gas, it shrinks to form a partial vacuum within the
      chamber as it returns to one atmosphere and the squeeze provides
      quicker return to a stable state.<br>
      <br>
      [0042] As soon as the sensor (80) indicates to the ECS (84) that
      ignition has occurred, the ECS (84) disables voltage to the four
      high voltage coils (58), (60), (62) and (64) as the transformation
      to a plasma has started. As soon as the sensor (80) notes that the
      power has decreased by 50%, the ECS (84) disables voltage to the
      radio frequency generator (52). The power and wavelength of the RF
      energy within the transition chamber (25) also dictates the speed
      of operation of the motor (100). The higher the frequency, the
      faster the ionization process takes place and the faster the motor
      (10) operates. The piston should be just over half way down toward
      BDC Bottom Dead Center) at this time.<br>
      <br>
      [0043] The Transition cycle is allowed to start its collapse,
      which actually takes place and completes just before BDC. At or
      about BDC, the ECS (84) removes the speed voltage from the coil
      (50) and places a recharge voltage on the coils (46), (48) and
      (50), if needed, for collapse. As the piston (22) begins to move
      back upward toward TDC, the ECS (84) recognizes the upward speed
      of the piston (22) which allows the ECS (84) to adjust voltages
      and duration to either speed up or slow down the motor (10).<br>
      <br>
      [0044] The ECS (84) keys off of signals produced by the sensor
      (80), comprising at least one for TDC, and may include multiple
      pulses to further locate the piston (22) position within the 360
      degree rotational cycle of a single power cycle. This input is
      then translated into internal processor signals to energize the
      three coils (46), (48) and (50), radio frequency generator (52)
      and four high voltage electrodes (68), (70), (72) and (74) to
      function at their proper time in relation to the placement of the
      piston (22) within cylinder (14) and the 360 degree arc of the
      crankshaft (36) as set by a predetermined set of parameters. If,
      at any point the ECS (84) detects a decrease in energy output of
      the motor, the ECS (84) triggers the valve (78) to provide
      additional fuel into the expansion chamber (24) through the
      refueling port (76).<br>
      <br>
      [0045] Although the invention has been described with respect to a
      preferred embodiment thereof, it is to be understood that it is
      not to be so limited since changes and modifications can be made
      therein which are within the full, intended scope of this
      invention as defined by the appended claims. As an example, the
      motor may be provided with four, five or more coils which the ECS
      (84) can switch in sequence. In another example, the ECS (84) may
      be coupled to device, such as generator, water or air pump etc.,
      to automatically adjust the output of the motor (10) according to
      the changing demands of the device. In yet another example, the RF
      power may be increased to 900 MHz to 1.7 GHz, or higher. As the RF
      frequency goes up, the power required to excite the fuel goes
      down. The ECS has the ability to sense and react to the engine and
      it can be programmed to control engines of any design, so any
      static timing given is for instructional purposes as a starting
      point for fine tuning.<br>

        was bizarre, labyrinthian, and astonishing with its mother-lode
        of unexpected findings— from nuclear-scale excess heat to the
        rebirth of alchemy in low-energy nuclear transmutation,
        discoveries alternately persecuted or ignored by the scientific
        establishment— the cold fusion adventure doesn't hold a nuclear
        candle to the story of Joseph Papp and his noble gas engine. The
        Papp engine saga seems to have had its roots in the 1950s, but
        it only came into public view in 1968. And, strangely enough,
        there may well be an underlying physics that links elements of
        the two stories and their profoundly heretical science.
        Pathological skeptics of cold fusion— and perhaps some cold
        fusion researchers— may laugh at or recoil from this synthesis,
        but they will be treading on thin ice.</p>

        appeared in California's San Jose Mercury News newspaper on
        August 27, 1989. We have reprinted David Ansley's exemplary
        account, which was triggered by the cold fusion announcement
        some four months earlier (p. 14). Read Ansley's piece to get the
        gist of what had happened up to mid-1989 with the Papp engine.
        We also reprint a well done story that ran much earlier in
        Private Pilot, in December 1968 (p. 49). But the Papp saga has
        progressed far beyond those days, hence we are devoting a
        substantial portion of this issue of Infinite Energy just to
        begin to recount the tale of the Papp engine as it has never
        been done before. There is very likely to be more to come. . .so
        stay tuned. (We are looking into the possibility of preparing a
        DVD made from video tapes of Papp's demonstrations already in
        our possession and from present day experiments, if permissions
        can be obtained.) This editor has been aware of claims about the
        Papp engine since about 1992, but it has only been within the
        past three years that sufficient information has emerged to
        change my view from curious onlooker to acceptance of the
        engine's validity.</p>

        word-spacing: 0px;">The basic "problem" with cold fusion is, of
        course, that water in contact with metals with a bit of low
        voltage electrical excitation is not supposed to make nuclear
        reactions and release huge thermal excess energy per atom of
        presumed reactant. The problem with Papp's noble gas engine is
        that the noble gases employed— argon, helium, krypton, neon, and
        xenon— are essentially non-reactive chemical elements (except in
        certain exotic combinations known to modern chemists); that's
        why they are called noble. How can such gases, "pre-treated" or
        otherwise, explode with unusual violence and drive a
        reciprocating single-cycle engine— a retrofit device from an
        ordinary gasoline engine (lubricated with oil to be sure), but
        one with no cooling system, no fuel system, and no exhaust? On
        its face, Papp's engine appears inconceivable— until the
        evidence is weighed very carefully. Once the battery-driven
        electric starter revved up the Papp engine (according to dozens
        of initially skeptical witnesses), the engine— equipped with an
        alternator— ran with no outside electrical input. And, even if
        such "miracle" reactions of noble gases should produce
        interminable explosions from a tiny volume of gas, pushing
        pistons and driving a large flywheel, why didn't such an engine
        run very hot? It didn't. What about the supposed need for a much
        lower temperature reservoir to make this "heat" engine work at
        all? If the engine is a monumental "fraud," it is a very, very
        challenging one to try to pull off.</p>

        How to begin? Let's try this synopsis: A technically schooled
        draftsman and ex-pilot, Josef Papp (pronounced "Pop" in proper
        Hungarian), emigrated from Hungary to Canada in 1957 after the
        ill-fated anti-Communist revolt and Soviet invasion of his
        country. Perhaps he may have made paper or microfiche copies of
        documents relating to some sensitive R&amp;D projects in Hungary
        and he took them with him to the New World? That's only educated
        speculation. Otherwise, if his independently developed ideas
        really worked, as they seem to have, he was either extremely
        lucky in finding a hidden secret of Nature, or he was an
        unfathomable genius. He did not seem like the latter. From all
        accounts, he was an extremely paranoid, very unstable, selfish,
        and unpredictable man, who was probably one of his own worst
        enemies. There is little evidence that he understood the physics
        of what he had, but however the process was developed— it seemed
        to have worked in a way that seems "too good to be true"— it was
        an almost fully formed new energy technology that came very
        close to coming under the wings of some of the world's largest
        technology corporations.</p>

        word-spacing: 0px;">The story entered its second phase with what
        seems like a preposterous diversion: In Canada in the early
        1960s, Papp worked secretively to develop a mysterious, sleek
        "submarine" that looks like something out of a "Star Wars"
        movie. He claimed that he would cross the Atlantic with it in
        much less than a day— that's what he told Canadian television.
        (It was a big media story in Canada in the summer of 1966, but
        most of you probably missed it, though Papp wrote a now hard-to
        find book about the episode, entitled The Fastest Submarine.)
        Then he disappeared. Within days, Papp was found by authorities
        bloodied and floating on a rubber raft off the coast of France.
        Papp claims to have made the ocean crossing in only thirteen
        hours after he left North America. Where was the wondrous
        submarine? "Lost at sea," of course, according to Papp. The
        fantastic claim was soon debunked in a very embarrassing way—
        but, in truth, no one has ever found the submarine either in
        Canada or in the Atlantic. Why Papp thought he could get away
        with this stunt and how this episode seems to clash with what
        comes next— the scientifically interesting part of the Papp
        saga— is a mystery and may forever be. Papp is dead— cancer took
        him on April 13, 1989, three weeks after Fleischmann and Pons
        announced cold fusion.</p>

        word-spacing: 0px;">But apart from this embarrassing, bizarre
        episode with the submarine, Papp left behind one of the most
        tantalizing legacies in the history of free energy: There exists
        nearly rock-solid evidence now that Papp really had managed to
        build a robust engine of over 100 horsepower (75 kilowatts) that
        was "fueled" by a mixture of, we believe, "pre-treated" noble
        gases (probably mixed with some air). Though it had no exhaust
        and no cooling system, it had huge torque even at low RPM (776
        foot-pounds at only 726 RPM, the result of one certified test—
        see Exhibit A.) [Exhibits from this Introduction to the Issue 51
        cover story are not available on the website.] Dozens of
        astonished engineers, scientists, and investors— even a Federal
        judge with an engineering background was blown away by it— have
        seen the engine working in closed rooms for hours, which would
        have killed its occupants with toxic gases had it been a
        hydrocarbon-fuel engine. There was absolutely no exhaust, no
        visible provision for any exhaust! The engine ran cool— only
        about 60°C (140°F) on its surface, it has been reported by
        several reliable observers. All these people, who had years to
        try to debunk it, became convinced of the engine's reality. They
        all failed to discover a hoax. But here is the ultimate triumph
        of the Papp engine: Today, ongoing research in the United
        States— totally independent of Papp and his former financial
        interests— has proved conclusively that noble gases,
        electrically triggered in various ways, can indeed explode with
        fantastic violence and energy release— melting metal parts and
        pushing pistons with large pressure pulses. Some of the people
        performing this work, or who have evaluated it, are from the
        cold fusion field, others are experienced plasma physicists.
        Some will allow their names to be revealed, while others in
        senior positions at major research institutions must remain
        anonymous for now. I am confident, however, that these
        scientists will eventually "go public." They should, when
        circumstances permit.</p>

        Apart from the intense contemporary work to resurrect the Papp
        engine in its full cycling functionality and the independent
        certification test in 1983 (see p. 9), what other proof is there
        that Papp's engine was for real? Sad to say, this evidence is
        the death of one person and the severe injury of three others at
        a public demonstration of the engine on November 18, 1968 in
        Gardena, California. At that event, the engine exploded with an
        evident energy release that no internal combustion engine could
        touch. Read the eyewitness testimony of engineer Cecil
        Baumgartner (p. 31) in my interview with him this year. He was
        representing the top management of the TRW aerospace corporation
        that day. The previous month (on October 27, 1968) Baumgartner
        and others had observed one of the detonation cylinders of the
        engine test fired in the California desert. In full public view,
        just a few cubic centimeters of noble gas had been admitted with
        a hypodermic needle to the sparking chamber, and this made the
        thick steel-walled chamber peel back like a banana when the
        device was electrically triggered. The collaborating observers
        from the Naval Underseas Warfare Laboratory (as the Pasadena,
        California lab was then called), who attended the desert test,
        had earlier sealed the chamber so that Papp or others could not
        insert illicit explosives as part of a hoax. Their names,
        according to Baumgartner, were: William White, Edmund Karig, and
        James Green.</p>

        But at the public meeting the next month at which the fatality
        occurred (see the local newspaper account of the fatality and
        injuries-p. 30) was Caltech physicist Richard P. Feynman
        (1918-1988), who had worked on the Manhattan atomic bomb project
        in World War II. Before even arriving at the demonstration,
        Feynman assumed that the Papp engine, whose operation he was
        about to witness, had to be part of an elaborate hoax. We know
        this because he recounted his reactions during the episode in
        his widely circulated internet account touted by the "skeptic"
        community (see "Mr. Papf's (sic) Perpetual Motion Machine," p.
        29).</p>

        word-spacing: 0px;">But here is the central problem with
        Feynman's analysis (which has many other errors of fact and
        logic embedded in it): There was a court action against Feynman
        by Papp and his backer, Don Roser of Environetics, Inc., as a
        result of Feynman's inept attempt to disprove the Papp engine
        with his unauthorized pulling of an electric control-circuit
        wire that Feynman egregiously imagined had to be powering the
        engine. It was unfortunate for Feynman that the wire's gauge was
        far too thin even had there been a secret electric motor within
        the retrofit Volvo engine. Furthermore, as you will read, the
        engine kept running even after the flimsy wire was removed.
        Feynman asserted that Papp most likely had deliberately planned
        to blow up his own engine to avoid subsequent discovery of the
        "fraud"! And, Feynman acknowledges that there was an
        out-of-court settlement with Caltech. Surely, had there ever
        been the slightest piece of evidence that conventional
        explosives blew up the Papp engine that day, Caltech would most
        certainly not have had to settle. Papp would soon have been
        charged with manslaughter, no doubt, and Feynman would surely
        have cited this evidence publicly. He was not one to shrink from
        dramatic gestures. Caltech also had the motive and the means to
        skewer Papp with the kind of evidence that is routinely gathered
        by police departments and crime labs following explosion
        accidents.</p>

        into the accident appear to have vanished down some kind of a
        memory hole. I believe they exist somewhere, but we have not
        been able— yet— to obtain them. On June 29, 1998, Caltech's very
        helpful Associate Archivist, Shelley Erwin, faxed me: "Well, the
        mysterious affair with Mr. Papp/Papf continues to remain
        mysterious. I have found nothing in the Feynman papers that
        refers to it. Nor is there any obvious reference to Mr. Papp or
        the lawsuit in administrative or publicity papers from the time.
        We do not have a clippings file for the 1960s, so that is one
        type of resource I did not investigate. . .I think I have done
        all I can here, without any useful result. We would be
        interested to know how your search comes out— if indeed this is

        Caltech offices, which could not provide me with any records—
        not even its public information office had newsclips, and
        efforts to locate official accident reports in California have
        come up dry. Some of these may have been destroyed, according to
        some police departments contacted. After all, this is an
        accident that happened thirty-five years ago. But the point is
        that nowhere, so far, do we have any evidence that the explosion
        was a result of illicit explosives. Failing such direct evidence
        of hoax, the proved violence of the explosions— the November
        1968 and the October 1968 ones— strongly point to the reality of
        the Papp process. But we also have the contemporary laboratory
        work that establishes convincing evidence— visual and by
        instrumentation— that noble gases can be made to explode and
        achieve over-unity. Heroic work on a shoestring budget over the
        past few years is recounted in broad scope by researchers Mark
        Hugo and Blair Jenness in Minnesota (p. 51). We hope to feature
        their work in greater depth in future issues. Heinz Klostermann
        of California, whom I met two years ago, has been of great
        assistance in assembling some of the information that went into
        this issue of Infinite Energy. On p. 55, he discusses his broad
        knowledge of many of the groups working in the U.S. in the past
        and today in the effort to recover the Papp engine technology.
        He has begun his own independent initiative.</p>

        2000, with prominent positions in the cold fusion field,
        certainly estimated over-unity factors beyond 10 and perhaps
        even 100— for what may well be a suboptimal version of the Papp
        noble gas process. To run a cyclic 100 HP engine as Papp did
        would require detonation energies possibly far beyond these
        preliminary factors, but remember: no one who is attempting to
        recover the technology knows the exact pre-treatment process and
        gas mixture that Papp employed. The patents, so far, have not
        been adequate to learn exactly what was done. Finally, the
        eyewitness accounts, as well as the dynamometer test of 1983,
        give further support for the validity of the Papp technology.</p>

        helping to resolve the space shuttle Challenger accident of
        1986. The brilliant, entertaining, passionate, and often
        self-effacing physicist with the Far Rockaway, New York accent
        won the Nobel Prize for physics with Julian Schwinger and
        Sin-Itiro Tomanaga in 1965, three years before the explosion of
        the Papp engine in Gardena. He is rightly considered to be a
        very great scientist, whose quest to expand the frontiers of
        physics and to convey the excitement of science to the public
        was legendary and noble. In fact, I had often thought that if
        Feynman had lived into the cold fusion era, he might have set
        some of the anti-cold fusion bigots straight. Several years
        before Feynman's Nobel Prize award, in April 1963 in several
        wonderful lectures that have been reprinted in a book, The
        Meaning of It All (Addison-Wesley, 1998), Feynman made these
        wise observations</p>

        seem to have lost their authority completely. If one of its most
        dynamic and iconoclastic members, Feynman— a hero to physicists
        as well as to the general populace— can have made such a
        horrible error in judgment in the matter of his observation and
        actions at the Papp engine demonstration in 1968, then there is
        real trouble, and this is now proved. Feynman's tragic mistake
        would be just that, by the way— a mistake whether or not the
        Papp engine is real. If it is real, so much the worse for
        Feynman's legacy, for science, and for civilization. The
        inadequate methods by which Feynman rendered a snap judgment on
        the Papp engine that day reflected poorly on him; his methods
        were incapable of discovering the truth about this device. And
        then there are the questions about what did Feynman know and
        when did he know it, concerning any accident reports that may
        have been available to him.</p>

        cold fusion/low-energy nuclear reaction field by "authorities"
        and their followers. The so-called "skeptics" of CSICOP and
        elsewhere, who chose to use Feynman's reflections on the Papp
        demonstration as an example of how science should be done,
        should hide their heads in shame, but they won't. They will be
        outraged that one of their icons and their belief in the
        impossibility of new energy sources are found wanting. They will
        not admit this, of course.</p>

          others who have examined this patent and followed its outline
          have already been able to obtain explosive detonations in

        Assuming that the Papp engine phenomena that have been observed
        are valid, no one can claim to have a satisfactory and
        comprehensive explanation for what is going on. In my view, the
        physics associated with the detonation, light emission, and
        other phenomena in these noble gas explosions is quite beyond
        contemporary understanding. It is of interest that Dr. Randell
        Mills and his colleagues at BlackLight Power Corporation have
        observed excess heat phenomena associated with microwave
        stimulation of helium and hydrogen mixtures, but not krypton and
        argon mixtures. I'm not sure that this has any direct bearing on
        the Papp conditions, but I mention it for completeness.</p>

        were kind enough to abstract for inclusion in this issue of
        Infinite Energy (p. 61) a report that they prepared in the
        mid-1990s concerning the Papp technology— or at least a crude
        copy of it. This was based on a limited view; they were given
        only a video tape, the performance claims, and the patents. They
        discuss the differences between the plasma and energy phenomena
        they have pioneered in their PAGDTM excess energy technology,
        and what they could gather from the Papp technology
        experimenters' claims.</p>

        information about it, such as the one from the U.S. Army shown
        in Exhibit B, but the other responses evidence the kind of grave
        science and technology policy problems in government that would
        emerge in the cold fusion era. Some letters show that the same

        serving in DOE during the Carter Administration, dismisses the
        Papp engine in his thinly disguised negative letter to Senator
        Hatch of Utah (Exhibit F). Ironically, Deutch would later play a
        two-faced role in the cold fusion saga as it unfolded at MIT
        when he was Provost there in 1989 (see IE #24). He later became
        Director of the CIA, but was caught in an egregious computer
        security lapse, which could have landed him in jail.</p>

        Navy Rear Admiral writes to President Carter in an effort to

        have misguided McMillian about his credentials (Papp had no
        doctorate) and the date of his arrival in the U.S.<br>
        An insulting letter from the DOE (just months before cold fusion
        was announced) to one of the witnesses to the Papp engine
        testing is shown in Exhibit H. George Lewnes, who had an
        engineering background, had seen the engine run in Florida. Here
        DOE touts its hot fusion program as the only possible route to
        fusion! Always the same excuse for not investigating new
        processes.</p>

          Forward</span><br>
        There is now a staggering amount of good information available,
        which at a bare minimum would justify a thorough review of the
        Papp engine matter by official agencies such as the U.S.
        Department of Energy and military research organizations such as
        DARPA. There is significant evidence for the release of
        heretofore unknown explosive energy from noble gas mixtures. The
        energetic level of these reactions on their face, if confirmed
        by independent review, may have serious national security and
        global security consequences (especially in this age of
        terrorist threat— use your imagination). But the cat is out of
        the bag, and it cannot be put back. One hopes that the civilian
        uses of this potential technology will far outweigh the military
        hazards.</p>

          to have brought this technology to the New World, but his
          outrageous behavior at many turns helped prevent scientific
          truth from emerging. Yet at long last, the truth is coming
          out. There needs to be a wide and deep review of the evidence.
          Unfortunately, the experience of the cold fusion/low-energy
          nuclear reaction (LENR) field over the past fourteen years, in
          trying to get an impartial DOE review of now proved and
          replicated LENR experiments, does not inspire much confidence
          that DOE or other official groups will do anything about this—
          even if the evidence is shoved in their faces. The John
          Huizengas, William Happers, Richard Garwins, and Steve Koonins
          (Caltech) of this world wield enormous influence within
          government. They know a priori that cold fusion, and now the
          Papp engine, are nonsense. Therefore, it will fall to the
          private sector and to individual scientific researchers to
          deal with or not deal with the Papp engine enigma. We hope
          that this beginning of Infinite Energy's coverage of the Papp
          engine, and the science that may underlie it, will contribute
          to the search for scientific truth. Perhaps the Papp saga, and
          particularly Richard Feynman's negative role in it, will yet
          help to catalyze a long overdue review by mainstream science
          of what it thinks it knows and what it thinks it knows cannot
          be.<br>
