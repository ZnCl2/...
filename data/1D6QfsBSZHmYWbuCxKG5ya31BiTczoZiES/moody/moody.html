      ...So I was at work, and working in a hospital, we began
      discussing healthcare and the financial problems that are
      resulting from the low reimbursements which are directly impacting
      patient care. The conversation then progressed to other ways the
      government is screwing people, and ended with this ...<br>
      <br>
      My coworker has an uncle whom I had not heard of, Ralph Moody. She
      said she forgets what he did, but he created an 80+ mpg car 30
      years ago, that garnered offer from foreign interests in excess of
      20 million. She said her uncle was very patriotic, and turned them
      down wanting to sell the technology to an American car company
      perhaps, but not to a foreign group. This car, which did not start
      out as a low MPG project, utilized a carburetor they created to
      achieve these outstanding results. The federal government showed a
      lot of interest in the car, so much that they confiscated it. My
      coworker said the car still sits in a storage area in North
      Carolina and that her family is allowed to use it, but the
      property can not be passed down, it no longer belongs to them. I
      am not one to believe in these magic carburetors, I would love to
      know more about this particular car...<br>

      "What happened to this?" asks reader Pete Kontes about a 1979 AP
      wire story clipped from his local paper, the Post-Register, in
      Idaho Falls, Idaho.<br>
      <br>
      The headline screams, "Former racer could have energy crisis
      killer."<br>
      <br>
      Readers of a certain age will recognize 1979 as the time between
      Energy Crisis One and Energy Crisis Two, a grim era of fuel
      shortages and lines at gas pumps following the OPEC embargo of
      1973-74.<br>
      <br>
      The "racer" here was Ralph Moody, most famous as the mechanical
      wizard who had teamed up with super salesman John Holman to form
      Holman-Moody, which went through NASCAR in the '60s like Patton
      had gone through Africa two decades before.<br>
      <br>
      According to the old clipping: "In tests recently at Daytona Beach
      Community College, Moody's 1979 Mercury Capri test car got an
      astounding 84 miles to a gallon. The skeptical test supervisor,
      Bill Gordon, who has supervised Environmental Protection Agency
      fuel economy tests before, couldn't believe it. 'It is the car of
      the century,' Gordon said enthusiastically after the test."<br>
      <br>
      The article's description of the engine sounds confused. Moody is
      quoted as saying, "We took a four-cylinder Perkins block,
      converted it to diesel fuel, turbocharged it, and built a special
      clutch, transmission, and rear-end setup."<br>
      <br>
      Other sources simply say it was a Perkins diesel, which sounds
      more likely.<br>
      <br>
      Those years of iffy fuel supply had the car market in a panic,
      with frugal Japanese sedans selling far above sticker price and
      Detroit still caught in the Cutlass Supreme era of chromey
      two-door hardtop coupes about the size and weight of today's SUVs
      but with no space in the back seat. American Motors had already
      responded by dragging its compact Hornet sedan out behind the barn
      and whacking off most of the useful parts—all of the trunk and a
      major section of the back seat—to create the worthless Gremlin.<br>
      <br>
      Motorists wanted miles per gallon, and they wanted it instantly.
      But elephants can't zig. Detroit factories were mostly tooled for
      big iron. The industry seemed unresponsive, and the media had the
      persistent notion that some guy somewhere in a one-car garage,
      armed with only a screwdriver and a Crescent wrench, could
      outengineer General Motors. The papers were filled with breathless
      stories like the one of Moody's Capri.<br>
      <br>
      "We just got flooded" with inventors, Howard Padgham remembered
      recently. He's retired now after years heading Chrysler's
      powertrain engineering. But neither he nor I remembered Moody's
      car.<br>
      <br>
      I spent a week in Moody's shop back in 1974 doing field surgery on
      this magazine's full-race Pinto after an inglorious debut at
      Talladega. Within hours of leaving, we qualified on the pole for
      the Charlotte race and later won it with a big lead. I'm sure the
      other competitors thought Moody had uncorked a few speed secrets
      for me.<br>
      <br>
      If he had sure-fire recipes, he didn't share them. He seemed a
      sensible guy, careful about the details as he understood them. He
      left the big talk to others.<br>
      <br>
      The rumor had been floating around about a Moody mileage maker for
      a few months before the Capri appeared, something on the order of
      60 to 70 mpg. About these numbers, he said later, "They were a
      little conservative—on purpose. If you come right out saying
      you've got a car that'll get 80 to 90 miles per gallon, people
      will think you're some kind of jerk."<br>
      <br>
      Yes, that sounds like the Ralph Moody I knew. He was no Smokey
      Yunick. But we'll come to the Smoke's mileage maker in a bit.<br>
      <br>
      Padgham confirms another detail of the times. Most of the
      inventors who came forward with magic miles-per-gallon numbers
      "were normal people, not charlatans." They set up their tests at
      constant speeds, on level roads, with their engines fully warmed
      up. In that driving, even the relatively primitive engines of the
      time went far on a gallon.<br>
      <br>
      Moody died last summer, so we can't ask him about the Capri, but I
      did find it listed in Government Involvement in Suppressed
      Inventions, by Pea Research (iaesr.homestead.com). The lengthy
      compendium confirms that carburetors were favorite breakthroughs
      for Uncle Sam's squelching, along with a reassuring number of
      flying saucers. My thanks to Pea Research for answering reader
      Kontes's question more eloquently than I could have.<br>
      <br>
      Before we leave the topic of government suppression, however,
      let's put Moody's achievement in perspective: "They" also got to a
      "highly modified 1959 Opel" credited with 376.59 mpg.<br>
      <br>
      I don't doubt Padgham when he says most of the inventors weren't
      charlatans, but it wasn't always easy to tell the difference.
      Early in 1984 I went down to "The Best Damn Garage in Town," town
      being Daytona Beach, Florida, along with Don Sherman, C/D
      technical director at that time, for a look at Smokey Yunick's
      "phase-one adiabatic hot-vapor" engine. It was a 2.2-liter
      Chrysler four promising 0 to 60 in six seconds and 50 mpg.<br>
      <br>
      Sherman and I are both engineers by training and wary of those who
      claim to have found an end run around the laws of thermodynamics.
      Yunick had been doing his rulebook double-shuffle against NASCAR's
      canniest tech inspectors for decades before we arrived. We didn't
      expect a PowerPoint presentation. What we got was the full wizard
      act, a sinewy guy in the white coveralls you see "before" in the
      detergent commercials. Even at breakfast I don't remember that he
      removed his bad-cowboy black hat. It was oil-soaked at the band
      and permanently embedded with aluminum chips from his machine
      shop.<br>
      <br>
      He was 60 then. I think the man and his act were already
      inseparable. If you fell for the act, maybe you wouldn't notice
      the fundamental outrageousness of his claims. He had a
      high-compression engine with a turbocharger. Very risky with the
      crude controls of mixture and timing of those days. The usual
      technique then and now is to add an intercooler to the intake
      stream. Yunick had an interheater instead. Yes, retaining heat
      helps efficiency, at least theoretically, but you might just as
      well put a .357 Magnum to the cylinder head.<br>
      <br>
      We went out for a test drive. The car pulled like hell. It pinged
      like hell, too, and busted a piston early in the acceleration
      runs.<br>
      <br>
      Yunick stuck to his story. We didn't buy it. Later I heard that he
      had sold his "hot vapor" patents to some big company, along with a
      multi-year consulting contract that would keep the cash flowing
      into his pockets. For the honest inventors and for the charlatans
      alike, that was always the touchdown.<br>
      <br>
      Was he on to something we simply couldn't comprehend? Let's just
      say, two decades and many mpg regulations later, I don't see any
      "hot vapor" engines. <br>

      <div align="center"><b>Ralph Moody May Travel the Road to Riches
          in a Diesel Car That Gets 84 Miles Per Gallon</b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Sandra Hinson</b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      About a year ago Ralph Moody, a legendary stock car driver and
      mechanic, was thinking about retiring. “All I wanted to do,” he
      says, “was a little bit of nothing.” Today Moody has postponed the
      rocking chair in favor of rocking the auto industry. He and a pal
      have designed a car with an engine that gets up to 84 miles to a
      gallon of diesel fuel. The Moodymobile, as it’s called, came out
      of the Oak Hill, Fla. auto shop of Mike Shetley, whom Moody knew
      from their days together on the Ford racing team. Shetley had
      summoned his old boss from his Charlotte, N.C. home to help with a
      complicated chassis for a Thunderbird replica. Moody, 60, solved
      the problem in a week, and soon the men were talking about
      building a sports car with a diesel engine. “The idea wasn’t high
      mileage in the beginning,” says Shetley, 36. “We wanted a
      nice-driving car for the guy who couldn’t afford luxury.”<br>
      <br>
      What they did was modify, inside and out, a four-cylinder Perkins
      diesel engine (like those used in motorboats) and drop it into a
      1979 Capri body, adding a turbocharger for extra power. (The
      turbocharger reroutes hot exhaust gases that normally escape from
      the tail pipe.) The Moodymobile was soon stirring interest locally
      and was test-driven by Congressman Bill Chappell. He immediately
      wired President Carter: “I’ve seen it, I’ve driven it and it
      works.”<br>
      <br>
      A fortnight ago Moody and Shetley drove the car 850 miles to
      Washington, D.C. (on 11.1 gallons of fuel) and testified before
      the Senate Energy Committee. The car (which is noisier than a
      conventional one) faces a stiff battery of environmental tests
      before it can be marketed, but Moody is confident one of the big
      automakers will buy the rights to the patent. Ford, Chrysler and
      General Motors have all expressed interest.<br>
      <br>
      Born in Massachusetts, Moody raced midget cars as a teenager and
      in 1956 joined Ford, later becoming chief mechanic. That meant
      giving up competitive driving. “I could still outrun them,” he
      proclaims. “I did all the test work.” Champion drivers like Mario
      Andretti, A.J. Foyt, Cale Yarborough and Bobby Allison have won
      with Moody-groomed Fords. He also designed much of the safety
      equipment now standard in stock cars.<br>
      <br>
      When Ford stopped racing in 1971, Moody opened a small “speed
      shop” in Charlotte (a city he, his wife Mitzi, 53, son Ralph III
      and daughter Ann have lived in for 23 years). He began selling
      race cars to drivers and, as a sideline, refined a gasoline engine
      that gets up to 65 miles per gallon. “We put it on the shelf,”
      Moody shrugs. “Nobody needed it then.”<br>
      <br>
      Shetley claims — perhaps extravagantly — that they have turned
      down $100 million from Arab interests to buy rights to the
      Moodymobile, which has cost them $20,000 to develop. Meanwhile,
      the designers are filing away in cardboard boxes the names of
      private citizens eager to place orders. Possibly 2,000 of the cars
      will be available late this year for about $7,000 apiece. And for
      the time being, Ralph Moody has put off retirement. “In the old
      days on the racing circuit, I worked day and night,” he smiles.
      “Now it’s only 20 hours a day.”<br>

        <b>APPARATUS REGULATING EXHAUST FLOW TO INCREASE BACK PRESSURE
          IN AN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE</b><br>
      </div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      Inventor: MOODY RALPH A JR<br>
      <br>
      The internal combustion engine (10) includes a fuel delivery
      system (200) and an exhaust system having an apparatus (44) for
      regulating exhaust flow to increase engine back pressure. In
      response to regulated exhaust flow and increased engine back
      pressure, the fuel delivery system (200) is controlled to decrease
      fuel flow resulting in increased fuel efficiency of the engine and
      decreased exhaust emissions. A forced air induction system such as
      a turbocharger (80) or supercharger may also be used in conjuction
      with the engine (10). In preferred embodiments, the exhaust flow
      regulating apparatus (44) is either a fixed cross-sectional area
      orifice or a variable cross-sectional area orifice.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Background of the Invention</b><br>
      <br>
      Internal combustion engines are widely used to provide power for
      vehicles and machinery, and therefore, it is desirable to design
      these engines so that fuel consumption and emissions are reduced.<br>
      <br>
      Air flow through conventional diesel internal combustion engines
      is not controlled and exhaust flow is generally increased by
      designing these engines with reduced exhaust restrictions. Air
      flow through conventional gasoline engines is controlled by
      restrictions in the induction side which create lower than wide
      open throttle combustion pressures resulting in combustion
      efficiency losses under normal operation. Prior art teaches that
      internal combustion engine efficiencies are improved by reducing
      exhaust system restrictions.In a Society of Automotive Engineers
      article titled "The Influence of the Exhaust Back Pressure of a
      Piston Engine on Air Consumption, Performance, and Emissions",
      January 8-12, 1973, the authors showed that engine air consumption
      responds to variation of the ratio of absolute exhaust back
      pressure to absolute inlet manifold pressure with a strong
      dependence on engine speed, and that exhaust back pressure affects
      performance and lowers some exhaust emissions. The authors,
      however, did not investigate how fuel efficiency is affected when
      exhaust flow is regulated to increase engine back pressure while
      at the same time reducing fuel flow.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Summary of the Invention</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The internal combustion engine of the invention includes a fuel
      delivery system and an exhaust system having an apparatus for
      regulating exhaust flow through the engine to increase engine back
      pressure. In response to regulated exhaust flow and increased
      engine back pressure, the fuel delivery system is controlled to
      decrease fuel flow resulting in increased fuel efficiency. Reduced
      exhaust emissions also result. A forced air induction system such
      as a turbocharger or supercharger may also be used in conjunction
      with the engine.<br>
      <br>
      In general, the apparatus for controlling exhaust flow and
      increasing engine back pressure is any restriction positioned
      within the exhaust system of either a diesel or gasoline (spark
      ignition) internal combustion engine. In one embodiment the
      apparatus is a venturi system having a large opening tapering to a
      smaller opening that allows exhaust to flow from the large opening
      through the smaller opening. Alternatively, the exhaust flows
      through a venturi system having an opening formed by a fixed side
      and a movable side adjustable at various engine operating
      parameters by an actuating system to establish a desired increase
      in back pressure.<br>
      <br>
      The internal combustion engine of the invention directly
      contradicts the prior art in that back pressure is increased
      resulting in increased fuel efficiency. The advantages of the
      internal combustion engine of the invention are that fuel
      efficiency is increased because induction side losses of the gas
      engine can be reduced, the dynamic combustion pressures of both
      diesel and gas engines are increased, exhaust flow in both diesel
      and gas engines is controlled, and when utilized in conjunction
      with a forced air induction system such as a turbocharger or
      supercharger, the invention eliminates the need for and efficiency
      losses of a dump valve or wastegate valve that is normally
      required for forced air induction system overpressure protection.<br>

      </b><br>
      As shown in Fig. 1, an internal combustion engine 10 includes a
      cylinder head 12, intake manifold 14, exhaust manifold 16 and a
      controllable fuel delivery system 200 as shown in Fig. 8. The
      exhaust manifold 16 includes a pair of hollow spaced legs 18 and
      20 connected to the cylinder head 12 by plates 22 and fasteners
      24. Alternatively, plates 22 can be welded to the cylinder head 12
      or be cast integrally with the cylinder head 12 with the prime
      consideration being that whatever mode of connection is used the
      connection should be substantiaffily airtight. The free ends of
      legs 18 and 20 merge at 26 and 28 respectively, preferably in a
      smooth curvilinear manner, into a conduit passageway 30 disposed
      parallel to and spaced from the cylinder head 12.<br>
      <br>
      The free end of the conduit 30 terminates at an exhaust section
      32, this section preferably being a smooth curved section, to
      which a mounting flange 34 is secured. The flange 34 removably
      supports an exhaust pipe 36 having an inlet 38 terminating in a
      flange 40 complementally fastened to the flange 34 by nuts and
      bolts 42 or similar fasteners.<br>
      <br>
      The controllable fuel delivery system 200 as shown in Fig. 8
      comprises a fuel tank 137, fuel line 143, transfer fuel pump 142,
      fuel line 141, fuel filter 140, fuel line 139, fuel flow control
      lever 160, conventional rotary style fuel injection pump -133,
      injector lines 135, fuel injectors 134, return fuel line 138 from
      the fuel injectors 134, and return fuel line 136 from the fuel
      injection pump 133. Fuel flows from the fuel tank 137, to the
      transfer fuel pump 142, through the filter 140 to the fuel
      injection pump 133. Rate of fuel flow from the fuel injection pump
      133, via lines 135 to the fuel injectors 134, is controlled by the
      fuel flow control lever 160. Residual fuel that is not injected
      into the engine is then returned to the fuel tank 137 via the
      return lines 136 and 138. The purpose for the return lines 136 and
      138 is twofold. First, the return lines 136 and 138 allow for pump
      and injector cooling, especially under low load or idling
      conditions, and second, they allow for venting of unwanted gases
      that may accumulate in the system. The fuel flow spray pattern of
      the controllable fuel delivery system 200 may be a cone shaped
      fuel flow spray pattern.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that by regulating the exhaust flow exiting the
      engine to increase engine back pressure, air flow entering the
      engine can be controlled, and engine efficiency will be
      significantly improved when fuel flow is also reduced. Exhaust
      emissions will be significantly reduced as compared with
      conventional diesel and gas internal combustion engines.<br>
      <br>
      As shown in Fig. 2, this result is obtained by placing apparatus
      for controlling exhaust flow to increase engine back pressure
      within the exhaust system. A venturi system 44 is placed between
      exhaust section 32 of the conduit passageway 30 and the inlet 38
      of the exhaust pipe 36. The venturi system 44, in its simplest
      form, comprises a funnel-like member 46 having a large opening 48
      tapering to a smaller opening 50. A flange 52 disposed about the
      opening 48 is removably secured between exhaust section flange 34
      and inlet flange 40 by fasteners 42 for keeping the venturi system
      44 in position. The venturi system 44 may also be formed as an
      integral part of exhaust section 32 of conduit 30 or of the inlet
      38 of the exhaust pipe 36.<br>
      <br>
      Exhaust flows from the large opening 48 through the smaller
      opening 50, thus regulating exhaust flow to increase engine back
      pressure. Operation of the internal combustion engine 10
      incorporating the fixed venturi system 44 of Fig. 2 is identical
      to the operation of existing internal combustion engines commonly
      used in vehicles. The fixed venturi system 44 can also be
      incorporated into engines, such as industrial engines, operating
      under constant loads.<br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, a venturi system 44 is
      constructed as a variable cross-sectional area venturi system
      which can be utilized in engines, such as automobile engines,
      operating under a range of dynamic loads. Exhaust section 32 of
      conduit 30, shown in Fig. 1, transitions from a round to
      rectangular shape at section 56 terminating at rectangular section
      58 having a rectangular flange 60. The variable venturi system 44
      is positioned at the rectangular inlet 62 of exhaust pipe 64, such
      rectangular inlet 62 having a rectangular inlet flange 66
      connected to rectangular flange 60 by nuts and bolts 68.<br>
      <br>
      The variable venturi system 44 comprises a fixed converging side
      70, and a moveable side 72, which rotates with a shaft 74 movable
      by an arm 76 having a hole 78 for connection to an actuating
      device (not shown). In addition to increasing engine back pressure
      and reducing fuel flow, the variable venturi system 44 of the
      invention may be used as the engine's main control, thus
      eliminating the induction side throttling device currently
      required for operation of non-diesel engines.<br>
      <br>
      Rudimentary operation of the internal combustion engine 10
      incorporating the variable venturi system 44 of Figs. 3 and 4 may
      be accomplished by connecting the throttle pedal (not shown) to
      the fuel flow control lever 160 of Fig. 8 and the arm 76 of Fig. 3
      by cam linkages. Actuation of the throttle pedal will change the
      position of the fuel flow control lever 160 and cause the arm 76
      to vary the position of the movable side 72 of the venturi system
      44.<br>
      <br>
      In another embodiment, operation of the internal combustion engine
      10 incorporating the variable venturi system 44 is effectuated by
      a microprocessor (not shown) that receives information from engine
      sensors (not shown) that measure various operating parameters. The
      microprocessor analyses the received information and sends optimum
      position output information to the fuel flow control lever 160 and
      arm 76 which, in turn, positions the movable side 72 of the
      venturi system 44. Examples of sensors that may be incorporated
      into the internal combustion engine 10 of the invention are
      sensors that measure oxygen concentration, coolant temperature,
      manifold air pressure, vehicle speed, throttle position, engine
      RPM, mass air flow, detonation (anti-knock), exhaust temperature,
      exhaust manifold pressure and fuel flow.The throttle pedal,
      connected to an input transducer (not shown), in effect, acts as
      the throttle position sensor. When a forced induction system such
      as a turbocharger is used in conjunction with the engine, as
      discussed below, additional sensors that measure boost pressure
      and turbocharger RPM may also be used for optimization of the
      positions of the fuel flow control lever 160 and the movable
      venturi system 44.<br>
      <br>
      During engine idle, the variable venturi system 44 and fuel flow
      control lever 160 are positioned at a predetermined minimum
      setting. The fuel flow, controlled by the fuel flow lever 160, is
      continuously and automatically adjusted to maintain proper fuel
      mixture based on engine speed, mass air flow, and oxygen
      concentration sensor input. The position of arm 76, as shown in
      Fig. 3, is continuously and automatically adjusted for idle speed
      control. Because engine load may vary at idle due to accessory
      demands, the movable side 72 is constantly repositioned to
      maintain minimum idle speed.<br>
      <br>
      Upon desired acceleration, the throttle position sensor delivers
      an increasing voltage to the microprocessor which, in turn,
      increases the opening of the variable venturi system 44. Based on
      input from other operating sensors, the fuel flow control lever
      160 is adjusted to regulate fuel flow resulting in an optimum air
      to fuel ratio. If maximum engine speed is achieved inadvertently,
      the microprocessor can reduce engine speed by reducing fuel flow
      and/or air flow by repositioning the fuel flow control lever 160
      and/or the movable side 72 of the venturi system 44. In addition,
      if the engine is equipped with a turbocharger, the manifold air
      pressure sensor will supply input to the microprocessor causing
      the microprocessor, upon approach of maximum inlet manifold boost
      pressure, to begin closing the variable venturi system 44.As this
      action occurs, the mass air flow and the fuel flow will be reduced
      to maintain air to fuel ratios within an acceptable range.<br>
      <br>
      Oxygen concentration sensors can also be used in conjunction with
      mass air flow sensors for maintaining air to fuel ratios. If the
      boost pressure increases beyond a desired maximum, the
      microprocessor will respond by initially causing the fuel flow
      control lever 160 and the movable side 72 to close until an
      acceptable air flow and manifold pressure is achieved. The engine
      will then return to the desired boost operating mode and optimum
      air flow to fuel flow will be retched by the gradual opening of
      the venturi 44 which is limited by the manifold air pressure
      sensor. When the opening of the venturi 44 is limited, the
      microprocessor will also limit the opening of the fuel flow
      control lever 160 to maintain acceptable fuel to air ratios while
      controlling maximum boost pressure.It is noted that the fixed
      venturi system 44 of Fig. 2 cannot exceed a maximum boost pressure
      because the smaller opening 50 is designed to control the maximum
      boost pressure.<br>
      <br>
      At maximum deceleration, fuel flow is completely shut off by
      closing the fuel flow control lever 160, and the movable side 72
      of the venturi system 44 is returned to a preset minimum position.
      When the engine approaches idle speed, the fuel flow is turned
      back on and the engine begins operating under idle conditions.
      Moderate deceleration is achieved by varying the position of the
      movable side 72 based on input from various operating sensors
      including the throttle position sensor. Fuel flow to fuel
      injectors 134, as shown in Fig. 8, is reduced proportionally as
      air flows are reduced by the closing of the variable venturi
      system 44.<br>
      <br>
      As previously mentioned, the internal combustion engine 10 of the
      invention may be used in conjunction with a forced air induction
      system such as a turbocharger. Figs. 5 and 6 show a removable
      turbocharger 80 attached to the exhaust section 32 of the internal
      combustion engine 10 at mounting flange 34 removably supporting
      the turbocharger 80. A housing 82 included in turbocharger 80
      comprises a tangentially disposed conduit section 84 extending
      outwardly from the housing 82 with its free end 86 terminating at
      flange 88 complementally fastened to flange 34 by nuts and bolts
      42 or similar fasteners.<br>
      <br>
      Further details of the turbocharger 80 are illustrated in Figs. 5,
      6 and 7, and include a totally enclosed generally cylindrical
      outer housing 82 having an axially disposed air inlet 90 having
      conduit means 91 and an axially disposed exhaust outlet 92 having
      conduit means 93, preferably at opposite ends thereof. An
      additional radially positioned opening 94 is provided adjacent to
      air inlet 90 and communicates therewith to convey air entering
      inlet 90 to the intake manifold 14 by conduit means 96 removably
      secured at one end to opening 94 and at the other end 98 to an
      opening 100 provided in the wall of intake manifold 14.<br>
      <br>
      The housing 82 further includes rotor housing sections 102 and
      104, preferably bulbous-like, directly behind the axial disposed
      openings 90 and 92 and receiving rotors 106 and 108 each including
      a plurality of blades 110 and 112, respectively, radially disposed
      about a hub in conventional fashion. The rotors 110 and 112 are
      mounted on a common shaft mounted for rotation within housing 82.
      A recessed section 114 connects the rotor housing sections 102 and
      104 and an oil line 116 communicating with an oil source (not
      shown). The oil line 116, positioned at the top of housing 82,
      discharges oil into the interior of housing 82 to lubricate the
      bearings rotatably supporting the rotor shaft. An oil return line
      118 positioned at the bottom of recessed section 114 returns oil
      to the source.<br>
      <br>
      The housing 82 is further seen to be formed of section parts to
      permit ready access to the interior thereof, and to this end, the
      rotor housing section 104 is formed with a flange 120 which is
      removably secured to flange 122 of recessed section 114 by a
      standard peripheral clamp (not shown) similar to standard
      peripheral clamp 130. The other flange 126 of recessed section 114
      mates with flange 128 of rotor housing section 102 and is held in
      place by the standard peripheral clamp 130 having a nut and bolt
      means for holding the clamp 130 in place. A gasket 132 or the
      like, is used (only one being shown) to make the joints between
      flanges 120, 122, 126, 128 airtight.<br>
      <br>
      While the weight of the turbocharger 80 is mainly supported by
      exhaust manifold 16 and its connection thereto, the conduit means
      91, 93, and 96 associated therewith, also aid in the suspension of
      the turbocharger as the free ends thereof are connected to other
      supporting structures The free end of conduit 91 is connected to
      an atmospheric opening, not shown, in the vehicle or machine body,
      and the free end of the conduit 93 is connected to the exhaust
      pipe of the vehicle or machine, and the air conducting conduit 96
      is connected to the intake manifold 14. The conduits 91, 93, and
      96 can be made of any suitable material but it preferred that
      conduit 91 be made of rubber or the like of the bellows variety to
      facilitate connection of the conduit 91 to component parts.The air
      conducting conduit 96 is preferred to be constructed of metal due
      to temperature and pressure considerations, connected at ends 100
      and 94 via rubber like hose and metal clamps to facilitate removal
      for inspection or repair. The exhaust conduit 93 is made of metal
      as it is in contact with high exhaust temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      Up to this point, the operation of the turbocharger is standard in
      that the gases emanating from the exhaust manifold 16 at section
      32 are directed against the blades 112 of rotor 108 thereby
      imparting rotation to the rotor 108, such rotation causing rotor
      106 to rotate with the blades 110 drawing atmospheric air through
      conduit 91 into the rotor housing 102 from where it is discharged
      through conduit 96 into the intake manifold 14 to increase intake
      air pressure.<br>
      <br>
      It is known that present day turbochargers are designed in such a
      manner that no consideration is given to the control and use of
      the air processed by the turbocharger. A dump valve or wastegate
      valve is associated with known turbochargers which opens to vent
      exhaust when too much exhaust is available in the turbocharger.
      This defect, as is apparent, then places additional strain on the
      engine in that it causes both the turbocharger and the engine to
      process unwanted additional volumes of exhaust that are then
      similarly discharged to the atmosphere via the dump valve or
      wastegate valve which is normally located in the exhaust manifold
      prior to the turbocharger. These dump valves or wastegate valves
      are "pop-off" relief valves actuated by the sensing of excess
      pressure at the intake of the engine.<br>
      <br>
      Upon actuation, these valves vent exhaust gases to the atmosphere,
      thereby preventing them from flowing through the turbocharger
      which would in turn generate additional intake pressures via the
      turbocharger function.<br>
      <br>
      It has been found that by regulating the exhaust flow exiting the
      engine, air flow entering the engine and boost pressure produced
      by the turbocharger can be controlled, and the fuel efficiency of
      the engine or engine-turbocharger combination will be
      significantly improved. Exhaust emissions are also substantially
      reduced as compared to conventional diesel and gas engines because
      controlled exhaust flow and increased back pressure provide for
      more complete combustion.<br>
      <br>
      The apparatus for regulating exhaust flow to increase engine back
      pressure as previously discussed and shown in Fig. 2 is
      incorporated into the engine-turbocharger combination to increase
      fuel efficiency and reduce exhaust emissions.<br>
      <br>
      The first test engine-turbocharger combination was a Perkins
      marine diesel engine with a displacement of 108 cubic inches
      fitted into the chassis of a 1979 Mercury Capri. All sharp edges
      or contours of combustion area surfaces of the engine, such as
      piston top surfaces and surfaces within the cylinder head
      combustion chamber and preignition chamber, were slightly rounded
      to reduce the potential of concentrated "hotspots" during
      operation under leaner fuel ratios. These slight engine
      modifications were made to extend engine life and do not
      significantly alter or improve the operation of the engine. The
      turbocharger attached to the engine was a Rayjay turbocharger,
      model #3881882581. Total vehicle weight was 3,300 pounds.The fixed
      venturi system 44 of Fig. 2 was incorporated into the first test
      engine-turbocharger combination wherein the cross-sectional area
      of the large opening 48 was approximately 2.1 square inches, and
      the cross-sectional area of the smaller opening 50 was
      approximately 0.44 square inches resulting in an approximate 4.7:1
      cross-sectional area ratio. The fixed venturi system 44 was
      secured between mounting flange 34 and flange 88 as shown in Fig.
      6 by nuts and bolts 42.<br>
      <br>
      The first test engine-turbocharger combination having the fixed
      venturi system of Fig. 2 was extensively tested.<br>
      <br>
      Certified Environmental Protection Agency mileage and emissions
      tests were run with the following results:<br>
      <br>
      Cold start city test: 37.10 miles per gallon<br>
      3.40 grams per mile of Carbon Monoxide<br>
      0.41 grams per mile of Hydrocarbons<br>
      1.00 grams per mile Oxides of Nitrogen<br>
      Highway test: 56.23 miles per gallon<br>
      2.10 grams per mile of Carbon Monoxide<br>
      0.33 grams per mile of Hydrocarbons<br>
      0.71 grams per mile Oxides of Nitrogen<br>
      <br>
      At a steady state of 55 miles per hour 63.97 miles per gallon was
      achieved.<br>
      <br>
      Test results, as shown by the graphs of Figs. 9 and 10, indicate
      that the exhaust manifold back pressure and intake manifold boost
      pressure can be significantly altered by the fixed venturi system
      44. Increased back pressures on the engine show additional torque
      (horsepower) gains in the lower RPM ranges on both naturally
      aspirated and turbocharged engines. Horsepower gains are slightly
      higher in forced air induction system applications due to the
      added effect of slightly increased boost pressures at lower RPMs.<br>
      <br>
      Test results, however, indicate that engine output horsepower is
      not dramatically affected with back pressures exceeding 2
      atmospheres, and lower RPM boost pressures can be increased while
      flattening the upper RPM boost pressure curve as shown in Fig. 11.<br>
      <br>
      The ratio of boost pressure to back pressure varies during the
      several operational conditions including maximum acceleration,
      maximum deceleration, and idle. As shown in Fig. 11, the maximum
      boost pressure to back pressure ratio for the first test
      engine-turbocharger combination operating at maximum acceleration
      was approximately 0.27.<br>
      <br>
      The variable orifice venturi system 44 of Figs. 3 and 4 may also
      be incorporated into the engine-turbocharger combination by
      forming the free end 86 of conduit section 84 of the turbocharger
      shown in Fig. 6 into a rectangular free end 86 having a
      rectangular flange 88 to complementally join with rectangular
      mounting flange 60 by nuts and bolts 68 as shown in Fig. 3. As
      shown in Fig. 6, the variable orifice venturi system 44 includes a
      fixed side 70 integrally formed with the turbocharger free end 86,
      movable side 72, and additional elements as previously discussed.
      At higher engine RPM, the orifice formed by the fixed side 70 and
      the movable side 72 will be larger than when operating at a lower
      RPM, except in the case where boost pressure begins to exceed an
      upper control limit predetermined by engine and turbocharger
      parameters. When boost pressure approaches the upper control limit
      the opening action of the variable orifice venturi system 44 is
      retarded, and is reversed as the boost pressure meets the upper
      control limit. This closing of the variable orifice venturi system
      44 further increases back pressure on the engine, thereby reducing
      exhaust flow, which in turn slows the turbocharger rotation
      resulting in reduced boost pressure and eliminating the need for a
      dump or wastegate device.<br>
