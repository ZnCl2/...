          <br>
          Very little of Patrick Peebles’ invention could be called
          conventional. The FanWing looks like someone has put the
          blades of a combine harvester behind a helicopter cockpit and
          forgotten about the rest of the fuselage. That combine
          harvester, the FanWing propulsion system, is a fan in a wing,
          making it a thick wing that provides lift and thrust.<br>
          <br>
          It has a fixed wing but can autorotate like a helicopter. It
          has two engines, but they are at either end of the wing. It
          has two booms instead of one. Its inventor is American, but
          this invention has been developed in England and Italy. Its
          lift efficiency is so good that university studies in the
          United Kingdom have concluded 100 horsepower could lift 5,732
          pounds.<br>
          <br>
          This has been proven through wind-tunnel testing at Imperial
          College London, work carried out at Kingston University
          London, and scale-model flight tests funded by the development
          agency of London, England, and the U.K. government’s
          equivalent of the U.S. federal department of commerce. The
          aircraft’s efficiency is achieved because the air is
          accelerated twice: First the rotor accelerates it as the
          blades rise from the front bottom to the top and then again as
          the rotor moves back toward the wing’s trailing edge.<br>
          <br>
          The FanWing has two engines for redundancy. One engine can
          keep the aircraft in the air and give it the power to climb.
          But if the worst happens pilots can autorotate down with a
          glide ratio of about 3:1. Peebles likes to say the FanWing is
          similar to a helicopter but with a much simpler drive train.<br>
          <br>
          The high lift efficiency, according to Peebles, gives it good
          stall resistance, stability in turbulence, short takeoff and
          landing capability, and good fuel economy. The wing’s
          twin-tail outboard stabiliser configuration avoids a strong
          downwash behind the wing and recovers energy from the wingtip
          vortex upwash. This is not just theory: Since June a 5.57-foot
          wingspan remote-controlled prototype with a takeoff distance
          of 12 feet and takeoff weight of 20.9 pounds has been flying
          at up to 40.5 knots for 10 minutes or more to a few hundred
          feet altitude. Based on this prototype’s performance Peebles
          predicts a full-sized 22,000-pound FanWing aircraft would have
          a cruise speed of around 100 knots.<br>

          Peebles doesn’t have the funds to develop such a large
          aircraft that could be an airliner or cargo carrier; instead
          he is aiming at a two-seat light sport class technology
          demonstrator that he wants to fly publicly for the first time
          at the Experimental Aircraft Association’s (EAA) AirVenture in
          Oshkosh, Wis., in 2013.<br>
          <br>
          Alameda, Calif.-based marine and aerospace components
          manufacturer Photon Composites Inc. will build the FanWing
          technology prototype. Photon’s owner, British-born engineer
          Richard Jenkins, has supported new transport technologies
          before. He was a director of the British environmental
          transportation project Greenbird, a wind-powered vehicle that
          achieved 126.2 mph on Ivanpah Dry Lake in California in March
          2009.<br>
          <br>
          The total length of the prototype demonstrator, including the
          wing’s tails, will be 22.9 feet, and its total width with its
          outboard stabilisers will be 45.9 feet, including 32.8 feet of
          wingspan. Preliminary studies indicate that the two-seater
          will have an empty weight of 661.3 pounds and two 50-hp
          two-cycle engines driving either side of the FanWing rotor.
          The cruise speed is expected to be about 60 knots, with a top
          speed of 80 knots. The rotor speed will be 1,500 rpm, and
          flight control will come from the rotor rpm and the tail
          surfaces. Its takeoff distance is expected to be 49.2 feet.<br>
          <br>
          Still looking for investors so he can build the demonstrator
          and then get the necessary FAA and EAA approvals for the 2013
          flight, Peebles expects to display a static model of the
          technology demonstrator at next year’s Oshkosh show.<br>
          <br>
          He said the light sport aircraft “is a major new phase for the
          company. This interim technology demonstrator will on one side
          take us forward on the [research and development] R&amp;D and
          on the other side offers a neat little STOL [short takeoff and
          landing] light aircraft.”<br>
          <br>
          International interest in the FanWing has seen the
          Aerodynamics Research Institute of Chinese aircraft maker
          AviChina investigate the concept and publish a technical paper
          on it. To protect the intellectual property Peebles now has
          patents in 10 countries including the United States, China,
          Australia, and various European countries.<br>
          <br>
          Over the last 10 years of development Peebles has counted
          about 100 investors as his FanWing supporters, and he is in
          talks with potential new partners. The twin-tail outboard
          stabilisers, Peebles believes, have made the FanWing more
          commercially attractive because the new configuration has
          increased the forward speed to the equivalent of a civilian
          helicopter. Previous studies of other FanWing configurations
          had predicted a slow cruise speed.<br>

          “George Seyfang originally suggested the twin tail, then got
          involved in the tests and has basically turned things round
          for us,” said Peebles. Seyfang, a retired BAE Systems
          principal future concept engineer, joined the FanWing team two
          years ago. Seyfang spent his career working on aerodynamics at
          BAE’s Warton Aerodrome site in northern England. BAE is the
          U.K. aerospace manufacturer whose antecedent companies built
          the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Siddeley Harrier GR7
          “jump-jet” and the British Aircraft Corp. Concorde. All of
          these aircraft are classic designs, and if Peebles and Seyfang
          can succeed, the FanWing may join them in the aviation hall of
          fame.<br>

        <div align="left"><br>
          FanWing or fan wing is a concept for a type of aircraft. It is
          distinct from existing types of aircraft like airplanes and
          helicopters in using a fixed wing with a forced airflow
          produced by cylindrical fan(s) mounted at the leading edge of
          the wing.<br>
          <br>
          Its makers claim it is the first horizontal-rotored integral
          lift and propulsion wing in history to sustain flight.<br>
          <br>
          FanWing is also the name of the company created to develop the
          concept.<br>
          <br>
          The fan-wing is a radical solution for the problem of how to
          get the maximal airflow through both the propulsion and
          lifting surfaces. A cylindrical radial turbine (resembling a
          cylinder mower) is embedded in the wing with its axis parallel
          to the wing and leaving about 2/3 of the diameter exposed
          above the top side of the wing's length just after the leading
          edge. This increases the velocity of the airflow across the
          wing's upper surface beyond that of the forward motion of the
          aircraft. Consequently the wing has lift at slow speeds where
          a normal wing would stall.<br>
          <br>
          Practical trials with various remote-controlled models have
          proven that the concept provides a vehicle capable of
          controlled flight. There are however some significant
          differences compared to normal fixed-wing flying:<br>
          <br>
          * The throttle directly affects the pitch which means
          increased throttle can slow the plane down much in the same
          manner a helicopter flares, and if carelessly applied can
          force a complete mid-air stop.<br>
          * Glide-ratio in case of power-failure is rather low (about
          1:3) but if the power-line is disengaged, the fan-wing is
          fully capable of doing an auto-rotational landing.<br>
          <br>
          FanWing, the developing company, also have high hopes of the
          configuration being more silent, having V/STOL capabilities,
          stability in cross-winds combined with low to zero risk of
          stalls and a very low build/maintenance costs. These claims
          have yet to be verified with full-sized fan-wings though.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">History</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Patrick Peebles developed the FanWing concept in 1997. He
          formed the FanWing Company and applied for patents on his idea
          in several countries where aircraft are manufactured. In July
          2005 the company advertised that the first FanWing aircraft
          was in development in the United Kingdom. They advertised that
          the concept has undergone wind tunnel tests and powered model
          flights, and that the UK government was contributing to its
          further development.<br>

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          In May 2007 the developers announced that a version built for
          low speed STOL urban surveillance as a drone was at the
          prototype stage and claimed the following performance. [1]<br>

          aircraft (1) comprising: a fuselage (2), opposing wings (3, 4)
          either side of the fuselage (2), each wing (3, 4) supports at
          least one tangential flow rotor (5) and has a rotational axis.
          At least one tail section (3A) is disposed on each wing (3, 4)
          for forming a wing trailing edge. The tail sections (3A) are
          moveable about the, or each, rotor axis (X) relative to the
          fuselage (2) so as to provide, in use of said aircraft (1),
          variable thrust forces, whereby in use, movement of the or
          each tail section (3A) controls the flight of the aircraft
          (1). Lift is generated by way of a shroud (12) which forms an
          extension to the tail section (3A) curved surface or cowl to
          jointly cover a proportion of the circumference of the rotor.
          Ideally the shroud (12) and tail section curved surfaces
          create a vortex chamber generally within the rotor. An
          alternative embodiment includes a vertical axis fan (6) is
          provided on the fuselage (2) to adjust aircraft "pitch".<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0001] The present invention relates to an aircraft with an
          aerodynamic lift generating device.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIOR ART</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0002] It is known to use lift generating devices for powering
          aircraft. Such devices are disclosed in my prior Patents
          EP-B-0 918 686 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,229, the contents of
          which are incorporated herein by reference. Such lift
          generating devices provide an alternative means of propulsion
          to conventional propellers and the like, and lead to improved
          efficiencies.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] European Patent EP-B-0 918 686 describes a lifting
          member that may be employed in either a liquid (hydrofoil) or
          gas (aerofoil). A wing like member is disclosed in which a
          spanwise extending rotor is housed. The rotor is positioned
          adjacent the leading edge and defines a fluid intake region.
          As the rotor rotates about a drive axis, fluid is drawn in and
          forced across the hydrofoil or aerofoil so as to create lift.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] The present invention seeks to provide an aircraft with
          an improved lift generating device in which the thrust
          direction can be altered. Therefore the invention finds
          particular application in aircraft referred to as vertical
          take-off and landing (VTOL) or aircraft referred to as short
          take-off and landing (STOL) as the improvement provides both
          vertical thrust for vertical take off and forward thrust for
          propulsion.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0005] According to the present invention there is provided an
          aircraft comprising: a fuselage, opposing wings either side of
          the fuselage, each wing supporting at least one tangential
          flow rotor having a rotational axis, and at least one tail
          section for each wing forming a wing trailing edge, said tail
          section being moveable about the or each rotor axis relative
          to the fuselage so as to provide, in use of said aircraft,
          variable thrust vectors, whereby in use, movement of the or
          each tail section is used to control flight of the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0006] Preferably movement of the or each tail section is
          vectored by rotating the wing casing whereby the lift
          component increases while the thrust is reduced. This allows
          the aircraft forward flight as well as vertical take off and
          facilitates vertical landing.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Preferably the or each tail section includes a curved
          surface which covers a proportion of the circumference of the
          rotor. The curved surface or cowl may have a radius of
          curvature substantially equal to the radius of curvature of
          the rotor. The curved surface of the tail section may be
          offset relative to the curved circumference of the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] Preferably the or each tail section includes a shroud
          extending therefrom, said shroud including a curved surface or
          cowl which covers a proportion of the circumference of the
          rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] Advantageously the shroud forms an extension to the
          tail section curved surface to jointly cover a proportion of
          the circumference of the rotor. Preferably the shroud and tail
          section curved surfaces create a vortex chamber generally
          within the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] In one preferred embodiment the shroud is fixed to the
          tail section. Preferably the tail section and shroud are
          moveable about the or each rotor axis relative to the
          fuselage.<br>
          <br>
          [0011] In another particularly preferred embodiment the shroud
          is connected to a fixed point of a wing, and is adapted to
          slide over a portion of the tail section whereby the
          proportion of the circumference of the rotor covered by the
          shroud curved surface or cowl and tail section curved surface
          or cowl varies as said tail section moves about the, or each,
          rotor axis.<br>
          <br>
          [0012] The radius of curvature of the shroud curved surface or
          cowl changes as said tail section moves about the or each
          rotor axis. The radius of curvature of the shroud curved
          surface or cowl may be non-uniform along its length.<br>
          <br>
          [0013] Preferably a wing leading edge is provided for each
          wing in the form of an air input duct to allow passage of air
          to said rotor. Preferably the duct is variable in size to
          control the amount of air passing therethrough whereby to
          control "roll" of the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0014] Preferably a vertical axis fan is provided at or near
          the rear of the fuselage to control the aircraft "pitch".<br>
          <br>
          [0015] An embodiment of the invention will now be described
          with reference to the drawings in which:<br>

            PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0019] Referring to FIG. 1 there is shown an aircraft 1.
          Aircraft 1 has a fuselage 2, and opposing wings or aerofoils
          3, 4 either side of the fuselage 2. Each wing 3, 4 supports a
          tangential flow rotor 5 having a rotational axis "X". The
          tangential flow rotor is housed within a rotor cavity.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] Wing 3 has a tail section 3A forming a wing trailing
          edge. Tail section 3A is moveable about the rotor axis "X"
          relative to the fuselage 2. Similarly wing 4 has a tail
          section 4A forming a wing trailing edge. Tail sections 3A, 4A
          are moveable about the rotor axis "X" relative to the fuselage
          1, thereby providing, in use of the aircraft, variable thrust
          vectors to create aircraft lift and forward movement as more
          fully described below.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] In use of aircraft 1, movement of each tail section is
          used, inter alia, to control flight of the vehicle, especially
          to allow the aircraft forward flight as well as vertical take
          off.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] Movement of the tail section in addition to providing
          lift can be used to control "roll" of the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] A vertical axis fan 6 is provided on the fuselage 2 to
          adjust aircraft "pitch". Rear tail wings 8A, 8B and rudder 9
          may also be provided. In this sense it is appreciated that in
          a second aspect of the invention there is provided an aircraft
          comprising: a fuselage, opposing wings either side of the
          fuselage, each wing supporting at least one tangential flow
          rotor having a rotational axis, and at least one tail section
          for each wing forming a wing trailing edge, said tail section
          being moveable about the or each rotor axis relative to the
          fuselage so as to provide, in use of said aircraft, variable
          thrust vectors, whereby in use, movement of the or each tail
          section being used controls flight of the aircraft and a
          vertical axis fan located in the tail section and adapted to
          provide pitch control.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] A motor or engine 7 is provided to rotate each flow
          rotor 5. Alternatively a magnetic field may be established so
          that on passing an electric current through the rotor, the
          rotor rotates. Alternatively an electric or magnetic field can
          be established by inductive coupling. Other drive systems
          include a turbo prop engine, jet engine or conventional piston
          driven engine.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] Referring now to FIGS. 2A to 2C there is shown a cross
          section view of various positions of the tail section of a
          first embodiment. In FIGS. 2A to 2C, a tail section 10 (which
          may be used as the tail section 3A or 4A in FIG. 1) includes a
          curved surface or cowl 11 which covers a proportion of the
          circumference of a clockwise-rotating tangential flow rotor 5
          which creates airflow over the top of the tail section 10 to
          deliver flight thrust in the opposite direction. The curved
          surface or cowl may have a radius of curvature substantially
          equal to the radius of curvature of the rotor 5.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] Tail section 10 includes a shroud 12 extending
          therefrom. Shroud 12 includes a curved surface or cowl which
          covers a proportion of the circumference of the rotor. The
          shroud 12 is fixed to and forms an extension to the tail
          section curved surface or cowl 11 to jointly cover a
          proportion of the circumference of the rotor and again has a
          radius of curvature substantially equal to the radius of
          curvature of the rotor. The shroud 12 and tail section curved
          surface or cowl 11 create a vortex chamber generally within
          the rotor. The curve of the shroud 12 and surface 11 could be
          offset relative to the curved circumference of the rotor (as
          shown with reference to FIGS. 3A-A-3C-A below). The tail
          section 10 and shroud 11 are moveable about the rotor axis "X"
          relative to the fuselage such as shown in FIGS. 2A to 2C
          whereby to provide, in use of the aircraft, variable thrust
          vectors.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] The position shown in FIG. 2A would provided forward
          thrust with some lift to the aircraft (e.g. during normal
          flight), the position shown in FIG. 2B would provide forward
          thrust and lift to the aircraft (e.g. for slower flight), and
          the position shown in FIG. 2C provides vertical lift to the
          aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] Referring now to FIGS. 3A to 3C there is shown a cross
          section view of various positions of the tail section of a
          second embodiment. In FIGS. 3A to 3C, a tail section 20 (which
          may be used as the tail section 3A or 4A in FIG. 1) includes a
          curved surface 21 which covers a proportion of the
          circumference of a tangential flow rotor 5. The curved surface
          21 may have a radius of curvature substantially equal to the
          radius of curvature of the rotor 5. The curved surface 21 of
          the tail section 20 may be offset relative to the curved
          circumference of the rotor as shown in FIGS. 3A-A, 3B-A and
          3C-A.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] As the wing 20, 21 is rotated downwards, the shroud
          reduces the angle of coverage of the rotor, this firstly
          increases the velocity of the vortex and secondly the air
          output angle is altered. As a result the fan efficiency is
          increased thus making the fan more suitable for hovering or
          vertical take off.<br>
          <br>
          [0030] Tail section 20 includes a shroud 22 extending
          therefrom. Shroud 22 includes a curved surface which covers a
          proportion of the circumference of the rotor. The shroud 22
          has one end fixed to a lower air input duct member 23 on the
          wing and the other end overlaps the tail section 20 and slides
          over it. Thus the proportion of the circumference of the rotor
          covered by the shroud 22 curved surface and tail section
          curved surface 21 varies as the tail section 20 moves about
          the rotor axis "X" as shown in FIGS. 3A to 3C. As shown also
          in FIGS. 3A-A, 3B-A and 3C-A, the radius of curvature of the
          shroud 22 curved surface changes as the tail section 20 moves
          about the or each rotor axis, and the radius of curvature of
          the shroud curved surface is non-uniform along its length.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] The shroud 22 and tail section curved surface 21 create
          a vortex chamber generally within the rotor having a vortex
          boundary defined by the combined length of the shroud 22 and
          tail section curved surface 21. The shape of the vortex may
          also change by changes in shape of the gap between the shroud
          22 and curved surface 21 and the circumference of the rotor.
          The tail section 20 and shroud 22 when moved about the rotor
          axis "X" relative to the fuselage such as shown in FIGS. 3A to
          3C provide, in use of the aircraft, variable thrust vectors.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] Lower air input duct member 23, in combination with an
          upper air input duct member 24 create a wing leading edge in
          the form of an air input duct "A" to allow passage of air to
          said rotor. The upper and lower air input duct members may be
          moved towards or away from each other so that the input duct
          "A" is variable in size to control the amount of air passing
          therethrough, whereby to control "roll" of the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0033] The position shown in FIG. 3A would provided forward
          thrust with some lift to the aircraft (e.g. during normal
          flight). In this position air enters the wing through the
          input duct "A" flowing between the members 23, 24 to be
          accelerated by rotor 5 rotating clockwise over the vortex in
          the rotor. The air is ejected over the tail section 20. The
          angle formed between the opposing ends of the shroud 22 and
          axis "X" and curved section 21 and axis "X" may be about
          160[deg.]. In this FIG. 3A the radius of curvature of the
          shroud 22 and curved section is similar to that of the
          circumference of the rotor although it is moved away from the
          motor radially by 10 to 20% of the radius.<br>
          <br>
          [0034] The position shown in FIG. 3B would provide forward
          thrust and lift to the aircraft (e.g. for slower flight). In
          this position air enters the wing through the input duct "A"
          flowing between the members 23,24 to be accelerated by rotor 5
          rotating clockwise over the vortex in the rotor. The air is
          ejected over the tail section 20. The angle formed between the
          opposing ends of the shroud 22 and axis "X" and curved section
          21 and axis "X" may be about 130[deg.]. The combined length of
          the shroud 22 and tail section curved surface 21 is shorter
          than in FIG. 3A, and the radius of curvature of the shroud 22
          changes.<br>
          <br>
          [0035] The position shown in FIG. 3C would provide vertical
          lift to the aircraft. In this position air enters the wing
          through the input duct "A" flowing between the members 23,24
          to be accelerated by rotor 5 rotating clockwise over the
          vortex in the rotor. The air is ejected over the tail section
          20. The angle formed between the opposing ends of the shroud
          22 and axis "X" and curved section 21 and axis "X" may be
          about 80[deg.]-90[deg.], e.g. 85[deg.]. The combined length of
          the shroud 22 and tail section curved surface 21 is shorter
          than in FIG. 3B and the radius of curvature increases still
          further.<br>
          <br>
          [0036] The invention may take a form different to that
          specifically described above. For example each wing could
          support two or more rotors, e.g. axially aligned in side by
          side relationship. Also each wing could support two or more
          tail sections. Also the shroud of FIGS. 3A to 3C could slide
          over the curved section 21 of tail section 20 rather than the
          face of tail section 20 shown.<br>
          <br>
          [0037] Similarly it is appreciated that differential drive of
          the rotors with respect to one another permits the aircraft to
          bank to permit turning.<br>
          <br>
          [0038] Preferred embodiments of the invention have been
          described and it will be understood that features from one or
          more of the aforementioned embodiments may be incorporated
          into a different aircraft. For example a glider or hydrofoil.<br>
          <br>
          [0039] It is understood that although reference has been made
          to an aircraft per se, it will be understood that the aircraft
          may be an unmanned vehicle such as a Drone or unmanned aerial
          vehicle (UAV).<br>
          <br>
          [0040] Various embodiments of the invention have been
          described, by way of example only and it will be appreciated
          that variation may be made to the examples described without
          departing from the scope of the invention.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- A wing (1)
          including a lift augmentation device, comprising a main wing
          body (3) and a displaceable auxiliary body (5) defining a lift
          augmenting configuration and a non-augmenting configuration
          and moveable to intermediate configurations therebetween. A
          vortex is generated extending spanwise of the wing at the
          junction between the main wing body and the auxiliary
          lift-augmenting body, the arrangement being such that the
          generated vortex rotates in a direction which causes the
          airflow in the vortex to be co-current with the airflow
          passing over the wing body at a relatively lower pressure side
          of the wing body and the flow of the vortex air to be counter
          current with the over the wing body in the relatively higher
          pressure region around the wing body.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to a lift augmentation device,
          and in particular provides a novel form of wing flap for lift
          augmentation during take-off, or landing approach, or landing,
          or indeed in any other low velocity regions of the flight
          envelope.<br>
          <br>
          It is known to provide an aerofoil wing with lift-augmenting
          flaps which may be positioned at the wing leading edge or at
          the wing trailing edge. Traditionally such flaps rely on
          increasing the wing area by extending the flap forwardly from
          the leading edge or rearwardly from the trailing edge, and
          amplifying the effective camber (curvature) of the wing
          cross-section by giving a leading edge flap a more negative
          angle of incidence than the main wing body or giving a
          trailing edge flap a more positive angle of incidence than the
          rest of the wing body.<br>
          <br>
          It is also known, from W098/07622, to provide a
          lift-generating member in the shape of a wing but having a
          recess extending span-wise of the wing leading edge and
          opening into the upper surface of the wing body, there being a
          cross-flow fan rotor positioned in said recess, and extending
          spanwise of the wing body. This rotor is driven for rotation
          in a direction which causes the path of the fan rotor blades
          to move rearwardly in the region of their path where they are
          exposed to the airflow over the top of the wing body. It has
          been found that the vortex generated using such a leading edge
          rotor can be controlled in order to vary the lift generated by
          such a wing-like member and GB-A-2346348 discloses the use of
          a vane to control the vortex for varying the lift generated
          with such a lift-generating member, for example for
          controlling roll in the case of an aircraft having such a
          lift-generating member for each of its main planes.<br>
          <br>
          US-A-3289979 discloses a high lift aeroplane wing which uses
          trailing edge flaps deflectable in the normal manner in order
          to increase camber of the wing section for increasing the lift
          co-efficient. In order to improve the airflow over the
          junction of the main wing and the flap, where problems
          normally arise from the discontinuity of the boundary layer
          airflow, an auto-rotating rotor is positioned on or near the
          pivot axis of the flap to be rotated by the airflow over the
          wing and flap surfaces. US-A-3289979 also acknowledges that
          prior to that rotating cylindrical structures driven by power
          sources in the aircraft had been provided in order to minimise
          the discontinuity over the junction between the wing and the
          flap.<br>
          <br>
          US-A-4293110 discloses a swept wing having leading edge
          double-flaps comprising a main (aft-flap) body deflected
          downwardly for increasing the lift co- efficient, but provided
          with a smaller leading edge (fore-flap) portion which deflects
          upwardly relative to the aft-flap segment when in the
          lift-enhancing mode. Air is blown from a nozzle positioned
          slightly above the junction between the fore-flap segment and
          the aft-flap segment in order to generate a vortex over the
          upper surface of the aft-flap segment in the lift-enhancing
          mode.<br>
          <br>
          GB-A-0612304 discloses positioning a rotor in the upper side
          of a wing with half the diameter of the rotor projecting above
          the wing surface at the half chord position. The disclosure
          shows a tri-plane with the main wing provided with a trailing
          edge flap of conventional form.<br>
          <br>
          FR-A-2228168 discloses the formation of a vortex in a cavity
          between the main wing body and a trailing edge flap, with the
          intention that this created vortex avoids the formation of
          parasitic vortices. The vortex is created using blowing
          nozzles and/or sucking nozzles.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with the present invention we now propose a
          wing-like body including a lift augmentation device,
          comprising a main wing body and a displaceable auxiliary body
          defining a first, lift-augmenting configuration and a second,
          non- augmenting configuration and moveable to intermediate
          configurations therebetween, including means for generating a
          vortex extending spanwise of the wing-like body at the
          junction between the main wing-like body and the auxiliary
          lift- augmenting body; wherein the arrangement is such that,
          at a relatively lower pressure side of the wing body, the
          generated vortex rotates in a direction which causes the
          airflow in the vortex to be co-current with the nearby main
          airflow passing over the wing body and, at the relatively
          higher pressure side of the wing body, the flow of the vortex
          air is countercurrent with the nearby main airflow over the
          wing body.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the vortex is generated by a cross-flow rotor
          extending spanwise of the flap along the recess and connected
          to driving means which rotates the rotor in a direction to
          carry the rotor vanes cocurrent with the airflow over the
          convex upper surface of the flap.<br>
          <br>
          Such an auxiliary lift augmentation member may for example be
          a leading edge flap or a trailing edge flap, and may even be
          associated with other auxiliary wing devices such as wing
          slats.<br>
          <br>
          In order that the present invention may more readily be
          understood the following description is given, merely by way
          of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in
          which:-<br>

            cruising flight or high speed flight using a suitable
            propulsion means such as at least one reaction motor (rocket

            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          Referring now to the drawings, Figure 1A shows an aerofoil
          wing-like body 1 comprising a main aerofoil portion 3
          truncated at its trailing edge but supplemented by a trailing
          portion 5 such that, together, the portions 3 and 5 define an
          aerofoil section to the wing 1.<br>
          <br>
          Positioned between the main (3) and trailing (5) portions of
          the wing body is a cross-flow rotor 7 having blades 8
          extending spanwise of the wing 1 and able to orbit about a
          rotation axis 9 extending parallel to the wing span. The part
          of the rotor facing the trailing wing portion 5 defines a
          concave recess 11 extending spanwise of the wing 1 and
          pivotable about an axis 13 close to the convex upper surface
          of the wing 1 near the leading part of the trailing wing
          portion 5. In Figure 1A the wing 1 is clean in that the angle
          of incidence of the trailing wing portion 5 is substantially
          the same as that of the main wing portion 3 so that the
          aerofoil of the wing defines continuous surfaces at the
          junction between the main wing portion 3 and the trailing wing
          portion 5. In other words the cross-flow rotor 7 is totally
          isolated from the airflow passing over the convex upper
          surface and the concave lower surface of the wing 1. In this
          configuration the wing is configured for high speed flight or
          cruising flight using a suitable propulsion means.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1B shows the wing of 1A when adapted for augmenting the
          lift normally generated by the wing as a consequence of its
          forward flight. The rotor 7 is shown to be rotating in the
          anti-clockwise direction about the rotation axis 9, such that
          the rotor blades 8 and the generated vortex rotate in a
          direction which causes the airflow in the vortex to be
          co-current with the main airflow passing over the wing body at
          a relatively lower pressure side of the wing body and the
          rotor blades 8 and the flow of the vortex air to be
          countercurrent with the main airflow over the wing body in the
          relatively higher pressure region around the wing body.
          Furthermore the extension of the trailing wing portion 5
          rearwardly with respect to the main wing portion 3 has opened
          a slot between the convex upper surface and the concave lower
          surface of the wing 1 so as to allow airflow to pass upwardly
          from the relative higher air pressure region below the wing to
          the relatively lower air pressure region above the wing. This
          upward passage of the air through a slot reference 15 is
          augmented by the rotation of the rotor 7 with its blades 8
          moving cocurrent with the airflow through the slot 15.<br>
          <br>
          In the Figure 1B configuration the rotor 7 and the shroud 11
          are in the same configuration relative to the trailing wing
          portion 5 as they are in Figure 1A. There is therefore a
          degree of lift and thrust augmentation without any
          undue"dirtying"of the wing configuration in that drag will
          inevitably be somewhat higher than in the Figure 1A
          configuration, but will not be increased unduly in that the
          rotor is still within the overall aerofoil shape of the wing 1
          rather than projecting clear of it into the passing airflow.
          In Figure 1B, the camber of the aerofoil section is somewhat
          higher than it is in Figure 1A whereas in Figure 2B the camber
          is unchanged from that of Figure 2A.<br>
          <br>
          In both cases (Figures 1B and 2B) the camber is such that the
          wing is still substantially as clean as in the cleanest
          configuration (Figures 1A and 2A respectively).<br>
          <br>
          In the Figure 1B configuration the wing is suitable for
          transition from high speed or cruising flight to approach
          speed, or indeed in order to augment lift and thrust for
          take-off. Just as in WO-A-98/02766 the rotation of the rotor 7
          in the anti- clockwise direction shown in Figure 1B may well
          generate thrust which will augment the general thrust
          generated by the propulsion means of an aircraft incorporating
          the wing of Figures 1A to 1D. These propulsion means may for
          example comprise propellers driven by piston engines, or
          thrust-generating gas turbine engines, or turbo prop
          assemblies with propellers driven by gas turbine engines.
          Other propulsion means may of course be acceptable for use
          with the wing of Figures 1A to 1D.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 1C shows the wing of Figure 1B with the wing trailing
          part 5 deflected downwardly so as to increase the overall
          camber of the wing 1, and now with the vortex-confining shroud
          11 displaced slightly relative to the wing trailing body 5 by
          pivoting anti-clockwise about the pivot axis 13 so as to move
          the lower part 11 a of the shroud forwardly and upperwardly
          with respect to the leading edge of the under surface of the
          trailing part 5, and the rotor 7 is similarly displaced in an
          anti-clockwise direction relative to the trailing wing portion
          5. As a result of this displacement the upper part of the path
          of the vanes of the cross-flow rotor 7 projects upwardly of
          the convex upper surface of the wing 1 so as to encounter
          airflow over the upper surface, moving from the leading edge
          to trailing edge of the wing 1, and thereby to exert a greater
          thrusting effect on the airflow as a result of the driven
          anti-clockwise rotation of the fan rotor 7. This both
          increases the degree of thrust generated by the rotor 7 and
          additionally results in attachment of the airflow over a
          greater length of the upper surface of the trailing wing 5 as
          a result of the higher airflow over a greater length of the
          upper surface 5b.<br>
          <br>
          Preferably the rotor rotation axis 9 and the shroud 11 move in
          unison about the pivot axis 13 so as to maintain a constant
          positioning between the rotor 7 and the shroud 11 for the
          purpose of maintaining the quality of the vortex generated
          within the spanwise extending recess defined by the shroud 11.
          However, for the purposes of controlling that vortex it may be
          desirable to cause differential movement of the fan rotation
          axis 9 and the shroud 11 during this anti-clockwise movement
          between the position of Figure 1B and that of Figure 1C.<br>
          <br>
          As is clearly visible in Figure 1C, the trailing wing portion
          5 has not only pivoted anti-clockwise to increase the camber
          of the wing 1 but has also been extended further rearwardly
          with respect of the Figure 1B configuration so as to increase
          still further the effective wing area of wing 1. In this
          configuration the wing is well suited for the transition from
          approach speed to landing speed, or to augment still further
          thrust and lift for take-off.<br>
          <br>
          The final position, shown in Figure 1D, is one in which the
          pivoting of the shroud 11 and the fan rotation axis 9 about
          the pivot axis 13 is still more pronounced so as to increase
          the degree of projection of the path of the blades of the
          cross-flow rotor 7 into the rearwardly moving airflow over the
          convex upper surface of the wing body 1, thereby still further
          increasing the tendency of the airflow to remain attached over
          the upper surface 5b of the trailing wing portion 5 and
          equally still further increasing the thrust effect of the
          driven rotor 7 on the airflow.<br>
          <br>
          The slot 15 shown in Figure 1C is wider than the corresponding
          slot discussed above with reference to Figure 1B, and
          correspondingly that same slot becomes still wider in the
          Figure 1D configuration. Figure 1D shows the wing in maximum
          lift configuration for landing.<br>
          <br>
          Although above we refer to the lower surface of the wing as
          being the concave surface, it will of course be appreciated
          that not all aerofoils exhibit concave lower surfaces so that
          undersurface may equally be straight or even mildly convex.<br>
          <br>
          Although the above description refers to the slot 15 being
          opened as the trailing wing portion 5 moves rearwardly during
          its extension, it is equally possible for the slot to be
          opened by retraction of sliding doors which normally close the
          slot for high speed or cruising flight but which serve to open
          the slot even before the rearward extension of the trailing
          wing portion 5 has occurred.<br>
          <br>
          As mentioned above, there is a degree of thrust augmentation
          as a result of the rotation of the driven fan 7 in the
          configurations of Figures 1B, 1C and 1D. It is considered that
          this will enable the main propulsion means to be somewhat
          rested during the flight in the lower speed regions of the
          flight envelope, and under certain conditions it may even be
          possible for all of the thrust to be generated by the rotation
          of fan rotor 7 so as to dispense with the need for thrust from
          main propulsion means.<br>
          <br>
          If desired, the shroud 11 may additionally include a control
          means similar to that disclosed and claimed in GB-A-2346348
          for the purposes of controlling the vortex within the
          generally cylindrical span-wise recess defined by the shroud
          11. It has been found that the lift augmentation resulting
          from the positioning of a cross- flow rotor near the leading
          edge of a wing-like body (in this case the wing trailing
          portion 5 which in some ways resembles the wing illustrated in
          WO A-98/2766), is due to the existence of the vortex within
          the recess defined by the shroud 11 and at least partially
          intersecting the path of the vanes of the rotor 7.<br>
          <br>
          Referring now to Figures 2A to 2D, there will be seen an
          alternative embodiment in which the wing-like member 21
          includes a cross-flow rotor 27 between a leading portion 25
          defining the leading edge of the wing and a main wing body
          portion 23 defining the remainder of the aerofoil of the wing.
          Again, a slot 35 exists between the leading portion 25 and the
          main wing portion 23, and the forward- facing part of the path
          of the blades 28 of the fan 27 borders on the slot 35.<br>
          <br>
          In Figure 2A, showing the"clean"configuration of the wing for
          high speed for cruising flight, the slot 35 is closed off from
          the region of relatively higher pressure air under the wing
          body 21 by means of a lower sliding door 35a, and likewise the
          slot is closed off from the relatively lower pressure region
          of air above the convex upper surface of the wing body 21 by
          an upper sliding door 35b. Retraction of these doors into
          either the leading portion 25 or the main wing portion 23 (in
          this case the main wing portion 23) opens the slot 35 and
          allows to pass upwardly through it.<br>
          <br>
          Although the effect of the driven rotation of the cross-flow
          fan rotor 27 is only exerted on the movement under the wing
          body 21 when the slot 35 is open, it may of course be
          desirable to maintain drive to the rotor 27 to keep it
          rotating about its rotation axis 29 even when the slot is
          closed, if only for the purposes of ensuring that as soon as
          the slot begins to open the rotor will already be rotating in
          the appropriate direction and with the desired speed. For this
          reason the fan rotor 27 is shown in Figure 2A as rotating in
          the anti-clockwise direction.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 2B shows a configuration generally equivalent to that
          illustrated in Figure 1B but in this case there has been
          substantially no forward movement of the leading wing portion
          25, but simply retraction of the two sliding doors 35a and 35b
          to open the slot 35 to the under and over the wing body 21.
          This illustrates the configuration for transition from high
          speed or cruising flight to approach speed. The effect of the
          vortex within the recess bounded by the shroud 31 is to
          increase the over the upper surface of the wing body 21,
          thereby augmenting lift and thrust and maintaining the over
          the convex upper surface attached until much closer to the
          trailing edge of the main wing portion 23. Although there
          would some extent be thrust augmentation as a result of the
          driving of the upwardly to the slot 35, as with the wing 1 of
          Figs. 1A to 1D, the effect of thrust augmentation begins to be
          more noticeable when the configuration of Figure 2C is
          reached. As in the case of Figure 1C, the shroud 31 has
          pivoted in the anticlockwise direction about the pivot axis
          33, and carried the rotor 27 along with it as is evident from
          Figure 2C. Thus the upper part of the path of the blades 28 of
          the fan rotor 27 projects more noticeably into the passing
          over the upper surface of the wing body 21, increasing the
          thrust augmentation effect and still further increasing the
          tendency for the over the upper surface of the wing to remain
          attached up to the trailing edge.<br>
          <br>
          Figure 2C also illustrates the fact that the wing leading
          portion 25 has begun to deflect downwardly and, although the
          mechanism for supporting and guiding the wing leading portion
          25 is not shown in the drawings, the theoretical position of
          the centre of rotation 26 of the movement of the wing leading
          portion 25 is illustrated both in Figure 2C and in Figure 2D.<br>
          <br>
          As in the case of Figure 1C the position illustrated in Figure
          2C applicable to the transition from approach speed to landing
          speed or for augmenting lift and thrust for take off.<br>
          <br>
          Likewise, configuration in Figure 2D shows still further
          anticlockwise pivoting of the rotor axis 29 and the shroud 31
          about the pivot axis 33 and still further clockwise movement
          of the wing leading portion 25 to result in both a more
          negative angle of incidence of the wing leading portion and a
          further forward extension which increases the effective wing
          area of the wing 21 for landing.<br>
          <br>
          The embodiment of Figures 2A to 2D has the advantage that the
          spanwise- extending cross-flow rotor is positioned at the
          thickest part of the aerofoil section.<br>
          <br>
          Surprisingly it has now been discovered that the existence of
          the vortex at the recess defined in the leading portion of a
          wing body may under system circumstances result from without
          the need for a driving cross-flow fan rotor such as the rotor
          7 in Figures 1A to 1D or the rotor 27 in Figures 2A to 2D.
          Such an arrangement is shown in Figures 3A and 3B where Figure
          3B shows the high lift"landing" configuration where the
          through the slot between the trailing wing portion and the
          main portion of the wing body itself generates the required
          vortex.<br>
          <br>
          In particular, Figure 3a shows a wing 41 comprising a main
          wing body portion 43 and a displaceable trailing wing portion
          45 which is displaceable by virtue of pivoting around a
          theoretical axis 46 shown in both Figure 3A and Figure 3B. In
          Figure 3A, showing the most clockwise-displaced configuration
          of the trailing wing portion 45, the geometry is such that
          there is no slot existing between the main wing body portion
          43 and the trailing wing body portion 45. However, once the
          trailing wing body portion 45 has begun to displace by
          anticlockwise rotation about the axis 46 from the
          configuration shown in Figure 3A, that slot 55 is open and is
          able to pass through the slot upwardly from the relatively
          higher pressure region below the wing body 41 through the area
          of relatively lower pressure air above the wing. In doing so,
          this will generate a vortex rotating in the anticlockwise
          direction as illustrated by the arrows 56 in Figure 3b, and
          this vortex is expected to have the same effect of augmenting
          lift of the wing 41 as was evident with the wing 1 of Figures
          1A to 1D and the wing 21 of Figures 2A to 2D, without the need
          for the cross-flow rotor to generate the vortex.<br>
          <br>
          Although Figure 3B illustrates the position generally
          equivalent to the configuration shown in Figure 1D, i. e. the
          high lift"landing"configuration, it will of course be
          understood that there are other configurations between the
          extreme of Figures 3A and 3B equivalent to the exemplary
          configurations shown in Figures 1B and 2B (transition from
          high speed or cruising flight to approach speed) and Figures
          1C and 2C (transition from approach speed to landing speed or
          showing lift augmentation for take off).<br>
          <br>
          The wing in accordance with the present invention may be used
          in a"self- propelling"mode which could do away with the need
          for a separate propulsion means. For example, the wing of
          Figures 1A to 1D could rely on the Figure 1C configuration for
          take-off in that the anticlockwise-rotating cross-flow fan 7
          will generate a rearward flow of air over the upper surface of
          the wing trailing part 5 to propel the aircraft forwardly
          during the take-off run while the intake of air into the slot
          15 from beneath the wing will not generate any appreciable
          rearward reaction (a reaction force acting in the direction
          towards the trailing edge of the wing trailing body 5).
          Indeed, the underside of the main wing portion 3 at the rear
          end near where the slot 15 opens may be shaped so as to
          facilitate flow of air into the slot 15 in a rearward
          direction (in a direction from the leading edge to the
          trailing edge of the wing 1) and, provided the magnitude of
          the airflow induced by the fan 7 is adequate, there will be a
          forward thrust on the wing which can cause the aircraft to
          gather momentum during the take-off run and achieve flying
          speed. The lift off speed will of course be enhanced (lowered)
          as a result of the partial downward deflection of the trailing
          wing part 5, in the manner of the trailing edge wing flap.
          After take-off the trailing wing portion 5 can be raised into
          the Figure 1B configuration where the same effect of thrusting
          flow generated by the cross-flow fan 7 will maintain forward
          thrust and maintain cruising flight.<br>
          <br>
          For landing purposes, the trailing wing part 5 will initially
          be lowered to the Figure 1C configuration and then, for final
          approach, be lowered to the Figure 1D configuration where the
          maximum CL value will be obtained.<br>
          <br>
          It will of course be appreciated that at no stage will the
          wing be cleaned up to the Figure 1A configuration, where no
          such thrusting flow can be generated by the totally enclosed
          cross-flow fan 7 even if the fan is rotating idly within its
          shut-off housing defined by the slot 15 on the one hand and
          the shroud 11 on the other hand.<br>
          <br>
          The same effect can be achieved with the configuration of wing
          shown in Figures 2A to 2D in that, for take-off purposes, the
          wing may be set to the Figure 2C configuration so that airflow
          through the cross-flow fan 7 will be discharged rearwardly
          over the top surface of the main wing part 23 and taken in
          from beneath the leading wing part 25 in a generally rearward
          direction while the configuration of the leading wing part 25
          resembles that of a leading edge wing flap. After the take-off
          phase, the wing can be set to the Figure 2B configuration in
          which, as in the case of Figure 1B, cruising flight may be
          maintained with merely the propelling effect of the rearwardly
          moving air discharged by the cross-flow fan 27 over the top
          surface of the main wing part 23, optionally assisted by a
          rearward direction of the airflow into the slot 35 from
          beneath the leading wing part 25. Again, as in the case of
          Figures 1A to 1D, the leading wing part 25 may be shaped at
          its under surface so as to facilitate entry of rearwardly
          moving air into the slot 35 from beneath the leading wing part
          25. Such shaping may, for example, comprise blunting of
          the"nose"between the underside of the leading wing part 25 and
          the entry into the slot 35, or even raising of the
          undersurface of the leading wing part 25 so that it allows the
          air from beneath the leading wing part 25 to approach the fan
          rotor in a generally rearward and upward direction.<br>
          <br>
          The Figure 2B configuration can be used for forward flight and
          the Figure 2C configuration can be used for the early stages
          of the landing approach, with the Figure 2D configuration used
          for the final approach where maximum CL values are required.<br>
          <br>
          Although Figures 1A to 1D on the one hand, and Figures 2A to
          2D on the other hand, illustrate positions of the cross-flow
          fan 7 or 27 at points where the transition between the main
          wing part 3 and the moving trailing wing part 5 of a
          conventional wing with trailing wing flap will arise (Figure
          1B) or where the transition between the main wing part 23 and
          the leading wing part 25 of a wing with a leading edge flap
          will arise, this self-propelling configuration just discussed
          above may be improved by having the cross-flow fan rotor moved
          somewhat rearwardly from the position showing in Figures 2A to
          2D, where the thickest part of the aerofoil will permit the
          maximum diameter of fan rotor 27 to be accommodated.<br>
          <br>
          As indicated above, the configuration of Figures 1A to 1D
          showing the displaceable wing trailing portion, and likewise
          the configuration of Figures 3A and 3B showing such a
          displaceable trailing portion, are equivalent to a
          conventional trailing edge flap, and likewise the
          configuration shown in Figures 2A to 2D is generally
          equivalent to a conventional leading edge wing flap. However,
          the lift augmentation device may equally embody other wing
          configurations and may, for example, be incorporated in a
          moveable slat to generate a lift-augmenting slot between
          itself and the adjacent surface of the wing body.<br>
          <br>
          Although throughout the above description the member 1,21 or
          41 has been described as"wing-like"this member could be any
          other dynamic aerofoil plane such as a tailplane or a canard
          surface.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract</span> -- An
          aircraft has its wing defined as a wing-like body with a
          tangential flow rotor in the leading edge. A shroud, under the
          lower part of the tangential flow rotor, terminates in at
          least one movable flap defining a lift-generating lip when the
          rotor is rotating such that the upper part of the rotor,
          projecting above the level of the upper surface of the
          wing-like body, is moving rearwardly. Differential adjustment
          of the flaps in the wings to either side of an aircraft
          centerline allows directional control and control of banking
          of the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0002] The present invention relates to an aerodynamic lift
          generating device and is an improvement in the lift generating
          member disclosed and claimed in WO-A-98/07622.<br>
          <br>
          [0003] The device of the above-mentioned International
          application uses a cross-flow or tangential flow rotor
          positioned in place of the leading edge of a wing-like body
          and rotating such that the part of the fan rotor at the top of
          the wing-like body is moving rearwardly, i.e. towards the
          trailing edge of the wing-like body, whereas the lower part is
          moving forwardly. The forwardly moving lower part is shrouded
          and in various of the embodiments of that earlier device the
          shroud terminates in a lip which helps to form and locate a
          vortex within the rotor when the rotor is in motion.<br>
          <br>
          [0004] Lift control, and hence steering and differential lift
          generation, in that earlier device was envisaged as being
          effected by a differential gearbox to drive the parts of the
          rotor to either side of an aircraft centerline at different
          rotational speeds so as to generate different lift and thrust
          values to each side of the centerline.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0005] It is an object of the present invention to provide an
          alternative means of generating differential lift in such a
          vehicle.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br>
          [0006] The present invention envisages using a movable flap as
          the lip at the leading edge of the shroud defining the
          undersurface of the wing-like body, so that the lip can be
          either (i) eliminated by positioning the flap flush with the
          adjacent part of the shroud or (ii) reduced in its degree of
          intrusion on the space occupied by the rotor by causing it to
          adopt a position between the optimum vortex-generating
          configuration and the fully flush position.<br>
          <br>
          [0007] Thus according to a first aspect of the present
          invention there is provided a lift-generating member
          comprising:-a wing-like body defining leading and trailing
          edges and opposed surfaces which converge towards said
          trailing edge; and a spanwise extending tangential flow rotor
          positioned adjacent the leading edge of the wing-like body and
          projecting proud of that one of the opposed surfaces which is
          uppermost in use of the lift-generating member, whereas the
          other opposed surface which is the lower one in use of the
          lift-generating member is defined in part by a shroud which
          extends forwardly and upwardly and confines the space occupied
          by the tangential flow rotor and terminates at a lip to define
          a vortex within the rotor; characterised in that the lip is
          defined by at least one movable flap which is variable between
          a first position projecting away from the general direction of
          the shroud so as to intrude on the space occupied by the rotor
          and a second position in which it does not intrude to that
          same extent.<br>
          <br>
          [0008] By positioning the flaps to either side of the aircraft
          centerline in configurations which differ from one another it
          is possible for the lift at the side where the flap is "less
          intrusive" to be reduced as compared with that where it is
          "more intrusive". Because the vortex influences both lift and
          thrust it is also conceivable to use the differential lift
          effect to generate also a yawing movement, preferably such
          that the difference in lift between the two sides of the
          aircraft centerline and the difference in thrust on the two
          sides of the aircraft centerline cause the aircraft to execute
          a slipless banked turn.<br>
          <br>
          [0009] The control of the angle of the flaps on both wings
          simultaneously also enables the lift to be rapidly increased
          or decreased for manoeuvring, either to effect take off and
          landing or to manoeuver the aircraft in flight.<br>
          <br>
          [0010] It is also possible for the vortex-generating "lip" to
          be defined by several different flaps at different regions
          along the span of the wing, so that the turning effect and/or
          the banking effect can be more finely tuned by selecting for
          the lift variations a portion of the flap which is at a
          greater or lesser distance from the aircraft centerline,
          thereby changing the moment of the differential lift and
          thrust forces.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
            INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
          <br style="font-weight: bold;">
          [0017] FIG. 1 is a schematic plan view of an aircraft 1
          comprising a wing body 2 divided into a port wing body 2a and
          starboard wing body 2b, with a tangential flow rotor 3 which
          is not shown in detail but which is divided into a port rotor
          3a and a starboard rotor 3b, driven by a common drive means.
          The aircraft has a fuselage comprising a pod 4 and a tail boom
          5 which supports a tailplane 6 and a fin 7.<br>
          <br>
          [0018] The underside of the wing body 2 is extended forwardly
          as a shroud 2' to enclose the cylindrical space 7 occupied by
          the rotor 3. At the leading edge of the shroud 6 is a
          pivotable lip-defining flap 8 which is shown in FIG. 2 as
          intruding on the cylindrical space 7 to its maximum extent.
          The flap 8 is mounted for pivoting about a pivot defining a
          pivot axis 8'.<br>
          <br>
          [0019] In rotation of the rotor 3, in the anticlockwise sense
          as viewed in FIG. 2, the tangential flow in the rotor results
          in the air expelled from the exposed periphery of the rotor at
          the front and the top of the wing becoming divided by the nose
          9 at the top of the wing-like body 2 such that the expelled
          air moves downwardly and rearwardly over the upper surface of
          the wing-like body 2 while the rest of the air moves in the
          anticlockwise sense within the cylindrical space 7 until it
          reaches the lip defined by the flap 8 in the FIG. 2 position.
          As a result an anticlockwise vortex is generated within the
          rotor and greatly improves the lift force, as described in my
          WO 98/07622.<br>
          <br>
          [0020] It has been found that in the high lift configuration
          shown in FIG. 2 the noise generated by the wing and rotor
          combination is increased as compared with that which would
          normally be experienced in the cruising configuration shown in
          FIG. 3 where the flap 8 is in the position 8a substantially
          flush with the rest of the shroud 2'. In this FIG. 3 position
          less lift is generated and also less thrust is generated but,
          provided the flap is as close as possible to the periphery of
          the fan rotor, the efficiency of the wing is at a maximum. The
          induced air flow through the rotor in the FIG. 3 configuration
          is illustrated by the arrows moving along curved streamlines
          from right to left in the drawing. In the FIG. 2 (high lift)
          position the flap 8 is even closer to the passing rotor blades
          than in the FIG. 2 position but must not interfere
          mechanically with them.<br>
          <br>
          [0021] The difference in lift and thrust can be used in the
          following manner in order to provide optimum flight
          conditions.<br>
          <br>
          [0022] For running up the rotor as rapidly as possible on the
          ground, the rotor drive motor is accelerated while the flap is
          in the position 8a shown in FIG. 3, thereby minimising
          resistance to rotation of the rotor. When the rotor has been
          run up to a desired speed the flap may be moved into its
          position 8 shown in FIG. 2 and this results in an increase in
          lift, allowing the aircraft to take off. When the aircraft is
          stationary the vortex-controlling flap 8 is at its most
          effective. The aircraft may already have been accelerating
          forwardly while in the FIG. 3 configuration but generating
          much less lift, possibly only 20% of the available lift, than
          it does in the FIG. 2 position.<br>
          <br>
          [0023] In flight, the flap is returned to the position 8a
          shown in FIG. 3, or to a position close to it, in order to
          minimize the rotational drag on the rotor, but also to take
          advantage of the induced lift resulting from the air flow
          through the rotor and the air flow over the aerofoil wing-like
          body 2. In order to control the angle of bank and/or the angle
          of yaw it is possible to vary the position of the flap to a
          position somewhere between the two extreme positions shown in
          FIG. 2 and FIG. 3.<br>
          <br>
          [0024] In order to provide for optimum manoeuverability the
          aircraft may be flown during climb after take off or during
          approach to landing with the two flaps set midway between the
          extreme positions shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, such that when bank
          is needed it is possible to increase the lift from the steady
          state by increasing the degree of intrusion of the flap on the
          side where higher lift is required and decreasing the lift on
          the other wing by similarly reducing the degree of intrusion
          into the space 7.<br>
          <br>
          [0025] For take off and landing it is advantageous for both
          wings simultaneously to be in the FIG. 2 configuration, or in
          a configuration close enough to it to generate high lift and
          high thrust but still leave some degree of differential
          adjustability for controlling bank and yaw on landing.<br>
          <br>
          [0026] From the above it will be understood that the rotor 3
          may initially tend to slow down somewhat during the take off
          phase, until the forward speed is such that the air flow
          through the rotor again assists in reducing the resistance to
          rotation of the rotor. Thus in the take off phase it is
          possible to some extent to build up excess rotor speed with
          the flap in the FIG. 3 position and then to consume some of
          that energy in the take off phase when the flap moves towards
          the FIG. 2 configuration and the resistance to rotation of the
          fan rotor 3 builds up.<br>
          <br>
          [0027] The principle illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 3 can be
          readily applied to any of the wing cross-sections shown in WO
          98/07622, and indeed to any other variations of the basic
          configuration of the rotor in the leading edge of the wing
          body.<br>
          <br>
          [0028] If desired and inboard section of each wing (2a, 2b)
          may have its vortex-generating flap adjustable independently
          of that as the outboard section so that the inboard section
          may remain in the high lift configuration during take off and
          the landing approach, while the outboard section may be
          adjusted for manoeuvring.<br>
          <br>
          [0029] The embodiment shown in FIGS. 4a and 4b differs from
          that shown in FIGS. 2 and 3 in that there are two limbs 18a
          and 18b to the flap, pivotable about a single pivot axis 18'.
          The two limbs 18a and 18b are at a fixed angle of inclination
          relative to one another. In the FIG. 4a position the flap limb
          18b is substantially a continuation of the shroud 12', while
          the flap limb 18a is directed inwardly towards the rotor in
          the position giving maximum lift and thrust (similar to the
          FIG. 2 configuration).<br>
          <br>
          [0030] In the FIG. 4b configuration this two part flap has
          pivoted clockwise about the pivot 18' so as (i) to open a gap
          in the 'shroud' where the flap limb 18b has moved inwardly
          from it flush position, and (ii) to decrease the extent to
          which the upper flap limb 18a extends inwardly until it
          defines the front of the shroud 2'. In this configuration the
          high speed peripheral air moving forwardly along the inner
          surface of the shroud will spill out forwardly to reduce both
          lift and thrust still further as compared with the FIG. 3
          configuration, thereby giving more control of differential
          thrust and lift to improve manoeuvrability of the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          [0031] In the embodiment of FIGS. 5a, 5b, and 5c the control
          of this better manoeuvrability embodiment of FIGS. 4a and 4b
          is still further improved in that an additional facility is
          provided by virtue of the intermediate configuration of FIG.
          5b.<br>
          <br>
          [0032] In the embodiment of FIGS. 5a, 5b and 5c the two limbs
          28a and 28b of the flap are to a degree pivotable
          independently of one another. If desired, complete
          independence may be provided. For movement from the FIG. 5a
          configuration to the FIG. 5b configuration the upper flap limb
          28a pivots clockwise while the lower flap limb 28b is
          stationary, until the two limbs 28a and 28b are substantially
          mutually parallel in the FIG. 5b configuration and
          substantially flush with the shroud 2'. From then on the two
          limbs move in unison to reach the FIG. 5c configuration where
          the two limbs together define the spill passage to allow
          forward spilling out of the forwardly moving air between the
          fan rotor and the shroud.<br>

          <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract </span>-- An
          aircraft lifting member (wing) comprises a crossflow rotor 2
          formed of a core 4 having rotor vanes 5 mounted around it,
          disposed in a trough 3 at the front upper part of a wing-like
          body 1. Rotation of the rotor induces a downwardly and
          rearwardly directed airflow over the upper surface 6 of the
          wing-like body 1 generating both lift and thrust. The upper
          part of the rotor vane path projects above the upper surface 6
          and the lift-generating member is open at the leading edge to
          expose the cross-flow rotor 2 to the incident airflow. <br>
          <br>
          The present invention relates to an improved form of lifting
          member using a fluid flow, either of an aerodynamic nature or
          a hydrodynamic nature. It Is particularly useful for an
          aircraft, and in particular as a high lift wing which will
          provide both high lift and thrust for a low speed aircraft,
          making it attractive for STOL (short takeoff and landing)
          purposes.<br>
          <br>
          In the past STOL aircraft have depended upon either lift
          augmentation of an aerofoll wing, for example by blown flaps
          and/or the use of slats and leading edge flaps, and/or upon
          the use of a tilt wing construction where an engine is mounted
          fixed in relation to the wing so that tilting the wing to a
          higher angle of incidence also tilts the engine to give a
          measure of vectored thrust. Vectored jet thrust in the context
          of vertical/short take-off and landing (V/STOL) flight is also
          known.<br>
          <br>
          The present invention aims to provide a novel way of achieving
          high lift at low forward speed of an aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          GB-A-885888 discloses the use of a cross flow rotor at various
          locations in an aerofoll body, and includes in FIGS. 27 and 26
          a cross-low rotor embedded in the leading edge of the aerofoll
          body.<br>
          <br>
          In accordance with the present invention there is provided a
          lift-generating member comprising a wing-like body defining
          leading and trailing edges and opposed surfaces which converge
          towards said trailing edge, and a spanwise extending
          cross-flow rotor positioned adjacent the leading edge and one
          of said opposed surfaces to define an air intake region and an
          air discharge region along the circumferential path of the
          rotor vanes; wherein the rotor rotates in a direction which
          carries the rotor vanes in the part of their path which is
          adjacent said one opposed surface in a direction which extends
          towards the trailing edge of the wing-like body; characterised
          In that the surface of the rotor projects proud of the said
          one opposed surface over at least said air discharge region;
          and in that the rotor is exposed to air at the leading edge of
          the wing-like body to define a leading edge of the
          lift-generating member and to take in air at the front of said
          body and to discharge it over said opposed surface as a result
          of rotation of the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          By providing for a differential in efficiency between the
          rotors on either side of the center line of an aircraft it is
          possible to control the lift differentially, to give a means
          of banking the aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          If desired, the rotors may provide not just the lift but also
          all of the thrust which is required for forward propulsion of
          the aircraft, in which case differential power to either side
          of the centre line of the aircraft also provides for a measure
          of yaw control and for a means of controlling the aircraft in
          a stable banked turn.<br>
          <br>
          In order that the present invention may more readily be
          understood the following description is given, merely by way
          of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in

          The lifting member shown in FIG. 1 uses the combination of a
          tapered wing-like body 1 and a spanwise extending cylindrical
          crossflow rotor 2 set into an upwardly open trough-like recess
          3 in the front of the wing body 1 near the leading edge 7 of
          the wing body. As shown In FIG. 1, the crossflow rotor 2
          projects upwardly into the airflow passing over the upper
          surface 6 of the body 1 and it is indeed the rotation of the
          rotor 2, in the clockwise direction as viewed in FIG. 1, that
          induces this airflow. The rotor is open to the incident
          airflow at the front of the lifting member.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 1 shows that the rotor 2 is a form of crossflow rotor,
          also known as a tangential flow rotor, extending spanwise
          along the wing body. In its crudest form the rotor has a
          succession of discs 9 with high aspect ratio fan vanes 5
          extending between the successive discs along the rotor. An
          optional central shaft 4 connects the various discs together
          and is driven by the drive means, which preferably includes a
          differential gearbox mechanism to vary the power distribution
          between such a lifting member to one side of the aircraft, and
          a similar such lifting member the other side. Such a rotor
          will of course be able to be used with any alternative wing
          body shape such as any of those shown in FIGS. 1, 2 and 6 to
          12.<br>
          <br>
          The crossflow rotor 2 rotates clockwise as viewed in FIG. 1
          and generates an airflow, shown by the double-headed arrows,
          deflected upwardly over the upper surface of the rotor core 4
          at an air intake region of the rotor blade path and then
          passing obliquely downwardly from an air discharge region of
          the rotor blade path to follow the upper surface of the
          tapering wing body 1. At the trailing edge of the wing body 1
          the airflow will detach in the form of a downwardly and
          rearwardly moving stream which generates a downward component
          of airflow giving rise to augmented lift of the lifting
          member, and also a rearward component which generates thrust
          to induce forward propulsion of the lifting member. Although
          not shown in FIG. 1, when forward propulsion of the lifting
          member is established there will be also be an airflow passing
          under the wing body 1 so that the incident airstream from the
          left hand side of the lifting member shown in FIG. 1 will
          divide, with some passing over the rotor and the rest passing
          under the wing body, and with these two flows recombining,
          preferably with minimum turbulence, at the trailing edge.
          This, combined with an aerofoll general shape to the
          cross-section of the lifting member (wing body 1 and crossflow
          rotor 2) may also generate aerodynamic lift in the
          conventional manner.<br>
          <br>
          By increasing the speed of rotation of the rotor its output
          power can be increased and hence both the lift and the thrust
          on that lifting member can be increased.<br>
          <br>
          As will be clear from a reading of the following description,
          there are various other possibilities for designing the
          spanwise crossflow rotor 2. However, the concept remains the
          same in that there will be an airflow induced over the wing
          body giving rise to both lift and thrust.<br>
          <br>
          An aircraft incorporating the lifting member in accordance
          with the present Invention may have additional
          thrust-generating means such as at least one engine driven
          propeller or at least one turbine or rocket engine, but it is
          envisaged that all of the thrust may be derived from the
          crossflow rotor 2.<br>
          <br>
          Hence variation of the speed of rotation of the rotor 2 (or
          its efficiency by means shown in FIGS. 7, 12a and 12b) will
          not change simply the lift on that lifting members; It may
          also vary the thrust of that same lifting member to an extent
          which will allow yaw control of the aircraft having such a
          lifting member as a wing.<br>
          <br>
          Where this differential lift facility is available it is
          possible for the aircraft to omit the convention lateral
          guidance means (such as a rudder) and/or roll control means
          (for example ailerons).<br>
          <br>
          Although it is possible for ailerons to be omitted in their
          entirety, it may be helpful to have ailerons present in order
          to compensate for the de-stabilizing effects of a side-wind on
          cross-wind lending. Where ailerons are provided, it is
          expected that they will still produce aileron-induced yaw.<br>
          <br>
          An aircraft using the lifting member of the present invention
          may include a variable speed drive motor driving a means (such
          as a differential gearbox) of varying the division of power
          between the spanwise rotor of the lifting member on the
          starboard side and the spanwise rotor of the lifting member on
          the port side, for the purposes of controlling yaw and/or
          roll.<br>
          <br>
          It is also conceivable for the speed control to be linked to a
          conventional pitch control means such as a control column
          normally driving an elevator, so that increasing the motor
          speed will increase the power to both port and starboard side
          of the aircraft and hence increase the lift, giving a nose-up
          tendency, and vice versa. This may either augment or replace
          the elevator. Alternatively conventional elevator control may
          be employed, and the speed of the motor diving the rotor 2 may
          instead be controlled separately In the manner of lift
          augmentation means such as leading edge and/or trailing edge
          flaps of a conventional aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          Equally it is possible for there to be a control surface
          attached to the wing body 1, for example of the trailing edge,
          in order to vary the aerodynamic camber of that wing body for
          the purposes of further augmenting lift.<br>
          <br>
          If desired the wing body member 1 of FIG. 1 may have the
          trailing edge occurring at the end of a sharper taper zone
          starting at a point on the upper surface of the tapering wing
          body. In this case the undersurface of the wing body may be a
          continuous planar surface as shown in FIG. 1. However
          alternatively the undersurface could equally include a point
          of discontinuity (similar to such a point of the upper
          surface) at which the angle of inclination of the lower
          surface either increases or decreases.<br>
          <br>
          Also, the trailing edge may be at the end of a downwardly
          curved portion of the wing body to impart aerofoll camber to
          the wing today, resulting from the curvature of the part of
          the wing body behind the trough 3 and rotor 2. The upper
          surface may be convex overall (so that for the entire wing
          body can be of curved form with a generally aerofoll
          configuration) or may become convex after a point marking the
          termination of a forward generally planar upper surface. (It
          will of course be appreciated that the downwardly curved
          portion may be in the form of a succession of generally planar
          surfaces giving rise to a succession of stepped regions of
          different inclinations to resemble such a curved
          configuration).<br>
          <br>
          In all of the embodiments the vanes may form a close
          non-interference fit with the concave part-cylindrical wall of
          the wing body defining the trough 3.<br>
          <br>
          In the preferred embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the rotor discs 9
          have a diameter of 80 mm. Between two successive rotor discs 9
          along the span of the lifting member are 16 rotor vanes 5, in
          this case each of 10 mm chord and 0.6 mm thickness. The blades
          are part-cylindrical curved sheets having a 30 mm radius of
          curvature. This is the design of prototype used for the tests
          whose results are shown in FIGS. 4 and 5.<br>
          <br>
          In this case the trough 3 is part-cylindrical and has the
          discs 9 fitting closely within it. It extends over 155 DEG of
          arc of the cylinder defining the trough. Thus, as viewed in
          FIG. 1, the left hand- or leading edge-side of the wing body
          member is cut away at 7 to expose the rotor to the incident
          airflow.<br>
          <br>
          As shown in FIG. 1, the rotor vanes 5 are in this case set at
          an angle of 30 DEG with respect to that radius which also
          passes through the edge of the rotor vane 5 lying farthest
          from the shaft 4. It may also be of value to control the angle
          of these blades while the rotor is turning. This could be in
          the form of collective pitch which would change the angle of
          all the blades at the same time or in the form of cyclic pitch
          control which would control the angle of the blades depending
          on their position relative to the wing body.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 2 shows a variant, generally similar to the embodiment of
          FIG. 1, but with a slat or cover 8 over the rotor to define a
          slot to control the airflow over the upper surface of the
          lifting member.<br>
          <br>
          A model incorporating the design shown in FIG. 1 has been run
          using direct drive to the rotors to each side of the fuselage
          centre line of the model. Such a model is shown in plan view
          in FIG. 3 as comprising a fuselage 20 having a fixed tail
          plane 21 and a port wing body 22a and a starboard wing body
          22b. In this case a fin or vertical stabilizer 23 has also
          been mounted on a tail 24 of the model. The rotor has been
          omitted from FIG. 3 but the trough 3a and 3b of the respective
          wing member 22a and 22b is illustrated. It is thus possible to
          visualise the way in which the lifting body cross-section of
          FIG. 1 has been adapted to the model aircraft.<br>
          <br>
          The model has an all up weight of 3.4 Kg which includes a 1
          horse power motor of 5 cc displacement. The wing span of the
          model is 206 cm, and this comprises two active wing bodies 22a
          and 22b each of 93 cm span.<br>
          <br>
          The model was flown in radio-controlled free flight. The
          airspeeds and power values (see FIGS. 4 and 5) were
          extrapolated using the test results of a 90 cm span tethered
          wing prototype of the wing body of FIG. 1.<br>
          <br>
          For take-off the motor was running at one-third of its maximum
          power. Stable flight speed was measured as approximately 5.5
          metres per second.<br>
          <br>
          A similar tethered test was carried out using a single lifting
          member, of the type shown in FIG. 1 with its rotor 2 driven by
          an electric motor, mounted on a mast and counterbalanced by a
          mass arm. With such an apparatus the various parameters shown
          in FIG. 4 were determined. They are as follows:<br>
          <br>
          V represents the voltage applied to the motor.<br>
          <br>
          A represents the motor current in amps.<br>
          <br>
          The third column shows the rotor speed in r.p.m..<br>
          <br>
          W represents the rotor input power in watts.<br>
          <br>
          The fifth column represents the forward (propulsive) thrust
          measured when the lifting member was held stationary, i.e. not
          allowed to orbit the mast.<br>
          <br>
          The sixth column shows the average time to complete one
          revolution about the mast, when in the steady state.<br>
          <br>
          The seventh column tabulates the lift force in grams.<br>
          <br>
          The eighth column is the quotient of lift (gm) divided by
          rotor input power (watts) (i.e. the value in the seventh
          column divided by the value in the fourth column).<br>
          <br>
          The ninth column illustrates the ratio of static thrust:lift
          (static thrust as shown in the fifth column, and lift as
          measured while the wing was in motion) for each value of the
          rotor speed and power quoted in the third and fourth columns.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 5 illustrates a plot of the input power of the rotor
          measured in watts, as the ordinate, and the lift in grams
          measured as the abscissa. The points correspond to the
          measured values tabulated in FIG. 4, and the straight line
          illustrates the theoretical (compromise) plot and can be seen
          to be a nearly straight line.<br>
          <br>
          In other words, the efficiency of the lifting member shown in
          FIG. 1 appears to be constant over the range of rotor speeds
          tested, and over the orbiting speeds encountered.<br>
          <br>
          There are of course various alternative possibilities for the
          geometry of the rotor used with the device of FIG. 1. For
          example, the thickness and chord values of the rotor vanes 5
          may be varied. The angle of incidence (30 DEG in FIG. 1) of
          the rotor vanes may be changed. Also, the angle of are
          subtended by the trough 3 may be varied.<br>
          <br>
          With the device shown in FIG. 1 it has been discovered that,
          for a given rotor speed, the lift tends to increase as the
          speed increases. Bearing in mind that the vertical projection
          P1 of the part of the rotor on which the incident air impinges
          is much greater than the projection P2 on to a line normal to
          the upper surface 6 of the wing body, it is possible that
          there is some form of compressibility effect generated through
          the ram effect of the incident air arriving at the rotor area
          exposed at the front of the lifting member.<br>
          <br>
          The included angle of taper of the wing body 1 of FIG. 1 is
          approximately 45 DEG . However, this can be varied. The air
          discharged tangentially from the rotor thus follows a
          direction approximately 45 DEG to the vertical, giving
          substantial lift and thrust components.<br>
          <br>
          Various alternative forms of the lifting member 1 are shown in
          FIGS. 6 to 12 as follows:<br>
          <br>
          In these various drawings the direction of the airflow
          relative to the lifting wing is from right to left whereas in
          FIGS. 1 and 2 it was from left to right. In each view the
          direction of rotation of the crossflow rotor is illustrated by
          a single headed arrow and in FIG. 6 a vortex airflow within
          the rotor is illustrated by doubled headed arrows, with the
          centre of the vortex being designated v, but in practice the
          position of the vortex will be located by experiment if the
          position of the centre needs to be known.<br>
          <br>
          It is known that the efficiency of the crossflow rotor
          increases with the establishment of a vortex within and
          eccentric to the path of the rotor vanes, and rotating at an
          angular velocity much higher than that of the rotor and in the
          same direction of rotation. The establishment of such a vortex
          is enhanced by various means shown in FIGS. 6 to 12.<br>
          <br>
          In FIG. 6 the shroud 3 has its front end turned inward at 3a,
          and the result of this is the formation of a vortex centred
          within the rotor and having the direction of rotation
          indicated by the double headed arrows. FIG. 6 also illustrates
          the angle of incidence .varies. a of the wing body 1 measured
          in terms of the inclination of the underside of the wing body.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 7 shows a departure from FIG. 6 in that the underside of
          the wing body 1 is concave to impart a degree of camber to the
          wing body, but furthermore the wing body of FIG. 7 has
          additional control features. At the front end of the shroud 3
          is a movable baffle 11 which can be retracted to the position
          shown in FIG. 7 to allow maximum airflow into the rotor or can
          be extended upwardly and rightwardly so as to mask the inlet
          of the rotor to some extent, and thus to control the
          efficiency of that particular lifting body.<br>
          <br>
          Also shown in FIG. 7 is a movable spoiler 12 which is
          illustrated in FIG. 7 as being extended so as to attenuate or
          to destroy the vortex. This again provides a measure of
          control of the efficiency of the lifting body.<br>
          <br>
          It is envisaged that the baffle 11 and the spoiler 12 would be
          able to be used independently of one another, or together in
          the same embodiment, and for the sake of simplicity they have
          been shown in FIG. 7 as both being present. In FIG. 7 the
          shroud 3 is no longer concentric with the rotor 2 but has its
          end points 3b and 3c closer to the path of the vanes 5 of the
          rotor than is the shroud at a point between them (for example
          where the spoiler 12 is mounted), and this helps to generate
          the vortex provided either there is no spoiler 12 present or
          that spoiler has been moved anticlockwise from the FIG. 7
          position to lie flush with the shroud 3.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 8 again has the shroud 3 non-concentric between the
          points 3b and 3c, in order to establish the vortex, but in
          this case there is a forward extension 3d of the shroud from
          the point 3b and substantially concentric with the rotor vane
          path.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, FIG. 9 lacks this forward extension 3d and
          provides a more open construction which, for a given speed of
          rotation of the crossflow rotor 2, is able to admit and
          discharge a greater volume flow rate of air than with the FIG.
          8 embodiment.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 10 provides for a larger air inlet area and relies on a
          bulge 1a of the lifting body 1 to define the necessary
          non-concentric portion, even though in this case there is no
          shroud as such. The formation of the vortex results from the
          cut away configuration of the part of the lifting body 1
          facing the crossflow rotor 2. Towards the lower leading part
          1b of the lifting body 1 is a concave section which, together
          with guide vanes 15, defines an inlet path or nozzle to guide
          incident air into the rotor blade path and hence to establish
          better the vortex and the flow through the crossflow rotor.<br>
          <br>
          FIG. 11 again uses a bulge 1a, but this time positioned much
          higher on the lifting body 1 so that the air inlet "nozzles"
          defined by the convex surface of the lifting body 1 between
          bulge 1a and front 1b; also the two guide vanes 15 are much
          longer than in the FIG. 10 embodiment. This appears to give
          the most open configuration of the rotor, allowing the best
          possible flow conditions through the rotor.<br>
          <br>
          FIGS. 12a and 12b illustrate an alternative form of the
          lifting body 1 in which the inlet configuration can be altered
          in flight to control the efficiency of the lifting body. FIG.
          12a shows a set of four straight inlet guide vanes 17,
          pivotable about their respective shafts 18, between the open
          position shown in FIG. 12a and a closed position shown in FIG.
          12b. The lifting body 1 does have a vestige of the shroud 3,
          and it is possible to liken the inlet guide vanes 17 in their
          FIG. 12a position to the inlet guide vanes 15 of FIGS. 10 and
          11, and in their closed (12b) position to the shroud extension
          3d of FIG. 8 or the shrouds 3 of FIGS. 6 and 7.<br>
          <br>
          Although only FIGS. 7 and 10 illustrate camber of the lifting
          wing body by means of a concave underside, it would of course
          be appreciated that any of the embodiments shown may have such
          a concave underside and/or a convex upper surface (6 in FIG.
          1) to impart camber to the body.<br>
          <br>
          Although the above description is based on a lifting member
          for an aircraft, there are various other possibilities. It may
          be that the device may have hydrodynamic applications, for
          example in propelling boats using such a member as an immersed
          keel or a hydrofoil wing.<br>
          <br>
          In the aerodynamic field, the device may also be used for
          propelling and controlling boats using the aerodynamic effect
          rather than the hydrodynamic thrust of an immersed screw.<br>
          <br>
          When used as the lifting wing for an aircraft, as mentioned
          above it is possible for other thrust means to be omitted and
          for the airflow generated by the rotor to provide all of both
          thrust and lift. With reference to the (model) aircraft
          depicted in FIG. 3, the drive motor for the rotors may operate
          such that pushing the control column to the left (port) will
          cause the rotor(s) of the starboard side lift-generating
          member to rotate faster than the rotor(s) on the port side,
          giving controllable roll and yaw to allow a balanced banked
          turn to be executed. There may still be a rudder to provide
          for the yaw, in which case this will be connected to the
          pilot's foot pedals. There may equally be some interconnection
          between the foot pedals and the speed differential mechanism,
          so that at high rotor powers there will be less rudder
          deflection needed for a given degree of yaw.<br>
          <br>
          The elevator may be dispensed with but is more likely to be
          present and controlled by a trim lever rather than by rearward
          movement of the control column.<br>
          <br>
          An aircraft incorporating such a lifting member will provide
          adequate degrees of lift at low speeds and will therefore have
          good STOL characteristics. The noise generated will be much
          lower than that of a conventional jet or propeller-driven
          machine. Because a large quantity of air is moving at a very
          low speed through the rotor the rotor blades themselves move
          slower than a conventional driving propeller so the blade
          noise can be much lower than that of a propeller.<br>
          <br>
          In order to reduce noise levels still further it may be
          advantageous to shape the rotor vanes 5 so as to follow the
          path of a very coarse pitch helix about the axis of rotation
          of the shaft 4 so that they are nearly, but not quite,
          straight. This may avoid any tendency for a sudden noise to be
          created as each blade enters the trough at the trailing edge
          of the trough because whereas a straight blade parallel to
          that trough trailing edge will pass the trough edge at a
          single instant, a slightly helical blade will not but will
          instead have a point of approach which travels along the span
          of the wing body 1 (rather like the shearing action of the
          rotary blades of a cylinder mower passing a stationary
          straight blade).<br>
          <br>
          An aeroplane incorporating such a lifting member will, for
          example, be applicable to sport and tourism in that an
          open-cockpit aircraft can be constructed to fly slowly and
          quietly using such a system. Equally, it can be useful for
          carrying loads over short distances (in view of its low flying
          speed). Furthermore, it can be useful for crop-dusting.<br>
          <br>
          For passenger transport it may be particularly convenient to
          use this as a shuttle craft between nearby airports.<br>
          <br>
          In the event of engine failure the spanwise rotors may be
          driven in autorotation by the airflow, so that recovery from a
          loss of lift would require simply an increase in forward
          speed, in a dive, and then, on nearing the ground, flattening
          out the flight path to exploit the kinetic energy of the rotor
          somewhat like the case of engine-off autorotation of a
          helicopter.<br>
