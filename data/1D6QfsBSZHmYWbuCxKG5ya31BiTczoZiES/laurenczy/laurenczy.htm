      <br>
      Do ants hold the key to the fuel of the future? Formic acid
      provides more efficient and safer storage of hydrogen. It is an
      ideal way to store energy from renewable sources or to power 21st
      century cars.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is often referred to as the future replacement for fossil
      fuels. Despite being environmentally-friendly and efficient, it
      nevertheless has many drawbacks. Because it is extremely
      flammable, it must be stored in bulky pressurized cylinders.
      Scientists from the EPFL and their colleagues at the
      Leibniz-Institut für Katalyse have found a way around these
      obstacles. Once converted to formic acid, hydrogen can be stored
      easily and safely. This is an ideal solution for storing energy
      from renewable sources like solar or wind power, or to power the
      cars of tomorrow.<br>
      <br>
      Hydrogen is easy to produce from electrical energy. With a
      catalyst and the CO2 present in the atmosphere, scientists have
      been able to convert it to formic acid. Rather than a heavy cast
      iron cylinder filled with pressurized hydrogen, they obtain a
      non-flammable substance that is liquid at room temperature.<br>
      <br>
      In November 2010, EPFL laboratories produced the opposite
      reaction. Through a catalytic process, the formic acid reverts to
      CO2 and hydrogen, which can then be converted into electricity. A
      compact working prototype producing 2 kilowatts of power has been
      developed, and two companies have purchased a license to develop
      this technology: Granit (Switzerland) and Tekion (Canada).<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Storing Renewable Energy</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      “Imagine for example that you have solar panels on your roof,”
      says Gabor Laurenczy, professor at the Laboratory of
      Organometallic and Medicinal Chemistry and Head of the Group of
      Catalysis for Energy and Environment.“In bad weather or at night,
      your formic acid battery will release the excess energy stored
      while the sun was shining.” In such a configuration, the method
      can restitute more than 60% of the original electrical energy.<br>
      <br>
      This solution is extremely safe. The formic acid continuously
      releases very small amounts of hydrogen, “just what you need at
      the time for your energy consumption,” says the researcher.<br>
      <br>
      Another advantage over conventional storage is that the method can
      store almost twice as much energy at equal volume. One liter of
      formic acid contains more than 53 grams of hydrogen, compared to
      just 28 grams for the same volume of pure hydrogen pressurized to
      350 bars.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, the researchers have developed a catalytic process using
      iron, which is readily available and inexpensive compared to
      “noble” metals such as platinum or ruthenium. As with all
      catalysts, no material is degraded during the process.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Formic acid at the pump</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      It is probably in the automotive field that the invention has the
      greatest potential. Currently, the prototypes produced by certain
      carmakers store hydrogen in conventional form, which entails
      problems such as risk of explosion, large volume pressurized
      tanks, difficulties in filling the tank quickly, etc.<br>
      <br>
      The vehicles of the 21st century may run on formic acid. This
      solution allows for safer, more compact hydrogen storage as well
      as easier filling at the pump – formic acid is liquid at room
      temperature. “Technically, it is quite feasible. In fact, a number
      of major automobile manufacturers contacted us in 2008, when oil
      prices reached record highs,” says Gabor Laurenczy. “In my
      opinion, the only obstacle is cost.” It will be several years
      before drivers can pull up to any anthill and fill their tanks.<span

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Abstract -- </span>The present
      invention relates to a method of producing hydrogen gas and carbon
      dioxide in a catalytic reaction from formic acid, said reaction
      being conducted in an aqueous solution over a wide temperature
      range and already at room temperature (25 DEG C.). The reaction is
      advantageous because it can be tuned to take place at very high
      rates, up to about 90 litre H2/minute/litre reactor volume. The

      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      [0001] The present invention relates to a method of producing
      hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide from formic acid, and to a method
      of producing energy.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PRIOR ART AND THE PROBLEM
        UNDERLYING THE INVENTION</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0002] Hydrogen gas, H2, is a versatile source of energy and an
      important starting material for many chemical reactions.
      Therefore, hydrogen production is a large and growing industry,
      with globally about 50 million tons being produced in 2004. As an
      energy source, for example, it can be used in fuel cells,
      combustion motors and chemical reactors for producing energy in
      the form of electric energy, kinetic energy, and/or heat, just to
      mention a few. It is for these many applications that hydrogen gas
      was recognised to be a primary carrier that connects a host of
      energy sources to diverse end uses (US Department of Energy 2003
      report).<br>
      <br>
      [0003] The high importance of hydrogen gas may be illustrated at
      the example of the hydrogen fuel cell. Although water electrolysis
      gives very pure H2, traditionally produced hydrogen gas often
      contains carbon monoxide, which is deleterious to the catalyst in
      fuel cells. This indicates how important it is to provide a
      process for producing hydrogen gas at high purity locally,
      comprising no contamination by CO.<br>
      <br>
      [0004] Furthermore, hydrogen gas is extremely volatile. As a
      consequence, hydrogen gas is stored at high pressure or low
      temperature in gas containers made of steel, the weight of which
      is exceeding by far the weight of the hydrogen gas stored in it.<br>
      <br>
      [0005] Hydrogen gas reacts violently with oxygen in a wide
      concentration range, making the storage of large quantities of
      hydrogen dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      [0006] Given the difficulty in storing the volatile hydrogen gas,
      it is a particular objective to provide a process of preparing
      hydrogen gas in situ, in other words, instantly upon demand of a
      selected, hydrogen consuming device or process. For example, it
      would be advantageous to provide a vehicle comprising a hydrogen
      fuel cell or a hydrogen driven combustion motor, the vehicle being
      propelled by energy generated in a reaction consuming hydrogen
      gas. Preferably, such a vehicle does not require a heavy and
      dangerous container for storage of hydrogen gas.<br>
      <br>
      [0007] Generally, the present invention seeks to provide hydrogen
      gas in an inexpensive, efficient manner, and, if necessary at high
      pressure, in suitable reactors for direct use in a hydrogen
      consuming process or device.<br>
      <br>
      [0008] In JP 2005-289742 a method for producing hydrogen gas and
      carbon dioxide from formic acid is disclosed. However, the
      reaction is conducted at temperatures in the range of
      250-600[deg.] C. and is, therefore, not very practical.<br>
      <br>
      [0009] U.S. Pat. No. 4,597,363 disclose a method of producing
      hydrogen gas for a fuel cell by conversion of oxalic acid to
      formic acid, followed by formation of hydrogen gas and carbon
      dioxide from formic acid at elevated temperatures.<br>
      <br>
      [0010] In both prior art documents, hydrogen gas is obtained at a
      low conversion rate, relatively high temperatures and at a low gas
      pressure. It is an objective of the present invention, to provide
      a method for producing hydrogen gas at higher reaction rates,
      temperatures in the range of 30-180[deg.] C. and at desired/very
      high gas pressures.<br>

      mixtures of calcium carbonate and carbon dioxide using a
      water-soluble rhodium(I)-tertiary phosphine complex catalyst"
      Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical 224 (2004) 87-91,
      disclose a method in which calcium formate is obtained from
      calcium carbonate under a gas phase containing both H2 and CO2.
      Also the decomposition of Ca(HCOO)2 to H2 and CO2 by aid of the
      same catalyst was reported. Again, only low conversion rates and
      low gas pressures were obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0012] Jenner et al, Journal of Molecular Catalysis, 64 (1991)
      337-347, disclose the decomposition of formic acid, more precisely
      methyl formate in aqueous solution, to hydrogen, carbon dioxide
      and carbon monoxide (1%). In this reaction, CO is produced in an
      intermediate step, which accounts for its presence in the final
      products. As catalysts, Ru3(CO)12 and tributylphosphine are
      disclosed. Furthermore, no formate salt is added to the reaction
      mixture. In view of this document, it is an objective of the
      present invention to avoid CO impurities on the product side, use
      formic acid as H2 and CO2 source, avoid the formation of methanol
      as by-product and to be able to conduct the reaction at lower
      temperatures with still high conversion efficiency and speed.<br>
      <br>
      [0013] R. Laine et al., Journal of American Chemical Society,
      99(1) (1977) p. 252-253, disclose the use of a ruthenium carbonyl
      catalyst in a water gas shift reaction conducted in very diluted
      ethoxyethanol solvent. A relatively slow conversion of formic acid
      or formate to hydrogen gas and CO2 in the same system is reported
      (half life of formic acid is about 300 s). The very diluted
      ethoxyethanol solution, with a molar ratio of KOH/HCOOH higher
      than 1.5 (mole/mole), renders this reaction unsuitable for
      practical applications.<br>
      <br>
      [0014] Khai et al., Journal of organometallic chemistry, 309
      (1986) p. C63-C66 disclose the reduction of nitro- and halo
      aromatic compounds in presence of formic acid, the latter being
      decomposed in the course of the reaction. The reaction takes place
      in organic solvents (THF, benzene, DMF) and in presence of a
      water-insoluble triphenyl ruthenium catalyst. The reduction of
      nitro- and halo aromatic compounds is not the subject of the
      present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0015] King et al., Inorganica Chimica Acta, 237 (1-2) (1995), p.
      65-69, report the decomposition of formic acid in a system
      comprising a aqueous solution of rhodium(III) and NO&lt;2-&gt;. In
      this reaction, NO&lt;2-&gt; is used up and converted to N2O. The
      catalyst is quickly deactivated during the reaction into insoluble
      Rh metal. The present invention has the goal of converting formic
      acid to hydrogen in a continuous way with catalyst recycling.
      Furthermore, specific further products are not desired.<br>
      <br>
      [0016] Gao et al., J. Chem. Soc., (2000), p. 3212-3217 and Chem.
      Comm. (1998), 2365-2366, disclose the interconversion of formic
      acid and H2/CO2 in acetone solution in presence of a binuclear
      ruthenium catalyst comprising two bis-(diphenylphosphine)methane
      ligands. They use air/oxygen sensitive system and catalyst, which
      releases CO during the activation. Acetone is a volatile and
      flammable solvent.<br>
      <br>
      [0017] FR 1228452 discloses the decomposition of formic acid in
      mixtures comprising further aliphatic acids by the aid of a
      catalyst comprising a metal such as platine bound on active
      carbon. The reaction takes place slowly and conversion
      efficiencies are around 80-90%). The present invention has the
      objective of conducting the conversion of formic acid in absence
      of other aliphatic acids and at higher conversion efficiencies.<br>
      <br>
      [0018] It is an objective of the present invention to provide a
      method of producing hydrogen gas at a increased rate and at a high
      conversion efficiency. It is a further objective to produce
      hydrogen gas at higher pressures. Ideally, hydrogen gas is
      produced at desired H2 partial pressures of up to 600 bar or more.<br>
      <br>
      [0019] In particular, it is an objective to produce hydrogen in
      situ, at a desired high rate for feeding a hydrogen consuming
      device, for example a fuel cell or burning motor, or a hydrogen
      consuming process directly, in an amount corresponding to the
      hydrogen gas to be used.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0020] The inventors of the present invention provided a method
      for producing hydrogen gas from formic acid, which method meets
      the objectives discussed above and which solves the problems of
      the prior art.<br>
      <br>
      [0021] In a first aspect, the present invention provides a method

      <br>
      [0026] In a sixth aspect, the present invention provides a method
      of producing hydrogen gas and carbon dioxide in a chemical
      reaction from formic acid, said reaction being conducted in
      presence of a catalyst, said catalyst preferably being a complex
      of the general formula (I):<br>
      <br>
      [0000]<br>
      M(L)n (I)<br>
      <br>
      [0000] in which,<br>
      <br>
      M is a metal selected from Ru, Rh, Ir, Pt, Pd, and Os, preferably
      Ru;<br>

      said phosphorus atom being bound by a complex bond to said metal,
      L further comprising at least an aromatic group and a hydrophilic
      group; and,<br>
      n is in the range of 1-4;<br>
      wherein the complex of formula (I) optionally comprises other
      ligands and is provided in the form of a salt or is neutral.<br>
      <br>
      [0030] In a seventh aspect, the present invention provides a
      method for producing hydrogen gas at controlled quantity and/or
      gas pressure comprising the reaction according to the present
      invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0031] In an eight aspect, the present invention provides a method
      for producing hydrogen for a hydrogen consuming process and/or
      device, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      producing hydrogen gas according to the method of the invention,
      and,<br>
      directing the hydrogen gas to the hydrogen consuming process
      and/or device.<br>
      <br>
      [0034] In a ninth aspect, the present invention provides a method

      [0039] In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a
      method of producing a gas comprising hydrogen gas and being free
      of carbon monoxide (CO), wherein the chemical reaction is
      conducted at a temperature in the range of 15-220[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0040] In another aspect, the present invention provides a method
      for providing hydrogen gas as a reagent in a specific chemical
      reaction, for example chemical synthesis, the method comprising

      invention, optionally, removing CO2 from the gas obtained, and
      directing the hydrogen gas to provide it for the specific chemical

      <br>
      [0041] The reaction preferably takes place in an aqueous solution
      and at relatively low temperatures. The chemical reaction of the
      method of the present invention is believed to be highly
      advantageous because, first, the reaction products, H2 and CO2,
      can be easily separated from the reaction medium and from each
      other. Actually, the gas just separates from the reaction medium
      when being generated. Second, the catalyst is easily separated
      from the reaction products, due to the high solubility of the
      catalyst in the reaction medium and practically zero solubility in
      the reaction products. The combination of these features render
      the method of the present invention an extremely valuable tool for
      producing hydrogen gas for any purpose one can envisage.<br>

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
        PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0049] The present invention provides a way to generate hydrogen
      gas devoid of carbon monoxide not only at a unusually high rate,
      but also at a rate that can be controlled easily by supply of
      formic acid, and/or varying temperature in the reaction vessel,
      and/or by varying other parameters of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0050] The reaction is robust, as the catalyst is completely
      recycled and is effective for prolonged time without degradation.
      The catalyst preferably used in the method of the present
      invention is stable at the temperatures and in the acidic
      environment of the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0051] The reaction conditions are generally mild, as the reaction
      was observed to take place at high conversion efficiency already
      at temperatures of around 20[deg.] C., for example RT (25[deg.]
      C.) and higher.<br>
      <br>
      [0052] The reaction vessel in which the reaction takes place needs
      to be substantially impermeably to water and air and preferably
      withstand the acidic reaction conditions as defined further below.
      Accordingly, glassware may constitute a material for a reaction
      vessel in which the reaction of the method of the present
      invention can be conducted.<br>
      <br>
      [0053] If the reaction is conducted at high pressures, the
      reaction vessel needs, of course, to be adapted to the pressures
      and further conditions generated by the chemical reaction.
      Accordingly, depending on the amount of pressure to be generated,
      vessels of different materials and sizes may be constructed. At
      very high pressures such as those described below, reactors made
      of hydrogen resisting stainless steel may be used (Hastelloy,
      Inconel, etc).<br>
      <br>
      [0054] Preferably, the reaction vessel comprises a formic acid
      inlet and/or a gas outlet. The gas outlet may be provided as a
      valve, thus allowing to control the pressure inside the reaction
      vessel may be controlled by the valve properties. In case that the
      reaction is conducted at above ambient pressures in the reaction
      vessel, the formic acid inlet is preferably coupled to a pump so
      that formic acid can be entered into the aqueous solution in the
      reaction vessel albeit the high pressures inside it.<br>
      <br>
      [0055] The reaction vessel preferably comprises means for
      measuring the temperature and pressure inside the vessel, in
      particular a thermometer and a pressure gage.<br>
      <br>
      [0056] The chemical reaction of the present invention preferably
      takes place in an aqueous solution, with water providing the
      principle, preferably the only solvent (reaction medium).
      Preferably the aqueous solution is a ionic aqueous solution. For
      the reaction of the present invention to be carried out, only the
      starting material, formic acid, and the catalyst are required.
      Preferably, also a formate salt is present in the aqueous
      solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0057] Accordingly, in the method of the present invention,
      preferably a catalyst is used. In other words, the chemical
      reaction of the method of the present invention is a catalytic
      reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0058] The catalyst to be used in the reaction of the present
      invention is preferably soluble in water at least 50 g/L water at
      25[deg.] C. More preferably it is soluble at least 100 g/L water,
      even more preferably at 150 g L/water and most preferably at least
      200 g L/water.<br>
      <br>
      [0059] Of course, catalysts having lower solubilities could do as
      well, for example with catalysts having higher efficiencies than
      those reported herein.<br>
      <br>
      [0060] Importantly, the catalyst is much more soluble in the
      reaction medium, generally water, than in any of the products
      produced, in particular in supercritical CO2, if the reaction is
      conducted at a pressure sufficiently high for CO2 to be present in
      the supercritical state. For example, above 31[deg.] C. and 73 bar
      partial pressure, CO2 is present as a supercritical CO2. Since the
      method of the present invention can be conveniently be conducted
      under these conditions, the catalyst preferably is practically
      insoluble in supercritical CO2, the latter serving as solvent in
      many chemical reactions.<br>
      <br>
      [0061] Preferably, the molecular ratio of solubility of the
      catalyst in water to the solubility of the catalyst in
      supercritical CO2 is &gt;99.5:0.5, more preferably &gt;99.99:0.01,
      most preferably &gt;99.999:0.001.<br>
      <br>
      [0062] Furthermore, the catalyst is stable at temperatures
      &gt;=60[deg.] C., preferably &gt;=80[deg.] C., preferably
      &gt;=120[deg.] C., more preferably &gt;=150[deg.] C. and most
      preferably &gt;=180[deg.] C. Stable, for the purpose of the
      present invention, means that the catalyst catalyses at least 5,
      preferably 10 or more reaction cycles without measurable
      degradation or measurable loss of activity.<br>
      <br>
      [0063] Preferably, the catalyst is stable at the pH at which the
      reaction is conducted, as defined further below.<br>
      <br>
      [0064] Preferably, the catalyst is the catalyst of formula (I),
      M(L)n as defined above. Preferably, M is Ru or Rh, more preferably
      Ru (Ruthenium). Ru preferably is in the oxidation state Ru&lt;II
      &gt;during the reaction, however, Ru&lt;III&gt;, which is more
      easily available may also be used. It was observed that Ru&lt;III
      &gt;is converted to Ru&lt;II &gt;during the reaction.<br>
      <br>
      [0065] According to an embodiment of the method of the invention,
      if n&gt;1, each L may be different from another L.<br>
      <br>
      [0066] L, in formula (I), is preferably selected from aryl
      phosphines, more preferably phenyl phosphines, for example
      triarylphosphines and/or triphenylphosphines. Preferably, the aryl
      phosphine is substituted in order to increase its solubility in
      water. Preferably, the aryl phosphine is substituted by a
      hydrophilic group. The hydrophilic group is preferably selected
      from sulphonate, carboxylate, and/or hydroxy, for example.
      Preferably it is sulphonate.<br>
      <br>
      [0067] Preferably, L in formula (I) above is a sulfonated triaryl
      phosphine. It may be a mono-, di- or trisulphonated aryl
      phosphine. Preferably, the triarylphosphine is trisulfonated.<br>
      <br>
      [0068] Preferably, L is a sulfonated triphenylphosphine. It may be
      a mono-, di- and/or trisulphonated triphenylphosphine. Preferably,
      the triphenylphosphine is trisulfonated, as in this case
      solubility in water is highest.<br>
      <br>
      [0069] The sulfonyl group may be in the meta or para position of
      the aryl/phenyl group bound to the phosphorus atom. Sulphonated
      triphenylphosphines with the sulfonate group present at the meta
      position are more easy to synthesise and are, therefore,
      preferably used in the method of the present invention.<br>
      <br>
      [0070] Preferably, L is TPPTS (tris(3-sulfophenyl)phosphine).<br>
      <br>
      [0071] L can be also a carbene.<br>
      <br>
      [0072] In formula (I) above, n is preferably 1, 2, 3 or 4, more
      preferably it is 1, 2 or 3, most preferably it is 2. If n is 2,
      each ligand L(1 to n) may be the same or different. An unlimited
      number of combinations is technically possible in the context of
      the present invention. Care has to be taken that, when selecting
      ligands, the preferred water solubility of the ligand as defined
      herein is obtained.<br>
      <br>
      [0073] For illustrating the many possibilities of selecting
      ligands for the catalyst of the present invention, one could
      imagine that n is 2, with ligand L1 being a mono, bis, tris or
      non-sulfonated triphenyl phosphine and ligand L2 being selected
      from a carbene, a carbonated triphenyl phosphine or from a (mono,
      bis or tris) sulphonated triphenyl phosphine, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0074] Preferably, if n=2, one ligand L1 is selected from a mono,
      bis, or tris sulfonated triphenyl phosphine and ligand L2 is
      selected from a carbene, a carbonated triphenyl phosphine or a
      sulphonated triphenyl phosphine (in particular a mono, bis, or
      tris sulfonated triphenyl phosphine).<br>
      <br>
      [0075] Alternatively, if n=2, ligand L1 is selected from a mono,
      bis, tris or non-sulfonated triphenyl phosphine and ligand L2 is
      selected from a mono, bis, or tris sulfonated triphenyl
      phosphine).<br>
      <br>
      [0076] For example, if n is 2, L1 may be TPPTS and L2 may be TPPMS
      (mono sulfonated triphenyl phosphine). According to another
      example, L1 may be TPPTS and L2 may be TTPDS
      (bis(3-sulfophenyl)phosphine). According to a still other example,
      a non-sulfonated triphenyl phosphine ligand may be combined with a
      trisulphonated triphenyl phosphine ligand. Basically, all
      combinations of mono, bis, tris and non-sulfonated
      triphenylphosphine ligands are possible.<br>
      <br>
      [0077] If n&gt;=2, there is preferably at least one sulfonated
      triphenylphosphine ligand present. However, it is also possible to
      use and combine triphenylphosphine ligands comprising carboxylate
      groups.<br>
      <br>
      [0078] It is worthwhile noting that, in general, catalysts with
      twice the same ligand L, e.g. TPPTS, are much easier to prepare
      than catalysts with different ligands L.<br>
      <br>
      [0079] According to a preferred embodiment, the catalyst is
      [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)4]XY, in which X is a non coordinating anion, for
      example tosylate, triflate, and Y is 1 or 2, the overall charge of
      XY being -2.<br>
      <br>
      [0080] The catalyst may be conveniently synthesised by mixing
      constituents (Ru&lt;II &gt;and/or Ru&lt;III&gt;, TPPTS, for
      example) of the complex in water in the respective molecular
      quantity followed by crystallisation. The individual constituents
      are commercially available and are described in the literature.
      Alternatively, the catalyst can be synthesised and partly
      generated in situ, in the aqueous solution providing the reaction
      mixture by adding said constituents first to an aqueous solution.<br>
      <br>
      [0081] The reaction of the method of the present invention is
      preferably conducted in presence of a formate salt. Surprisingly,
      the presence of the formate salt can have a positive impact on the
      rate of the reaction. On the other hand, with the ratio of formic
      acid (HCOOH) to formate (HCOO&lt;-&gt;) in the aqueous solution
      decreasing, conversion efficiency decreases, in other words, the
      percentage of formic acid that is converted becomes lower.<br>
      <br>
      [0082] The formate salt may be any formic salt as long as the
      cation does not substantially interfere with the chemical
      reaction. Preferably, the cation is an inorganic cation, for
      example calcium sodium preferably a metal ion. For example, the
      cation is sodium and/or potassium, also possible are lithium,
      cesium, calcium and ammonium. The use of different formate salts
      (with different cations, for example) is not excluded.<br>
      <br>
      [0083] Therefore, the molecular ratio of HCOOH:HCOO&lt;- &gt;can
      be adjusted according to preferences on rate or conversion
      efficiency, as is desired by the skilled person. The present
      inventors found an optimum ratio in the range of 1:20 to 30:1,
      preferably 1:5 to 20:1, more preferably 1:1 to 15:1, and even more
      preferably 5:1 to 14:1. The most preferred ratio for having an
      optimal compromise between reaction rate and conversion efficiency
      was found to be 9:1. According to a preferred embodiment, the
      molecular ratio of HCOOH:HCOO&lt;- &gt;is in the range of 1:9 to
      15:1. The ratio of HCOOH:HCOO&lt;- &gt;is a way of controlling the
      rate and conversion efficiency of the present invention (see
      examples) and can be adjusted according to the preferences of the
      skilled person.<br>
      <br>
      [0084] For the purpose of the present specification, values
      indicating the end-points of a range are considered to be included
      in the range.<br>
      <br>
      [0085] The presence of formic acid and the formate having, of
      course, an influence on the pH, the reaction of the present
      invention is preferably conducted at a pH in the range of 0-6,
      more preferably 1-5, even more preferably 1.5-4.5 and most
      preferably 2-4 and 2-3.5. According to preferred embodiments, the
      pH is in the range of 1-6, preferably 2.5-5.0.<br>
      <br>
      [0086] The temperature of the reaction mixture (aqueous solution)
      was found affect reaction rate. Accordingly, the chemical reaction
      of the method of the present invention is preferably conducted at
      a temperature in the range of 20[deg.] C.-200[deg.] C., preferably
      60[deg.] C.-150[deg.] C., more preferably 70[deg.] C.-140[deg.]
      C., even more preferably 80[deg.] C.-130[deg.] C., most preferably
      90[deg.] C.-125[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0087] The temperature is preferably applied from outside the
      reaction vessel by suitable heating/cooling equipment. For
      example, heat exchangers, electric heating, an oil bath and or
      water bath may be used to control the temperature in the interior
      of the reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0088] Other preferred ranges for the reaction of the method of
      the invention are 25[deg.] C.-200[deg.] C., 80[deg.] C.-110[deg.]
      C.; 90[deg.] C.-120[deg.] C. and 80[deg.] C.-130[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0089] It is clear that the reaction temperatures can be
      controlled according to the preferences. If H2 production is to be
      very cost-effective, it may be conducted at ambient temperatures
      for prolonged time. This may be the case if cost is a more
      important factor than time, for example when hydrogen is consumed
      in a low rate. Under these conditions, temperature ranges of
      20-90[deg.] C., 25-70[deg.] C. may be selected, or even lower
      temperatures, for producing hydrogen and CO2 gas at a relatively
      slow rate but still pressures significantly above 1 bar.<br>
      <br>
      [0090] In principle, the higher the temperature, the quicker the
      reaction takes place. However, very high rates are obtained at
      relatively low temperatures and therefore, temperatures around
      100[deg.] C.+-20[deg.] C., preferably +-15[deg.] C. are preferred
      for practical reasons.<br>
      <br>
      [0091] A further way of controlling the reaction rate is, of
      course, the supply of formic acid to the reaction vessel. The
      chemical reaction of the method of the present invention can be
      conducted batch-wise or continuously. In the batch-wise operation
      mode, the amount of formic acid added per batch determines the
      amount of hydrogen gas being produced. In the continuous mode, the
      rate of adding formic acid into the reaction vessel can be used to
      determine rate and/or amount of hydrogen being produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0092] Temperature is thus one of the ways among others of
      controlling the reaction of the method of the present invention.
      By keeping the reaction vessel at a specific temperature, or by
      modifying this temperature, the reaction rate can conveniently be
      controlled.<br>
      <br>
      [0093] Accordingly, in an embodiment, in the method of the present
      invention, the hydrogen quantity and/or gas pressure is
      controlled, optionally in the course of the reaction taking place,
      by varying one, several, or all of factors selected from:<br>
      <br>
      pH;<br>
      the molecular ratio of formic acid to formate in the reaction
      medium;<br>
      the reaction temperature;<br>
      supply of formic acid;<br>
      these factors being varied, if applicable, according to the ranges
      provided in the present description.<br>
      <br>
      [0098] The hydrogen and carbon dioxide gas developed in the course
      of the reaction can cause considerable pressure. Surprisingly, the
      equilibrium of the reaction of the present invention lies so far
      at the side of the products, that the increasing pressure does not
      stop the reaction. So far, total gas pressures of up to 1200 bar
      have been measured, which means that the method of the present
      invention can be conducted under or at these pressures.<br>
      <br>
      [0099] In terms of H2 partial pressure, the reaction was conducted
      to produce H2 at partial pressures over to 600 bar. It is expected
      that H2 higher partial pressure can be obtained, for example up to
      1000 bar and more, in suitable reaction vessels. Accordingly, the
      reaction of the present invention is preferably conducted at a H2
      partial pressure in the range of 0.5-600 bar.<br>
      <br>
      [0100] A pure H2 and CO2 mixture (50:50 vol. %) is produced.<br>
      <br>
      [0101] The method of the present invention can be controlled to
      produce from 0-90 litre H2/minute/litre reactor volume. For
      example, the method produces from 10-60, 20-60, 30-55, or 40-55
      litre H2/minute/litre reactor volume, according to the preference
      of the skilled person. In particular, the tuned reaction produces
      80 litre H2/minute/litre reactor volume. Any value in the ranges
      may be obtained by adjusting parameters, for example the
      temperature, catalyst concentration, formate concentration, the
      formic acid supply rate, accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      [0102] If required, CO2 can easily be separated from H2, by
      exploiting physical properties such as melting temperature,
      volatility and/or diffusion coefficient that differ with the two
      gases.<br>
      <br>
      [0103] The absence of any carbon monoxide in the produced gas, the
      high rate and efficiency of conversion of formic acid to H2 under
      the conditions described hereinabove, as well as the fact that the
      reaction can be conveniently controlled provide important
      advantages, for example if combined with the requirements of a
      fuel cell. The fact that H2 at a high partial pressure is produced
      is also an advantage, because it permits to control the amount of
      H2 conducted to a hydrogen gas consuming device, such as a fuel
      cell by modifying the valve properties, with the reaction vessel
      functioning as a reservoir for H2. The reaction vessel thus has
      two functions: hydrogen gas is produced in it in accordance with
      requirements, and hydrogen gas pressure is buffered in it under
      high pressure and thus constitutes a buffer tank. Of course, if
      compared to a traditional tank of hydrogen gas stored under
      pressure, a significantly smaller and lighter vessel size can be
      used, with the actual tank of fuel being constituted by a
      container of formic acid, which may be used to produce hydrogen
      gas to meet short term requirements.<br>
      <br>
      [0104] The present invention provides a method and/or device for
      producing energy. The energy may be energy in any form, such as
      kinetic energy, electric energy, heat, potential energy, or
      combination of these at the same time.<br>
      <br>
      [0105] For example, devices producing energy from hydrogen gas are
      motors, such as a combustion motors and hydrogen fuel cells.
      Methods for producing energy from hydrogen gas are the methods
      taking place in the motor or the fuel cell. A fuel cell, for
      example, may produce electric energy. A motor may produce kinetic
      energy and/or heat, for example.<br>
      <br>
      [0106] The present invention also provides a method for producing
      hydrogen gas (H2) for chemical uses, that is, for using it in a
      chemical reaction, in particular chemical synthesis. In this case,
      the hydrogen gas may be produced according to the requirements in
      the chemical reaction and be directly directed in the necessary
      quantity to the place where the reaction/synthesis is supposed to
      happen.<br>
      <br>
      [0107] The present invention also provides a process and/or
      apparatus consuming energy, whereby the energy is produced by the
      method and/or device of the present invention. Apparatuses
      consuming energy are, for example, vehicles, such as cars, trains,
      aircrafts or boats. Of course, any energy consuming apparatus is
      referred to, not only transport vessels. Accordingly, the energy
      consuming apparatus is understood to also refer to plants,
      households, and so forth.<br>
      <br>
      [0108] Preferably, with respect to the method and/or device
      producing energy from hydrogen gas, said hydrogen gas is
      preferably produced in, or in close vicinity to said device for
      the purpose of producing energy. "Vicinity", in the context of the
      present invention, refers to the fact that the hydrogen gas may be
      directly guided to the method and/or device without need to be
      stored in a storage container, such as a gas bottle, which has to
      be brought to the device and which needs to be exchanged as soon
      as it is empty. In other words, "vicinity" refers to a system in
      which hydrogen gas is produced from a formic acid storage, in a
      way that hydrogen gas can be produced continuously or batch-wise
      as long as formic acid is present for providing hydrogen gas to
      the energy producing method and/or device.<br>
      <br>
      [0109] FIG. 5 schematically illustrates a device and/or method
      producing energy. In this figure, 11 illustrates a HCOOH
      reservoir, which is connected to a pump 12, which pumps formic
      acid into reactor 10, from which hydrogen gas is directed to the
      desired application 20, which may be a motor, a fuel cell, a
      reactor for a further chemical reaction, for example. An optional
      CO2-separator 5 is indicated with doted lines, and may be used
      whenever pure hydrogen gas or hydrogen gas free of CO2 is required
      for application 20.<br>
      <br>
      [0110] For example, the energy may be electric energy produced by
      a fuel cell, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
      <br>
      producing hydrogen gas according to the method of the present
      invention;<br>
      optionally, separating the hydrogen gas from the carbon dioxide;<br>
      directing the hydrogen gas to a fuel cell; and,<br>
      oxidizing the hydrogen gas with oxygen gas in said fuel cell and
      thus creating electric energy.<br>
      <br>
      [0115] In general, the process and/or apparatus consuming energy
      is preferably situated in vicinity to the method and/or device
      producing energy, for example on the vehicle, if the energy
      consuming apparatus is a vehicle. The energy may, of course, be
      stored in a suitable form, if desired, before being consumed by
      the method and/or apparatus consuming energy. Preferably, however,
      the energy is produced, by the method of the present invention,
      according to the energy requirements of the process and/or
      apparatus, and hydrogen gas is produced and guided to the energy
      producing method and/or device for producing energy as a function
      of said energy requirement.<br>
      <br>
      [0116] The present invention is described more concretely with
      reference to the following examples, which, however, are not
      intended to restrict the scope of the invention.<br>

        [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)4](tos)2]</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0117] The catalyst precursor [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)4](tos)2], was
      prepared by dissolving [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2, in which tos=tosylate
      (4-methylbenzenesulfonate ion) and TPPTS, where TPPTS is
      tris(3-sulfophenyl)phosphine tri sodium salt, in a molar ratio of
      1:2 in water, slightly acidified with tosylic acid.<br>
      <br>
      [0118] [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2] is synthesised according to the method of
      Bernhardt (Bernhardt, P.; Biner, M.; Ludi, A. Polyhedron 1990, 9,
      1095-1097). TPPTS is commercially obtained from Aldrich (N&lt;o
      &gt;444979) CAS 63995-70-0.<br>
      <br>
      [0119] 2.1 g (0.0038 mol) [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2 was mixed with 4.3 g
      (0.0076 mol) TPPTS in 20 mL water (containing 0.2 g tosylic acid)
      at 55[deg.] C. until the complex formation was complete (NMR

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Experimental Setting for the
        Preparation of Hydrogen from Formic Acid</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0120] The reaction was carried out in two different reactors:<br>
      <br>
      [0000] A) In high pressure sapphire NMR tubes (A. Cusanelli, U.
      Frey, D. T. Richens, A. E. Merbach, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1996, 118,
      5265) equipped with a manometer, in batch mode. The reaction was
      followed simultaneously by multinuclear NMR (&lt;1&gt;H,
      &lt;13&gt;C, &lt;31&gt;P) and in the same time by the pressure
      evolution of the H2 and CO2. This setting 1 is schematically
      illustrated in FIG. 1A, in which the NMR tube 3, serving as a
      reaction vessel, comprising the reactants is placed in the NMR
      spectrometer 2 and wherein a pressure measurement device 4 placed
      on top of the tube, can be monitored from outside.<br>
      B) In a high pressure autoclave of the type Parr 47, equipped with
      manometer, thermometer, modified for inlet/outlet, connected to a
      HPLC pump for supplying formic acid with the required pressure. It
      was used both in batch mode and in continuous mode. The reactor
      was prepared according to the schematic illustration shown in FIG.
      1B, in which 10 stands for the reaction vessel/reactor. A formic
      acid reservoir 11 is connected to a pump 12, which pumps the
      formic acid through an inlet 13 directly into a glass container
      placed in the autoclave 14. The autoclave is equipped with a
      manometer 15 and a thermometer 16 that permit monitoring of the
      conditions inside the reactor while the reaction takes place. A
      gas outlet 17 comprises a valve 19 in order to control the gas
      outflow. A heater 18 is provided for controlling the temperature
      in the reactor, where the reaction takes place.<br>
      <br>
      [0121] In a standard experimental setting, in high pressure
      sapphire NMR tube reactors, 2.5 mL of an aqueous solution of 4 M
      HCOOH/HCOONa, with a initial molar formic acid to formate ratio of
      9:1 (that is 3.6 M HCOOH and 0.4 M HCOONa) is prepared at RT
      (=25[deg.] C.) in a 10 mm sapphire NMR tube. The pH of the
      solution was about 2.8.<br>
      <br>
      [0122] The catalyst is formed in situ by adding [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2
      (30 mg, 0.054 mmol) and TPPTS at (61 mg, 0.108 mmol) to the
      aqueous solution (catalyst concentration: 0.022 mM).<br>
      <br>
      [0123] Oxygen is removed previously from all solutions by bubbling
      N2 into the solution, since both, [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2 and the
      phosphines can be oxidized.<br>
      <br>
      [0124] The sapphire tube is put into the NMR spectrometer,
      connected to a manometer and the reaction is started by heating to
      a temperature of 90[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0125] Reactions are followed by analysing the species in solution
      by multinuclear (&lt;1&gt;H, &lt;13&gt;C, &lt;31&gt;P) NMR
      spectroscopy. In general, the pressure in the sapphire NMR tube
      and the species in solution in each of the experiments were
      measured simultaneously as a function of time. There is no other
      product detected during the reaction beside H2 and CO2. As
      expected, it was found that pressure correlates directly with
      conversion.<br>
      <br>
      [0126] There are no traces of CO is found in the reaction product
      gas as it is tested by &lt;13&gt;C NMR and FT-IR spectroscopy.<br>
      <br>
      [0127] In the batch-wise mode, for recycling, as one reaction
      cycle is completed (checked by NMR and no further increase in
      pressure-or release of gas through the outlet valve), the sapphire
      tube is moved out from the NMR spectrometer, opened and formic
      acid is added to restore the initial concentration of HCOOH.<br>
      <br>
      [0128] In the continuous mode, the autoclave containing of an
      initial concentration of 4 M HCOOH/HCOONa (9:1), and 0.022 M
      [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)6](tos)2 in 12 mL water, is put in an oil bath and
      the reaction is started by heating the oil bath and therewith the
      temperature in the autoclave to a temperature of 100[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0129] In the continuous mode, when the initial amount of formic
      acid is fully converted (no more increase in pressure), formic
      acid is added continuously at a constant rate of 0.1 mL/min.
      Non-degassed HCOOH is added without protection against oxygen. No
      effect on the activity is observed, indicating that the
      catalytically active species are not sensitive to oxygen. The H2
      (+CO2) gas is released at 130 bar at a rate of about 150 mL/min in
      order to maintain the pressure constant. When addition is stopped
      and the gas out valve closed, no pressure increase is observed,
      which means that all formic acid has been converted. The
      continuous process was run for several weeks without any loss of
      activity, even if the process is interrupted and restarted.<br>
      <br>
      [0130] In the following examples, batch-wise or continuous mode
      was selected for studying the effects of varying different
      reaction parameters provided in Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 3</span><br

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Effect of Temperature on Hydrogen
        Production from Formic Acid</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0131] The experimental setting of Example 2 is modified to
      evaluate the effect of temperature on the pressure in the sapphire
      tube reactor.<br>
      <br>
      [0132] Accordingly, 1.25 mL H2O and 1.25 mL D2O were supplied with
      2 mM of the catalyst concentration obtained in Example 1. Formic
      acid and formate were initially added at a molar ratio of 9:1 and
      at a total concentration of 4 M. The pH of the solution was about
      2.8.<br>
      <br>
      [0133] The reaction was operated batch-wise, by closing the
      gas-outlet. Cycles 3-6 were conducted at different temperatures
      and the conversion over time was monitored. Accordingly, the
      3&lt;rd &gt;cycle was conducted at 90[deg.] C., the 4thcycle was
      conducted at 100[deg.] C., the 5thcycle was conducted at 80[deg.]
      C. and the 6thcycle at 70[deg.] C.<br>
      <br>
      [0134] Each cycle was considered terminated when conversion was
      more than 90% and no further increase in pressure was observed and
      no more change in the HCOOH/HCOONa concentration was detected by
      NMR. Then, for the next cycle, the pressure was released, new
      formic acid was added to restore the initial concentration of 4 M
      HCOOH/HCOONa and the reaction started by setting temperature.<br>
      <br>
      [0135] At all temperatures, total pressure (and accordingly,
      conversion) increased with time, the HCOOH concentration
      decreased, with the reaction performed at 100[deg.] C. being
      completed fastest, after 30-40 minutes, when a pressure of about
      120 bars was observed.<br>
      <br>
      [0136] The results of this example are shown in FIG. 2, which
      shows the influence of temperature during different cycles on
      reaction rate. It can be seen that the reaction is completed most
      rapidly at 100[deg.] C. (?), whereby at 70[deg.] C. (-), the
      reaction is slowest, but still above 90% conversion is obtained.
      The reaction rate thus directly correlates with temperature.<br>

        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0137] Influence of pH to the reaction rate and conversion
      efficiency is measured with the experimental setting of Example 2,
      which is operated batch-wise and in which the initial ratio of
      HCOOH to HCOONa is varied, while keeping the overall concentration
      of substrate at 4 M, thus varying pH. Accordingly, HCOOH:HCOONa
      mixtures of 100:0 mol %, 90:10 mol %, 70:30 mol %, 40:60 mol %,
      10:90 mol % and 0:100 mol % were prepared and added to the aqueous
      solution at 4 M.<br>
      <br>
      [0138] After each completed reaction cycle, HCOOH was added to
      obtain a total concentration of 4 M, thus restoring HCOOH that was
      used up.<br>
      <br>
      [0139] It was found that when only HCOOH or only HCOONa was used
      (100:0; 0:100), reactions were very slow.<br>
      <br>
      [0140] It was found that the presence of HCOONa positively affects
      the reaction rate in a wide concentration range, with the
      conversion efficiency becoming lower at lower concentrations of
      HCOOH.<br>
      <br>
      [0141] The optimum ratio of HCOOH:HCOONa in terms of reaction rate
      and conversion efficiency was identified to be around 9:1.<br>
      <br>
      [0142] At this ratio, the pH was in the range of 2.6-3.1<br>
      <br>

        Conversion Efficiency and Reaction Rate</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0143] Example 4.1 is conducted batch-wise with a concentration of
      22 mM [Ru(H2O6](tos)2, 44 mM TPPTS (catalyst formed in situ), 4 M
      HCOOH (10 mmol) with variable initial contents of HCOONa.<br>
      <br>
      [0144] The experiment was repeated with 0.4, 1.2, 1.6, 3.6 M
      HCOONa and conversion was monitored over time.<br>
      <br>
      [0145] After each reaction cycle, initial HCOOH concentration was
      restored to 4 M HCOOH.<br>
      <br>
      [0146] The result is shown in FIG. 3, were it can be seen that
      with lowest initial HCOONa concentration (0.4 M, -), the reaction
      advances slowest, but conversion of HCOOH to H2 and CO2 gets close
      to 100%. The reaction rate is higher at HCOONa concentrations of
      1.6 (?), 2.8 (-) and 3.6 M (O), but overall conversion decreases.
      In summary, HCOONa concentration is inversely proportional with
      conversion. It increases the reaction rate, but only up to 2.8 M
      concentration. An optimum concentration of formate salt can be
      selected according to preferences of the skilled person.<br>

      [0147] The experiment of Example 2, is modified by adding
      different initial concentrations (2.3 mM, 22 mM, 45 nM, 67 nM, 90
      mM, 112 mM and 123 mM) of [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2 and 2 equivalents of
      TPPTS.<br>
      <br>
      [0148] It was observed that increase in catalyst concentration
      accelerates the rate of the HCOOH decomposition reactions until a
      catalyst concentration of is about 90 mM reached.<br>

      <br>
      [0149] TPPTS (tris(3-sulfophenyl)phosphine trisodium salt) has
      been chosen as ligand because of its very high water solubility
      and stability. The catalysis was further tested with less soluble
      mono-sulfonated triphenyl phosphines, with the sulfonyl group in
      para and meta position (pTPPMS and mTPPMS), as a ligand for the
      [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2 complex. Two equivalents mTPPMS and pTPPMS,
      respectively were added to each Ru- equivalent.<br>
      <br>
      [0150] The experiments were conducted in the batch-wise mode in
      the sapphire NMR-tube as indicated in Example 2.<br>
      <br>
      [0151] The results are shown in FIG. 4. As can be seen, the
      reaction works with all catalysts. The rate is slightly faster
      with monosulfonated triphenylphosphines (?, -) than with the
      trisulfonated one (-), but since the former are only partially
      soluble in water, handling is less convenient. When ruthenium is
      added as RuCl3, the reactions are slower and the catalyst less
      stable over repeated cycles, specially with the monosulfonated
      triphenylphosphines (-, [Delta]).<br>

      is as fast as [Ru&lt;II&gt;(H2O)6](tos)2 with two TPPTS.<br>
      <br>
      [0153] In the cycles following the first reaction cycle, no
      difference in reaction rate or conversion was found between
      [Ru&lt;II&gt;(H2O)6](tos)2 and [Ru&lt;III&gt;(H2O)6](tos)3. The
      species observed during the reaction with Ru&lt;III &gt;are

      [0162] In general, all catalysts 5.5 a)-d) were much slower than
      Ru(H2O)6 with two TPPTS.<br>
      <br>
      [0163] With the bipyridine ligand (5.5 b)), there is decomposition
      of the catalyst, observable by the change of the red solution to
      black and also by the loss of activity during recycling.<br>
      <br>
      [0164] The arene compound (5.5 c)), initially soluble in the
      reaction mixtures, precipitates out during the reaction.<br>

        Poisoning</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">6.1 Poisoning by Mercury</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0165] Example 2 was run in the batch-wise mode with 22 mM
      [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)4](tos)2.<br>
      <br>
      [0166] After the 3&lt;rd &gt;recycling of
      [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)4](tos)2, mercury is added to the solution. The
      following recycling cycles are not affected by the presence of Hg,
      giving a strong evidence that the catalytic reaction is
      homogeneous.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">6.2 Carbon Monoxide (CO)</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0167] Example 2 was run in the batch-wise mode with 22 mM
      [Ru(TPPTS)2(H2O)4](tos)2.<br>
      <br>
      [0168] After the 16threcycling of the [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2+2 TPPTS
      solution (without loss of activity), the reactor is pressurised
      with 50 bar of CO and mixed for 15 minutes. The gas is then
      released and the reaction restarted. The first two recyclings (the
      17thand 18th) are significantly slowed down but the catalyst is
      not completely poisoned. During further recycling cycles, the CO
      is being slowly eliminated and the original activity of the
      catalyst is almost fully recovered.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">6.3 Oxygen</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0169] As mentioned in Example 2 above, oxygen is removed from all
      the solutions by bubbling N2 into the solution before the filling
      of the reactor. These precautions are taken since both
      [Ru(H2O)6](tos)2 and the phosphines can be oxidized. However,
      during the recycling cycles, non-degassed HCOOH is added without
      protection against oxygen. In case of Ru(TPPTS)2 it is not
      necessary to degas.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">6.4 Chloride</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0170] Example 2 was run in the batch-wise mode. Further to the
      two equivalents of TPPTS, two equivalents of NaCl were added. No
      effect on the rate of reaction were observed during recycling in
      presence of NaCl.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example 7</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br style="font-weight: bold;">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Pressure in Reaction Vessel</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0171] In order to verify that the reaction can still be done at a
      higher pressures, a high pressure autoclave was prepared in
      similar conditions.<br>
      <br>
      [0172] At optimum temperature, pH and with the catalyst of Example
      2, in batch mode the total gas pressures of over 750 bar were
      registered, with hydrogen gas partial pressures up to 370 bar.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">CONCLUSIONS</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      [0173] From the series of experiments conducted described herein
      above it can be concluded that the method of the invention permits
      the quick production of hydrogen gas very pure from carbon
      monoxide. The amount of hydrogen gas to be produced can be
      determined and varied at very short terms by substrate quantity,
      temperature and pH. The hydrogen generation is easily controllable
      and the catalyst is robust. The reaction can conveniently be
      conducted at batch-wise or continuous mode without catalyst loss.<br>
