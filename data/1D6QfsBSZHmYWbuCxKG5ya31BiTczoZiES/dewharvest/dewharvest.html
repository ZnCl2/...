      <b>Gabin Koto N’Gobi’s Dew Collector</b><br>
      <br>
      The lack of water in the Northern region of his home country Benin
      motivated Gabin Koto N’Gobi to design a dew collector.<br>
      <br>
      His prototype is made out of local materials which makes it
      sustainable and accessible. It harvests up to 4 liters of water
      per night...<br>

      <br>
      <b>geometrical shapes and efficiency</b><br>
      <br>
      These designs might make you wonder about the effect of different
      shapes on the efficiency of dew collecting. During summer and fall
      2009 experiments have been done (Pessac, France) to get an answer
      to this question. The results were published in “New Architectural
      Forms to Enhance Dew Collection” (Daniel Beysens, Filippo
      Broggini, Iryna Milimouk-Melnytchouk, Jalil Ouazzani, Nicolas
      Tixier)<br>
      &nbsp;<br>
      <b>a. conical</b><br>
      <br>
      <div align="center"><img alt="" src="conical.jpg" height="148"
          width="233"><br>
      </div>
      60° cone angle (30° from horizontal)<br>
      <br>
      the 30° angle has been found to give the best cooling efficiency.
      This angle also allows water to easily flow by gravity as the
      gravity forces are only reduced by 50% with respect to vertical.<br>
      <br>
      YIELDS: an average of 22% larger than the planar reference
      condenser (30% at wind speeds below 1.5 m/s to 0% above 3 m/s).
      The gains are larger for low dew yields.<br>
      <br>
      <b>b. inverted pyramid<br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b><img alt="" src="pyramid.jpg" height="144"
            width="184"></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Here the surface also has an angle of 30° from horizontal<br>
      <br>
      YIELDS: an average of 20% larger than the planar reference
      condenser. The gains are larger for low dew yields, these
      increased gains are lower though than with the conical shape.<br>
      <br>
      As these shapes are somewhat unpractical when making constructions
      to collect dew on large scale, tests were also made with hollow
      shapes that could be ’tiled’ on a bigger surface, like a roof. In
      this way the collecting surface can be increased without needing
      more horizontal space nor an unpractical increase of vertical
      space.<br>
      <br>
      <b>c. egg-box<br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b><img alt="" src="eggbox.jpg" height="213"
            width="261"></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      YIELDS: an average of 10% larger than the planar reference
      condenser.<br>
      <br>
      Note that part of the formed dew can’t be collected because of the
      areas where the angle is too low for the drops to flow off (the
      flat tops of the egg bumps)<br>
      <br>
      <b>d. origami<br>
        <br>
      </b>
      <div align="center"><b><img alt="" src="origami.jpg" height="140"
            width="168"></b><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      YIELDS: an average of 120% larger than the planar reference
      condenser, with much higher gains for low dew yields (up to 400%)<br>
      <br>
      So we can see that the geometrical shape of the collectors is of
      great influence to the amount of dew that can be collected. The
      big advantage of hollow shapes lies in the fact that influences of
      the wind are decreased, and thus the cooling is increased...<br>

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The ability to absorb water vapor from the
      atmosphere enables ticks to survive without drinking water for
      many months. The tick rehydrates using a three-stage process.
      First, it uses its foremost pair of legs to detect microregions of
      high humidity, such as those surrounding water droplets. Once a
      suitable water source is detected, the tick secretes a hydrophilic
      solution from its mouth. Once it is saturated, the tick draws the
      now hydrated secretion back into its mouth. The secretion is a
      hygroscopic salt solution. Once ejected from the mouth, the
      solution dries at low ambient humidities, leaving a crystalline
      substance behind. When the humidity increases, the hydrophilic
      crystalline substance dissolves and is swallowed back into the
      body of the tick. The adaptation allows exophilic ticks to absorb
      water vapor from close to saturation down to 43% relative
      humidity. Mites and soil-dwellings use a similar mechanism to
      absorb water vapor.-- asknature.org<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      In many regions and geographical settings, dew water collection
      can serve as a water source, supplementing rain and fog water
      collection. This is particularly useful when precipitation is low
      or lacking, especially in remote areas and islands in the dry
      season. A project called Dew Equipment for Water (DEW) was
      initiated for a 15.1 m2 roof in the island of Biševo (Croatia),
      equipped with commercial plastic cover selected for its superior
      dew collection properties. Measurements of both rain and dew water
      will be performed over several years and data will be correlated
      with meteorological data collected in situ. Preliminary
      measurements during the period 21 April–21 October 2005 showed
      that dew water contributed significantly, 26% of the total
      collected water.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Dew water is water droplets formed due to condensation of
      atmospheric water vapor on surfaces of temperature below its dew
      point temperature. Dew water can be seen as a nonconventional
      source of water and may be exploited in regions where weather
      conditions favor dew formation and inadequate supply and quality
      of water is a prevalent problem. There are two main types of dew
      condenser, the apparatus used to collect dew water, namely
      radiative (also called passive) and active condensers. Radiative
      passive collectors rely on exploiting the physical processes
      responsible for dew formation to collect dew water without any
      additional energy input. Previous studies indicate that a 1 m2
      radiative condenser yields between 0.3 and 0.6 L/day of dew water
      in arid and semi-arid regions. Active condensers have been
      designed as an alternative method of collection that produces
      higher yields by using additional energy inputs. Several designs
      of active condensers have been patented for which the yield can
      reach 20 L/day for portable devices, and up to 200,000 L/day for
      larger agricultural water devices. Active condensers are also
      known as atmospheric water generators, dehumidifiers, and air to
      water devices. Most of the active condensers are based on a
      regenerative desiccant that attracts and holds large volumes of
      water from the air or on a means of cooling the condensing surface
      below the dew point temperature (refrigeration circuit). The
      larger yields and wider range of environmental conditions in which
      dew can be collected make active condensers a promising option as
      an alternative or supplemental source of water in water scarce
      regions. The aim of this paper was to provide a comprehensive
      review of radiative and active condensers, including dew formation
      processes, methods of dew collection, and parameters that
      influence the dew collection. Subsequently, patents of active
      condensers were reviewed to ascertain how they ca n be integrated
      with different types of renewable energy and to assess the
      potential use of such integrated systems as a sustainable source
      of water in regions that suffer water scarcity and/or as a
      sustainable source of water for agriculture.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      Dew water collection can be considered as a non-conventional
      source of water which can enhance water supply in certain
      climates/regions. Hence, it can be considered as a possible
      alternative or supplementary source of water in many water scarce
      regions of the world where weather conditions favor dew formation.
      The atmospheric air can be considered as a huge renewable
      reservoir of water which can be used as a water source everywhere
      on the earth (Hamed et al. 2010). The amount of water in air is
      assessed as 14,000 km3, while the amount of fresh water in the
      earth is about 1200 km3 (Hamed et al. 2010). Despite this
      significant volume of potentially extractable fresh water in many
      places where weather conditions favor dew formation, dew water
      collection systems are rare, suggesting dew collection is an
      under-explored alternative for providing good quality water.<br>
      <br>
      Current dew water collectors are divided into two main types:
      radiative (or passive) and active dew water condensers. Research
      on radiative condensers started in the early 1960s (Gindel 1965).
      Since then, research has focused on the condenser materials,
      architecture, influence of meteorological parameters, and other
      factors that affect the volume of dew water collected using
      radiative condensers. According to the radiative energy available
      for condensation, the upper limit of dew yield is 0.8 L/day/m2
      (Monteith and Unsworth 1990). However, the maximum recorded yields
      of dew water in arid and semi-arid climates typically fall within
      a range of 0.3–0.6 L/day/m2 of surface area (Muselli et al. 2009;
      Maestre-Valero et al. 2011; Lekouch et al. 2012). Studies
      conducted in more humid climates showed lower yield; for example,
      in a perennial grassland environment in the Netherlands, the
      maximum water collected was 0.19 L/day/m2 (Jacobs et al. 2008);
      for a humid tropical island in French Polynesia, the maximum
      amount was 0.23 L/day/m2 (Clus et al. 2008); and in an
      agricultural environment near an urban area in
      Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, QC, Canada, the maximum amount was 0.37
      L/day/m2 (Khalil et al. 2015).<br>
      <br>
      Early designs for active dew condensers were developed in the
      1930s, but innovation has increased since the commercialization of
      mechanical refrigeration (Wahlgren 2000). Active condensers are
      now considered an innovative option for locally managed water
      supply systems in areas with water quality and/or quantity
      problems (Wahlgren 2000). Active condensers work in a manner
      similar to that of a dehumidifier to extract water from the air.
      Although they are more effective than the radiative condensers in
      terms of water yield per day, they require a source of energy
      which makes their operating costs much higher than those of
      radiative condensers which do not require an energy source.
      However, recent active condensers are designed to minimize the
      energy required or make use of renewable energy resources that can
      be integrated into the condenser. For example, most modern solar
      stills integrate additional solar cells to provide supplementary
      energy to the system (Bundschuh and Hoinkins 2012). Active
      condensers are also often equipped with filtration and
      purification units such as ozone treatment units. The water yield
      of active condensers varies depending on the design/purpose;
      yields fall within the range of 15–50 L/day for a small portable
      drinking water unit to up to 200,000 L/day for larger agricultural
      scale designs (Peters et al. 2013). In this paper, a comprehensive
      review for different radiative and active condensers was provided
      and their potential for agricultural uses was discussed.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Radiative systems</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Understanding the principles of dew formation is important for
      designing both effective radiative as well as active dew
      condensers that exploit these processes to collect dew. Dew
      formation is a natural occurrence where a phase transition from
      gaseous to liquid water occurs on an exposed surface (Beysens
      1995; Agam and Berliner 2006). Dew formation is affected by
      several factors such as vapor pressure, air temperature, relative
      humidity, and wind speed. The vapor pressure is defined as the
      pressure exerted by the gaseous water in equilibrium with its
      liquid phase at a given temperature (McCabe et al. 1993). If the
      pressure increases, it will reach a maximum point where, passed
      that point, there will be a net loss of molecules from the
      atmosphere (i.e., condensation). This maximum pressure reached by
      the water vapor is called the saturation vapor pressure and is the
      point where the atmosphere is completely saturated with water
      molecules. The saturated vapor pressure is a function of the air
      temperature, and their relationship can be described by the
      following equation (Alnaser and Barakat 2000):<br>
      <br>
      es=0.611exp(17.27(Ta-273)Ta-36)<br>
      (1)<br>
      <br>
      where es is the saturated vapor pressure in kPa and Ta represents
      the ambient temperature in Kelvin.<br>
      <br>
      When a constant atmospheric pressure is assumed, an increase or
      decrease in ambient temperature will also increase or decrease the
      saturated vapor pressure. If air is cooled at constant humidity to
      become saturated, the corresponding temperature at a given point
      is called the dew point temperature. If the temperature of an
      exposed surface is equal to or lower than the dew point
      temperature, condensation will occur (Agam and Berliner 2006).
      Moreover, if the exposed surface is maintained at a lower
      temperature than the air above it, according to Eq. (1), the
      saturated vapor pressure will be lower near that surface. This
      difference in vapor pressure is the gradient for mass transfer to
      take place since the water molecules in the atmosphere will go
      from high to low vapor pressure, allowing condensation to occur
      near the exposed surface without bringing the bulk of the air to
      its dew point temperature.<br>
      <br>
      The dew formation rate depends on the amount of water vapor in the
      air; this amount is related to the absolute humidity (i.e., the
      amount of gaseous molecules in the air) and the difference between
      the dew point and ambient temperature. This notion is expressed by
      the relative humidity (RH), which is defined as the amount of
      water vapor in the air at a given temperature with respect to the
      maximum amount of water vapor that the air can hold at that same
      temperature. It can also be defined as the contribution made by
      water vapor to the total atmospheric pressure over the maximum
      pressure that the water vapor can exert at the current temperature
      (Alnaser and Barakat 2000):<br>
      <br>
      RH=e(Ta)es(Ta)×100<br>
      (2)<br>
      <br>
      where RH is the relative humidity in % and e is the vapor pressure
      in kPa. Given the definition of the dew point temperature, the
      relative humidity can also be expressed as follows (Alnaser and
      Barakat 2000):<br>
      <br>
      RH=es(Td)es(Ta)×100<br>
      (3)<br>
      <br>
      where Td is the dew point temperature in Kelvin. The RH depends on
      both the difference between the dew point and the ambient
      temperature, and the humidity of the air (Alnaser and Barakat
      2000).<br>
      <br>
      Based on these principles, a radiative condenser (also called a
      passive dew condenser) rely on exploiting the physical processes
      responsible for dew formation to collect dew water without any
      additional energy input. The surface of radiative condensers has a
      high emittance in the infrared region of the spectrum that allows
      it to cool faster than other surfaces at night-time. Therefore, to
      attain the required dew point temperature and induce the
      collection of dew water, the environmental conditions have to be
      conducive to surface cooling and the exposed surface (i.e., the
      condenser) has to be optimized to enhance cooling.<br>
      <br>
      Several parameters influence radiative dew collection (Fig. 1).
      The imposed parameters describe the meteorological conditions that
      enhance or reduce the formation of dew. They are related to the
      physical principles behind the technology of the radiative
      systems. The variable parameters are the components of the
      condenser that are modified to optimize the collection of dew.<br>

      <b> </b><b><br>
      </b><b>Weather conditions</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dew water condensation occurs during the early morning (Jacobs et
      al. 1998; Kidron 2000) when the environmental conditions are
      favorable. It is important to consider the dependency of dew
      formation on weather conditions, such as sky emissivity, relative
      humidity, and wind speed, in the study of dew water condensation
      (Beysens et al. 2003, 2006; Shank 2006).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Sky emissivity</b><br>
      <br>
      Low emissivity through the sky is known to prevent water vapor
      condensing, as it does not allow radiation to escape from surfaces
      at ground level (Gläser and Ulrich 2013); therefore, higher
      emissivity is ideal for condensation to occur. Dew formation is
      more likely to occur under clear skies. For example, studies in
      continental and coastal areas showed that yield was directly
      proportional to atmospheric transparency and sky visibility to
      infrared radiation (Beysens et al. 2006; Muselli et al. 2009).<br>
      <br>
      Surfaces cool at night since there is a net flux of radiation
      energy emitted toward the sky. This radiation lies in the infrared
      region of the spectrum (?, 8–13 µm), which is the region
      associated with thermal radiation (Alnaser and Barakat 2000).
      During the night, the net radiation of a surface is emitted toward
      the sky and a fraction of the radiation is lost to space. However,
      the radiative energy can partially be absorbed by the water and
      carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and part of this absorbed energy
      is radiated back to the surface, reducing the net long wave
      radiative cooling effect (Beysens et al. 2007). Therefore, clear
      nights when there is a lot of water held in the atmosphere are
      more conducive to thermal cooling of radiative surfaces than
      cloudy nights.<br>
      <br>
      As clear nights allow greater surface cooling, they are optimum
      for dew formation, as opposed to cloudy nights (Kidron 2000).
      Muselli et al. (2009) found that dew yields decreased
      approximately linearly with the increase of mean cloud cover,
      which was used as an indicator of thermal emissivity of the sky,
      as described by the following equation:<br>
      <br>
      h=h0(10-N-)<br>
      (4)<br>
      <br>
      where N- is the mean night-time cloud cover that was equal to 0
      for clear sky and 10 for totally cloudy sky; h is the mean dew
      yield (mm/day) and h0 is the mean dew yield when the cloud cover
      was equal to zero. It is important to note that in this experiment
      the maximum yield did not correspond to N- being zero but to N-
      being approximately three. In fact, the dew yield was relatively
      low for the nights that were totally clear; for two sites situated
      in the Mediterranean basin, h0 was equal to 0.018 and 0.016 mm,
      which is relatively low when considering that the mean dew yield
      was 0.138 and 0.108 mm, respectively.<br>
      <br>
      The discrepancy between mean dew yield and yield when skies were
      clear can be explained by the fact that a clearer sky also
      corresponded to drier air (Muselli et al. 2009), showing that a
      certain level of absolute humidity is required for dew
      condensation to occur. For example, it has been found that the
      frequency at which dew events occurred in humid environments was
      20 % higher than in semi-arid Mediterranean climates, which
      resulted in a higher cumulative dew water formation during the
      summer in the humid environment (5.58 L/m2/summer) than in the
      semi-arid environment (3.5 L/m2/summer) (Clus et al. 2008). In
      addition, a study in Morocco concluded that circulation of humid
      marine air was an important factor controlling dew yield (Lekouch
      et al. 2012), again showing the importance of atmospheric water
      content for dew condensation.<br>
      <br>
      However, the absolute humidity of the atmosphere also affects the
      emissivity of the sky, with radiation being reduced when absolute
      humidity is high. For example, the high absolute humidity in
      environments such as wetland ecosystems or tropical climates
      hinders dew formation (Clus et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2013).
      Conversely, the drier Mediterranean climate allows for higher dew
      yields (Clus et al. 2008).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Relative humidity</b><br>
      <br>
      The relative humidity is highly correlated to dew water yields. In
      a study comparing two large (30 m2 in area) passive dew condensers
      in Ajaccio, France, Muselli et al. (2006) found that the limiting
      value of humidity below which dew did not form was 80.7 and 79.3 %
      for both condensers. Similarly in southwest Morocco, Lekouch et
      al. (2012) found that water mostly condensed when the relative
      humidity was between 74 and 92 %. In the same study, the authors
      defined the relationship between the relative humidity and the air
      and dew point temperature difference as (LeKouch et al. 2012):<br>
      <br>
      ln(RH)=k(Ta-Td)<br>
      (5)<br>
      <br>
      where k is a constant that varied only slightly with the air
      temperature Ta in Kelvin. This relationship was found to be
      important since nearly all the data points were below the line
      described by the equation (Clus et al. 2008; Lekouch et al. 2012):<br>
      <br>
      h=h'?T0[?T0-(Td-Ta)]<br>
      (6)<br>
      <br>
      where h' is the maximum yield for one night (L/m2/day) and ?T0 was
      the maximum difference in temperature between the surface of the
      condenser and the air (Clus et al. 2008; Lekouch et al. 2012). The
      ?T0 can be used as a measure of the performance of the dew
      condenser in a specific location; for example, ?T0 was used to
      compare the efficiency of dew collection in three locations:
      Morocco, Zadar and Komiza (Croatia). In Morocco it was found that
      the maximum temperature difference between the surface of the
      condenser and the air temperature was -5.3 °C, whereas the
      difference was slightly greater in the two locations situated in
      the Adriatic area of the Mediterranean basin; in Zadar it was -9.2
      °C, and in Komiza it was -8.0 °C (Muselli et al. 2009; Lekouch et
      al. 2012). Thus, it can be concluded that the surface of the
      condenser cooled to a greater extent in the Adriatic locations
      than in Morocco.<br>
      <br>
      The linear relationship described in Eq. (6) suggests that the
      difference between air and dew point temperature, or the relative
      humidity, can be the main parameter that limits the dew yield. In
      fact, several studies have found a linear relationship between the
      dew yield and difference between the air and dew point temperature
      and, therefore, a logarithmic relationship with the relative
      humidity (Sharan et al. 2007; Muselli et al. 2009). However,
      Muselli et al. (2009) did not find this linearity statistically
      significant. Muselli et al. (2009) concluded that the relative
      humidity alone was not enough to model dew yield, and that the
      night net radiation was another important parameter in the
      formation of dew on condensers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Wind speed</b><br>
      <br>
      Wind has both a hindering and enhancing effect on dew
      condensation. It is necessary to bring humid air, but also reduces
      radiative cooling by increasing the heat exchange between the
      warmer air and the surface of the collector (Beysens et al. 2003).
      Gandhidasan and Abualhamayel (2005) suggested that in dry
      conditions, strong winds do not favor dew condensation. In a study
      conducted in the humid tropical island of French Polynesia, dew
      yields declined rapidly for wind velocities higher than 3 m/s, and
      dew was almost absent for velocities higher than 4 m/s (Clus et
      al. 2008). Similarly, the limiting wind speed for condensation in
      the Adriatic area of the Mediterranean basin was 4.7 m/s,
      according to a study conducted in Zadar (Muselli et al. 2009).
      Therefore, protecting the condenser from direct wind can be
      beneficial for improving dew condensation. On the other hand, low
      wind speeds are necessary to bring atmospheric water vapor to the
      surface of the condenser; a study in southwest Morocco found that
      dew formed when wind was in the range of 0.15–0.7 m/s (Lekouch et
      al. 2012).<br>
      <br>
      The technology behind radiative dew water collection system is
      relatively simple as it relies on exploiting the physical
      processes of dew formation, and no additional energy input is
      necessary. However, the radiative cooling power of passive dew
      collectors is a function of the weather (ambient temperature,
      relative humidity, and cloud cover), which affects yield in
      relatively complex ways. Overall, however, the ideal weather
      conditions are usually found in arid and semi-arid climates, which
      also tend to be water scarce. By implementing this technology, it
      will be possible to produce drinkable water with no additional
      energy input and consequently with a very small footprint.
      However, due to the very particular weather conditions necessary
      for maximum condensation of dew (i.e., relative humidity ~80 %,
      and cloud cover and wind speed low but greater than zero), the
      water yield per day is typically relatively low and difficult to
      predict. This makes dew collection using radiative condensers a
      non-reliable water source, although optimizing condenser design
      can go some way to improving yields.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Design of radiative dew condensers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Given the dependence of radiative systems on the dew formation
      physical processes, their design has to be optimized to allow
      surface cooling without any external energy input. In particular,
      there are a number of factors that must be optimized to increase
      the yield. First, it is important to maximize the infrared
      wavelength emitting properties of the condensing surface to allow
      surface cooling at night. Second, absorption of the visible light
      must be reduced to prevent daytime warming of the condenser, which
      means having a higher reflectivity in the visible part of the
      spectrum (i.e., white materials). Third, the heating effect of the
      wind must be reduced by lowering its velocity, which is usually
      achieved by having a tilt angle on the condenser or a specific
      shape. Fourth, a hydrophilic surface is needed to recover most of
      the water, so it can be collected in a container, and to avoid
      evaporation of the water in the early morning. Finally, it is
      important to have a light condenser to reduce heat inertia, making
      it easier to change the temperature of the surface, and to have
      good insulation to avoid heat transfer from the ground (Beysens et
      al. 2006, 2007; Clus et al. 2009). This said, it is possible to
      divide the optimization factors of the design and location of
      radiative systems into the material, shape, and size of the
      collector, and its position.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Surface material</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Dew formation is influenced by the properties of the material used
      for the surface of the condenser. By selecting the appropriate
      material, the energy barrier at the liquid–vapor interface can be
      lowered to enhance water recovery. Alnaser and Barakat (2000)
      tested three different types of materials and the results showed
      that aluminum had the highest potential use as a dew water
      collecting surface, followed by glass and polyethylene. They came
      to the conclusion that a polished surface enhances dew collection
      by letting the water easily run along the surface. Kidron (2010)
      found that a smooth Plexiglas surface collected 0.21 L/m2/day of
      dew water, compared to a rough surface that collected 0.1
      L/m2/day.<br>
      <br>
      Another property that affects dew condensation is the mass of the
      material, which affects the ability of the condenser to lower its
      temperature, since condensers with a higher mass have higher
      thermal inertia. For this reason, insulation beneath the condenser
      is necessary to prevent heat transfer between the soil (or the
      condenser frame) and the surface sheet of the dew condenser
      (Beysens 1995; Nikolayev et al. 1996). For example, a study in
      North West India of plain, uninsulated corrugated galvanized iron
      roofs measured a maximum cooling temperature of 2 °C, while a
      condenser that was thermally insulated using a foil with a higher
      emissivity had a maximum cooling of around 3.4–3.7 °C.<br>
      <br>
      In addition to being light, having high wetting properties, and
      being thermally insulated from the ground, the condenser material
      needs to have a high emittance in the infrared region of the
      spectrum to enhance its cooling properties (Alnaser and Barakat
      2000). The standard foil recommended by the International
      Organization for Dew Utilization (OPUR) is a white hydrophilic
      foil of titanium dioxide and barium sulfate microspheres embedded
      in polyethylene. The OPUR standard foil is said to improve
      emitting properties in the near infrared region by providing
      radiative cooling at normal ambient temperatures. At the same
      time, it reflects visible light, thus increasing the time for dew
      collection in the early morning. Maestre-Valero et al. (2011)
      compared the standard white hydrophilic foil recommended by the
      OPUR (yield 17.36 L) with a low-cost black polyethylene foil (BF)
      used for mulching in horticulture (yield 20.76 L). The OPUR foil
      and BF foil had the same emissivity in the wavelength of 7–14 µm
      (e = 0.976). However, the BF had a higher emissivity in the
      wavelength of 2.5–7 µm (BF: 0.996; OPUR foil: 0.833) and 14–25 µm
      (BF: 0.998; OPUR foil: 0.990). The better performance of the BF
      showed that the increase of emissivity in the infrared spectrum
      resulted in a higher yield than an increase in the surface
      hydrophilic properties. This indicates the importance of the
      emittance of the material, with high emittance being needed not
      only in the near infrared spectrum but also in the entire
      mid-infrared spectrum (Maestre-Valero et al. 2012).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Shape</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      The shape of the dew water collector and its influence on water
      yield has been studied in terms of simple hollow structures and
      non-plane sheets. Dew collection from hollow funnel-like
      structures showed an increase in the collector efficiency compared
      to a 1 m2 standard planar collector. This standard collector is a
      polyethylene sheet embedded with microspheres of titanium dioxide
      and barium sulfate tilted at a 30° angle to the horizontal.
      Beysens et al. (2012) hypothesized that hollow forms reduced the
      heat exchange between the air and the condenser surface by
      reducing free convection; it was found that a cone half-angle of
      30° gave the best results among all the tested inclinations (25°,
      30°, 35°, 40°, and 50°). In a grassland area in the Netherlands,
      an inverted pyramid with an angle of 30° collected 20 % more water
      than a standard 1 m2 planar dew collector (Jacobs et al. 2008). <br>
      <br>
      Similarly, a simulation done under typical meteorological
      conditions (i.e., clear sky, ambient temperature of 15 °C and
      relative humidity of 85 %) showed that a funnel shaped condenser
      with a half-angle of 30° had a higher performance by 40 % compared
      to the reference plate. The funnel shape was found to reduce the
      flow of warm air and block the heavier cold air at the bottom,
      thus avoiding natural convention (Clus et al. 2009).<br>
      <br>
      Concerning non-planar collectors, three shapes of sheet with
      different relief have been tested: egg-box, origami and
      multi-ridge. The origami structure compared to the egg-box
      structure showed better performance because the egg-box structure
      hindered the flow of dew water due to its flat top (Beysens et al.
      2012). The multi-ridge condenser did not show any difference in
      performance compare to a flat reference condenser, but when the
      wind speed increased above 1.5 m/s, the multi-ridge condenser
      showed an increase in efficiency of 40 % (Clus et al. 2009).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Size</b><br>
      <br>
      The size of the condenser has been found to influence its
      performance. For example, an on-ground 900 m2 condenser showed a
      decrease in yield of 42 % compared to four 1 m2 standard
      condensers. It was suggested that the large size of the condenser
      allowed the foil to fold, which increased water stagnation, thus
      affecting the radiative cooling effect (Sharan et al. 2007).
      However, Kidron (2010) found that a decrease in size from a 0.16
      to a 0.01 m2 condenser reduced the yield from 0.25 to 0.15 L. The
      reduction in size on both axes (e.g., from 10 cm by 10 cm to 5 cm
      by 5 cm) showed a greater decrease in yield than when one axis was
      kept constant (e.g., from 20 cm by 10 cm to 10 cm by 10 cm). This
      suggests that there is a border effect that reduces the efficiency
      of the condenser surface toward the edges. This issue has not yet
      been explored in detail.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Position</b><br>
      <br>
      The position of the dew condenser, in terms of its inclination,
      shading and exposure, influences the condensation of water. First,
      it was found that an angle of 30° with respect to the horizon was
      the optimal inclination to minimize the heat exchange effect
      caused by wind, increase the water recovery by gravitational force
      and not hinder the visibility to the sky that is needed for
      radiation cooling. For example, a study in Grenoble, France, found
      that when the condenser was inclined at an angle of 30°, the yield
      of dew water increased by up to 20 % when compared to a nearby
      horizontal reference plate (Beysens et al. 2003).<br>
      <br>
      Second, studies of dew condensation showed different results for
      condensers in the sunlight and in the shade. For example, an
      experiment in Israel showed higher yields in the shaded areas
      (Kidron 2000). Furthermore, in north-west India, water
      condensation was 35 % higher for a condenser that remained longer
      in the shade than for one exposed to sunlight (Sharan et al.
      2007).<br>
      <br>
      Finally, studies showed that exposure to the sky also affected
      condensation rates by being related to radiative cooling. A site
      surrounded by high altitude topography will have the infrared
      radiation that the condenser emits reflected back by the hills or
      mountains (Beysens et al. 2007). For example, a study comparing an
      uphill site with a downhill site showed that the yield from the
      latter was 40 % lower than that of the uphill site (Kidron 2000).
      In addition, Muselli et al. (2006) showed that a condenser exposed
      from the sides had a higher yield (mean dew yield: 0.118 L/day)
      than one that was enclosed and closer to the ground (mean dew
      yield: 0.111 L/day).<br>
      <br>
      The optimization of radiative condensers allows yield to be
      increased by changing the design of the condenser from a flat
      plate to more complex shapes and materials. First, an optimal
      inclination of 30° decreases the heating effect of wind on the
      condenser (force convection) and enhances water collection by
      gravity. In addition, an inverted hollow structure such as a cone
      or pyramid reduces the negative consequences of convection even
      further, including free convection. However, producing a hollow
      structure is more complicated than producing plane condensers.
      Second, the emittance properties of the material can significantly
      enhance dew condensation. The standard OPUR sheet has been shown
      to increase the cooling of the condensing surfaces; however, since
      the sheet is specially manufactured for research purposes, the
      cost is quite elevated. Maestre-Valero et al. (2011) studied a
      low-cost polyethylene foil that is commonly used in agriculture,
      which produced better results than the OPUR sheet. This suggests
      that there is further potential to lower the price of the material
      used as a surface collector while increasing the efficiency of the
      collector. Finally, the scaling up of the condenser from the 1 m2
      standard has shown a decrease in efficiency of about 40 % (Sharan
      et al. 2007), which does not allow for the collection of high
      volumes of dew water.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Active condensers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Given the low yields of radiative condensers and the specific
      environmental conditions required for dew formation, active
      condensers may be a viable alternative. Although relative humidity
      is a significant factor in the efficiency of active condensers
      (Peters et al. 2013), active condensers are less affected by
      variation in conditions such as sky emissivity, wind speed, and
      topographic cover than radiative condensers. Thus, they can
      potentially be operational under a wider range of weather
      conditions (Peters et al. 2013).<br>
      <br>
      Active condensers can be classified into personal scale devices
      that can generate 15–50 L of water per day, or larger industrial
      scale machines, which can produce up to 200,000 L/day (Peters et
      al. 2013; Khalil et al. 2014). The yield of active condensers is
      much higher than of radiative condensers, but active condensers
      typically have a high energy demand. Despite this drawback, active
      condensers can be useful as a supplementary water source in
      circumstances where water supply from other sources is limited,
      such as an alternative source of potable water.<br>
      <br>
      Active dew condensers typically use cooling condensation or
      regenerative desiccation to bring trapped air to the dew point
      temperature, thus causing the water vapor to condense for
      collection. Early active condenser technology used simple designs
      to maintain collection surfaces at cool temperatures for a longer
      period of time than can be achieved in radiative condensers.
      Subsequent technological development focused on using regenerative
      desiccants, which are subdivided into solar regeneration, heat
      exchanger coupled, and dual air pathways, and cooling condensation
      technology, which is further divided into ground-coupled,
      portable, vehicle compatible and seawater cooling. Each of these
      design types has benefits and drawbacks, as discussed below.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Regenerative desiccant materials</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Regenerative desiccant technologies use hygroscopic materials
      (substances that can attract and hold water molecules through
      adsorption or absorption) to increase the volume of dew collected.
      Silica gel and zeolite are commonly used in active condensers. The
      capacity of hygroscopic materials to hold amounts of water greater
      than their own mass theoretically makes the active condensers more
      effective at extracting and retaining water than radiative
      condensers. Furthermore, low dew points can be achieved without
      potential freezing at moderately low operation costs. However,
      initial costs of desiccant materials are high and the desiccant
      beds must be replaced periodically. Regenerative desiccant
      condensers typically include a bed of hygroscopic material that
      can be exposed to humid air, and a stimulus source, such as solar
      power or heat exchangers, to extract the water content for
      collection in built-in or external reservoirs. It should be
      emphasized that some apparatuses (e.g., solar regeneration) depend
      on solar radiation for heating the desiccant and do not require an
      additional source of energy. These apparatuses cannot be
      considered as active condensers, but were included in this section
      as one of the types of regenerative desiccant condensers.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Solar regeneration</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Initial designs of this type consisted of a solid or liquid
      desiccant that absorbed water vapor from moist air, which was
      subsequently recovered by heating the desiccant and condensing the
      evaporated water (Hamed et al. 2010). For example, an apparatus
      that used a high surface area of wood exposed to the nighttime air
      absorbed moisture of up to 30 % of the dry wood’s weight. During
      the daytime, the wood was stored in an area with large windows and
      glass ceilings to allow the sun’s heat to evaporate the moisture
      from the wood. The air was then expelled to an area in the shade
      where the moisture condensed and was collected in a reservoir. The
      air was recirculated back to the wood to carry more moisture and
      flow back to repeat the cycle (Altenkrich 1938). Several setups
      used different desiccants, such as saw wood (Altenkrich 1938),
      silica gel (Dunkak 1949; Ackerman 1968; Hamed et al. 2011), and
      recycled newspapers (Krumsvik 1998). For instance, a glass pyramid
      shape apparatus with a multi-shelf solar system to extract water
      from humid air was explored by Kabeel (2007). Saw wood and cloth
      were examined as beds and were saturated with 30 % concentrated
      calcium chloride solution. During the night, the pyramid glass
      sides were opened to allow the desiccant to absorb moist air and
      during the day, the glass sides were closed to extract the
      moisture from the bed by solar radiation. Water evaporates and
      condenses on the top of the pyramid and is collected through a
      middle cone and through the glass inclined sides to an external
      reservoir (Fig. 2). The pyramid shape with multi-shelves doubled
      the amount of collected water compared with a solar
      desiccant/collector system with horizontal and corrugated beds.<br>
      <br>

      <br>
      Similar setups have used silica gel contained within a breather,
      which is a vented housing that allows air exchange with the
      atmosphere due to temperature and pressure differences between the
      two. The breather housing was coated with a dull, dark finish to
      allow for maximum heat absorption during the day. The heated
      silica gel inside was then activated, which allowed release of the
      water content, creating warm moist air that flowed out of the
      breather and condensed. The gel sat on a slotted bed, which was
      sufficient to allow it to collect moisture during the night-time
      (Dunkak 1949). Similar mechanisms can be found in different
      designs, such as several cone shaped thin sheets of metal stacked
      vertically with a desiccant in the middle. During the night, the
      ends of the metal sheets were raised so that the desiccant was
      exposed to the cool, moist air, and condensed during the day
      (Ackerman 1968). Recycled newspapers have also been used as
      desiccants housed in glass pyramid chambers (Krumsvik 1998).<br>
      <br>
      Collectors with regenerative desiccant materials have been
      designed for use in a wide range of environments, and have been
      optimized by altering the desiccant used and the design of the
      collector. For example, for humid tropical regions with large
      temperature differences, Groth and Hussmann (1979) described a
      device comprising a glass sun-ray collecting top layer, followed
      by a coarse, granular silica gel absorbent layer, followed by a
      layer of non-absorbent materials, such as stones, that was stacked
      3–5 m high (Fig. 3). At the bottom, fans supplied and withdrew
      air. This device could be 100–200 m in width and up to 15 m in
      length. Cool, moist nighttime air was channeled from the bottom up
      so that it passed the non-absorbent layer and cooled before
      reaching the absorbent layer, where water adsorbed to the silica.
      During the day, hot air flowed in the reverse order and reverse
      direction. The moisture desorbed from the silica gel flowed
      downwards into the stones (heat exchange layer) and condensed on
      contact with the cool surface, then flowed into a reservoir. The
      air flow in this phase could also be aided by a radiator (Groth
      and Hussmann 1979). This structure could collect 10–15 L of water
      per square meter of adsorbing surface over 24 h.<br>
      <br>

      For application on a larger scale in desert regions, Klemic (2005)
      detailed an apparatus containing a frame 1–6 m high, which held a
      net of superabsorbent polymer, preferably of a grain size of
      50–1000 microns. This polymer was capable of absorbing moisture of
      several times its own weight, which was released with the
      application of solar power. The condensate water was collected in
      a trough located directly below the net. This device can be used
      for fog clearance and odor removal in addition to water
      generation, and the frame can be built from local, widely
      available materials.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Heat exchanger coupled desiccants</b><br>
      <br>
      Regenerating desiccant beds with heat exchangers removed the time
      constraints associated with solar power and led to more control
      over the amount of energy supplied to regenerate the desiccants.
      For example, Michel and Bulang (1981) described an apparatus
      containing a sun collector, an adsorbent layer with a desiccant
      bed, and an air baffle, followed by a condenser (Fig. 4). A grated
      collection reservoir was located below the condenser, as well as
      fans below the sun collector to channel air through. Air intake
      was in the air baffle zone, which was open during the night to
      contain air inside. Upon entry, the air flow was split into two,
      with one partial air stream being channeled through the condenser
      and heat storage reservoir to cool it. The second stream is
      directed into the adsorbent layer, where its moisture was
      adsorbed. The two streams connected before exiting through the air
      outlet port. In the daytime phase, the water was desorbed and
      condensed. The air flaps were closed and mirrors concentrated sun
      rays to heat the air inside. Heating the adsorbent released
      moisture to two streams of air. One went down to the condenser
      layer and relinquished some of the moisture, which condensed as
      water droplets and was heated in the process. The warm air was
      recycled back through the adsorbent layer and continued to pick up
      more moisture. Ito et al. (1981) described similar designs with
      multiple desiccant beds.<br>

      </b><b>Dual air paths and chambers</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Newer designs with regenerative desiccants used multiple pathways
      and chambers, the purpose of which was to maximize moisture
      extraction and increase the efficiency of batch processing. Such
      designs included portable sized devices that could be coupled to
      mobile energy sources, such as automobiles. For example, Tongue’s
      (2007) desiccant wheel required a heat source such as that from a
      vehicle exhaust to provide heat to an air loop, where a heat
      exchanger heated the air within the loop. On one side of the loop
      was dry air and on the other was the humid air passage. The moist
      air in the second passage flowed to a condenser, from where the
      subsequent condensate dripped through a pipe to a reservoir, where
      it was filtered further before being dispensed (Call et al. 2009).
      An air blower channeled ambient air into a desiccant bed, the air
      from which was then released via heat from an energy conversion
      device. With the addition of heat, the high temperature, high
      humidity air was desorbed, passed over a condenser and collected
      as water droplets. The energy conversion device can be excess heat
      from a vehicle’s motor.<br>
      <br>
      Rodriguez and Khanji (2012) described another dual chambered
      device that incorporated a water treatment step. The closed
      chamber received air funneled in through fans, which was then
      heated to 75–82 °C and exposed to a desiccant that had been
      pre-absorbed with moisture from the ambient air. The hot air was
      humidified and then passed over condenser coils, which collected
      water condensate that dripped into a collection tank. The computer
      control extra heated the desiccant once per day to decontaminate
      it, and ambient air from the open air chamber was infused within
      it to supply the moisture. The collected water was exposed to UV
      light and then pumped through filters containing carbon and zinc
      or silver activated zeolite, before being collected in a final
      reservoir that rested on Peltier plates to allow the water to cool
      before dispensing. Water sensors could shut off or shift the
      output of processed water when the reservoirs were full. Ellsworth
      (2013) described a desiccant that included porous support material
      and hydroscopic absorbent dispersed within the support material.
      Materials such as PVA foam with calcium chloride as a chemical
      desiccant resulted in increased moisture adsorbing properties.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Cooling condensation systems</b><br>
      <br>
      The second common class of active condensers contain the
      components of a refrigeration system to provide a cooled surface
      for condensation to occur, such as in a reverse cycle air
      conditioner (Graham and Dybvig 1946). These devices often contain
      a compressor, condenser, and evaporator connected by conduits that
      carry a refrigerant. These, in addition to pressure valves, air
      inlets and outlets, and water reservoirs, are generally housed in
      a rectangular container. The advantages offered by this approach
      include low initial costs, and low operating and maintenance
      costs. In addition, the refrigeration mechanism allows for dew
      collection even at times when the ambient temperature is greater
      than the dew point temperature, potentially making them more
      efficient than radiative condensers. The disadvantages include
      potential icing of evaporator coils and low cost-effectiveness
      during periods of low air flow. However, these problems have been
      addressed in newer models by insulation and programmable cycling
      compressors, respectively.<br>

      Coanda and Coanda (1956) described a housing with orientable entry
      and exit points for wind, located near large water bodies, where
      warm, moist air is prevalent. Inside the housing was the first
      cooling radiator coil, which was connected via conduits to a
      second coil located beneath the soil surface that was in contact
      with cooler temperatures. A cooling liquid was driven through the
      coils by a windmill. The warm air entering the housing was cooled
      as it flowed through the coils, such that condensed water droplets
      flowed down the coils and were piped via conduits into a
      dispensing reservoir.<br>
      <br>
      Portable atmospheric water generators also use cooling liquids to
      acquire potable water from ambient air of varying temperature and
      humidity conditions, and typically generate between 20 and 50 L of
      water per day. They also contain built-in filtration systems that
      remove the need for separate water treatment, making them an asset
      to regions without such infrastructure. Air is funneled into the
      device via fans through an air filter that screens out debris.
      Inlet air passes through evaporator and condenser coils aided by a
      compressor to remove the water vapor by condensation from the air.
      Evaporators induce liquid refrigerant vaporization, allowing the
      air to cool the air and the water to condense into a reservoir for
      collection. A compressor and condenser allow the refrigerant to
      return to its liquid state. The condensate is collected on a
      collecting pan and channeled into a reservoir where UV light is
      applied to kill 99.9 % of microorganisms (Reidy 1992a, b). Once
      sufficient water has collected, it is passed through a water
      filter into a second reservoir where secondary UV light exposure
      is applied. Processing is halted if either of the UV lights
      malfunction or when filters require replacement or cleaning, as
      detected by an air pressure sensor. Sensors detect and stop water
      output once the external or internal containers are full and the
      flow of water can be shifted to secondary containers (Reidy 1992a,
      b).<br>
      <br>
      A programmable microchip set can be used to operate the generator.
      In addition to being programmed to display alerts during
      compromised operations, such as when the air filters need
      replacing, the microchip can be coupled to a thermostat and
      humidistat. These can be programmed to process air of a given
      temperature and humidity level so as to maximize the water yield
      for a given amount of energy needed to operate the generator. For
      example, at 24 °C and 50 % relative humidity, up to a 3.79 L of
      water can be produced within 12 min (Reidy 1993). Similar designs
      incorporate ionic air filters and activated charcoal water filters
      to remove volatile organic compounds, and heat strips to prevent
      freezing of water when atmospheric temperatures drop below 0 °C
      (LeBleu 1997, 1998).<br>
      <br>
      Subsequent designs allowed the collected water to be cooled or
      heated, as well as to be recirculated to prevent stagnation.
      Insulation and heating measures were also added to prevent rusting
      and icing of the condensing coils (e.g., Zakryk 2000; Lloyd and
      Baier 2002). Design modifications to prevent stagnation included a
      spinning reservoir that was cylindrical at the top and conical at
      the bottom; the vortex created by the spinning water prevented
      stagnation and accumulation of sediment. Additional forms of
      filtration included melamine deep filters and charcoal black
      filters. The water was chilled or heated and pumped to be
      dispensed from a spout located at the top (Dagan 2003). Water
      dispensing can be either gravity assisted or accomplished through
      the use of small pumps (Faqih 2004). Versatile designs can be a
      standalone indoor or outdoor unit, wall-mounted, mobile or
      attached to a vehicle (Engel and Clasby 2004; Foss 1973).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Ground-coupled heat exchangers</b><br>
      <br>
      The ground can also be used as a heat sink to naturally induce
      condensation. However, one disadvantage of this approach is that
      underground tubes are susceptible to contamination and are
      difficult to clean. Courneya (1982) described an apparatus that
      contained a cold heat exchanger buried beneath the surface of soil
      or a body of water that was at or near subsurface temperature. An
      above ground, water collecting funnel channeled air into the
      system, through the heat exchanger, out through the outlet valve,
      and into a reservoir that collected the condensate. The outlet
      valve could be regulated to increase residence time of the air
      inside the heat exchanger to allow for sufficient condensate to
      form. O’Hare (1984) described a simpler apparatus that operated by
      the same principle with solely a blackbody pipe that extended
      beneath the surface (Fig. 5). In addition, Smith (1984) described
      a housing with a turbine and evaporator conduit. The turbine was
      connected to an electrical generator that powered the
      refrigeration system. The unit was mounted on a tower such that it
      automatically rotated to point toward the wind. The cooling of the
      evaporator caused the air to sink and leave the unit at a lower
      position to where it entered, leading to denser air. A similar
      design contained a chamber located 6' below the surface, which
      contained fans that helped circulate air within several conduits.
      When air temperature is higher or lower than ground temperature, a
      gradient is established and water is trapped and condensed (Rogers
      and Midgett 1980).<br>

      <br>
      Craven’s (2008) invention generated fresh water from deep cold
      ocean water at altitudes above sea level (Fig. 6). It included a
      first stage with a siphon, collecting tank and supporting
      structure. The irrigation piping in the siphon transported the
      deep ocean water high up the insulated irrigation pipe condenser,
      which retained the coolness of the water, and allowed the air
      outside to condense onto it. The layered irrigation pipes were
      made of materials with properties that allow them to function as a
      heat exchanger.<br>

      </b><b>Cooling using dual airflows</b><br>
      <br>
      Bulang (1980) described a device that took moist nighttime air and
      divided it into two partial air flows. The first partial air flow
      passed through a water-absorbing material, such as silica gel. 75
      g of water could be absorbed for 100 g of the silica gel. The
      second partial gas flow passed through a heat accumulator where
      heat was transferred to it. The accumulator was deheated and the
      second partial gas flow was discharged. In the second stage during
      the daytime, a flow of moist gas that had been heated by a
      solar-energy collector was passed through the moisture laden water
      absorber from step 1. This gas flow absorbed the moisture from the
      absorber, creating a second warmer and more humid gas flow. This
      gas was passed over the deheated heat accumulator, where heat was
      transferred to the accumulator and moisture condensed on its
      surface. The flow of gas was discharged and the condensate was
      collected. Hussmann’s (1982a, b) similar device used four stages.
      In the first stage cool humid atmospheric air was used to cool the
      first heat condenser and moisten an adsorbent medium. In the
      second stage, warm solar heated air was used to expel moisture
      from the adsorbent and carry the moisture into the first heat
      storage condenser, where the moisture condensed and released its
      heat. In the third stage, a second stream of cool humid air was
      used to cool the second heat condenser and moisten the first
      adsorbent. In the fourth phase, a second stream of warm solar
      heated air was used to harness moisture from the adsorbent and
      condense it over the second heat storage condenser. The stream of
      air in the second phase was preheated by the second heat storage
      condenser from the fourth phase. The stream of hot air in the
      fourth phase was preheated by the first heat storage condenser, in
      addition to solar radiation, and this heat was also used to expel
      all moisture from the adsorbent.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Other methods</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Ockert (1978) proposed the ‘Tornook’ device, which was a tall
      stack with an extended base (Fig. 7). Air intake was through the
      base, which contained inlets that imparted a rotational velocity
      to the air. The resulting air had a reduced pressure and the
      density difference aided in continuing the flow. This also led to
      rapid moisture loss from the air, which was precipitated due to
      the centrifugal force in the vortex. The remaining air was heated
      to be released from the top of the stack, and the resulting
      pressure differential allowed for new air to enter from the base.
      High humidity resulted in a stronger vortex.<br>

      Peltier systems, which consist of a unit that transfers heat from
      one side to the other powered by electricity, have been used to
      provide water directly to plants for irrigation. Biancardi (1982)
      described a Peltier system that contained a housing, a
      condensation member and a pair of electrical probes. The probes
      were stuck in the soil such that the condensation member resided
      above the soil. In addition, a thermocouple such as a Peltier
      crystal, which contains a hot and cold side when electricity is
      conducted, was included. The hot side contained a heat sink and
      the cold side contained a conductor that removed heat from the
      conduction member, making it cooler. The cooled conduction member
      allowed condensation of moisture from the atmosphere; this
      condensation was then channeled into a small collection reservoir
      and subsequently into the soil (Muñoz-García et al. 2013). The
      electricity source for the system could be a battery or an AC
      current source. Similarly, Tircot’s (1985) apparatus utilized the
      Peltier effect and had a hot end that was in contact with a heat
      dissipater and a cold end in contact with a thermally insulated
      condenser powered by an AC current (Fig. 8). Air entered the
      chamber and induced the condensation of water into droplets that
      were collected in an external reservoir. A fan and thermometer can
      also be used to force air and detect temperatures inside the
      chamber to ensure adequate processing.<br>

      </b><b>Large-scale designs</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Faqih (2005) offered several prototypes for collecting water for
      human, animal and irrigation purposes using flat, vertical or
      conical condensation surfaces. Evaporator coils were installed
      behind the condenser surfaces, where humid air lost moisture on
      contact with the surface; the condensation collected on these
      surfaces dripped down into a collection pan. The water could then
      be filtered and appropriated for use. These devices used
      thermo-acoustic engines, which use high intensity sound waves to
      generate superhot gas molecules that transfer their energy to
      coils and then expand and cool, rather than standard refrigeration
      systems.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Implications for optimization and use of active condensers</b><br>
      <br>
      Regions where low technology systems are more appropriate tend to
      use passive radiative condensers or solar-energy based
      regenerative desiccant condensers. However, active condensers may
      prove useful in regions and situations where conventional sources
      of water are not available and a higher yield is required, such as
      for providing potable water for isolated communities in arid
      regions or insular areas. The usefulness of active condensers
      depends on their design and intended application. For instance,
      active condensers using cooling condensation technology generally
      provide the benefit of being more portable than regenerative
      desiccation systems. Traditionally, desiccants allowed for
      function of condensers at lower dew point temperatures because
      there was no concern that the condenser coils would freeze.
      However, insulation and programmable chipsets have allowed for the
      design of condensers that can remain functional at lower
      temperatures as well as perform within certain temperature ranges,
      so as to be more efficient depending on the local climate. The
      trend in regenerative desiccants has been to couple them with heat
      exchangers to improve their regeneration capabilities and enhance
      the yield.<br>
      <br>
      Milani et al. (2011) estimated that 95 % of the water costs of
      such technology can be attributed to energy consumption rather
      than the capital costs of the active condenser technology.
      However, this is difficult to quantify, as energy consumption
      varies with the design of the condenser. For example, a life-cycle
      assessment of active condensers in comparison to refrigerators has
      shown that active condensers powered by conventional,
      non-renewable energy sources consume more electricity for
      operation than refrigerators. In addition, active condensers
      powered by conventional sources of energy require 4–8 L of virtual
      water to produce one liter of potable water, excluding condensed
      vapor, based on the source of power (99 % of this water is a
      consequence of coal washing and power station cooling operations
      used to provide electrical power) (Peters et al. 2013). The high
      energy consumption also raises environmental concerns related to
      emission of greenhouse gases. For example, active condensers
      produce nearly three orders of magnitude more greenhouse gases
      than seawater desalination plants (Peters et al. 2013). It should
      be emphasized that these analyses were based on active condensers
      that were powered by conventional electricity sources.<br>
      <br>
      Given that 99 % of the water use and greenhouse gas emissions of
      active condensers are associated with the power supply, the
      obvious way to improve these generators is to utilize renewable
      sources of energy, such as wind or solar. With such a power
      supply, the active condensers would significantly outperform sea
      water desalination plants on greenhouse emissions. Overall, it is
      likely to be environmentally safer and more cost-effective to
      utilize active condensers powered by renewable energy sources.
      Although including a solar power unit to provide the power
      required for active condensers will increase the capital cost, the
      operation costs as well as the cost per liter will be reduced
      significantly.<br>
      <br>
      Khalil et al. (2014) suggested an independent dew water irrigation
      system (IDWIS), which consists of four main components: a solar
      power unit, active condenser(s), water reservoir, and a drip
      irrigation system. The design of the IDWIS consists of four steps.
      First, the irrigation demand is computed based on the area
      cultivated and the crop type. Second, the reservoir is designed to
      store the amount of water required for the maximum irrigation
      event. Third, the number of condensers is identified based on the
      amount of water required for the maximum irrigation event and the
      productivity of a single condenser. Fourth, the solar power unit
      is designed based on the energy required for the number of
      condensers identified in the third step.<br>
      <br>
      Other designs utilize seawater to enhance cooling and to reduce
      the energy demands of cooling condensation condensers. The
      seawater greenhouse prototype may be a useful tool to better
      understand the enhanced cooling by means of seawater (Wahlgren
      2000). This prototype uses cool seawater that is pumped into a
      greenhouse and channeled between a condenser and evaporators to
      enhance the cool and humid conditions in the greenhouse that are
      required for plant growth, as well as to produce fresh water
      condensate. There are certain constraints to this technology,
      including that the location must be coastal, capital costs are
      high, and water is relatively expensive at the rate of
      $0.005–0.012/L (Wahlgren 2000). However, these costs can be
      attenuated by selling the products grown inside the greenhouse for
      a profit.<br>
      <br>
      Overall, although water production from active condensers remains
      relatively costly at present, active condensers are still
      beneficial in appropriate situations and there are several
      promising developments in their design that overcome key
      shortcomings of earlier models. However, while technological
      development has been extensive, little research has been conducted
      into design optimization for particular conditions to maximize
      yield. The reliability of coupled renewable energy sources and
      other alternative cooling mechanisms has also not been evaluated.
      These issues must be explored further for active dew condensers to
      be a reliable source of water in regions where supply and quality
      of water from other conventional sources are poor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion</b><br>
      <br>
      Dew forms on surfaces when the surface temperature is lower than
      the dew point temperature. For water condensation to occur; there
      are several environmental conditions that must be met. A high
      relative humidity, high sky visibility to infrared radiation, and
      low wind speed are required, which therefore means that the
      volumes of dew formed are highly variable. Radiative dew
      condensers rely solely on the physical processes that induce dew
      formation naturally. To maximize water condensation without any
      external source of energy, radiative condensers can be optimized
      in terms of their shape, size, material (hydrophilic properties,
      mass, infrared emittance), and position (inclination, shading, sky
      exposure, and orientation). Such condensers are an interesting
      source of alternative water because they do not require any
      additional energy input, and the highest yields collected—up to
      0.6 mm/day/m2—are predominantly in regions of water scarcity (arid
      and semi-arid regions). Despite optimization, radiative condensers
      are still highly dependent on the weather conditions, making this
      a relatively unreliable source of water. In addition, yields will
      remain low, since the scaling up the condenser size from 1 m2 has
      been found to decrease efficiency.<br>
      <br>
      Compared to radiative condensers, active condensers are more
      efficient, with daily yields proven to be considerably higher
      (e.g., 15–50 L/day for a small portable drinking water unit).
      Active condenser technology takes two main forms: regenerative
      desiccant materials and cooling condensation systems. The first of
      the two uses hygroscopic substances that can attract and hold
      water molecules, from which water is subsequently extracted using
      a specific stimulus such as solar regeneration, heat exchange, or
      air paths and chambers. With this type of system, higher volumes
      of water can be extracted from the air than can be extracted using
      radiative condensers. Cooling condensation systems contain the
      components of a refrigeration system to provide a cooled surface
      for condensation to occur. Similar to radiative condensers, they
      are optimized to lower the temperature of a specific surface to
      below the dew point temperature. However, the cooling condensation
      systems are able to create a larger temperature difference between
      the air temperature and the surface temperature than radiative
      condensers.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, active condensers hold promise as an alternative or
      supplemental source of water in regions where conventional water
      supplies are limited or unavailable, due to the higher yields
      produced than those of radiative condensers. Nevertheless, they
      are more expensive and tend to have high energy demands. Several
      recent innovations offer solutions for reducing the energy
      requirements, such as coupling condensers with ground heat
      exchangers or vehicles, and using seawater for cooling. In
      addition, the majority of activity in relation to active
      condensers has been in technological innovation, with research
      into their efficiency being relatively limited compared to
      radiative condensers. If active condensers are to achieve their
      potential, research is needed to evaluate the existing
      technologies in terms of yield under different conditions, to
      optimize their design and reduce their energy requirements.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Atmospheric water vapour processing (AWVP) technology is reviewed.
      These processors are machines which extract water molecules from
      the atmosphere, ultimately causing a phase change from vapour to
      liquid. Three classes of machines have been proposed. The machines
      either cool a surface below the dewpoint of the ambient air,
      concentrate water vapour through use of solid or liquid
      desiccants, or induce and control convection in a tower structure.
      Patented devices vary in scale and potable water output from small
      units suitable for one person’s daily needs to structures as large
      as multi-story office buildings capable of supplying drinking
      water to an urban neighbourhood.<br>
      <br>
      Energy and mass cascades (flowcharts) are presented for the three
      types of water vapour processors. The flowcharts assist in
      classifying designs and discussing their strengths and
      limitations. Practicality and appropriateness of the various
      designs for contributing to water supplies are considered along
      with water cost estimates. Prototypes that have been tested
      successfully are highlighted.<br>
      <br>
      Absolute humidity (meteorological normals) ranges from 4.0 g of
      water vapour per cubic metre of surface air in the atmosphere (Las
      Vegas, Nevada, USA) to 21.2 g m-3 (Djibouti, Republic of
      Djibouti). Antofagasta, Chile has a normal absolute humidity of
      10.9 g m-3. A 40% efficient machine in the vicinity of Antofagasta
      requires an airflow of 10 m3 s-1 to produce 3767 l of water per
      day. At a consumption of 50 l per person per day, 75 people could
      have basic water requirements for drinking, sanitation, bathing,
      and cooking met by a decentralized and simplified water supply
      infrastructure with attendant economic and societal benefits.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The recovery of clean water from dew has remained a longstanding
      challenge in many places all around the world. It is currently
      believed that the ancient Greeks succeeded in recovering
      atmospheric water vapour on a scale large enough to supply water
      to the city of Theodosia (presently Feodosia, Crimea, Ukraine).
      Several attempts were made in the early 20th century to build
      artificial dew-catching constructions which were subsequently
      abandoned because of their low yield. The idea of dew collection
      is revised in the fight of recent investigations of the basic
      physical phenomena involved in the formation of dew. A model for
      calculating condensation rates on real dew condensers is proposed.
      Some suggestions for the ‘ideal’ condenser are formulated.<br>

      </b><br>
      Passive dew harvesting and rainwater collection requires a very
      small financial investment but can exploit a free, clean (outside
      urban/industrial zones) and inexhaustible source of water. This
      study investigates the relative contributions of dew and rain
      water in the Mediterranean Dalmatian coast and islands of Croatia,
      with emphasis on the dry summer season. In addition, we evaluate
      the utility of transforming abandoned roof rain collectors
      (“impluviums”) to collect dew water too. Two sites were chosen, an
      exposed open site on the coast favourable to dew formation (Zadar)
      and a less favourable site in a cirque of mountains in Komiža (Vis
      Island). Between July 1, 2003 and October 31, 2006, dew was
      collected two or three times per day on a 1 m2 inclined (30°) test
      dew condenser, together with standard meteorological data (air
      temperature and relative humidity, cloud cover, windspeed and
      direction). Maximum yields were 0.41 mm in Zadar and 0.6 mm in
      Komiža. The mean yearly cumulative dew yields were found to be 20
      mm (Zadar) and 9.3 mm (Komiža). Because of its physical setting,
      Komiža represents a poor location for dew collection. However,
      during the dry season (May to October), monthly cumulative dew
      water yield can represent up to 38% of water collected by
      rainfall. In both July 2003 and 2006, dew water represented about
      120% of the monthly cumulative rain water. Refurbishing the
      abandoned impluviums to permit dew collection could then provide
      useful supplementary water, especially during the dry season. As
      an example, the 1300 m2 impluvium at Podšpilje near Komiža could
      provide, in addition to rain water, 14,000 L dew water per year<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      In order to improve the yield of dew condensation from atmospheric
      vapor, two large (30 m2 in area) insulated plane radiative
      condensers, inclined at 30°, were installed in Ajaccio (Corsica
      island, France; latitude 41°55'N, longitude 8°48'E). Prototype P1
      was elevated such that the underside was open and exposed.
      Prototype P2, however, was enclosed on all sides and closer to the
      ground. Both used a special radiative foil that enhances dew
      formation. The period of observation for P1 was July 22,
      2000–November 11, 2001, and for P2 was December 10, 2001–December
      10, 2003. All data were compared with respect to the same
      horizontal calibration plate of polymethylmethacrylate (Plexiglas)
      placed at 1 m above the ground on a sensitive recording balance.
      Water yield of both prototypes were compared and correlated
      against meteorological data (cloud cover, relative humidity, wind
      speed, condenser temperature and air temperature). Both prototypes
      exhibit improved performances when compared with the calibration
      plate: more dew days (+16% and +15% for P1 and P2, respectively);
      decrease of the humidity threshold (-3% and -4.4% for P1 and P2);
      increase of dew yields for wind speeds up to 3 m s-1. A model of
      the mass and thermal exchanges with the ambient air was used. Two
      adjustable parameters (heat and mass transfer coefficients) are
      used in the model. The values of these parameters were found
      larger than the values obtained in continental sites where dew
      forms with weak wind, thus emphasizing the peculiarities of dew
      formation in windy islands. When data are reduced with the
      calibration PMMA data, prototype P1 provided average water yields
      slightly larger than the enclosed prototype P2, a result that can
      be attributed to the influence of surface thermal radiation.<br>

      location, especially in dry-climate areas. One possibility is to
      obtain the required water from air moisture. This can be achieved
      by reducing the temperature of a surface below the air dew point
      temperature, inducing water vapor condensation on the surface. The
      temperature of a surface can be reduced by applying the
      thermoelectric effect, with Peltier modules powered by
      electricity. Here, we present a system that generates electricity
      with a solar photovoltaic module, stores it in a battery, and
      finally, uses the electricity at the moment in which air humidity
      and temperature are optimal to maximize water condensation while
      minimizing energy consumption. Also, a method to reduce the
      evaporation of the condensed water is proposed. The objective of
      the system is to sustain young plants in drier periods, rather
      than exclusively irrigating young plants to boost their growth.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Highlights</b><br>
      <br>
      Water can be obtained from the moisture of the air using Peltier
      modules... The water obtained by electronic devices can be enough
      to save young trees... A computer based controller can optimize
      the energy consumption of a water condenser... A photovoltaic
      power source supplies more energy when the necessity is higher.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The feasibility of using thermoelectric coolers (TECs) in a
      dehumidification system to condense atmospheric moisture and
      generate renewable freshwater was investigated. An algorithm was
      developed to correlate psychrometric variables at the entrance and
      exit of the TEC dehumidification system, determining the amount of
      condensable water, required energy and total cost per kL of
      generated water. The driving force of condensation is set to be
      dynamic to imitate wet-bulb variation at a pre-determined margin.
      The influence of relative humidity variation on saturation
      temperature, energy consumption, water productivity and the price
      of generated water in maximal thermal conditions was also
      determined. It found that more than 95% of the water cost was
      attributed to energy consumption rather than capital cost of the
      dehumidification system. The price of generated water is estimated
      to start from $82 per kL and can be integrated and programmed to
      top-up rainwater harvesting tanks (RHTs) productivity to entirely
      secure end-users freshwater demands. The main attractions of this
      approach include compact, safe and noiseless technology that can
      provide independent and clean water supply to end-users and
      alleviate the stress on freshwater resources and their aquatic
      ecosystems.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      This paper presents an energy balance modelling approach to
      predict the nightly water yield and the surface temperature (Tf)
      of two passive radiative dew condensers (RDCs) tilted 30° from
      horizontal. One was fitted with a white hydrophilic polyethylene
      foil recommended for dew harvest and the other with a black
      polyethylene foil widely used in horticulture. The model was
      validated in south-eastern Spain by comparing the simulation
      outputs with field measurements of Tf and dew yield. The results
      indicate that the model is robust and accurate in reproducing the
      behaviour of the two RDCs, especially in what refers to Tf, whose
      estimates were very close to the observations. The results were
      somewhat less precise for dew yield, with a larger scatter around
      the 1:1 relationship. A sensitivity analysis showed that the
      simulated dew yield was highly sensitive to changes in relative
      humidity and downward longwave radiation. The proposed approach
      provides a useful tool to water managers for quantifying the
      amount of dew that could be harvested as a valuable water resource
      in arid, semiarid and water stressed regions.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Highlights</b><br>
      <br>
      Surface temperature and dew yield of RDCs are estimated from the
      energy balance... Surface emissivity and emitted radiance are two
      key parameters when modelling dew... The applied filter was an
      appropriate strategy for a good performance of the model... Dew
      yield is very sensitivity to the meteorological input
      variables/parameters... Our energy balance model explained about
      70% of the total variance of dew.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      This paper analyses the dew collection performance of two
      polyethylene (PE) foils in a semi-arid region (Southern Spain).
      The dew collecting devices consisted of two commercial passive
      radiative dew condensers (RDCs) of 1 m2 tilted to 30°. They were
      fitted with two different high-emissivity PE foils: a white
      hydrophilic foil (WSF) recommended as standard for dew recovery
      comparisons by the International Organization for Dew Utilization
      (OPUR), and a low-cost black PE foil (BF) widely used for mulching
      in horticulture. Dew yield, foil surface temperature and
      meteorological variables (air temperature, relative humidity,
      downward long wave radiation and wind speed) were recorded hourly
      during a 1-year period from May-2009 to May-2010. The spectral
      emissivity of the foils was determined in laboratory in the range
      2.5–25 µm and the radiance-weighed values were calculated over
      different intervals, indicating that BF emitted more than WSF,
      especially in the range 2.5–7 µm. Dew yield was well correlated
      with the air relative humidity and foil net radiation in both
      foils and was hardly detected when the relative humidity was lower
      than 75% or the wind speed higher than 1.5 m s-1. WSF was more
      sensitive to dew formation due to its hydrophilic properties,
      registering more dewy nights (175) than BF (163) while the annual
      cumulative dew yield for BF was higher (20.76 mm) than for WSF
      (17.36 mm) due to the higher emissivity and emitted radiance of
      BF. These results suggested that increasing the surface emissivity
      over the whole IR spectrum could be more effective for improving
      RDC yield performances than increasing the surface hydrophilic
      properties. On a practical point of view, BF could be considered
      as a suitable material for large scale RDCs, as in our study it
      presented several advantages over the reference material, such as
      higher dew collection performance, longer lifespan and much lower
      cost.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Highlights</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      We compare the performance of two polyethylene foil materials for
      dew harvesting... Dew was well correlated with the air relative
      humidity and foil net radiation... Black foil (BF) was more
      productive...Surface emissivity and hydrophylic properties are two
      key parameters... Our empirical relationship explained about
      two-thirds of the total variance of dew.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><br>
      <br>
      Two coastal sites were investigated in an arid region of southwest
      Morocco to determine the amount of dew, fog and rain that could be
      collected from rooftops for household use. Systematic measurements
      were performed in Mirleft (43 m asl, 200 m from the coast) for 1
      year (May 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008) and in Id Ouasskssou (240 m
      asl, 8 km from the coast) for three summer months (July 1, 2007 to
      September 30, 2007). Dew water was collected using standard
      passive dew condensers and fog water by utilizing planar fog
      collectors. The wind flow was simulated on the rooftop to
      establish the location of the fog collector. At both sites, dew
      yields and, to a lesser extent, fog water yields, were found to be
      significant in comparison to rain events. Mirleft had 178 dew
      events (48.6% of the year, 18 ± 2 L m-2 cumulated amount) and 20
      fog episodes (5.5% of the year, 1.4 L m-2 with uncertainty
      -0.2/+0.4 L m-2 cumulated amount), corresponding to almost 40% of
      the yearly rain contribution (31 rain events, 8.5% of the year, 49
      ± 7 mm cumulated amount). At Id Ouasskssou there were 50 dew
      events (7.1 ± 0.3 L m-2, 54.3% frequency), 16 fog events (6.5 L
      m-2 with uncertainty -0.1/+1.8 L m-2, 17.4% frequency) and six
      rain events (16 ± 2 mm, 6.5% frequency).<br>
      <br>
      Meteorological data (air and dew point temperature and/or relative
      humidity, wind speed and wind direction, cloud cover) were
      recorded continuously at Mirleft to assess the influence of local
      meteorological conditions on dew and fog formation. Using the set
      of collected data, a new model for dew yield prediction based on
      artificial neural networks was developed and tested for the
      Mirleft site. This model was then extrapolated to 15 major cities
      in Morocco to assess their potential for dew water collection. It
      was found that the location of the cities with respect to the
      Atlas mountain chain, which controls the circulation of the humid
      marine air, is the main factor that influences dew production.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The capability of the glass pyramid shape with a multi-shelf solar
      system to extract water from humid air is explored. Two pyramids
      were used with different types of beds on the shelves. The beds
      are saturated with 30% concentrated Calcium Chloride solution. The
      pyramid sides were opened at night to allow the bed saturated with
      moist air and closed during the day to extract the moisture from
      the bed by solar radiation. The bed in the first pyramid was made
      of saw wood while it is made of only cloth in the second pyramid
      with the same dimensions. The system was experimentally
      investigated at different climatic conditions to study the effect
      of pyramid shape on the absorption and regeneration processes.
      Preliminary results have shown that the cloths bed absorbs more
      solution (9 kg) as compared to the saw wood bed (8 kg). Adopting
      this approach produces 2.5 L/day m2. The use of the pyramid shape
      with four glass surfaces and multi-shelves enhances the produced
      water by 90–95% compared with solar desiccant/collector system
      with horizontal and corrugated beds. Results also show that the
      clothes bed has higher productivity than that of saw wood bed by
      about 5%. This is due mainly to the greater carrying solution at
      the onset of the experimental work. The obtained results may help
      in designing more efficient system.<br>

      Passive dew collection experiments were initiated in late 2003 in
      the centre of The Netherlands within a grassland area. A specially
      designed 1 m2 insulated planar dew collector, set at a 30° angle
      from horizontal, was covered with a thin (0.39 mm) polyethylene
      foil and subsequently replaced with 4 mm polyvinyl chloride. A
      second dew collector, in the shape of an inverted pyramid, was
      constructed to reduce the view angle to only the nighttime sky. A
      simple surface energy-budget model and an aerodynamic model were
      used to simulate the dew collected by both collectors. The planar
      collector collected about 90% of the dew at the grass cover while
      the pyramid collector collected about 1.20% of the grass cover.
      The aerodynamic model was able to predict the amount of collector
      data to within 50% for the planar collector and 60% for the
      inverted pyramid collector. The pyramid collector design was able
      to collect about 20% more dew than the inclined planar collector.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      In the present work, an investigation on the application of solar
      energy to heat a sandy bed impregnated with calcium chloride for
      recovery of water from atmospheric air is presented. The study
      also aimed at evaluating the effects of different parameters on
      the productivity of the system during regeneration. These
      parameters include system design characteristics and the climatic
      conditions. An experimental unit has been designed and installed
      for this purpose in climatic conditions of Ta if area, Saudi
      Arabia. The experimental unit which has a surface area of 0.5 m2,
      comprises a solar/desiccant collector unit containing sandy bed
      impregnated with calcium chloride. The sandy layer impregnated
      with desiccant is subjected to ambient atmosphere to absorb water
      vapor in the night. During the sunshine period, the layer is
      covered with glass layer where desiccant is regenerated and water
      vapor is condensed on the glass surface. Ambient temperature, bed
      temperature and temperature of glass surface are recorded. Also,
      the productivity of the system has been evaluated. Desiccant
      concentration at start of regeneration is selected on the basis of
      the climatic data of Al-Hada region, which is located at Taif
      area, Saudi Arabia. Experimental measurements show that about 1.0
      liter per m2 of pure water can be regenerated from the desiccant
      bed at the climatic conditions of Taif. Liquid desiccant with
      initial concentration of 30% can be regenerated to a final
      concentration of about 44%. Desiccant concentration at start of
      regeneration is selected on the basis of the climatic data of
      Al-Hada region. The climate of Taif city is dry compared with that
      for Al-Hada region. This method for extracting water from
      atmospheric air is more suitable for Al-Hada region especially
      in&nbsp; the fall and winter. <br>

      <b>1. Introduction &nbsp;</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Shortage of drinking water is chronic, severe, and widespread in
      the regions of Northern Africa, Middle East, and Central and
      Southern Asia. The problem of providing arid areas with fresh
      water can be solved by the following methods [1]:&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      transportation of water from other locations; <br>
      <br>
      desalination of saline water (ground and under- <br>
      ground); <br>
      <br>
      extraction of water from atmospheric air. <br>
      <br>
      Transportation of water through these regions is usually very
      expensive, and desalination depends on the presence of saline
      water resources, which are usually rare in arid regions.
      Atmospheric air is a huge and renewable&nbsp; reservoir of water.
      This endless source of water is available everywhere on the earth
      surface. The amount of water in atmospheric air is evaluated as
      14000 km3, whereas the amount of fresh water in rivers and lakes
      on the earth surface is only about 1200 km3 [2]. The extraction of
      water from atmospheric air has several advantages compared with
      the other methods. The extraction of water from atmospheric air
      can be accomplished by different methods, the most common of these
      methods are cooling moist air to a temperature lower than the air
      dew point, and absorbing water vapor from moist air using a solid
      or a liquid desiccant, with subsequent recovery of the extracted
      water by heating the desiccant and condensing the evaporated
      water....&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

      </b><br>
      Radiation-cooled dew water condensers can serve as a complementary
      potable water source. In order to enhance passive dew collection
      water yield, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software,
      PHOENICS, was used to simulate several innovative condenser
      structures. The sky radiation is calculated for each of the
      geometries. Several types of condensers under typical
      meteorological conditions were investigated using their average
      radiating surface temperature. The simulations were compared with
      dew yield measurements from a 1 m2 30°-inclined planar condenser
      used as a reference. A robust correlation between the condenser
      cooling ability and the corresponding dew yield was found. The
      following four shapes were studied: (1) a 7.3 m2 funnel shape,
      whose best performance is for a cone half-angle of 60°. Compared
      to the reference condenser, the cooling efficiency improved by
      40%, (2) 0.16 m2 flat planar condenser (another dew standard),
      giving a 35% lower efficiency than the 30° 1 m2 inclined reference
      condenser, (3) a 30 m2 30°-inclined planar condenser (representing
      one side of a dew condensing roof), whose yield is the same as the
      reference collector, and (4) a 255 m2 multi-ridge condenser at the
      ground surface provided results similar to the reference collector
      at wind speeds below 1.5 m s- 1 but about 40% higher yields at
      wind speeds above 1.5 m s- 1.<br>

      </b><b>Summary</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An assessment of the potential for dew water to serve as a potable
      water source during a rainless season in a humid tropical climate
      was carried out in the Pacific islands of French Polynesia. The
      climate of these islands, in terms of diurnal and seasonal
      variations, wind and energy balance, is representative of the
      climate of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Measurements
      were obtained at two characteristic sites of this region; a
      mountainous island (Punaauia, Tahiti Island) and an atoll
      (Tikehau, Tuamotu Archipelago). Dew was measured daily on a 30°
      tilted, 1 m2 plane collector equipped with a thermally insulated
      radiative foil. In addition, an electronic balance placed at 1 m
      above the ground with a horizontal 0.16 m2 condensing plate made
      of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (Teflon) was used in Tahiti. Dew volume
      data, taken during the dry season from 16/5/2005 to 14/10/2005,
      were correlated with air temperature and relative humidity, wind
      speed, cloud cover and visible plus infrared radiometer
      measurements. The data were also fitted to a model.<br>
      <br>
      Dew formation in such a tropical climate is characterized by high
      absolute humidity, weak nocturnal temperature drop and strong
      Trade winds. These winds prevent dew from forming unless protected
      e.g. by natural vegetal windbreaks. In protected areas, dew can
      then form with winds as large as 7 m/s. Such strong winds also
      hamper at night the formation near the ground of a calm and cold
      air layer with high relative humidity. As the cooling power is
      lower than in the Mediterranean islands because of the high
      absolute humidity of the atmosphere, both effects combine to
      generate modest dew yields. However, dew events are frequent and
      provide accumulated amounts of water attractive for dew water
      harvesting. Slight modifications of existing rain collection
      devices on roofs can enhance dew formation and collection. Dew
      harvesting thus appears as an attractive possibility to provide
      the local population with a complementary – but on occasion,
      essential – water resource.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      In many regions and geographical settings, dew water collection
      can serve as a water source, supplementing rain and fog water
      collection. This is particularly useful when precipitation is low
      or lacking, especially in remote areas and islands in the dry
      season. A project called Dew Equipment for Water (DEW) was
      initiated for a 15.1 m2 roof in the island of Biševo (Croatia),
      equipped with commercial plastic cover selected for its superior
      dew collection properties. Measurements of both rain and dew water
      will be performed over several years and data will be correlated
      with meteorological data collected in situ. Preliminary
      measurements during the period 21 April–21 October 2005 showed
      that dew water contributed significantly, 26% of the total
      collected water.<br>

      We report on a 1-year investigation (15 January 2002–14 January
      2003) in Bordeaux, France, comparing the quality of dew water with
      respect to rain water. The following physico-chemical and
      bacteriological properties of dew and rain water were measured:
      pH, electric conductivity, cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg++, Zn++,
      Cu++), anions (Cl-, SO42-, NO3-, NO2-), hardness (TH, calcical,
      magnesial, permanent), complete alkalimetric title, dry residue
      and number of colony-forming unities (CFU) at 22 and 36 °C. The
      CO32-, HCO3-, HPO42- concentrations were found negligible. The
      ionic concentrations are in general lower in dew than in rain with
      NO2- as a noticeable exception. The mean rain pH (5.4) is lower
      than dew pH (6.3). The major ions are from the nearby Atlantic
      Ocean (within 50 km). Average ion concentrations are found below
      the World Health Organization (WHO) limit requirements for potable
      water; dew composition is close to low mineralized commercial
      spring waters for the analyzed ions. The biological analyses are
      concerned with CFU at 22 and 36 °C. Dew is seen to exceed on
      various occasions the WHO limits.<br>

      <b>Abstract</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      An inexpensive radiative condenser for collecting atmospheric
      vapor (dew) was tested in Grenoble (France). The surface
      temperature measurements are correlated with meteorological data
      (wind velocity, air temperature) and compared to the corresponding
      surface temperature of a horizontal Polymethylmethacrylate
      (Plexiglas) reference plate located nearby. The condenser surface
      is a rectangular foil (1×0.3 m2) made of TiO2 and BaSO4
      microspheres embedded in polyethylene. The foil has an angle ?
      with respect to horizontal. The under-side of the device,
      thermally isolated, faces the direction of the dominant nocturnal
      wind. Both a 2D numerical simulation of the air circulation around
      the foil and experimental measurements shows that the angle ?=30°
      is a good compromise between weak wind influence, large
      light-emission solid angle and easy drop collection. The study was
      conducted from November 25, 1999 to January 23, 2001. In
      comparison to the reference plate, it is found that water yield
      can be increased by up to 20% and water collection greatly
      facilitated.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      The problem of obtaining clean drinking water is very widespread
      among developing nations. The atmosphere contains an abundant
      amount of water in the form of vapor; however it can be difficult
      and costly to harvest. Atmospheric water vapor processing (AWVP)
      is a new field of research that is developing ways to obtain that
      vapor. One such method is known as radiative cooling. A surface
      radiates heat away until it drops below the dew point, causing
      moisture to condense on the surface. This is a process that occurs
      naturally, producing dew. The proposal is to harvest the dew that
      naturally forms on rooftops as a source of potable water. Rooftops
      made out of galvanized iron, plastic, or glass, in regions that
      experience the right weather conditions will naturally produce a
      significant amount of dew. Simply by collecting this dew, a family
      can gather up to 2L of dew water per dew night. This work offers a
      primer to the topic of AWVPs, and a description of how to build a
      dew collection rig. Unfortunately, dewfall is not currently
      recorded in most standard meteorological archives; so the next
      step for this project is to offer a reliable means of regional
      assessment that is accessible to a layman.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      As the world’s population increases, fresh water supplies are
      being tapped out. Desalination has become a necessary means of
      acquiring water; however current methods are usually quite costly
      and use fossil fuels. This is inappropriate for the developing
      world, where there is a serious need for increased fresh water
      availability. Atmospheric water vapor processing (AWVP) is a new
      and emerging technology in which the atmospheric water vapor is
      condensed and collected.[1][2][3]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Operating Principle</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      There is approximately 4 g of water vapor per cubic meter of air
      in the earth’s atmosphere. This source of potable water is
      available virtually worldwide. AWVPs harvest this water, by
      condensing it from vapor to liquid.[4][5]<br>
      <br>
      <b>Advantages</b><br>
      <br>
      It is at an early stage in development, but has the potential to
      provide environmentally acceptable alternatives to standard water
      supplies.[4][5]<br>
      <br>
      Many AWVP designs favor decentralization of water distribution and
      avoidance of huge capital costs for infrastructure.[5]<br>
      <br>
      AWVP can be made appropriate, community-managed and
      community-maintained for developing countries.[5]<br>
      <br>
      AWVP methods are competitive with desalination plants and simpler
      and less expensive to operate and maintain.[5]<br>
      <br>
      The amount of water produced would vary according to installation
      size, and be suitable to provide potable water to individuals or
      even thousands of people.[5]<br>
      <br>
      AWVP production can take place in a wide variety of locations.
      Thus, expensive water distribution infrastructure can be reduced
      or avoided.[5]<br>
      <br>
      Chemically, water vapor in the atmosphere is as clean as the air
      around it. Naturally occurring dew is a potable source of soft
      water, generally low on any mineral content.[6]...<br>

      <br>
      Dew water was collected from several passive foil-based radiative
      condensers established in a variety of geographic settings:
      continental (Grenoble, in an alpine valley, and
      Brive-la-Gaillarde, in the Central Massif volcanic area, both in
      France), French Atlantic coast (Bordeaux), eastern Mediterranean
      (Jerusalem, Israel), and the island of Corsica (Ajaccio, France)
      in the Mediterranean Sea. In Ajaccio two large 30 m2 condensers
      have been operating since 2000. Additional semi-quantitative dew
      measurements were also carried out for Komiža, island of Vis
      (Croatia) in the Adriatic Sea, and in Mediterranean Zadar and
      Dubrovnik (both in Croatia). Dew potential was calculated for the
      Pacific Ocean island of Tahiti (French Polynesia). The data show
      that significant amounts of dew water can be collected. Selected
      chemical and biological analyses established that dew is, in
      general, potable. Continued research is required for new and
      inexpensive materials that can enhance dew condensation.<br>

      </b><b>Abstract</b><br>
      <br>
      Over the last 20 years, dew harvesting has evolved to fruition
      because of a better understanding of its physics, thermodynamics,
      and the radiative cooling process of condensing substrates.
      Although resultant yields are relatively small, dew positions
      itself as a viable water resources supplement because it occurs
      naturally and frequently in many locations globally, particularly
      in the absence of precipitation or when more traditional water
      sources are subject to depletion. Moreover, dew water is generally
      potable, especially in rural locations, where it is most
      beneficial. This review summarizes dew harvesting research
      achievements to date including formation processes, collection in
      various environments, prediction models, water quality, and
      applications. The paper concludes with outlining existing gaps and
      future research needs to improve the understanding and performance
      of dew harvesting in the context of adaptation to climate change.<br>

      The present invention relates to the general field of materials
      used to promote the natural infrared radiative cooling, including
      employees in the construction of buildings, or in the automotive
      industry. More particularly, the present invention relates to
      materials used to achieve evacuation of calories by radiative
      cooling or to allow an atmospheric water vapor condensation in the
      form of clean liquid water for consumption. We know the importance
      should be attached to the energy management to develop means able
      to reduce energy costs and increase water resources, including
      drinking water in some areas. For this purpose, it is possible to
      use natural infrared radiative cooling of certain materials to
      evacuate day calories contained within a closed space, and to
      condense the night atmospheric moisture in the form of liquid
      water .<br>
      <br>
      This is particularly advantageous in relatively arid regions. Such
      natural radiative cooling is particularly effective in a spectral
      window wavelength of between 8 and 14 m, commonly known in English
      sky window, within which the atmosphere emits only low radiation.
      The overall radiative received power at day ground level is broken
      down into ultraviolet radiation (between 0 and 0.3 m), visible
      (between 0.3 m and 0.7 m), near infrared (between 0.7 m and 3 m)
      mid-infrared (between 3 and 25 m) and far infrared (over 25 m).<br>
      By day, the atmospheric radiation at long wavelengths (infrared
      and far infrared means) represents 22.9% of the aggregate
      radiative power. At night, this radiation is 100% of the energy
      received. Atmospheric radiation at long wavelengths is the result
      of absorption by the atmosphere, especially by water vapor H2O,
      carbon dioxide CO2 and ozone 03, extraterrestrial or infrared
      radiation emitted by the ground and oceans. The gas then each
      re-emit an infrared spectrum according to their chemical
      constitution. Ozone, which broadcasts mainly in the spectral
      window ranging from 8 to 14 m, emits a weak infrared radiation.
      Most of the sky emissivity deficit is therefore observed in this
      window. However, at room temperature, the emission spectrum of a
      black body has a maximum in the same window or spectral range. It
      is therefore conceivable that a material having a high emissivity
      on the spectral window ranging from 8 to 14 m can dissipate large
      amounts of energy by radiative transfer to the sky which has a
      lower temperature due to its low emissivity this beach.<br>
      Day, a material may limit its heating if it has a high emissivity
      in the mid-infrared radiation, and in particular on the spectral
      window ranging from 8 to 14 m, combined with reflectance of the
      relatively large solar energy, for the ultraviolet, visible and
      near infrared. The radiative dissipation is especially important
      as it is proportional to the temperature of the surface
      considered. The natural radiative cooling is therefore involved in
      an air conditioning energy savings.<br>
      <br>
      At night, only the atmospheric radiation at long wavelengths
      (infrared and far infrared means) is present. It is therefore
      possible to cool the materials by several degrees below the
      ambient temperature by radiative dissipation of energy. Such
      cooling can cause atmospheric water vapor condensation in the form
      of liquid water can be recovered. In this field of materials
      provided to the radiative cooling and atmospheric water vapor
      condensation, known by the scientific article Light scattering
      coatings: Theory and application of solar W. E. Vargas et al.
      journal Solar Energy Materials &amp; Solar Cells, 54, (1998)
      343-350, a white opaque thermoplastic film with high emissivity on
      a spectral band ranging from 8 to 13 m which is obtained from a
      low density polyethylene ( LDPE) respectively, which is 5% and 2%
      by volume of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and by volume of barium
      sulfate (BaSO4) relative to the total volume of the polyethylene.
      Such a thermoplastic film including major disadvantages include a
      main charge based on titanium dioxide which is relatively
      expensive, and require a relatively large thickness for its opaque
      character and its high infrared emissivity.<br>
      <br>
      This is especially bad for the cost of such a film, and may be
      incompatible with mass production. Furthermore, expenses of the
      thermoplastic film does not provide a satisfactory resistance to
      ultraviolet radiation, which is particularly problematic for a
      film to be used outdoors. In another technical field, by US Patent
      US 4,075,784 discloses a thermoplastic film obtained from a high
      density polyethylene (HDPE) charge of 1 to 15% by weight of
      calcined kaolin (Al2O3.2SiO2) by weight total polyethylene,
      calcined kaolinite comprising between 51 and 57% by weight silica,
      between 40 and 46% by weight of alumina and less than 3% by weight
      impurities. 5 The composition of the thermoplastic film for
      agricultural use allows an increase of the emissivity of the
      infrared radiation of the materials used in manufacturing
      greenhouses while retaining significant transmittance of visible
      light in order to increase the crop yield by retention heat and
      reduction in the quantity of heat to be supplied to heat
      greenhouses.<br>
      <br>
      In the field of agricultural greenhouses are also known from
      document US 6441059, a thermoplastic film comprising a high
      density polyethylene matrix (HDPE) and a plurality of suitable
      mineral fillers to increase the reflectance to the near infrared
      radiation while retaining significant transmittance of visible
      light to avoid getting daily high temperatures inside the
      greenhouse, and also limit heat loss during the night. In the
      above two agricultural applications, recommended thermoplastic
      films are intended only to limit the harmful temperature
      differences for crops due to radiative heat transfer ground / sky
      while ensuring, at visible wavelengths, the external energy supply
      necessary for their development.<br>
      <br>
      To reduce the energy required to provide for cooling a home, known
      from US 6,521,038, a mixture of pigments for paint adapted to
      allow the increase of the reflectance of the surface coated with
      the paint to radiation near infrared.<br>
      <br>
      Such a mixture has the drawback of being relatively expensive in
      so far as it requires a specific formulation for obtaining certain
      pigments of the mixture.<br>
      <br>
      In addition, the effectiveness of this solution is low to the
      extent that it only limits the introduction of light radiation,
      and this on a few extended spectral range. The present invention
      therefore aims to remedy the aforementioned drawbacks by enabling
      a significant cooling a particularly economically surface.<br>
      <br>
      More particularly, the present invention aims to obtain a
      substantial cooling of a surface by natural radiative dissipation,
      especially at night. The present invention may also be designed to
      ensure a water recovery, and in particular of drinking water by
      condensation of atmospheric water vapor during the cooling of the
      surface considered. The present invention also aims to achieve
      such radiative cooling of a surface, and possibly atmospheric
      water vapor condensation, stable over time. According to a first
      aspect, the invention relates to a use of a composition high
      emissivity on a spectral band ranging from 4 to 50 m, comprising a
      polymer matrix and at least one kaolin-based filler for radiative
      cooling a surface coated with said composition, and optionally the
      atmospheric water vapor condensation.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second aspect, the invention also relates to a
      paint composition comprising this composition. Finally, the
      invention relates to a plastic film comprising this composition.<br>
      <br>
      Other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the invention
      appear more clearly on reading the description and the various
      examples that follow.<br>
      <br>
      Kaolin has the advantage of possessing a very high emissivity in
      the infrared radiation, and in particular in the range from 7.5 to
      25 m. Thus, with a surface coated with the composition provided
      with such a burden to low optical density giving a transparent to
      the composition, one can obtain an important day and night cooling
      by radiative transfer, limiting the supply of external energy
      required to cool a confined space. It is easily understood that
      this composition is intended to be used primarily in environments
      where temperatures are relatively high. The composition is
      obtained from components available in low-cost trading. In
      addition, the kaolin has been recognized as safe for food contact
      use if the polymer matrix is ​​in contact with food. I1 is
      possible to collect drinking water on the surface. Thus, the
      drinking water recovery on a surface coated with the composition
      according to the invention generates no toxicity.<br>
      Kaolin clay is a white, friable and refractory, of lamellar
      structure composed mainly of hydrated aluminum silicate. Alumina
      silicate may originate from ore in the forms kaolinite, dickite
      and nacrite of empirical formula Al2Si2O5 (OH) 4 or A14Si4O10 (OH)
      8, the hydrated halloysite Al2O3.2SiO2.4H2O form of formula or in
      its form anauxite the same composition but containing a proportion
      of silica slightly higher than kaolinite. In its hydrated form
      natural marketed, its water content is generally less than 7% of
      the total mass and exceptionally up to 12%.<br>
      <br>
      The natural form is particularly suitable for applications in
      water based paints.<br>
      <br>
      After a calcining treatment, the water content is generally less
      than 1%. This form is adapted to be incorporated into plastics and
      paints in solvent base.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the composition comprises from 1 to 15%, and
      preferably of from 3.82 to 7.83% by volume of kaolin based on the
      total volume of the initial polymer. Particularly interesting
      formulations comprise from 5.7% to 7.83% of kaolin volume relative
      to the total volume of the initial polymer.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the composition comprises a pigment volume
      concentration from 1 to 30%, and preferably 5.90 to 12.1% by
      volume of kaolin based on the total volume of other non-volatile
      materials (mineral fillers, polymers and additives non-volatile).
      The pigment volume concentration (PVC) is the ratio of the pigment
      volume (or inorganic filler) and the total volume of non-volatile
      (i.e., pigments, mineral fillers and binder) present in a paint.
      This figure is generally expressed as a percentage. The binder
      volume corresponds to the volume solids content of the paint used
      as a basis to the mix.<br>
      <br>
      The average diameter of kaolin particles may range preferably
      between 0.2 and 2.3 m. However, an average diameter of kaolin
      particles less than 0.2 m or greater than 3 m is not harmful to
      the radiative properties to thermal infrared wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      Such a mean diameter of kaolin particles between 0.2 m and 2.3
      provides an increase in reflectance in the near infrared
      radiation. Indeed, the particles of inorganic fillers diffract the
      incident radiation wavelength close to their diameter when
      dispersed in a medium optical density lower than the optical
      density of the mineral component.<br>
      <br>
      Thus, kaolin is reflective for the wavelength range between 0.2
      and 2 to 3 m. Furthermore, the inhomogeneous distribution of the
      particle size further increases the reflectance of the composition
      to near infrared radiation. For use of the composition in the form
      of thermoplastic film include for example kaolin sold under the
      name GlomaxLL by Imerys with an average diameter of 1.5 m.<br>
      For use of the composition in the form of painting, there may be
      mentioned calcined kaolin sold under the name Blankalite 78 by the
      Soka society, with a median diameter of 2.0 m for a solvent-based
      paint, and natural kaolin atomized Blankalite 90C or 90P marketed
      by the company Gakkai, respectively median diameters 0.8 m and 0.2
      m respectively for lower water contents at 5 to 6%. <br>
      <br>
      Advantageously, the composition comprises a matrix polymer
      selected from polyolefins, polyvinyls, polyvinylidene,
      polystyrenics, acrylic and methacrylic polymers, polyamides,
      polyesters, polyethers, polyfluorinated; polyurethane resins,
      alkyd resins, epoxy resins, and phenolic resins. For example, the
      polymer matrix of the composition may be selected from low or high
      density polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride,
      polystyrene, poly (ethylene / vinyl acetate), acrylic resins,
      glyptal resins, and polyurethane resins.<br>
      Preferably, polyethylene is used. Include an indication
      polyethylenes used pursuant blowing sold under brand Lacqtene 1020
      FN 24 of Atofina, or Lacqtene FE 8000 with an average density of
      0.924.<br>
      <br>
      In the case of low density Lacqtene FE 8000 of a medium density
      polyethylene of 0.924 to which is added 7% of additive brand Atmer
      7340 0.925 density, percentage by weight of polymer in the final
      formulations are respectively 62.1 % (opaque white), 69.9% (white)
      and 72.4% (colorless). In another implementation, the composition
      may include calcite.<br>
      <br>
      Calcite CaCO3 chemical formulation also having a low optical
      density and giving a transparent appearance to the composition,
      increases the emissivity thereof over the range from 6.5 to 9.5 m.
      Radiative cooling is increased for these wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      This mineral filler also has a low cost and has been recognized
      safe for food contact use. The composition comprises from 0 to 5%,
      and preferably from 1.52 to 1.9% calcite volume relative to the
      volume of the original polymer. This composition is particularly
      suitable for the manufacture of films. For the manufacture of
      paints, the composition may comprise 0 to 15%, preferably 2.2 to
      3.2% of pigment volume concentration of calcite. Preferably, the
      average diameter of calcite particles is between 0.2 and 3 m. This
      range for the average diameter of the mineral calcite fillers can
      increase the reflectance of the composition for visible light and
      near infrared radiation, and specifically on the wavelength
      between 0.2 and 3 m.<br>
      <br>
      However, an average diameter smaller or larger particles will not
      be harmful to the radiative properties infrared thermal
      wavelengths.<br>
      <br>
      For use of the composition as a film or paint, can be cited as
      indicative calcite marketed under the name SB Polcarb by Imerys
      with a median diameter of 0.8 m. In one embodiment, the
      composition further comprises titanium dioxide. TiO2 chemical
      formulation of titanium dioxide may be incorporated in the polymer
      matrix when it is desired to use the matrix to limit day the
      heating of the surface coated with the composition. Indeed, the
      introduction of titanium dioxide allows to make white opaque
      composition, which allows to obtain on the visible light
      reflectance of a relatively high solar energy combined with high
      emissivity on the infrared radiation serves to limit daytime
      heating of the surface. The use of titanium dioxide is also
      eligible for food contact uses, if it is embedded in the material.<br>
      Titanium dioxide, however, a significantly higher price than
      kaolin and calcite, which increases the cost of the composition.
      The composition may comprise from 1 to 20%, and preferably from
      2.4 to 5.4% by volume of titanium dioxide relative to the total
      volume of the initial polymer in the manufacture of thermoplastic
      films.<br>
      <br>
      For the manufacture of paints, the composition may comprise 0 to
      30%, preferably 13.9%, of pigment volume concentration of titanium
      dioxide. All in the form of titanium dioxide ranges micronized
      suitable for such formulations, the mean diameter being generally
      between 0.1 and 0.5 m. Advantageously, the diameter means titanium
      dioxide particles is between 0.20 and 0.31 m.<br>
      <br>
      With such an average particle diameter of titanium particles, the
      reflectance of the composition is increased mainly for the
      ultraviolet and visible radiation. For use of the composition in
      the form of thermoplastic film include for example titanium
      dioxide marketed under the name TR28 by Huntsman means 0.21 m
      diameter. These particles are coated with Al2O3 to present a
      stability to ultraviolet radiation. An organic treatment
      facilitates their wetting by the polymer for a better dispersion
      and a higher mechanical strength of the final material. For use of
      the composition in the form of solvent-based paint include an
      indication titanium dioxide sold under the brand Ti-Pure R-105 of
      the company du Pont de Nemours, with an average diameter of 0.31
      m. In one embodiment, the composition comprises at least one
      anti-ultraviolet additive (UV). These additives help prevent aging
      by photo-degradation of the composition used in film form or in
      the form of painting.<br>
      <br>
      The UV stabilizing additives may be selected from the most
      widespread in the polymer industry, whether benzophenones type
      benzotiazoles, triazines, benzoxazinones, hindered benzoates,
      hindered amines, nickel-based, etc. . These stabilizers classes
      will be preferentially selected those that are accredited in
      temporary contact with foodstuffs. A non-exhaustive list of
      products that may be suitable is: Great lakes polymer additive
      range, type products Lowilite 94, 62, 22, 26, 27, 28, Q84 and Q21
      Lowilite type nickel-based, the products of Ciba Specialty
      Chemicals, stabilizers Tinuvin NOR 371; Smartlight RL 1000;
      Tinuvin 494; Tinuvin 783.<br>
      <br>
      Range of Cytec, Cyasorb UV the products; Cyasorb THT 4611. Or
      products Clariant H Ostavin N 391 and Gran Gran Hostavin ARO 8 and
      products from Rhodia brand ranges (paintings) Rhodocoat or
      Tolonate. Anti-UV additives are generally selected based on the
      polymer base used in said composition. For example, when the
      composition is in the form of films and includes low-density
      polyethylene, UV light stabilizer is chosen type based hindered
      amines or English Hindered Amine Light Stabilizers additive (HALS
      ). For applying the composition in the form of thermoplastic film
      include for example the anti-UV additive sold under the name
      Tinuvin 783 by Ciba Specialty Chemicals, which is suitable for
      food use. Advantageously, the composition comprises 0.5 to 0.7%
      and preferably 0.6% by weight, said anti-UV additive based on the
      total weight of the composition.<br>
      <br>
      This aspect of the composition must reflect the product used and
      the recommended mass content by the manufacturer. For applying the
      composition in the form of painting, proper commercial polymer
      matrix for outdoor use already containing such additive is
      sufficient. Advantageously, it is possible to impart to the coated
      surface from said composition of hydrophilic surface properties to
      promote the formation of films of water. Thus, in the case of
      films, the composition may comprise at least one additive which
      confers to the surface hydrophilic properties.<br>
      <br>
      This additive will favor the condensation of water at the film
      surface thereby increasing the amount of water recovered.<br>
      <br>
      Generally, this additive is a surfactant. Moreover, in the case of
      a thermoplastic film obtained by extrusion, this type of additive
      allows a better distribution of the inorganic fillers within the
      polymer matrix. During a cooling phase, this type of additive
      migrates to the surface and gives the composition hydrophilic
      properties in order to cause condensation in the form of film,
      which promotes the flow and the recovery of the condensed water.
      For applying the composition in the form of thermoplastic film,
      there may be mentioned the surfactant additive sold under the
      brand Atmer 7340 by Ciba Specialty Chemicals, which is suitable
      for food use.<br>
      <br>
      Preferably, the composition comprises from 6 to 8% and preferably
      7% by weight of said water drops anti-forming additive based on
      the total weight of the composition. Of course, it is also
      possible to provide any other industrial process capable of giving
      it hydrophilic properties, for example a corona treatment by
      dielectric barrier discharges, or also chemical treatments such as
      halogenation, oxidation or that chlorophosphorylation may agree
      provided that the legislation allows for the non-permanent contact
      with foodstuffs.<br>
      <br>
      For an application of the composition in the form of paint, this
      surface hydrophilic property can also be provided by a particular
      step in the manufacture of said paint. Thus, the added mineral
      fillers, and in particular the kaolin filler, are laid out exposed
      by photolysis of the binder on the surface after a period of
      exposure to ultraviolet radiation above 30 days.<br>
      <br>
      Painting acquires a highly hydrophilic character preserved over
      time and effective in promoting atmospheric water vapor
      condensation. This highly hydrophilic character also promotes
      gravity flow of condensed water on the surface.<br>
      <br>
      According to a second aspect, the invention also relates to a
      paint comprising a composition as defined above. Advantageously,
      the paint is water-based or organic solvent. Finally, in a third
      aspect, the invention further relates to a plastic film comprising
      a composition as defined above. Preferably, the film has a
      thickness of between 150 and 250 m. Such a film may be obtained
      for example by molding, by blow molding or by extrusion. The
      following examples illustrate the present invention and should not
      be considered in any way as limiting thereof. Example 1: The
      Applicant has made compositions used as films and having the
      following formulations: Wire White Colourless low density

      polymer introduced.<br>
      <br>
      The first opaque white film formulation comprising a proportion by
      volume of kaolin of 3.82% corresponds to a mass percentage of 9.0%
      of the polymer mass originally introduced. This formulation is
      recommended for applications requiring maximum opacity of the
      film.<br>
      <br>
      The film formulations comprising a proportion by volume of kaolin
      equal to 5.7% and 7.83% correspond to the respective weight
      percentages of 16.1% and 21.9% relative to the polymer mass
      originally introduced. The weight percentages are for guidance
      from the initial polymer mass for an initial polyethylene
      composition Lacqtene FE 8000 with an average density of 0.924 and

      The plaintiff has made compositions used as paints and comprising
      the following formulations. Because of 20 the solvent when forming
      the paint film, the pigment is expressed in terms pigment volume
      concentration (PVC), which is the ratio of the volume of the load
      calculated on the total volume of the dry extract of the final
      formulation comprising the binder, the pigments and fillers, but
      excluding the volume of the solvent. 1015 25 Commercial Base Type

      indication, if a colorless base is used, the volume proportion of
      binder in the extract dry the final formulation is 78.0%
      respectively (opaque white paint) and 84.9% (colorless paint).<br>
      <br>
      If a tinted base is used, the pigment volume concentration already
      incorporated can be variable while the added pigment volume
      concentration is 10%. In the latter case, the final proportion of
      binder will be determined with knowledge of the total pigment
      volume concentration in the mixture. The pigment volume
      concentration of each mixture will be the same if it is a
      solvent-based paint or water-based.<br>
      <br>
      The optical properties obtained for paints containing formulations
      identical to those of Table 4 and having thicknesses of 90 and 94
      m are: 20 commercial basis Type brilliant Base Colourless final
      painting radiative Opaque white Colorless Thickness (m ) 90 94
      Reflectance of visible radiation (0.38&gt; 0.80 0.62 0.78 ù m) ù
      Table 5 the formulations shown in tables 1 and 4 make it possible
      to obtain compositions having high emissivity the average
      reflectance and infrared radiation of relatively large solar
      energy to visible light and near infrared. However, a higher
      relative proportion of kaolin is in no way detrimental to the
      thermal infrared emissivity (4 ù 100 m) which is the essential
      property of these formulations. There is no theoretical upper
      limit to the incorporation of kaolin in the formulations. The
      materials formulated with a volume proportion of incorporated
      kaolin less than the values ​​given in Tables 1 and 4 will be
      particularly suitable for passive radiative cooling applications
      and atmospheric water vapor condensation.<br>
      <br>
      However, their emissivity medium and far infrared will be less,
      reducing their effectiveness for the above applications. The
      composition according to the invention is particularly suitable
      for use in building construction, or in the automobile industry.
      It is for example possible to use this composition in the form of
      paints for vehicle bodies automobiles, or to the walls and roofs
      of buildings.<br>
      <br>
      Of course, it is also possible to use films comprising the
      composition according to the invention to coat the roofs of
      buildings. A particularly interesting application of such films
      also relates to their use on flat surfaces bearing against the
      ground to form condensers and recovering potable liquid water. To
      promote a recovery of water, it is possible to incline the
      surfaces relative to the ground, for example an angle of a value
      of 30 °<br>
