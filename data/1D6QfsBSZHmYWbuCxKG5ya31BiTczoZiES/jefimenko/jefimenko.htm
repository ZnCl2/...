      <br>
      Would you believe an electric motor made almost entirely of
      plastic? That can run on power transmitted through open air? And
      sneak free electricity right out of the earth's electrical field?<br>
      <br>
      At the University of West Virgina we saw a laboratory full of such
      exotic devices spinning, humming, and buzzing away like a swarm of
      bees. They are electrostatic motors, run by charges similar to
      those that make your hair stand on end when you comb it on a cold
      winter's day.<br>
      <br>
      Today, we use electromagnetic motors almost exclusively. but
      electrostatics have a lot of overlooked advantages. They're far
      lighter per horsepower than electromagnetics, can run at extremely
      high speeds, and are incredibly simple and foolproof in
      construction.<br>
      <br>
      "And, in principle," maintains Dr Oleg Jefimenko, "they can do
      anything electromagnetic motors can do, and some things they can
      do better."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Jewel-like Plastic Motors.</span><br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko puts on an impressive demonstration. He showed us motors
      that run on the voltage developed when you hold them in your hands
      and scuff across a carpet, and other heavier, more powerful ones
      that could do real work. Up on the roof of the University's
      physics building in a blowing snowstorm, he connected an
      electrostatic motor to a specially designed earth-field antenna.
      It twirled merrily from electric power drawn out of thin air.<br>
      <br>
      These remarkable machines are almost unknown today. Yet the
      world's electric motor was an electrostatic. It was invented in
      1748 by Benjamin Franklin.<br>
      <br>
      Franklin's motor took advantage of the fact that like charges
      repel, unlike ones attract. He rigged a wagon-wheel-sized,
      horizontally mounted device with 30 glass spokes. On the end of
      each spike was a brass thimble. Two oppositely charged leyden jars
      -- high voltage capacitors -- were so placed that the thimbles on
      the rotating spokes barely missed the knobs on the jars ( see
      photo ).<br>
      <br>
      As a thimble passed close to a jar, a spark leaped from knob to
      thimble. That deposited a like charge on the thimble, so they
      repelled each other. then, as the thimble approached the
      oppositely charged jar, it was attracted. As it passed this second
      jar, a spark jumped again, depositing a new charge, and the whole
      repulsion-attraction cycle began again.<br>
      <br>
      In 1870, the German physicist J.C. Poggendorff built a motor so
      simple it's hard to see what makes it work. The entire motor, as
      pictured here, is a plastic disk ( Poggendorff used glass ) and
      two electrodes. The electrodes set up what physicists call a
      corona discharge; their sharp edges ionize air molecules that come
      in contact with them. These charged particles floating through the
      air charge the surface of the palstic disk nearby. Then the
      attraction-repulsion routine that Franklin used takes place.<br>
      <br>
      A few papers on electrostatic&nbsp; motors have trickled out of
      the laboratories in recent years. But nobody really showed much
      interest until Dr Jefimenko came on the scene.<br>
      <br>
      The Russian-born physicist was attending a class at the University
      of Gottingen one day shortly after World War II when the lecturer,
      a Prof. R.W. Pohl, displayed two yard-square metal plates mounted
      on the end of a pole. He stuck the device outside and flipped it
      180 degrees. A galvanometer hooked to the plates jumped sharply.<br>
      <br>
      "I could never forget that demonstration," said Jefimenko. "And I
      wondered why, if there is electricity in the air, you couldn't use
      it light a bulb or something."<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Electricity Everywhere</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      The earth's electrical field has been known for centruries.
      Lightning and St Elmo's fire are the most dramatic manifestations
      of atmospheric electricity. But the field doesn't exist just in
      the vicinity of these events; it's everywhere.<br>
      <br>
      The earth is an electrical conductor. So is the ionosphere, the
      layer of ionized gas about 70 kilometers over our heads. The air
      between is a rather poor insulator. Some mechanisms not yet
      explained constantly pumps large quantitites of charged particles
      into the air. The charged particles cause the electrical field
      that Jefimenko saw demonstrated. Although it varies widely,
      strength of the field averages 120 volts per meter.<br>
      <br>
      You can measure this voltage with an earth-field antenna -- a wire
      with a sharp point at the top to start a corona, or with a bit of
      radioactive materials that ionizes the air in its immediate
      vicinity. near the earth, voltage is proportional to altitude; on
      an average day you might measure 1200 volts with a 10-meter
      antennas.<br>
      <br>
      Over that past few years, aided by graduate-student Henry
      Fischbach-Nazario, Jefimenko designed advanced corona motors. With
      David K. Walker, he experimented with electret motors. An electret
      is an insulator with a permanent electrostatic charge. It produces
      a permanent electrostatic charge in the surrounding space, just as
      a magnet produces a permanent magnetic field. And like a magnet,
      it can be used to build a motor.<br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko chose the electrostatic motor for his project because
      the earth-field antennas develop extremely high-voltage
      low-current power -- and unlike the electromagnetic motor --
      that's exactly what it needs.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Climactic Experiment</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      On the night of Sept. 29, 1970, Jefimenko and Walker strolled into
      an empty parking lot, and hiked a 24-foot pole painted day-glow
      orange into the sky. On the pole's end was a bit of radioactive
      material in a capsule connected to a wire. The experimenters
      hooked an electret motor to the antenna, and, as Jefimenko
      describes it, "the energy of the earth's electrical field was
      converted into continuous mechanical motion."<br>
      <br>
      Two months later, they successfully operated operated a corona
      motor from electricity in the air.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Any Future In It?</span><br>
      <br>
      Whether the earth's electrical field will ever be an important
      source of power is open to question. There are millions -- perhaps
      billions -- of kilowatts of electrical energy flowing into the
      earth constantly. Jefimenko thinks that earth-field antennas could
      be built to extract viable amounts of it.<br>
      <br>
      But whether or not we tap this energy source, the electrostatic
      motor could become important on its own.<br>
      <br>
      * In space or aviation, it's extreme light weight could be
      crucial. Jefimenko estimates that corona motors could deliver one
      horsepower for each 3 pounds of weight.<br>
      <br>
      * They'd be valuable in laboratories where even the weakest
      magnetic field could upset an experiment.<br>
      <br>
      * Suspended on air bearings, they'd make good gyroscopes.<br>
      <br>
      In a particularly spectacular experiment, Jefimenko turned on a
      Van de Graaff generator -- a device that creates a
      very-high-voltage field. About a yard away he placed a
      sharp-pointed corona antenna and connected it to an electrostatic
      motor. The rotor began to spin. The current was flowing from the
      generator through the air to where it was being picked up by the
      antenna.<br>
      <br>
      The stunt had a serious purpose: The earth's field is greatest on
      mountaintops. Jefimenko would like to set up a large antenna in
      such a spot, then aim an ultraviolet laser beam at a receiving
      site miles away at ground level. The laser beam would ionize the
      air, creating an invisible conductor through apparently empty
      space.<br>
      <br>
      To be sure, many difficulties exist; and no one knows for sure
      whether we'll ever get useful amounts of power out of the air. But
      with thinking like that, Jefimenko's a hard man to ignore.<br>

      <br>
      When we crank up the electrostatic motor at the top of this page,
      people always want to know what makes it run. It is mysterious --
      there's nothing but a plastic disk and two strange electrodes. Yet
      there it is, spinning merrily.<br>
      <br>
      In "The Amazing Motor That Draws Power From the Air", last month,
      we told about our visit to the laboratory of Dr Oleg Jefimenko at
      the University of West Virginia, who has designed and built a
      variety of these ingenious machines. now, as promised, we bring
      you details on how you can build your own electrostatic motor from
      simple materials.<br>
      <br>
      The devices that you see here are corona-discharge motors. The
      sharp-pointed or knife-edge electrodes create a corona, which
      ionizes or charges the air particles floating by. These charged
      particles transfer their charge to the closest part of the plastic
      rotor and charge it up, just as you can charge your body by
      walking across a wool rug on a dry winter's day.<br>
      <br>
      Once a spot on the rotor assumes a charge, it is repelled from the
      chargin electrode by electrostatic forces, and at the same time is
      attracted to the other electrode, which has an opposite charge.
      When the charged section of the rotor reaches the opposite
      electrode, another corona discharge reverses the polarity and
      starts the whole thing over again.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Concept is Simple</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      And so are the motors. But that doesn't mean thery're easy to
      build. These motors run on millionths of a watt; they've got no
      power to waste turning stiff bearings or slightly misaligned
      rotors. So they must be built with watch-making precision.<br>
      <br>
      They're made of acrylic sheet, rod, and tube stock -- Plexiglas
      and Lucite are two of the better-known brands. Acrylic cuts and
      works beautifully. Cut edges can be sanded so they have a white,
      frosted appearance that, in contrast with clear surfaces, gives
      your finished motor a sparkling, jewel-like appearance. If you
      like clear edges, you can buff them on a wheel and the whole thing
      becomes transparent.<br>
      <br>
      Drill and tap the acrylic and assemble parts with machine screws.
      This allows for fine adjustment and alignment. Later, you can make
      the whole thing permanent by putting a little solvent along the
      joints. The solvent flows into the joint and fuses it permanently.<br>
      <br>
      Details of framework, support and so on aren't important; change
      them if you like. but work with care if you want to avoid
      headaches. The Poggendorff motor looked simple; we slapped it
      together in a couple of hours, hooked up the power source -- and
      nothing happened. We gave it a few helpful spins by hand, but it
      wouldn't keep running.<br>
      <br>
      The cure took about 3 hours. First, we noticed that the outer edge
      of the disk wobbled from side to side about 1/16 of an inch as the
      wheel revolved. So the rotor-electrode distance was constantly
      changing. There was a little play in the 1/4" hole we had drilled
      for the electrodes -- so they weren't lined up absolutely square
      with the disk. Then we noticed that the disk always stopped with
      one side down. The imbalance was only a fraction of an ounce --
      but it was too much.<br>
      <br>
      We drilled out the old hub and cemented in a new one -- this time,
      carefully. We lined up the electrodes -- precisely. Then, once
      more spinning the disk by hand, we added bit of masking tape until
      it was perfectly balanced. We connected the power -- and slowly...
      slowly... the disk began to turn. After about a minute, we clocked
      some turns with a watch and found it was spinning at 200 rpm. A
      moment later, we lost count. It was a great feeling.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Where Tolerances Are Brutal</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      We had even more trouble with the octagonal-window machine. When
      it wouldn't run and we turned the shaft by hand, we could feel the
      rotor dragging. We took it apart, felt all the surfaces on the
      rotor and the framework's insides and found a few bits of hardened
      cement, which we removed. We filed down all edges on the rotor adn
      the windows to make sure there were no beads or chips dragging.<br>
      <br>
      The rotor and corner separators are made from the same sheet of
      1/2" plastic, so rotor clearance is achieved by putting shims at
      the corners to hold the side plates slightly more than 1/2" apart.
      With the 1/16" shims we were using, we could see that the sides
      were slightly misaligned so the shaft was not being held at a true
      90 degrees. We drilled slightly oversized holes in the corners of
      one side piece and carefully adjusted until the rotor was turning
      true in the slot. To give the motor more torque, we put a bead of
      cement along the outer edge of each aluminum-foil electrode to
      stop corona leakage. The motor ran.<br>
      <br>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Take A Giant Step</span><br
        style="font-weight: bold;">
      <br>
      Once you've built these machines, why not design your own? Start
      with the Jefimenko 1/10 hp model (pictured) as a challenge. Then
      plan one from scratch. You can power your motors with a laboratory
      high-voltage supply, a Van de Graff generator, or a Wimhurst
      machine or any other high-voltage source. We've been running ours
      on the home-built Wimhurst machine shown in the photos. (If you
      don't want to build one, Wimhurst machiens are available from
      scientific supply houses such as Edmund Scientific ).<br>
      <br>
      The discharge globes are traditional for high-voltage machines.
      They aren't necessary, but they give a quick check on machine
      operation and a satifying arc when you move them within 1/2" of
      each other. Incidentally, that funny smell is ozone. But its
      concentration is too low to be harmful. The generator is safe,
      too. You can hold both electrodes in your hands and all you'll
      feel is a tingle. This particular generator, we estimate, puts out
      about 30,000 volts.<br>
      <br>
      To make wiring simple, we used standard connectors on the Wimhurst
      collectors, and meter leads with regular banana plugs and
      alligator clips to hook up the motors.<br>
      <br>
      Last month, we mentioned seeing Dr Jefimenko run his electrostatic
      motors on electricity tapped from the earth's field. We haven't
      had a chance to try this yet with ours, but it should work. If you
      want to try, you'll need a needle-pointed piece of music wire a
      few inches long to start a corona, plus several hundred feet of
      fine copper wire.<br>
      <br>
      Connect the pointed wire to the fine conductor, get the sharp
      point up into the air at least 200-300 feet with a kite or
      balloon, and hook the wire to one side of the motor. Hook the
      other side of the motor to ground. The earth field antenna should
      at times be able to develop up to 20,000 volts from the earth's
      electrical field. If nothing happens, check your equipment, or try
      another day. The field changes constantly.<br>

      Virginia University.<br>

      <span style="font-style: italic;">Biography</span><br
        style="font-style: italic;">
      <br>
      Jefimenko received his B.A. at Lewis and Clark College (1952). He
      received his M. A. at the University of Oregon (1954). He received
      his Ph.D. at the University of Oregon (1956). Jefimenko has worked
      for the development of the theory of electromagnetic retardation
      and relativity. In 1956, he was awarded the Sigma Xi Prize. In
      1971 and 1973, he won awards in the AAPT Apparatus Competition.
      Jefimenko has constructed and operated electrostatic generators
      run by atmospheric electricity.<br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko has worked on the generalization of Newton's
      gravitational theory to time-dependent systems. In his opinion,
      there is no objective reason for abandoning Newton's force-field
      gravitational theory (in favor of a metric gravitational theory).
      He is actively trying to develop and expand Newton's theory,
      making it compatible with the principle of causality and making it
      applicable to time-dependent gravitational interactions.<br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko's expansion, or generalization, is based on the
      existence of the second gravitational force field, the
      "cogravitational, or Heaviside's, field". This is might also be
      called a gravimagnetic field. It represents a physical approach
      profoundly different from the time-space geometry approach of the
      Einstein general theory of relativity. Oliver Heaviside first
      predicted this field in the article "A Gravitational and
      Electromagnetic Analogy" (1893).<br>

      The next energy breakthrough is Dr. Oleg Jefimenko's electrostatic
      motors. Discovered by Ben Franklin in the 18th century,
      electrostatic motors are an all-American invention. They are based
      on the physics of the fair-weather atmosphere that has an
      abundance of positive electric charges up to an altitude of 20 km.
      However, the greatest concentration is near the ground and
      diminishes with altitude rapidly. Dr. Jefimenko discovered that
      when sharp-pointed antennas are designed for a sufficient length
      to obtain at least 6000 volts of threshold energy, the
      fair-weather current density available is about a picoampere per
      square meter. Such antennas produce about a microampere of
      current. However, small radioactive source antennas may be used
      instead that have no threshold voltage and therefore no height
      requirements. Similar to a nuclear battery design of Dr. Brown,
      these antennas have larger current potentials depending upon the
      radioactive source used (alpha or beta source) and ionize the air
      in the vicinity of the antenna. Electrostatic motors are lighter
      than electromagnetic motors for the same output power since the
      motor occupies the entire volume. For example, it is expected that
      a motor one meter on a side will provide a power of one megawatt
      and weigh 500 kg or less. Electrostatic motors also require very
      little metal in their construction and can use mostly plastic for
      example. They can also operate from a variety of sources and range
      of voltages. As Dr. Jefimenko points out, "It is clear that
      electrostatic motor research still constitutes an essentially
      unexplored area of physics and engineering, and that electrostatic
      motor research must be considered a potentially highly rewarding
      area among the many energy-related research endeavors."[5] The
      atmospheric potential of the planet is not less than 200,000
      megawatts. He has succeeded in constructing demonstration motors
      that run continuously off atmospheric electricity. Jefimenko's
      largest output motor was an electret design that had a 0.1 Hp
      rating.[6] Certainly the potential for improvement and power
      upgrade exists with this free energy machine.<br>

      <br>
      So I go out on my step and what to my wondering eyes doth appear
      but the box from Amazon.com containing the Jefimenko books that
      Bill Miller shamed me into finally buying. So I take a quick look
      inside and decide to give an initial report here. (Too much vector
      math in there for a thorough review.)<br>
      <br>
      These books have some amazing advanced thinking in the
      understanding of Maxwell and EM. One first thought is the
      consideration of causality. This is typically totally ignored in
      the EM community. Evidence of that is the fact that EM waves are
      widely held to be propagated by the E field creating the H field
      and the H field creating the E field as it goes along. Too bad
      it's just not true! Jefimenko points out that causality demands
      that that an event must be PRECEDED by it's cause! Simultaneous
      events CANNOT be "causal" of each other. Hence E and H fields of
      waves are created by the WAVE SOURCE not each other! Same things
      goes for the E field created by Faraday induction. It simply
      cannot be "caused" by the time-varying Magnetic Field. "Magnetic
      induction" is therefore a misnomer. Such induction is caused by
      the source CURRENT and NOT the magnetic field!<br>
      <br>
      This leads Jefimenko on to note that contrary to the "one E field"
      theory that has been believed for so many years, the inductive E
      field is clearly NOT the same field as an electrostatic E field.
      Jefimenko terms this inductive E field the "Electrokinetic Field"
      to show that it is a different field from the electrostatic E
      field. Very good. However, old habits die hard and even Jefimenko
      persists in writing an expression for a "total E field" following
      Maxwell as consisting of a sum of the electrostatic and
      electrokinetic parts as if they were both the "same" kind of E
      field.<br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko then proceeds to illustrate the electrokinetic fields
      with a series of calculations and examples using his formulas as
      an approach. He presents it as basically a "new" way of doing this
      and in one sense it is compared to the commonly used and
      non-causal bogus "flux linkage" methods. However, he fails to note
      that the causal Neumann formula is in essence identical to his
      formulation and has been a standard formulation for years for the
      calculation of the "electrokinetic field" or what is usually
      termed "mutual induction". Nevertheless his example calculations
      are important basic references to the topic of Faraday induction.
      And the consideration of causality clearly shows that the Neumann
      approach has the edge over the "flux linkage" ideas with at times
      fail to give correct results.<br>
      <br>
      But the subject doesn't end with induction, he pulls gravity into
      the mix. Of particular interest is that he shows that once you
      introduce causality into Newton's theory of gravitation,
      interesting things start to happen! Relativity suddenly begins to
      show up and even more interesting "action-reaction" is soon
      discovered to actually be a law that does NOT hold in all cases!
      The electromagnetic nature of gravity quickly becomes strongly
      hinted at and without action-reaction laws, those dreamed of
      devices such as anti-gravity ships and the "force-glove" that you
      wear to push over a building become theoretical possibilities!
      These are truly books full of thought-provoking new ways of
      looking at tired old physics!<br>
      <br>
      I'm not going to be going through the large quantity of field
      theory math in these books in a hurry, but that's OK because
      clearly taking the time to go through in detail WILL be worth the
      effort! What can I say? Listen to Bill Miller and get that order
      off to Amazon.com now. At roughly $25 each these two books are a
      huge bargain to the usual EM text books costing hundreds of
      dollars and then being full of bogus ideas and misunderstandings
      of the established theories. Just do it! I did and I'm not sorry I
      did!<br>

            bold;">The Bizarre and Intriguing Story of Oleg Jefimenko
            and the Solutions to Maxwell's Equations</span><br
            style="font-weight: bold;">
        </big></div>
      <br>
      I recently heard the story of Oleg Jefimenko during a lecture on
      Electrodynamics, specifically the general solution to Maxwell’s
      Equations.<br>
      <br>
      Jefimenko’s tiny bit of fame comes from Jefimenko’s Equations,
      which are the general solution to Maxwell’s equations expressed
      solely in terms of sources, that is charge and current
      distributions. The equations are messy and difficult to work with,
      and aren’t used much in practice. But they do reveal certain bits
      of physics (such as the applicability of the quasistatic
      approximation (the link goes to a thermodynamics page, but the
      idea is the same) and that fields must be created by sources), and
      it’s always nice to have the general solution to a problem
      available.<br>
      <br>
      These equations weren’t written down until 1966, about a century
      after Maxwell’s Equations were known. Some people will claim (as
      the Wikipedia article cited does) that Jefimenko’s Equations were
      written down earlier, but those earlier versions are always
      slightly different and not quite complete. What’s really funny is
      that Jefimenko wrote them down in an attempt to formulate an
      alternative to Maxwell’s equations.<br>
      <br>
      When my current Professor, David Griffiths, was in the process of
      writing a paper on the subject, he independently derived
      Jefimenko’s equations, and tried to figure out if anyone had done
      it before. Other than some slightly tricky and annoying math,
      they’re not hard to derive, so someone must have done it. He found
      that Jefimenko had written them in a book that was published by a
      company that had only published one other work, also by Jefimenko
      (apparently regular publishers wouldn’t take his books, so he went
      to a prestige press). He contacted Jefimenko, and Jefimenko didn’t
      believe that he had solved Maxwell’s equations, but that he had
      created an electromagnetic theory separate from (and doubtless
      better than) Maxwell’s. Of course he had done no such thing, his
      formulation is exactly equivalent to Maxwell’s, but he wasn’t
      buying it.<br>
      <br>
      According to Griffiths, Jefimenko currently submits one or two
      papers a week to American journals, gets denied, then publishes
      them in Europe (where review is apparently not as stringent). I
      don’t know what they’re about, the Wikipedia article says he
      focuses on overthrowing Einstein’s General Relativity and Maxwell.<br>
      <br>
      I found this story behind some esoteric equations to be pretty
      amusing, and thought others might agree. I hope you’ve enjoyed the
      convoluted and intriguing story behind Jefimenko’s equations.<br>
      <br>
      [Most of my information comes from a lecture with Griffiths, and
      as such could not be found online. Anything that is available
      online has been referenced.]<br>

      <font size="3">Although no one can make a perpetual motion
        machine, anyone can tap the earth's electric field to run a
        homemade motor perpetually. The field exists in the atmosphere
        between the earth's surface and the ionosphere as an electric
        potential of about 360,000 volts. Estimates of the stored energy
        range from a million kilowatts to a billion kilowatts.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Energy in this form cannot be drawn on directly for
        driving ordinary electric motors. Such motors develop mechanical
        force through the interaction of magnetic fields that are
        generated with high electric current at low voltage, as Michael
        Faraday demonstrated in 1821. The earth's field provides
        relatively low direct current at high voltage, which is ideal
        for operating electrostatic motors similar in principle to the
        machine invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1748.</font><br>

      <font size="3">Motors of this type are based on the force of
        mutual attraction between unlike electric charges and the mutual
        repulsion of like charges. The energy of the field can be tapped
        with a simple antenna in the form of a vertical wire that
        carries one sharp point or more at its upper end. During fair
        weather the antenna will pick up potential at the rate of about
        100 volts for each meter of height between the points and the
        earth's surface up to a few hundred feet. At higher altitudes
        the rate decreases. During local thunderstorms the pickup can
        amount to thousands of volts per foot. A meteorological
        hypothesis is that the field is maintained largely by
        thunderstorms, which pump electrons out of the air and inject
        them into the earth through bolts of lightning that continuously
        strike the surface at an average rate of 200 strokes per second.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Why not tap the field to supplement conventional
        energy resources? Several limitations must first be overcome.
        For example, a single sharp point can draw electric current from
        the surrounding air at a rate of only about a millionth of an
        ampere. An antenna consisting of a single point at the top of a
        60-foot wire could be expected to deliver about a microampere at
        2,000 volts; the rate is equivalent to .002 watt. A
        point-studded balloon tethered by a wire at an altitude of 75
        meters might be expected to deliver .075 watt. A serious
        limitation appears as the altitude of the antenna exceeds about
        200 meters. The correspondingly higher voltages become difficult
        to confine.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">At an altitude of 200 meters the antenna should
        pick up some 20,000 volts. Air conducts reasonably well at that
        potential. Although nature provides effective magnetic materials
        in substances such as iron, nickel and cobalt, which explains
        why the electric-power industry developed around Faraday's
        magnetic dynamo, no comparably effective insulating substances
        exist for isolating the high voltages that would be required for
        electrostatic machines of comparable power. Even so,
        electrostatic motors, which are far simpler to build than
        electromagnetic ones, may find applications in special
        environments such as those from which magnetism must be excluded
        or in providing low power to apparatus at remote, unmanned
        stations by tapping the earth's field.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Apart from possible applications electrostatic
        motors make fascinating playthings. They have been studied
        extensively in recent years by Oleg D. Jefimenko and his
        graduate students at West Virginia University. The group has
        reconstructed models of Franklin's motors and developed advanced
        electrostatic machines of other types.</font><br>

      <br>
      <font size="3">Although Franklin left no drawing of his motor, his
        description of it in a letter to Peter Collinson, a Fellow of
        the Royal Society, enabled Jefimenko to reconstruct a working
        model [see illustration at right]. Essentially the machine
        consists of a rimless wheel that turns in the horizontal plane
        on low-friction bearings. Each spoke of the "electric wheel," as
        Franklin called the machine, consists of a glass rod with a
        brass thimble at its tip. An electrostatic charge for driving
        the motor was stored in Leyden jars. A Leyden jar is a primitive
        form of the modern high-voltage capacitor. Franklin charged his
        jars with an electrostatic generator.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The high-voltage terminals of two or more Leyden
        jars that carried charges of opposite polarity were positioned
        to graze the thimbles on opposite sides of the rotating wheel.
        The motor was started by hand. Thereafter a spark would jump
        from the high-voltage terminal to each passing thimble and
        impart to it a charge of the same polarity as that of the
        terminal. The force of repulsion between the like charges
        imparted momentum to the wheel.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Conversely, the thimbles were attracted by the
        oppositely charged electrode of the Leyden jar Franklin placed
        on the opposite side of the wheel. As the thimbles grazed that
        jar, a spark would again transfer charge, which was of opposite
        polarity. Thus the thimbles were simultaneously pushed and
        pulled by the high-voltage terminals exactly as was needed to
        accelerate the wheel.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Franklin was not altogether happy with his motor.
        The reason was that running it required, in his words, "a
        foreign force, to wit, that of the bottles." He made a second
        version of the machine without Leyden jars.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">In this design the rotor consisted principally of a
        17-inch disk of glass mounted to rotate in the horizontal plane
        on low-friction bearings. Both surfaces of the disk were coated
        with a film of gold, except for a boundary around the edge. The
        rotor was thus constructed much like a modern flat-plate
        capacitor.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Twelve evenly spaced metal spheres, cemented to the
        edge of the disk, were connected alternately to the top and
        bottom gold films. Twelve stationary thimbles supported by
        insulating columns were spaced around the disk to graze the
        rotating metal spheres. When Franklin placed opposite charges on
        the top and bottom films and gave the rotor a push, the machine
        ran just as well as his first design, and for the same reason.
        According to Franklin, this machine would make up to 50 turns a
        minute and would run for 30 minutes on a single charge.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Jefimenko gives both motors an initial charge from
        a 20,000-volt generator. They consume current at the rate of
        about a millionth of an ampere when they are running at full
        speed. The rate is equivalent to .02 watt, which is the power
        required to lift a 20-gram weight 10 centimeters (or an ounce
        2.9 inches) in one second.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Jefimenko wondered if Franklin's motor could be
        made more powerful. As Jefimenko explains, the force can be
        increased by adding both moving and fixed electrodes. This
        stratagem is limited by the available space. If the electrodes
        are spaced too close, sparks tend to jump from electrode to
        electrode around the rotor, thereby in effect short-circuiting
        the machine. Alternatively the rotor could be made cylindrical
        to carry electrodes in the form of long strips or plates. This
        scheme could perhaps increase the output power by a factor of
        1,000.&nbsp;</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Reviewing the history of electrostatic machines,
        Jefimenko came across a paper published in 1870 by Johann
        Christoff Poggendorff, a German physicist. It described an
        electrostatic motor fitted with a rotor that carried no
        electrodes. The machine consisted of an uncoated disk of glass
        that rotated in the vertical plane on low-friction bearings
        between opposing crosses of ebonite. Each insulating arm of the
        crosses supported a comblike row of sharp needle points that
        grazed the glass.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">When opposing combs on opposite sides of the glass
        were charged in opposite polarity to potentials in excess of
        2,000 volts, air in the vicinity of the points on both sides of
        the glass was ionized. A bluish glow surrounded the points,
        which emitted a faint hissing sound. The effect, which is
        variously known as St. Elmo's fire and corona discharge,
        deposited static charges on both sides of the rotor.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Almost the entire surface of the glass acquired a
        coating of either positive or negative fixed charges, depending
        on the polarity of the combs. The forces of repulsion and
        attraction between glass so charged and the combs were
        substantially larger than they were in Franklin's charged
        thimbles. The forces were also steadier, because in effect the
        distances between the combs and the charged areas remained
        constant. It should be noted that adjacent combs on the same
        side of the glass carried charges of opposite polarity, so that
        the resulting forces of attraction and repulsion acted in unison
        to impart momentum to the disk, as they did in Franklin's motor.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">By continued experimentation Poggendorff learned
        that he should slant the teeth of the combs to spray charge on
        the glass at an angle. The resulting asymmetrical force made the
        motor self-starting and unidirectional. When the teeth were
        perpendicular to the glass surface, the forces were symmetrical,
        as they were in Franklin's motor. When the machine was started
        by hand, it ran equally well in either direction.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Poggendorff was immensely pleased by the rate at
        which his machine converted charge into mechanical motion. He
        concluded his paper with a faintly odious reference to
        Franklin's device. "That such a quantity of electricity must
        produce a far greater force than that in the [Franklin] electric
        roasting spit," he wrote, "is perfectly obvious and nowadays
        would not be denied by Franklin himself. With one grain of
        gunpowder one cannot achieve so much as with one hundred
        pounds."</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Electrostatic motors are now classified in general
        by the method by which charge is either stored in the machine or
        transferred to the rotor. Poggendorff's machine belongs to the
        corona type, which has attracted the most attention in recent
        years. Although its measured efficiency is better than 50
        percent, Poggendorff regarded it merely as an apparatus for
        investigating electrical phenomena. He wrote that "it would be a
        sanguine hope if one wanted to believe that any useful
        mechanical effect could be achieved with it."</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Poggendorff's negative attitude toward the
        usefulness of his design may well have retarded its subsequent
        development. A modern version of the machine constructed in
        Jefimenko's laboratory has an output of approximately .1
        horsepower. It operates at speeds of up to 12,000 revolutions
        per minute at an efficiency of substantially more than 50
        percent. In one form the modern corona motor consists of a
        plastic cylinder that turns on an axial shaft inside a
        concentric set of knife-edge electrodes that spray charge on the
        surface of the cylinder [see illustration at left]. Forces that
        act between the sprayed charges and the knife-edge electrodes
        impart momentum to the cylinder.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Machines of this kind can be made of almost any
        inexpensive dielectric materials, including plastics, wood and
        even cardboard. The only essential metal parts are the
        electrodes and their interconnecting leads. Even they can be
        contrived of metallic foil backed by any stiff dielectric. The
        shaft can be made of plastic that turns in air bearings. By
        resorting to such stratagems experimenters can devise motors
        that are extremely light in proportion to their power output.
        Corona motors require no brushes or commutators. A potential of
        at least 2,000 volts, however, is essential for initiating
        corona discharge at the knife-edges.</font><br>

      <font size="3"><br>
        A smaller and simpler version of the machine was demonstrated in
        1961 by J. D. N. Van Wyck and G. J. Kühn in South Africa. This
        motor consisted of a plastic disk about three millimeters thick
        and 40 millimeters in diameter supported in the horizontal plane
        by a slender shaft that turned in jeweled bearings. Six radially
        directed needle points grazed the rim of the disk at equal
        intervals. When the machine operated from a source of from 8,000
        to 13,000 volts, rotational speeds of up to 12,000 revolutions
        per minute were measured.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">I made a corona motor with Plexiglas tubing two
        inches in diameter and one and a half inches long. It employed
        stiffbacked single-edge razor blades as electrodes. The bore of
        the tube was lined with a strip of aluminum foil, a stratagem
        devised in Jefimenko's laboratory to increase the voltage
        gradient in the vicinity of the electrodes and thus to increase
        the amount of charge that can be deposited on the surface of the
        cylinder. I coated all surfaces of the razor blades except the
        cutting edges and all interconnecting wiring with "anticorona
        dope," a cementlike liquid that dries to form a dielectric
        substance that reduces the loss of energy through corona
        discharges in nonproductive portions of the circuit.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The axial shaft that supports the cylinder on pivot
        bearings was cut out of a steel knitting needle. The ends of the
        shaft were ground and polished to 30degree points. To form the
        points I chucked the shaft in an electric hand drill, ground the
        metal against an oilstone and polished the resulting pivots
        against a wood lap coated with tripoli.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The bearings that supported the pivots were
        salvaged from the escapement mechanism of a discarded alarm
        clock. A pair of indented setscrews could be substituted for the
        clock bearings. The supporting frame was made of quarter-inch
        Lucite. The motor can be made self-starting and unidirectional
        by slanting the knife-edges. Those who build the machine may
        discover, as I did, that the most difficult part of the project,
        balancing the rotor, is encountered after assembly. The rotor
        must be balanced both statically and dynamically.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Static balance was achieved by experimentally
        adding small bits of adhesive tape to the inner surface of the
        aluminum foil that lines the cylinder until the rotor remained
        stationary at all positions to which it was set by hand. When
        the rotor was balanced and power was applied, the motor
        immediately came up to speed, but it shook violently. I had
        corrected the imbalance caused by a lump of cement at one end of
        the rotor by adding a counterweight on the opposite side at the
        opposite end of the cylinder. Centrifugal forces at the ends
        were 180 degrees out of phase, thus constituting a couple.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The dynamic balancing, which is achieved largely by
        cut-and-try methods, took about as much time as the remainder of
        the construction. To check for dynamic balance suspend the motor
        freely with a string, run it at low speed and judge by the
        wiggle where a counterweight must be added. Adhesive tape makes
        a convenient counterweight material because it can be both
        applied and shifted easily.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">I made the motor as light and frictionless as
        possible with the objective of operating it with energy from the
        earth's field. The field was tapped with an antenna consisting
        of 300 feet of No. 28 gauge stranded wire insulated with
        plastic. It is the kind of wire normally employed for
        interconnecting electronic components and is available from
        dealers in radio supplies.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The upper end of the wire was connected to a
        20-foot length of metallic tinsel of the kind that serves for
        decorating a Christmas tree. The tinsel functioned as multiple
        needle points. Strips cut from window screening would doubtless
        work equally well.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The upper end of the tinsel was hoisted aloft by a
        cluster of three weather balloons. Such balloons, each three
        feet in diameter, and the helium to inflate them are available
        from the Edmund Scientific Co. (300 Edscorp Building,
        Barrington, N.J. 08007). The weight in pounds that a
        helium-filled balloon of spherical shape can lift is roughly
        equal to a quarter of the cube of its radius in feet. To my
        delight the motor began to run slowly when the tinsel reached an
        altitude of about 100 feet. At 300 feet the rotor made between
        500 and 700 revolutions per minute.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">A note of warning is appropriate at this point.
        Although a 300-foot vertical antenna can be handled safely in
        fair weather, it can pick up a lethal charge during
        thunderstorms. Franklin was incredibly lucky to have survived
        his celebrated kite experiment. A European investigator who
        tried to duplicate Franklin's observations was killed by a bolt
        of lightning. The 300-foot antenna wire can hold enough charge
        to give a substantial jolt, even during fair weather. Always
        ground the lower end of the wire when it is not supplying a
        load, such as the motor.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">To run the motor connect the antenna to one set of
        electrodes and ground the other set. Do not connect the antenna
        to an insulated object of substantial size, such as an
        automobile. A hazardous charge can accumulate. Never fly the
        balloon in a city or in any other location where the antenna can
        drift into contact with a high-voltage power line. Never fly it
        below clouds or leave it aloft unattended.</font><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="197403.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      <font size="3">A variety of corona motors have been constructed in
        Jefimenko's laboratory. He has learned that their performance
        can be vastly improved by properly shaping the corona-producing
        electrodes [see illustration at right]. The working surface of
        the rotors should be made of a fairly thin plastic, such as
        Plexiglas or Mylar. Moreover, as I have mentioned, the inner
        surface of the cylinder should be backed by conducting foil to
        enhance the corona. Effective cylinders can be formed
        inexpensively out of plastic sewer pipe. Corona rotors can of
        course also be made in the form of disks.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">One model consists of a series of disks mounted on
        a common shaft. Double-edged electrodes placed radially between
        adjacent disks function much like Poggendorff's combs. This
        design needs no foil lining or backing because a potential
        gradient exists between electrodes on opposite sides of the
        disks. It is even possible to build a linear corona motor, a
        design that serves to achieve translational motion. A strip of
        plastic is placed between sets of knife-edge electrodes slanted
        to initiate motion in the desired direction.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Notwithstanding the problem of handling potentials
        on the order of a million volts without effective insulation
        materials, Jefimenko foresees the possibility of at least
        limited application of corona power machines. In The Physics
        Teacher (March, 1971) he and David K. Walker wrote: "These
        motors could be very useful for direct operation from
        high-voltage d.c. transmission lines as, for example, the 800 kV
        Pacific Northwest-Southwest Intertie, which is now being
        constructed between the Columbia River basin and California. It
        is conceivable that such motors could replace the complex
        installations now needed for converting the high-voltage d.c. to
        low-voltage a.c. All that would be required if corona motors
        were used for this purpose would be to operate local low-voltage
        a.c. generators from corona motors powered directly from the
        high-voltage d.c. line."</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">As Jefimenko points out, a limiting factor of the
        corona motor is its required minimum potential of 2,000 volts.
        This limitation is circumvented by a novel electrostatic motor
        invented in 1961 by a Russian physicist, A. N. Gubkin. The motor
        is based on an electret made in 1922 by Mototaro Eguchi,
        professor of physics at the Higher Naval College in Tokyo.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">An electret is a sheet or slab of waxy dielectric
        material that supports an electric field, much as a permanent
        magnet carries a magnetic field. Strongly charged carnauba-wax
        electrets are available commercially, along with other
        electrostatic devices, from the Electret Scientific Company
        (P.O. Box4132, Star City, W.Va. 26505). A recipe for an
        effective electret material is 45 percent carnauba wax, 45
        percent water-white rosin and 10 percent white beeswax. Some
        experimenters substitute Halowax for the rosin.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The ingredients are melted and left to cool to the
        solid phase in a direct-current electric field of several
        thousand volts. The wax continues to support the field even
        though the external source of potential is turned off [see "The
        Amateur Scientist, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, November, 1960, and
        July, 1968]. The electret reacts to neighboring charges exactly
        as though it were a charged electrode, that is, it is physically
        attracted or repelled depending on the polarity of the
        neighboring electrode.</font><br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="197404.jpg" alt=""></div>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Gubkin harnessed this effect to make a motor. The
        rotor consisted of a pair of electrets in the shape of sectors
        supported at opposite ends of a shaft. The center of the shaft
        was supported transversely by an axle. When the rotor turned,
        the electrets were swept between adjacent pairs of charged
        metallic plates, which were also in the form of sectors.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">The plates were electrified by an external source
        of power through the polarity-reversing switch known as a
        commutator. The commutator applied to the electrodes a charge of
        polarity opposite to the charge of the attracted electret. As
        the electret moved between the attracting plates, however, the
        commutator switched the plates to matching polarity. The
        alternate push and pull imparted momentum to the rotor in exact
        analogy to Franklin's motor.</font><br>
      <br>
      <font size="3">Gubkin's motor was deficient in two major respects.
        The distances between the electrodes and the electrets were
        needlessly large, so that the forces of attraction and repulsion
        were needlessly weak. Moreover, during the electret's transit
        between electrodes its surfaces were unshielded. Unshielded
        electrets attract neutralizing ions from the air and lose their
        charge within hours or days.</font><br>

      <font size="3"> Both inherent deficiencies of Gubkin's motor have
        been corrected in Jefimenko's laboratory by taking advantage of
        what is termed the slot effect. Instead of sandwiching the
        electret alternately between pairs of metal plates, Jefimenko
        employs opposing pairs of adjacent plates [see illustration at
        rightt]. The adjacent plates are separated by a narrow slot.
        When adjacent plates carry charges of opposite polarity, the
        electret experiences a force at right angles to the slot and in
        the plane of the electret. The strength of the force is at a
        maximum because the electret is close to the electrodes.
        Simultaneously the electrodes function as shields to prevent the
        neutralization of the electret by free ions.</font> <br>
      <font size="3"><br>
        Motors based on the slot effect can be designed in a number of
        forms. One design consists of an electret in the shape of a
        wafer-thin sheet of Mylar supported by a flat disk of balsa wood
        100 millimeters in diameter and three millimeters thick. (A
        long-lasting charge is imparted to the Mylar by immersing it in
        a field of a few thousand volts from an electrostatic generator
        after the motor is assembled.) This rotor is sandwiched between
        four semicircular sectors that are cross-connected [ see
        illustration ].</font><br>

        The electret is mounted on a four-millimeter shaft of plastic
        that turns in jeweled bearings. The conducting surfaces of the
        commutator consist of dried India ink. The brushes are
        one-millimeter strips of kitchen aluminum foil. The motor
        operates on a few microwatts of power.<br>
        <br>
        Jefimenko has demonstrated a similar motor that was designed to
        turn at a rate of about 60 revolutions per minute and develop a
        millionth of a horsepower on a 24-foot antenna having a small
        polonium probe at its upper end. (By emitting positive charges
        probes of this type tap the earth's field somewhat more
        efficiently than needle points do.) The performance of the motor
        easily met the design specifications. The charm of these motors
        lies in the fact that, although they do not accomplish very
        much, they can run forever.</font><br>
