      The copper mesh is fully integrated into the mouth of the mask.
      The use of copper as a filter for breathing can alleviate illness
      from airborne pathogens by eliminating or diminishing in strength
      and form these harmful pathogens. By breathing through the mask
      made of copper many important facts happen: The person who breaths
      through it inhales energy by inhaling this energy the lungs will
      clear of any bacteria. The mask will eliminate any type of
      breathing problems, asthma and reinforce the lungs to the smallest
      capillaries, including any type of Influenza, Birth flu, T.B, and
      may help people with AIDS to gain strength to fight this sickness.
      The blood loaded with energy will help to fix any internal organs
      and in the process will burn fat cells in the process of fixing
      and reinforcing the muscles in the different parts of the body.
      Breathing through the mask can help eliminate children obesity. I
      have been testing this mask with hundreds of people in the last 10
      years and have had excellent results for what I just mentioned
      above. People who have been using it eliminated their asthma
      problems, lost weight and didn't get sick for years from any type
      of Influenza. / Additional Notes taken from the video - Carlos is
      now 70 years old, stronger than he was when he was 30. Copper
      eliminates any type of mental sickness, Alzheimers, Parkinsons,
      strokes, Avian Flu, Tuberculosis and gives vitality to the whole
      system. Just breathing the copper will produce the results. 10
      years ago he was dying. Would fall asleep when he drove. When he
      placed copper on his head (looks like copper chore girl scubber
      stretched out to make a mesh net) and he felt good. Made a mask
      and slept while breathing through it. Carlos says he no longer
      needs glasses, can see like an eagle now. For 4 years now he
      hasn't gotten sick. Doctor told him he would die 4 years ago and
      he is alive and healthy thanks to breathing copper. Where to buy /
      As you can see, this is eminently easy to do for yourself. Any
      grocery store of decent size will have these COPPER CHOREBOYS and
      your hardware store should be able to custom order copper mesh if
      they don't have it in stock. Or you can buy on the internet. He
      makes a lot of claims for this and it doesn't appear it would do
      any harm to try it out. If you do try it, please email me your
      results and I'll post it to the Interact discussion list and
      possibly also on this page.<br>

          <b>Head shield</b><br>
        </big></div>
      &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
      An electromagnetic shielding apparatus for covering and protecting
      the head of a user from EMF radiation which may be worn by itself
      or discretely beneath other head gear. A head covering is
      fabricated from a conductive, non-magnetizable material such as
      copper, bronze, brass or the like which may be drawn and shaped
      into a web or mesh material. The resulting shield is lightweight,
      air permeable and supple enough to be worn beneath other head
      gear.<br>
      <br>
      <b>FIELD OF INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The invention relates to electromagnetic shielding for the head
      and particularly to a head shield which may be worn alone or in
      conjunction with other head gear. Specifically, the invention
      relates to a head shield fabricated from a light-weight metal mesh
      or web material having openings to permit air permeability.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Living tissues of plants and animals depend on electrochemical
      potentials for many of their normal functions. Charged species
      such as sodium, potassium and calcium ions are nearly omnipresent
      throughout mammalian bodies and participate in or facilitate
      numerous important chemical reactions. Disruption of or
      interference with these reactions may occur due to chemical
      imbalances caused by environmental factors including the presence
      of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) sources, such as power lines,
      electrical equipment and the like. Recently, EMR sources have been
      implicated in the development of brain tumors, cancer, headaches,
      malaise, short-term memory loss and childhood leukemia. Both
      static electric and magnetic fields (collectively, EMF) as well as
      radiofrequency (RF) radiation have been implicated in these
      conditions and diseases. Unfortunately, with modern society's
      increasing reliance on electrical devices such as refrigerators,
      alarm clocks, microwave ovens, cellular phones, computers and the
      like, exposure to EMFs has become more consistent and unavoidable.<br>
      <br>
      Notwithstanding efforts by numerous western nations and Japan to
      regulate exposure by their people to EMFs as well as regulatory
      efforts adopted by several states in the U.S., there is
      disagreement as to the significance of the role EMFs play in the
      development of disease, notably cancer, in humans. A peer-reviewed
      report appearing in the British journal The Lancet in December
      1999 concluded that there was no link between electromagnetic
      radiation and childhood cancer in clear conflict with a report by
      James Clark and David Derbyshire in the Jul. 16, 1998 edition of
      the Daily Mail that indicated studies conducted by British
      researches found the use of mobile phones could "disrupt parts of
      the brain in charge of memory and learning" and could "cause a
      rise in blood pressure and may harm pregnant women." What is not
      in dispute is that humans in developed nations are exposed to EMFs
      as part of the modern environment and that the range of effects
      due to such exposure is not fully understood. Arguably, reduction
      or elimination of such exposure in the absence of clear
      understanding is to be desired. To this end, several attempts have
      been made in the prior art to reduce exposure by humans to various
      radiation sources. For example, <b>U.S. Pat. No. 5,570,476</b>,
      issued Nov. 5, 1996 to B. B. Olive discloses a cap of metallized
      fabric to protect the wearer from an electromagnetic field. <b>U.S.






        Pat. No. 5,621,188</b>, issued Apr. 15, 1997 to S. C. Lee et al.
      discloses an electromagnetic shielding medium which can be used on
      the head. The shielding medium can be composed of any highly
      conductive metal, such as copper, and is fabricated as a plurality
      of geometrically shaped objects (spheres) held in contact with
      each other in a generally hexagonal array. <b>U.S. Pat. No.
        5,038,047</b> issued Aug. 6, 1991 to S. S. Still discloses a
      hood to protect the head from radiation exposure. <b>U.S. Pat.
        No. 5,022,099</b>, issued Jun. 11, 1991 to C. A. Walton shows a
      solid helmet to protect the head from radiation.<br>
      <br>
      Despite the efforts of the prior art, each of these devices fails
      to provide EMF shielding which is not only effective at shielding
      the head but also which is lightweight, thus making economical use
      of material, simple to manufacture, air permeable and supple
      enough to be worn comfortably under other head gear such as caps,
      hats or scarves.<br>
      <br>
      <b>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</b><br>
      <br>
      Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide
      an electromagnetic shielding apparatus that protects the head of a
      wearer from EMFs and which may be worn comfortably beneath or in
      conjunction with other head gear.<br>
      <br>
      A further object of the invention is to provide an electromagnetic
      shielding apparatus which is lightweight and air-permeable.<br>
      <br>
      A still further object of the invention is to provide an
      electromagnetic shielding apparatus which is simple to manufacture
      and makes economical use of material.<br>

      </b><b>DETAILED DESCRIPTION</b><br>
      <br>
      The present invention relates to an electromagnetic shielding
      apparatus 1 for the head. As shown in FIG. 1, the electromagnetic
      shielding apparatus may comprise a beanie configuration 3, 4
      including a basic head covering 2 which is fabricated from a web
      of coiled and interlocking metal wire 5. Because of its
      availability, cost and conductivity, copper wire is an ideal
      material, although any other highly conductive material, including
      for example, bronze or brass, also would be acceptable. A
      preferred material is copper wire having a guage size of about 1.0
      mm to about 1.0 cm. Importantly, the selected material should not
      be readily magnetizable in order to avoid inadvertent EMF exposure
      arising from the shield itself. The beanie configurations 3 and 4
      differ in size in order to accommodate different heads but may
      also differ in construction. For example, the small beanie 3 is
      made of a heavier gauge copper wire 5 than is the large beanie 4.
      Moreover, the spaces 6 between the interlocking coils 7 of the
      smaller beanie 3 are larger that the spaces 8 of the larger beanie
      4. Ideally, the pitch of the wire coils should be selected to
      produce spaces averaging from about 1.0 mm to about 20.0 mm
      across. Alternatively, the beanies may be fabricated from a metal
      mesh material. The resulting beanie allows for free air
      permeability therethrough and is supple enough to conform to the
      shape of a wearer's head. As configured, the beanie configurations
      3, 4 of the electromagnetic shielding apparatus of the instant
      invention may be worn by themselves or may be worn discretely
      beneath a yarmulke or similar head gear.<br>
      <br>
      A first alternative embodiment 10 is shown in FIG. 2. As with the
      preceding embodiment, the electromagnetic shielding apparatus is
      fabricated as a one-piece structure having a basic head-covering
      portion 11, a forehead-covering portion 12 and a bill portion 13.
      The electromagnetic shielding apparatus thus configured may be
      incorporated into a cap 15, such as a baseball cap. The shielding
      available to the wearer is extended to include not only the top of
      the head 16 but also the forehead 17, generally covering the
      entire brain. It is to be understood that although the
      electromagnetic shielding apparatus is shown in conjunction with a
      baseball cap, hats having different configurations such as fedoras
      or cowboy hats are contemplated to be within the scope of the
      present invention, the electromagnetic shielding apparatus
      requiring corresponding configurational changes to conform to
      differing hat types. Use of lightweight materials such as the
      interlocking coils or mesh used in the instant invention
      facilitates the ready modeling of these different configurations.<br>
      <br>
      A second alternative embodiment 20 shown in FIG. 3 comprises a
      one-piece structure including a basic head-covering portion 21 as
      well as a depending skirt portion 22 and may be worn to cover the
      entire face 23 and neck 24 of a user so that the entire head is
      protected from undesired EMF radiation.<br>
