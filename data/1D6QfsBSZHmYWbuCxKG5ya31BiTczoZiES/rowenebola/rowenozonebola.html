      In October 2014, I traveled to Sierra Leone with my colleague
      Howard Robins to train local health professionals to treat Ebola
      with ozone therapy. Training went great. We hit a snag. While at
      the Sierra Leone Ebola treatment center outside the capital, a
      call came in from the Ministry of Health halting the ozone
      project. Patients were forbidden to receive ozone, and the staff
      as well. The staff did continue with our training fearing for
      their lives otherwise. Patients were denied and left to die.<br>
      <br>
      As "luck" would have it, several health providers, who were on the
      front line, subsequently did come down with Ebola. Additionally we
      know of three additional doctors who contracted the disease. Of
      these three, two outright refused ozone therapy and quickly and
      miserably died. These made international news. The third was
      trained by me and requested ozone and was REFUSED. He also, sadly,
      died miserably. The remaining 4 managed to get the therapy and all
      4 responded nearly instantly, totally recovered within a few days
      and had no complications. The government announced in the world
      news that one military physician did recover, and seemed to take
      credit. However, the government omitted the fact that he received
      ozone therapy. <br>
      <br>
      We have just published the results of our 4 cases in the African
      Journal of Infectious Diseases, and I am providing it here for you
      to read and enjoy. A button below it can provide you with a

      </b><br>
      Please also know that a fifth person, the female consort of one of
      the senior doctors, who refused ozone and died, had encouraged him
      to get ozone. She was placed under armed guard quarantine at her
      home and could not exit to get ozone prophylaxis. Fearing for her
      life, having had intimate exposure, she scaled a razor wire fence
      in the middle of the night, shredding her skin, to evade the
      guards. She was able to get to ozone and developed no symptoms.
      This is a story made for Hollywood. I'll avoid the rest of the
      ramifications of what happened for now. But the good news is that
      Ebola appears to be easily cured and for less than 10 USD!<br>

      <b>Abstract </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Background: Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) has ravaged three countries
      in West Africa. The mortality rate is extremely high, and it is
      perceived not only as threat to all of Africa but to the entire
      world. There is no known treatment to date other than
      administration of convalescent blood or experimental monoclonal
      antibodies, which both often fail. Ozone therapy (OT) has been in
      clinical use for decades and has been found to have physiological
      effects, which should directly inactivate the virus itself, as
      well as modulate its damaging effects. We present the scientific
      background and the possibility of ozone therapy as a cure or
      prevention for EVD in five consecutive patients.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and Methods</b>: Ozone therapy administration by a
      combination of direct intravenous gas administration, rectal gas
      administration and ozonized water was administered to three
      patients with known acute EVD, one with apparent acute infection,
      and one case of extremely high risk. Treatment was carried out for
      up to ten days despite fast total remission of symptoms. Vitamin C
      and glutathione supporting supplements were administered.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Results</b>: Four symptomatic patients, three with test
      positive EVD confirmation and one (who suffered Ebola contaminated
      needle stick contamination three days earlier) without lab
      confirmation all remitted symptoms within 2-4 days and fully
      recovered. All four ill cases had an immediate recovery course
      upon initiation of therapy. The single case of non-symptomatic
      high-risk exposure treated preventively did not develop symptoms.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion:</b> Ebola virus may have a very narrow window of
      redox infectivity capacity, which can be easily exploited with OT.
      OT may be a useful modality in EVD and other viral diseases and
      should be immediately studied to save lives that might otherwise
      be lost. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
      <b>Introduction</b><br>
      <br>
      A Filovirus of several strains, commonly known as Ebola, causes
      hemorrhagic fever (EVD). Incubation ranges 2-21+ days. Ebola virus
      enters dendritic cells shutting down their immune system alerting
      alarms. While unchecked, it replicates wildly, infecting and
      damaging critical organs, inclusive of liver and kidneys. The
      cells explode releasing new viruses and debris. This can result in
      a cytokine storm (Tisoncik et. al., 2012), characterized by
      massive capillary leakage and tissue destruction. Then, the immune
      system may do more harm than good (Amarasinghe, 2014). Mortality
      is extremely high (60% in the current Zaire species outbreak).<br>
      <br>
      WHO reported that the current Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of
      West Africa is the most severe acute public health emergency seen
      in modern times (Watson, 2014).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To date, there
      is no known proven effective treatment” (Choi and Croyle, 2013). A
      recent JAMA editorial proclaimed need for “utmost urgency” of fast
      tracking promising vaccines (Giesbert, 2015). Effective treatment
      is emergently needed. <br>
      <br>
      Ozone is an oxygen allotrope, O3, created by solar UV radiation
      and lightning. It’s the strongest naturally occurring oxidant.
      Scripps Institute reported that ozone is actually generated by
      immune cells (Bablor, et. al., 2003) as part of its armamentarium
      of oxidants, which can be hurled against pathogens. Other immune
      system generated anti-infection oxidants include singlet oxygen,
      H2O2, NO, and NaOCl.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone kills bacteria in easily reachable concentrations nearly
      instantly (Leusink and Kraft, url) and some 100 times faster than
      chlorine containing disinfectants (decontaminants) (Oregon State
      Univ., 2011).<br>
      <br>
      Nikola Tesla patented the first commercial medical ozone generator
      in 1896. In World War I, German physicians disinfected wounds with
      medical OT. German physicians soon discovered that ozone
      application to various body fluids or cavities resulted in
      additional benefits, including enhanced circulation, oxygen
      delivery, and faster healing.<br>
      <br>
      OT has been continuously used for nearly 100 years, especially in
      Europe for a variety of infectious, immunological and circulatory
      conditions. Velio Bocci, MD of Italy investigated OT’s immune
      effects. He published results first in a series of studies (over
      175) in peer reviewed medical journals, now found succinctly in
      his book “Ozone, A New Medical Drug” (2011), which details ozone’s
      many mechanisms to help many medical conditions including:&nbsp;
      1) immune system modulation balancing its
      inflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines, 2) increase in
      production of RBC oxygen releasing 2,3 DGP (also reported by
      Viebahn-Hansler, 2003), and improved rheology properties of blood
      (increased RBC flexibility) 3) elevation of key anti-oxidant
      enzymes such as SOD, and increased glutathione. Cuban ozone
      researchers have independently verified these findings (Menendez,
      et. al., 2008).<br>
      <br>
      Medical OT induces vasoprotective prostacyclin production (Schulz,
      et. al., 2012). OT increases muscle (Clavo, et. al., 2003) and
      tumor oxygenation (Clavo, et. al., 2004) in humans studied by
      direct polarographic electrode measurement. Additionally, ozone
      protected against hepatic ischemia free radical reperfusion injury
      (Perralta, et. al., 1999). <br>
      <br>
      Cuban researchers found that OT preconditioning inhibits TNF-alpha
      production during endotoxic shock. In addition OT exerts influence
      on the antioxidant-prooxidant balance for preservation of cell
      redox state by stimulating endogenous antioxidant systems (Zamora,
      et. al., 2005).<br>
      <br>
      Many viruses require reduced sulfhydryl groups on their lipid
      envelope glycoproteins for cell entry. Mirazimi’s group speculated
      on the richness of disulfide bonds in viral glycoproteins as a
      factor for infectivity. Studying Cytomegalovirus, (CMV) they found
      the virus requires sulfhydryl groups to infect cells (Mirazmi, et.
      al., 1999). If the thiol groups were oxidized, CMV lost
      infectivity. When thiols were chemically re-reduced (by
      dithiothreitol), the virus regained 65% infectivity. Reflecting on
      the reduction of “critical” disulfide bonds for vaccinia virus
      cellular entry, Markovic, et. al., (2004) found that protein
      disulfide isomerase inhibitors limited HIV-1 entry into T cells.<br>
      <br>
      Ozone inactivates many viruses including polio, Norwalk,
      coliophage MS2, hepatitis A and others (Kekez and Sattar, 1997;
      Shin and Sobsey, 2003; Herbold, et. al., 1989; Emerson, et. al.,
      1982).<br>
      <br>
      Ebola appears no different.&nbsp;&nbsp; Studies by Sanders et al.
      have been able to determine the disulfide-bond map of the Ebola
      glycoprotein and, as a result, have proposed that reduction of the
      disulfide bond between the two subunits of the Ebola glycoprotein
      complex, GP1 and GP2, “is a critical step in the entry of Ebola
      virus into cells” (Sanders Lab, url).<br>
      <br>
      Ozone, in vitro, instantly oxidizes reduced sulfhydryls to
      disulfides as shown in the chemical reaction below:<br>
      <br>
      SH+SH+O3&gt;S-S+H2O+O2.&nbsp; While ozone itself lasts only
      microseconds in blood, the reaction of ozone and blood lipids
      leads to the production of more stable but still highly reactive
      oxygen species (such as peroxides), which would react similarly,
      and perhaps mimic the pro-oxidant mechanism of immune system
      defense.<br>
      <br>
      Aerobic cells are designed for redox shuttling and oxidant
      stresses. Viruses lack repair capacity. Shut out of the cell
      (inactivated), they cause no damage, but remain antigenically
      intact for immune response. However, aerobic mammalian cells can
      and do quickly repair membrane oxidation effects. One repair
      pathway activates the hexose-monophosphate shunt, which,
      incidentally, produces 2,3 DGP.<br>
      <br>
      Finally, intravenous oxygen gas has been administered in
      significant volumes for decades in Europe. Numerous papers have
      reported beneficial effects on several physiological parameters.
      Regelsberger&nbsp; observed a general improvement in oxygen
      availability, eosinophilia, which can be valued as an increase in
      undetermined cellular immunological resistance.&nbsp;
      “Furthermore, rheological qualities of the blood as well as
      diuresis are improved, the release of oxygen into the tissue is
      increased, and the blood pH is normalized” (Schmidt, 2002).
      Intravenous oxygen gas in human volunteers induces eosinophil
      generated 15-LOX-1, a powerful anti-inflammatory enzyme, believed
      to be a key factor in inflammatory modulating effects of IV oxygen
      gas (Chaitidis, et. al., 2004).<br>
      <br>
      These considerations caused lead author Rowen to speculate that OT
      might be an ideal candidate to actually cure EVD (and other
      viruses). Rowen has been using OT to treat virus and bacterial
      infections (outpatient setting) since 1986. He recruited Dr.
      Howard Robins, who refined a very inexpensive and relatively
      medical waste free technique of ozone administration- direct
      intravenous gas administration (DIV). DIV administers an
      oxygen/ozone gas mixture intravenously using a 27g winged infusion
      set. The clinician sets an ozone concentration up to 55 mcg/cc.
      (Approximately 98% O2 and 2% O3).&nbsp; Great care is taken to
      prevent “air”, which is 79% nitrogen gas and can cause an embolus,
      from entering the body. There are no reports in the worldwide
      literature, even after decades of use, that intravenous oxygen gas
      causes embolism. Desaturated venous blood is “thirsty” for it.<br>
      <br>
      A protocol (Rowen-Robins Method) for EVD was developed inclusive
      of oral vitamin C, and a supplement supporting recycling of
      glutathione (Thiodox®, Allergy Research Group).<br>
      <br>
      <b>Figure 1: Robins demonstrating DIV technique on Rowen before
        gathering of SL professionals. Sixty cc of gas is administered
        in this treatment.</b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      Rowen and Carew visited the Freetown Hastings Ebola Center and
      taught the method on 10/24/2014.&nbsp; The staff acknowledged a
      current 60% EVD mortality rate, considered, among the best results
      in Sierra Leone. For unknown reasons Ministry of Health
      authorities suddenly forbade the administration of OT on patients
      at the center while the educational session was in progress. Since
      all confirmed cases of Ebola suffered mandatory quarantine, it
      became extremely difficult to locate and treat cases outside this
      mandate. However, four cases did arise from within the facility
      amongst front line providers. These managed to receive OT. We now
      report these four case results. The first case, who was not
      tested, had had an accidental needle prick from Ebola contaminated
      blood three days earlier. All patients executed informed consents.
      <br>
      <br>
      <b>Materials and Methods </b><b><br>
      </b><br>
      “DIV” ozone indicates direct intravenous ozone gas at 55 mcg/cc at
      a volume between 20-40 cc. “Rectal ozone” indicates ozone gas
      administered rectally at a concentration of 36 mcg/cc&nbsp; and
      volume between 150-350 cc. “Ozone water” was made by bubbling
      ozone gas at approximately 70 mcg/cc into water for 15 minutes.
      Administration volume was 300-500 cc, and administered orally. All
      cases were provided nutritional supplements Thiodox® and Buffered
      Vitamin C® (donated by Allergy Research Group). Thiodox dose: one
      twice daily. Vitamin C: four to eight grams daily during the days
      of ozone treatment. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Case Reports </b><br>
      <br>
      Case 1 – Physician SK, 28, male, at the Hastings Ebola Center in
      Freetown jabbed himself with a contaminated needle. He was fearful
      to get an Ebola test, knowing if positive he would have been
      forcibly picked up and placed in quarantine and denied OT, which
      he feared would cost him his life. He was a physician Rowen and
      Carew had trained in OT at Hastings. He received 20 cc of DIV on
      October 23, 2014 as part of the training. The following is his
      verbatim and signed report edited only to remove names. What
      appears in brackets is editing by the authors for accuracy.<br>
      14th November: Needle prick in the red zone while trying to
      cannulate an EVD positive patient.&nbsp; This patient was in the
      recovery ward with no complaint and symptoms. She had done the
      blood (test) but it came positive and was waiting for the second
      specimen to be taken.<br>
      <br>
      The needle went through the PPE and pricked me a finger length
      anteriorly above the wrist. I was wearing Tybek (the thinnest
      PPE). The prick happened just above the margin of the gloves,
      making me more exposed. Had it gone through the gloves, as in the
      case of another doctor, it wouldn't have penetrated the skin.<br>
      <br>
      15th November: No symptoms, but planning to start OT.<br>
      <br>
      16th November: No symptoms- feeling fine. Called Dr. Carew and
      went to see him. DIV [30 cc, 55 mcg/cc] done [one session]. [He
      also received 500 cc ozone water]. Was given Vit. C, Thiodox,
      colloidal silver. I was also given the ozone machine, couldn't use
      it - gas leak.<br>
      <br>
      17th November: Fever at night, loss of appetite, bowel movements
      (unusual) and urge to empty my bowel. The urge was very strong. I
      tried to suppress it. I took ciprofloxacin, paracetamol,
      doxycycline, drank ORS. Couldn't sleep because of fever and the
      urge. I went after midnight to&nbsp; pass stools and I felt some
      comfort. The stool was not watery but not too hard (it was very
      soft). I came and slept.<br>
      <br>
      18th November: Loss of appetite in the morning and weakness.
      Slightly febrile, muscular pain and joint (suppressible). Went
      directly to Blue Shield and finally Dr. Carew came with Jeff
      [McNamara]. Before their arrival I was really weak and couldn't
      stand. For too long had to sit down. But after drinking the ozone
      water Jeff prepared I regained my strength and felt much better. I
      also tried the [ozone] fog. Started rectal ozone [36 mcg/cc].<br>
      <br>
      19th November: Slight weakness. Appetite is much better. DIV done,
      started working again. Did rectal ozone.<br>
      <br>
      20th November: For the first time I did rectal ozone 3 times a day
      [36 mcg/cc]. One DIV. Slight weakness. Slept well at night. My
      temperature was 37.1 degrees Celsius.<br>
      <br>
      21st November: My appetite is improving. DIV and rectal [as
      before].<br>
      <br>
      22nd November: DIV and rectal. No complaints. Prepared ozone
      water.<br>
      <br>
      23rd November: No complaints. Ozone water but no DIV and rectal.<br>
      <br>
      24th-29th November: Ozone water only. <br>
      <br>
      SK fully recovered, resuming his duties within just days of
      commencement of therapy. <br>
      <br>
      Case 2 - Physician MB, 35, male, had close personal contact (hug)
      with another physician after the latter initially tested negative
      for Ebola. However, within 2 days a repeat test (PCR) came
      positive on the other physician (who died shortly thereafter). MB
      subsequently developed typical Ebola symptoms (fever, abdominal
      pain, vomiting, appetite loss, and later diarrhea) within 3 days.
      He was placed in quarantine, but was offered and accepted OT
      administered by the recovered physician SK. <br>
      <br>
      At the appearance of symptoms, he received 30 ml DIV. When PCR
      testing returned positive, he was given an additional 2 DIV
      administrations consisting of: 40 cc each, 12-16 hours apart, at
      55 mcg/cc. He also drank 300-500 cc of ozonated water after the
      intravenous treatments. Within 4 days, all symptoms had cleared. A
      follow-up test for presence of Ebola virus was negative 2 weeks
      later. The government publicly announced this case as a complete
      Ebola recovery in a physician national, but did not mention he had
      received OT. <br>
      <br>
      Case 3-&nbsp; SS, 25, male nursing student on the Ebola front
      line, who was present for the Rowen and Robins ozone training in
      October 2014. He documented exposure to Ebola via damaged
      protective gloves enabling an Ebola patient’s blood to come in
      contact with his skin. He also, without protective gear, cared for
      a friend, who later was confirmed to have EVD. On December 2,
      2014, SS developed fever, malaise and headache. He received 2 DIV
      ozone gas injections of 20 and 30 cc respectively at 55 mcg/cc,
      and drank ozone water (100 cc) on 3 consecutive days. Upon testing
      positive for EVD, (PCR) he was taken to the Kerry Town Ebola
      treatment center where he was not permitted further OT. However,
      he had a complete and non-complicated recovery. <br>
      <br>
      Case 4 - IB, 24, male aid. Working in “red zone”. While bathing an
      Ebola patient, on or about November 24, 2014, he accidentally
      splashed body fluid contaminated water that went through his
      facemask and entered his eyes and mouth. Within 5-7 days, he
      developed progressive symptoms of extreme fatigue, body pains and
      vomiting. He started on anti-malarials. The next day, he informed
      the facility physician who immediately administered DIV ozone, 40
      mcg/cc, 40 ccs. Within a few hours of the gas injection, almost
      all symptoms subsided. He also received two rounds of ozonated
      water (as in case 2). However, by then, he was about symptom free.
      His Ebola test proved positive (PCR) and he was placed in the
      treatment unit and prohibited from further DIV ozone. He did
      receive their usual treatment protocol consisting of D5W,
      Ceftriaxon (IV), Metronidazole (oral), Immunoboost (oral vitamin).
      He had an uneventful stay within the Ebola containment unit and
      was discharged in the first week of December. <br>
      <br>
      Case 5 - GK was the female companion of a 67-year-old Sierra Leone
      senior physician who died of EVD. She had intimate contact with
      him at the time of his falling ill. Authorities placed her under
      home military quarantine (armed military guards), preventing any
      entry and exit, inclusive of anyone who might bring her OT. She
      was in great fear for her life and very much aware of OT, having
      urged her partner to accept it before he died. In the middle of
      the night she scaled a razor wire fence shredding her skin and
      evaded the guards. She arrived at Dr. Carew’s “Blue Shield”
      facility where she received: one DIV ozone treatment, and daily
      rectal ozone and ozone water for ten days. She also received
      vitamin C and Thiodox® twice daily. No symptoms developed.<br>
      <br>
      An ozone-fogging device was deployed at Dr. Carew’s Blue Shield
      facility for decontamination and protection of Dr. Carew and all
      exposed to patients who were treated there. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Discussion</b><br>
      <br>
      EVD has a progressively explosive downhill course from the time of
      symptom appearance. Typically, death occurs within a week or less
      in the majority of cases. In all our ozone treated cases, symptoms
      did not progress from the start of OT, and symptomatic patients
      were totally free of all symptoms, inclusive of fever, generally
      by day 3 of treatment.<br>
      <br>
      Through December 2014, Sierra Leone lost 11 out of 13 national
      physicians diagnosed with confirmed or probable Ebola.&nbsp; Both
      survivors received OT and quickly recovered. Following
      Rowen-Robins’ mission, one senior physician was offered and
      refused OT. He received convalescent serum and was transferred to
      the USA and died only 2 days later. Another senior physician
      likewise refused OT opting for ZMapp. He died while it was
      thawing. (Source: public news wires). A third EBV positive
      physician, Hastings trained, requested OT. Authorities refused and
      quarantined him. He died within 3 days.<br>
      <br>
      Both senior authors had expected rapid recovery with OT, but
      admittedly not this fast (within a few days and with limited
      treatments). Rapid recovery was expected because of the violent
      nature of EVD, and the known direct countering biological
      benefits/effects of OT. This merits further discussion.<br>
      <br>
      Ebola induced pathology includes rapid cellular entry, an
      explosion of viral particles into circulation, and rapid cellular
      re-entry perpetuating the cycle viciously. Then the repressed
      immune system “awakens” and pulls out all its weapons to do
      battle. But unfortunately, that battle results in a cytokine
      storm, wherein the immune system does more damage to the vascular
      system and tissues than does the virus. Death occurs due to
      capillary leaks, hemorrhage and organ failure.<br>
      <br>
      Circulatory compromise – The final common denominator in any
      vascular insult is oxygen deprivation and resultant cellular
      injury and death. OT is known to improve rheological properties of
      blood, increase 2,3 DGP, shifting the oxyhemoglobin curve to the
      right and releasing more oxygen in tissues. Bocci, Menendez, and
      others have well demonstrated that OT enhances oxygen delivery and
      utilization. Ozone itself is oxygen. Clearly, in advanced EVD with
      vascular damage, tissues are starved of oxygen and energy
      production. Any oxygen delivery enhancement could potentially
      salvage cells that might otherwise die. Viral entry – The need for
      reduced sulfhydryl groups to enter cells, may be the Achilles heel
      for reversing the lethality of EVD (and other viruses). Sulfhydryl
      groups are key to activity of many cellular enzymes; aerobic cells
      may control enzyme activity by redox, providing means to
      activate/inactivate these enzymes. It appears from our cases EBV
      has a very narrow redox window, and that its envelope
      glycoproteins must be reduced as literature suggests. The
      symptomatic patients began a recovery essentially with the first
      oxidation (ozone) treatment. The senior authors did expect
      recovery, but within 5-7 days, considering the natural course of
      EVD. These symptomatic cases improved with the very first
      treatment. An oxidant stress to the blood stream carrying newly
      emerging viruses may be capable of oxidizing and inactivating
      sulfhydryl entry mechanisms. Such inactivated viruses will be
      incapable of entering the cell for further replication, while able
      to encourage healthy immune responses. Gonzales et. al., (2014)
      reported on a case of another vicious virus now likely endemic in
      the USA. A man (54) developed high fever and severe arthralgia
      among other symptoms. He was positive for Chikungunya virus. After
      receiving two intravenous infusions of vitamin C, 100 grams each,
      he immediately began recovery and was clear of symptoms in two
      days.&nbsp; A second paper reported combined ascorbate and
      intravenous hydrogen peroxide on symptomatic cases of Chikungunya
      virus observing fast symptomatic relief (Marcial-Vega, et. al.,
      2015).&nbsp; This parallels our observations with ozone.
      Importantly, ascorbate in these doses has been found to undergo a
      newly discovered metabolism. The lab of Mark Levine at the
      National Cancer Institute research reported a heretofore-unknown
      effect of high levels of plasma ascorbate. “Pharmacologic
      ascorbate can act as a pro-drug for H2O2 formation, which can lead
      to extracellular fluid [accumulation of H2O2]” (Chen, et. al.,
      2005). Bocci, et. al., (1998)&nbsp; theorized that the key
      mediator in ozone’s beneficial effects is H2O2. Oxidation therapy
      was reported as far back as 1920 to dramatically cut the mortality
      rate of influenza pneumonia in the great epidemic of that time.
      British physician Oliver (1920), in India, took only hopeless
      cases and nearly halved the death rate with intravenous H2O2
      therapy. In the 1940’s, ozone’s sister therapy, ultraviolet blood
      irradiation therapy, was used to rapidly resolve viral influenza
      (Miley, 1942) and polio (Miley and Christensen, 1944). We have
      nothing, even in today’s modern world, which compares.<br>
      <br>
      Cytokine storm - Ebola induces a cytokine storm. OT has been shown
      to significantly modulate TNF-alpha and inflammatory cytokines.
      Bocci has investigated and reported ozone as a cytokine inducer
      (Bocci, et. al., 1993). Bocci (personal communication to Rowen)
      called ozone the “ideal cytokine inducer”, inclusive of
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. EVD instigates pathologically high
      levels of NO. Ozone modulates NO (Bocci, et. al., 2007).<br>
      <br>
      The actual extraordinary rapid recovery of the treated patients
      suggests that all three mechanisms may be at play, particularly
      viral inactivation. Ozone easily oxidizes SH groups to S-S groups,
      which, according to literature, is expected to inactivate viral
      entry. Ozonides, reactive oxygen species generated by OT such as
      peroxide species, would also easily oxidize reduced sulfhydryl
      groups based on simple chemistry. Our experience suggests that EVD
      has an extremely narrow redox window of infectivity. Even ozone
      exposures (rectal and water), far less powerful than DIV, appear
      to have assisted in dispatching symptoms and aiding recovery. We
      believe that the temporary oxidant stress to EVD patients oxidizes
      viral surface glycoproteins. The virus particles are unable to
      recover since they lack means to self-repair damage to their
      glycoprotein spikes. Also, the temporary oxidative stress created
      by ozone treatment stimulates the immune system to respond in more
      favorable conditions to the Ebola virus.<br>
      <br>
      Additional damage to viral infectivity could be inflicted on the
      lipid envelope. The virus incorporates lipids from our own cell
      membranes. Infectivity is dependent upon a functional lipid
      membrane. Agents that attack the lipid envelope may be useful as
      antiviral drugs (Lorizate, 2011). Ozone directly attacks
      unsaturated fatty acids, which would be expected to be part of the
      Ebola lipid envelope. Aerobic cells repair such alterations.
      Viruses cannot. Lorizate lamented that compounds which could
      attack viral lipids lack specificity and are “thus unacceptably
      toxic.” OT, in use for decades, has no reported toxicity and may
      serve as an ideal lipid altering anti-viral agent.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;Statistical probability: With Hastings center’s survival
      rate of only 40%, the statistical probability of 100% recovery
      arising from mere chance is 0.4(4), or 0.026%. Furthermore, lack
      of disease progression upon therapy commencement greatly magnifies
      the significance. <br>
      <br>
      Ethics: International agencies, inclusive of the WHO (2014),
      called for the use of any reasonable treatment in the fight
      against Ebola. (“…the panel reached consensus that it is ethical
      to offer unproven interventions with as yet unknown efficacy and
      adverse effects, as potential treatment or prevention.”)
      Considering the high mortality of EVD, we then believe it
      unethical to withhold a known, decades old, safe therapy from EVD
      patients, which has a 60% probability of death, to do a double
      blind study, or to deny OT for prophylaxis. Effectiveness will be
      self-evident.<br>
      <br>
      Cost: The ozone cost of treatment per patient was less than 10 USD
      excluding cost of ozone generator. Medical waste was limited to
      one 27 gauge “butterfly” needle per treatment (0.75 USD) and one
      syringe (reusable as ozone sterilizes the syringe as it fills each
      time) for each patient. Beyond modest cost of a reliable generator
      (1700 USD or less), the cost of DIV ozone will largely rest in
      labor costs.<br>
      <br>
      Safety: The world literature is devoid of medical ozone toxicity
      reports when administered within the guidelines of the Robins DIV
      method or the more common method of major autohemotherapy. In the
      latter, between 50-200 cc of blood is removed, treated with ozone,
      and returned to the patient. During training, we treated several
      score Sierra Leoneans with DIV ozone without any toxicity except
      rare vein irritation. Both senior authors have performed thousands
      of ozone treatments with negligible untoward effects. Both have
      observed repeatedly rapid resolutions of both viral and bacterial
      infections in hours to days.<br>
      <br>
      Availability: OT is not patentable; therefore it will fail to
      generate a profit for any developer or promoter. Hence, OT, though
      widely practiced, is not industry or mainstream promoted, and
      remains relatively unknown. This was a major reason Rowen and
      Robins chose to travel at their own risk and cost. By achieving
      success for the most dread virus on the planet, OT might attain
      its rightful place in healing and saving lives, regardless of lack
      of profit potential and industry glamour.<br>
      <br>
      Weaknesses of this report: We acknowledge that these cases were
      treated early (soon after symptoms developed). None were
      critically ill. Ozone benefits on late stage EVD remain unknown.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Conclusion </b><br>
      <br>
      Ozone therapy, a modality not well known or understood by
      conventional Western medicine, has performed as a safe and ideal
      therapy for EVD in all infected patients receiving it. EVD
      symptoms cleared within 2-4 days in all (four) symptomatic cases
      involving front-line health workers. No symptoms developed in a
      fifth extremely high-risk person. In contrast, two leading Sierra
      Leone physicians who contracted EVD and refused treatment both
      died, and one who requested, but was denied ozone treatment, also
      died, within weeks after our visit. DIV ozone is inexpensive, safe
      and leaves virtually no contamination. International organizations
      and governments would do well to immediately conduct a formal
      trial of this unique therapy for EVD, which could provide
      significant security, both for EVD prevention and treatment, and
      for dangerous font-line work. <br>

            Therapy</b></font><b><br>
          January 04, 2015&nbsp; </b><br>
        <br>
        <b>By Dr. Mercola</b><br>
      </div>
      <b><br>
      </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most tweeted term in 2014 was "Ebola,"
      a highly infectious and lethal disease that's been rapidly
      spreading in West Africa.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In October, I interviewed Dr. Robert Rowen, a
      leading expert on oxidative therapy, about an inexpensive and very
      safe treatment for this devastating disease.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, he'd received an invitation by the
      President of Sierra Leone to bring his team there to teach health
      care workers how to treat Ebola using ozone.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ozone is extraordinary in terms of its
      anti-infective and antiviral action, and it has virtually no
      toxicity, making it a prime candidate for both prevention and
      treatment of all sorts of infections and viral afflictions.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With bacteria, ozone works by puncturing the
      membrane of the bacteria, causing it to spill its contents and
      die. It also inactivates viruses, and does so 10 times faster than
      chlorine. This is in part why Dr. Rowen is convinced it can be a
      lifesaving treatment for Ebola patients.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ozone is perhaps the most powerful natural
      oxidant in the world. It also has the advantage of stimulating the
      immune system, and modulating it—either up or down depending on
      what your system requires. In this follow-up interview, Dr. Rowen
      tells the story of what actually happened in Sierra Leone.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Dr. Howard Robins and
      I traveled to Sierra Leone around the third week of October, and
      it was supported generously by donations from people who just came
      out of the blue, to donate money for materials.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The materials we had
      were syringes, needles, and butterfly needles. Longevity Resources
      Inc. from Canada donated 10 ozone machines. Royal Air Maroc got 37
      boxes of cargo on our own plane; very kind of them to do that," he
      says.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, although not unexpectedly, the
      use of this incredibly inexpensive therapy was undermined from the
      very start...<br>
      <br>
      <b>Teaching Health Care Workers in Sierra Leo</b>ne<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once in Sierra Leone, Drs. Rowen and Robins
      were housed and looked after by Dr. Kojo Carew — a national hero
      during their blood diamonds era. The very first day, they were
      taken to a large meeting hall with about 100 or more people who
      were there to hear them speak.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The audience included some "extraordinarily
      skeptical doctors," he notes, but by the time the lecture was
      over, most were willing to give ozone treatment a fair try.
      Conspicuously absent, however, was the Ministry of Health.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next several days, Drs. Robins and
      Rowen trained many health care workers on how to administer Direct
      Intravenous Ozone Gas administration (DIV), and the Rowen-Robins
      protocol for Ebola, which involves a combination of supplements
      and timing of administration of DIV.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They also met with the President of Sierra
      Leone, who asked them to administer the treatment on him as well.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really admire him
      for that because here, he was putting himself in front of all of
      his people saying, 'I'm willing to do this.' And he did it. There
      was no problem," Dr. Rowen says.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Minister of Health Pulls the Plug on Ozone Treatment...</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually, after many meetings, they finally
      met with Paolo Conte, the defense minister of Sierra Leone and
      newly appointed Ebola czar.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "After we told him the
      story, he had one question for us, 'Why isn't this being done
      already?' We laughed and said, 'We think you need to ask your
      other ministers why it hasn't been done.'<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We thought we had
      clearance now from their top brass. And the next day, we went to
      Hastings [the Sierra Leone government's Ebola treatment center]
      and started training all of their staff how to do [ozone
      therapy]...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the middle of
      training, a call comes in from the assistant minister of health,
      telling the military Major in charge of the facility, 'If you
      value your job, there will be no ozone at Hastings...'<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shortly after that, a
      call came in from the minister of health himself, reaffirming [the
      order]. I'm a fairly calm person under most situations. I'm slow
      to anger, but I exploded. In full view of everybody there, their
      whole staff; I just came unglued.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went to the Major and
      said, 'As far as I'm concerned, this is an illegal order. I told
      the entire staff, 'You're all at risk; some of you are going to
      die, [and] you're the President's top priority.'"<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why Is Sierra Leone Refusing Ozone Treatment for Dying
        Patients?</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a result, none of the infected Ebola
      patients were permitted to receive ozone therapy. However, they
      were allowed to continue training the staff, most of whom actually
      lined up to receive the treatment themselves, knowing the
      opportunity might vanish at any moment.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One might wonder just what kind of influences
      catalyzed the Minster of Health to override a direct request by
      the President... At present, there's no answer to that question.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it's certainly interesting that they
      permitted the experimental drug ZMapp to be used on patients.
      They're also going to allow the use of Amiodarone—a highly toxic
      drug that, according to Dr. Rowen has been proven ineffective.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet to the date of this latest interview, they
      have refused ozone therapy, which is incredibly
      inexpensive—basically just the cost of a syringe—and has a long
      track record of safe and effective use against a wide variety of
      infectious and debilitating diseases. It makes no sense at all,
      unless Ebola is being viewed as a center for massive profit...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's also interesting to note that, after
      appearing on the TV program National Encounter (which is similar
      to the American show 60 Minutes), where Dr. Rowen faced off
      against three government officials, the Sierra Leone Foreign
      Minister asked to have his entire family prophylactically treated
      with ozone therapy. Dr. Rowen declined to give his nod to use
      materials he and Dr. Robins brought.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The supplies that were
      donated were donated for Ebola victims, period. End of story. They
      weren't to be used for prophylactic treatment for government
      ministers," Dr. Rowen says. "If we can't get to the Ebola patients
      ourselves, I wasn't going to authorize release of materials
      donated in trust to Dr. Robins and me..."<br>
      <br>
      <b>Two Doctors Recover from Ebola—Was it Due to Ozone Therapy?</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the doctors trained in the use of ozone
      therapy at Hastings named Dr. Kanneh, accidentally stuck himself
      with an Ebola infected needle, and developed typical Ebola
      symptoms within three days, as expected. Understandably, he was
      scared to death to get tested, because he knew if he tested
      positive, he would not be allowed to receive ozone treatment. He
      did take ozone, as per Rowen-Robins protocol, and was symptom-free
      within 48 hours.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First of all, if
      you're suspected of having Ebola, you're thrown into a room with
      every other person who's suspected. And if you didn't have Ebola
      beforehand, you're probably going to have Ebola afterwards," Dr.
      Rowen notes.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you do test
      positive for Ebola, you're picked up forcibly in a paddy wagon and
      you're carted off to the 'treatment center.' Treatment center?
      Well, I'm finding out now that the people aren't really fed. If
      their families don't feed them, they don't get fed. At best,
      you're going to get IV fluids...<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They have a 60 percent
      probability of dying. And in the case of doctors... 100 percent of
      Sierra Leonean doctors who have gotten Ebola have died, with the
      exception of two. The first one is Dr. Kanneh. Now, we cannot
      prove that he had Ebola because he wasn't tested. I certainly now
      understand why he didn't get tested; he knew he would be carted
      off and left to die..."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second survivor is Dr. Komba Songu Mbriwa,
      who did test positive for the virus. Somehow he was offered, and
      accepted, ozone therapy, which was administered by Dr. Kanneh.
      Four days later, the government announced Dr. Mbriwa was free of
      Ebola... It's still unclear what or who allowed Dr. Mbriwa to
      receive the treatment, while it was withheld from so many
      others—including other infected doctors.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not really sure
      how it got there or if they looked the other way because he was a
      military physician," Dr. Rowen says. "But even though he was
      treated with ozone, the government didn't acknowledge it publicly.
      In fact, while they publicly said, 'We now have the Sierra Leonean
      physician who's survived Ebola,' they didn't tell the world that
      he got ozone.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government itself,
      apparently, took the credit for it. Now, I said 'apparently'
      because I don't know everything that happened there. All I know
      is, there's been no mention that the man received ozone at all,
      and we know he did receive it, and we know that he's the only
      confirmed physician case of a Sierra Leone doctor to have made
      [survived] it."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ... [Another] doctor we
      trained at Hastings, whom I met, also got Ebola... He asked for
      ozone; he begged for ozone, and was refused. He was transferred
      from Hastings, where it could've been accessible, to another
      center where it wasn't accessible, and then he got renal failure,
      and he was transferred again for dialysis, and died. This is a man
      that I met and that I had hands-on training with, and my heart is
      broken because he was refused ozone after he asked for it."<br>
      <b><br>
      </b><b>Who is Making Ebola Decisions in Sierra Leone and Why?</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Rowen is deeply concerned about what's
      happening in Sierra Leone, as well as other areas affected by
      Ebola. According to contacts on the ground, it appears the lives
      of those in Sierra Leone mean little to nothing—unless, that is,
      they survive Ebola. Then, they can get paid for their blood, which
      is given to the rich who get infected. Perhaps that is why those
      running these "killing fields" may not care about ozone therapy,
      he suggests. And, if that can happen in Sierra Leone, it can
      certainly happen in the US as well.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I met [the Sierra
      Leone] Ebola 'czar' [Paloh Conteh]. He seemed responsible and
      powerful and sent us forward to accomplish our mission to cure the
      malady... I cannot understand how his directive was undermined. I
      cannot understand how the government [Health Ministry of Sierra
      Leone] can stand by when doctors and nurses continue to die. I
      will wonder all my life about this experience," Dr. Rowen notes.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In writings and over the phone, Dr. Rowen
      received the following information from a contact in Sierra Leone,
      whose identity is kept anonymous for safety reasons:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need to tell you
      what is going on here that is inhumane and bypassing the will of
      the people. If WHO says someone in your household gets Ebola and
      tests positive, everyone in that home including domestic help,
      cooks and drivers, are confined to that home or village with an
      ARMED GUARD out front. Well off families can have food brought.
      Poor families cannot afford it - no food, no water, no sanitation;
      in some cases they just die of starvation or dehydration before
      Ebola gets them. Even if they ask for [ozone] therapy by informed
      consent document, here is how they [SL government] can deny
      treatment without saying they are denying ozone:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The Home or village now is a 'red' zone. Only authorized personnel
      are allowed in or out and the Ministry of Health puppets of WHO
      and CDC proclaim this a 'red zone' so anything allowed in,
      including doctors, are now quarantined along with the home. So,
      they cannot be treated at home, and they cannot leave to be
      treated. This effectively keeps them from receiving medical help!
      Do you get this demonic plan!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      They are not immediately tested for Ebola. If they have illness...
      they are to call 117 and the Ambulance, with sirens blaring
      bringing fear to all around the house, will take them to another
      quarantine holding center where, if they didn't have Ebola before
      they went there, they will have it after they get there!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Once in the quarantining center they must wait to show strong
      signs of Ebola before a test is ordered, wasting more time. Once a
      30 minute test is ordered it takes 1 - 3 days to get results
      because of back volume.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Once the test comes back positive, you are 2- 5 days from death
      when you are taken to the 'treatment center.' You would think you
      would receive treatment, but the average person is lucky to
      receive adequate food and water as the staff are scared to death
      to do anything, and only the rich and famous are guaranteed even
      sustaining care. The WHO approved Convalescent Whole blood be used
      but it is only to give to those of privilege, but under great risk
      in that the blood types are not cross checked adequately, so you
      are more likely to die of mismatched blood than Ebola!<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A follower of this saga (posted on Dr. Rowen’s
      Facebook page @ https://www.facebook.com/DrRobertJRowen ) has
      created a White House petition, urging the Obama administration to
      stop America's testing of viruses in Africa, and to use cost-free
      ozone to combat Ebola. Please take a moment to sign the petition
      now.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Benefits Beyond Ebola</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm convinced that ozone therapy is a highly
      effective and powerful intervention that can be useful for a wide
      variety of health issues, not just Ebola. Other infections that
      have a successful treatment record include Lyme disease,
      rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory bowel disease, just to name
      a few. According to Dr. Rowen, ozone therapy is also very
      beneficial for heart disease, immune diseases, injuries, and
      chronic degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. As an
      example, Dr. Rowen has found that ozone is about 85 percent
      effective in knees and only slightly less effective in hips, when
      given as an injection.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before considering knee or hip surgery it would
      be highly worthwhile to receive ozone treatments to see if that
      resolves the problem. While in Sierra Leone, Dr. Rowen was able to
      treat a number of Sierra Leoneans for other conditions besides
      Ebola. You can view some of these stories on his Youtube channel.1
      I definitely believe it's wise to find a clinician who can
      administer ozone, or if you want to take it to the next step, like
      I did, you can actually purchase a unit yourself. While not a
      miracle cure-all, it's a valuable adjunct to other healthy
      lifestyle changes.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is how I see
      ozone," Dr. Rowen says. "It stimulates your body to do what God
      designed it to do. We're designed to be self-healing mechanisms.
      The bottom line in all healing is oxygen. It also improves blood
      rheology, blood flow, and oxygen delivery from red cells. It
      modulates your immune system so that if you have inflammatory
      valve disease, it brings it down to tolerable. If you're infected
      with Lyme and your immune system is down here, it brings it back
      up to parity."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Influenza is another infection that can be
      successfully treated and/or prevented with ozone therapy. It's
      certainly a far safer and likely more effective alternative to the
      flu vaccine. (As you may have heard, the Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention (CDC) has announced that this year's flu
      vaccine is worthless, as virus strains in circulation do not match
      the ones in the vaccine.) Moreover, there's always the threat of a
      pandemic influenza outbreak, such as the avian flu. According to
      Dr. Rowen:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We have evidence that
      oxidation therapies do help... A 1920 Lancet article by Dr. T.H
      Oliver shows that intravenous hydrogen peroxide cut in half the
      death rate from influenza pneumonia in 1920."<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I communicated with Dr. Rowen on Christmas day.
      Strangely enough, international news has been circulating that
      there has been a mysterious decline in Ebola deaths at the Sierra
      Leone Ebola center at Hastings. The New England Journal of
      Medicine reports:<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “We have observed a
      decreasing case fatality rate among inpatients at Hastings, from
      47.7 percent among the first 151 patients (September 20 to October
      13), to 31.7 percent among the next 126 patients with a final
      disposition (October 14 to November 4), to 23.4 percent among the
      next 304 patients (November 5 to December 7).”2<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dr. Rowen comments: “I sense the presence of
      the Divine in all this, and at Christmas time, amazingly. Notice
      the coincidence of dates. Robins and I were in Sierra Leone the
      third week of October. Dr. Kanneh was trained in ozone and
      survived his own apparent bout with Ebola in mid November. He has
      largely run a one man heroic show at Hastings, secreting in ozone
      water and perhaps ozone for rectal insufflation.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information I have gotten on the ground in
      Sierra Leone in the last few days suggests that no one treated
      with ozone by virtually any method has died. If it holds, we have
      been guided to the medical discovery of the century. The dread,
      deadly and highly infectious Ebola disease may be no more fearsome
      than the Wicked Witch of the West in the Wizard of Oz, who melted
      when accidentally splashed with a bucket of water. The “wicked”
      Ebola virus may simply melt down when “splashed” with ozone, its
      Achilles Heel. Ozone, according to the literature I have, may
      handcuff the molecular fingers Ebola uses to enter host cells,
      which is what drove me to go to Sierra Leone in the first
      place.”&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      <b>More Information</b><br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To learn more about the general use of
      oxidative medicine, which include ozone therapy, ultraviolet blood
      irradiation therapy, and intravenous hydrogen peroxide therapy,
      please see my previous interview with Dr. Rowen. Of the various
      oxidative therapies available, ozone appears to be the best
      overall, as it's the most versatile. It's particularly beneficial
      for blood treatments, infection, and chronic fatigue.<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That said, all oxidative therapies work by
      stimulating your immune system, enhancing mitochondrial processes,
      and facilitating healing with virtually no side effects, and can
      be used either as treatment or prevention. They can also be used
      as a potent anti-aging health strategy for general wellness. I
      also encourage you to look at Dr. Rowen's channel on YouTube,3
      where you can find a number of examples of what oxidative
      therapies can be used for so that you can avail yourself of this
      relatively inexpensive and incredibly safe therapy. To locate a
      clinician who can administer oxidative therapy you can try the

      <br>
      Dr. Robert Rowen is known as “The Father of Medical Freedom” for
      pioneering the nation’s first law protecting alternative medicine,
      and has used ozone therapy to treat a host of different ailments
      since 1986. Dr. Robert was trained at Johns Hopkins University and
      UCSF Medical School, has been board certified and recertified by
      the American Boards of Family Practice and Emergency Medicine, and
      also served on the Alaska State Medical Board and as president of
      the International Oxidative Medicine Association. He is currently
      the Oxidation Workshop Chairman for the American College of the
      Advancement of Medicine, and as one of the foremost experts in the
      use of nature’s natural cleanser, ozone, he has been running
      training courses for medical practitioners in all forms of ozone
      therapy as an oxidation teacher since 1994.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Why you should listen –</b><br>
      <br>
      Dr. Rowen comes on Bulletproof Radio while in quarantine to
      discuss his experience presenting Ozone therapy to medical
      practitioners in West Africa, the benefits and types of ozone
      therapies, the power of oxygenation therapy as a treatment for
      curing and preventing ebola, and how you can find treatments or
      even set up ozone therapy in the comfort of your own home. Listen
      to this podcast to hear about some ozone therapy I did myself as
      well – it was really effective combatiing toxic mold
      exposure.&nbsp; I used it for about 18 months every night at home
      and it successfully reversed the problem.&nbsp; (And you wouldn’t
      believe where I put it…) <br>
