<p><b>1.&nbsp;</b> Thow that thys Boke beginneth to rede,
<br>Keepe well thys Councell the better schalt thow spede:
<br>Be thow in a place secret by thyself alone,
<br>That noe man see or here what thow schalt say or done.
<p><b>2.&nbsp;</b> Yet ere thow begyn to rede much, take thow good hede,
<br>Wyth whom thow kepest company I councell thee indede;
<br>Trust not thy freind too much, wherefore thow goe,
<br>For he that thow trustest best sometyme may be thye Foe.
<p><b>3.&nbsp;</b> And take hede to the words of the Fader of Wysdom,
<br>How he techeth hys Sonne how he schould done;
<br>To kepe hys precepts of bodely governance
<br>And wyth hys Conyng he will gretly advance.
<p><b>4.&nbsp;</b> And yf thow wylt not to hys wordys take hede,
<br>Thow schalt stand here oft in gret feare and dread.
<br>For he that hath a fore wytt he nedes not do amysse,
<br>And he that doth Folly the Folly schalbe hys.
<p><b>5.&nbsp;</b> Now my dere Sonne be thow not a know
<br>To Lerned nor to Leud, to Hygh nor to Low:
<br>Neyther to Young nor Old, Rych nor Poore,
<br>Unto them thow tech nothyng my Lore.
<p><b>6.&nbsp;</b> Also to scuche men that hold themselves wise,
<br>And so forth to the foolys that glyde on the Ice:
<br>They weene in grete Bokes schould be the Art
<br>Of the Science of Alchemy, but they be not worth a fart.
<p><b>7.&nbsp;</b> Therefor my Sonn to thee thys Science I may well teach,
<br>And yf thow wylt upon thy enemy be wreach;
<br>Or to purchase or build any good thyng,
<br>It schalbe to thy gret furtheryng.
<p><b>8.&nbsp;</b> Thys worthy Science of Alchemy if thow wylt it leare,
<br>A lyttle mony out of thy purse thow must forbeare;
<br>To buy therewyth Flos Florum it is most worthiest,
<br>And to build well her Cabyn and her Nest.
<p><b>9.&nbsp; </b>And if thow put out mony for any other thing.
<br>It is to thy losse; and to thy great hindring:
<br>Except yt be for thy workes naturall Foode.
<br>Which is had out of Stone, Ayre and Wood.
<p><b>10.&nbsp;</b> And if thow have all thyngs wythin the growing,
<br>Then thow needest not to to buy any manner of thing,
<br>That schould be to thys Science belonging,
<br>But beware of thy selfe for feare of hanging.
<p><b>11.&nbsp;</b> For then thow and thys Scyence were for ever lost,
<br>If thow make thereof any manner of boast,
<br>To any Man or Woman, Old or Young,
<br>Beware of thy selfe for feare of discovering.
<p><b>12.&nbsp;</b> For if thow make any man privie
<br>Of thy Councell, Rich or Needy,
<br>Thow must so beware Sleeping or Waking,
<br>For once ymagining of Money making.
<p><b>13.&nbsp;</b> For yf God sends thee grace and understanding
<br>Wyth thys Scyence thow mayst have good lyving:
<br>But beware of speach of Women liberall,
<br>And of the voice and fight of Children generall.
<p><b>14.&nbsp;</b> Sonn in thyne owne howse thow maist well gett
<br>A good Morsell of meat they mouth to sweet,
<br>Both Pheasant, Partridge, Plover and Leveret,
<br>Though thow cry yt not owte in the common Market.
<p><b>15.&nbsp;</b> Therefore kepe close of thy Tongue and of thy Hand,
<br>From the Officers and Governours of the Land;
<br>And from other men that they of thy Craft nothing know,
<br>For in wytnes thereof they wyll thee hang and draw.
<p><b>16.&nbsp;</b> And thereof the People will the at Sessions indight,
<br>And great Treason against the they wyll write;
<br>Wythowt that the Kings grace be to thee more,
<br>Thow schalt for ever in thys world be forlore.
<p><b>17.&nbsp;</b> Alsoe wythowt thow be sure of another thyng,
<br>To purchase the Lycence of thy King:
<br>For all manner of doubts thee schall betide,
<br>The better thow maiste Work, and both goe and ride.
<p><b>18.&nbsp;</b> Alsoe another thing I schall thee lere,
<br>The poore People take thow nothing deare,
<br>But ever serve thy God alway at the begynnyng,
<br>And among the poore People the better schalbe thy living.
<p><b>19.&nbsp;</b> Now my Chylde to my precepts looke thow take hede,
<br>Whatsoever fall after the better schall thow spede.
<br>Better it ys to have a thyng, then for it to wish,
<br>For when thow feelst a Sore tis hard for thee to get a Leech.
<p><b>20.&nbsp;</b> Now my deare Son to the I wyll declare,
<br>More of thys Warke which schalbe thy welfaire;
<br>If thow canst consider all my sayings,
<br>For therewyth thow mayest finde a full precious thing.
<p><b>21.&nbsp;</b> And Son though thys Writing be made in Ryme,
<br>Yet take thow thereat noe greate disdaine.
<br>Till thow hast proved my words in deede and in thought,
<br>I watt it well it schalbe set at nought.
<p><b>22.&nbsp;</b> Therefor of all Bodyes and Spyrits more or lesse,
<br>Mercury is called Flos Florum and worthiest Pryncesse:
<br>For her Birth and marvelous dealing,
<br>Sche ys most worthiest to have byne King.
<p><b>23.&nbsp;</b> For sche ys Erth and Water most heviest,
<br>And sche will conjoyne wyth Fire and Aire most lyghtest;
<br>And so forth wyth her love sche will run and flee,
<br>For sche delighteth noe other game or glee.
<p><b>24.&nbsp;</b> Some say that of Sulphur and Mercury all Bodyes minerall
are made,
<br>Ingendered in the Erth with divers Colours cladd:
<br>By the vertue of Decoccion before Preperacion,
<br>To the lykenes of every body Mynerall in ther fashion.
<p><b>25.&nbsp;</b> I will first begin wyth Saturne after other mens sayings,
<br>How he ys ingendered in the Erth wyth unclene Mercury flying:
<br>And of Mercury he ys most heviest wyth black Sulphury Erth mixed,
<br>Save he ys soft of fusion, and hys Sulphur nothing fixed.
<p><b>26.&nbsp;</b> Jupiter is a whyte Body made pure Mercury outward,
<br>And of clere Sulphur somewhat Erthly and white inward;
<br>He ys kynde softest and well in his fixation,
<br>For he is almost fixt, but he lacketh Decoction.
<p><b>27.&nbsp;</b> Mars ys a white Body most of unclean Mercury in the
Erth y'made,
<br>And he ys hardest of fusion with Sulphur Erthly cladd;
<br>To blackness and rednes he will soonest consume,
<br>By heate or by corrosive when the Spirit beginneth to fume.
<p><b>28.&nbsp;</b> Sol is the purest from what red &amp; is made of clene
Mercury &amp; Sulphur fixed,
<br>Ingendered with clere red Sulphur, in the Erth well mixed,
<br>And therefore he ys without defalt and lacketh no degree;
<br>For he ys almost hardest of Fusion and heviest in ponderossity.
<p><b>29.&nbsp;</b> Venus ys a Body more red of pure Mercury made in hys
substance,
<br>Most of red Sulphur and greene and therein is great variance:
<br>In the Erth ingendered with Corrosive and bitter substance,
<br>Well fixed and hard of fusion, rude in governance.
<p><b>30.&nbsp;</b> Mercury ys a Body if he be with a Substance moved,
<br>Mixing one kinde with his kinde, so schall he be loved;
<br>On Spirit received wyth another, the which of them be maine,
<br>Is casue of ingeneration of every body Mettalyne.
<p><b>31.&nbsp;</b> Luna ys a pure white Body of clene Mercury &amp; Sulphur
white ingendered
<br>And sche is a litle hard of fusion &amp; almost well fixed
<br>And sche is next cleanest in Tincture of whitenes,
<br>Of Ponderosity light, of Jupiter bearing his whitenes.
<p><b>32.&nbsp;</b> And soe after the Colour of that Erth ys Sulphuri and
receptuall,
<br>Some men do say ys engendered every Metall;
<br>But my Son the perfect worke of thys alteration,
<br>I schall informe the true way of another fashion.
<p><b>33.&nbsp;</b> Now have I declared the working of the Bodies Mynerall,
<br>Whereof they be ingendered after other mens sayings over all;
<br>And as in place of the Erth one Body was fully wrought,
<br>Soe must the artificiall Medicine, be or else it ys nought.
<p><b>34.&nbsp;</b> Now will I declare the worthiness of Mercury in speciall,
<br>How sche ys the notalest Spirit that ys mynerall,
<br>Most marvelous in working and in degree,
<br>Sche is called the Matter principallest of the three.
<p><b>35.&nbsp;</b> Also sche ys very subtile in many things artificiall,
<br>Sche will both give and take Tincture most speciall,
<br>To hym or of hym that sche loveth most best,
<br>In speciall when sche ys warmed in her Nest.
<p><b>36.&nbsp;</b> My Son Mercury ys called the mightiest Flos florum,
<br>And most royall, and richest of all the Singulorum;
<br>Sche ys very Patron and Princes most royall,
<br>And sche ys very Mother of every Mettall.
<p><b>37.&nbsp;</b> Sche ys Vegitable, Animalle and Minerall,
<br>Sche ys Foure in kinde, and One in generall:
<br>Sche is Erth, Aire, Water and Fyre,
<br>Among all other sche hath no Peere.
<p><b>38.&nbsp;</b> Sche kylleth and slayeth, and also doth calcine,
<br>Sche dyeth, and also doth sche live againe;
<br>Sche giveth lyfe and also ingression,
<br>For joyntly sche ys three in one.
<p><b>39.&nbsp;</b> Sche ys a very frendly mixar,
<br>The progeneration of a greate Elixar:
<br>Sche ys both Body Soule and Spirite,
<br>In Colour very red, black and white.
<p><b>40.&nbsp;</b> Many be the wooers that hang on her tayle,
<br>But sche will not with them I'deale;
<br>They would her wedd against her will,
<br>With foemen that liken her full ill.
<p><b>41.&nbsp;</b> Sche will deale with no manner of wight,
<br>But with her Husbande as it ys greate right:
<br>With him sche will bear much fruit,
<br>For he ys by her nature of her selfe same sute.
<p><b>42.&nbsp;</b> My Son of hem Fooles have much dispight,
<br>And therein such Fooles loose their light:
<br>For sometymes he ys darke, and sometymes bright,
<br>For he ys lyke no other wight.
<p><b>43.&nbsp;</b> For if they have their kynde ingendering,
<br>Their naturall foode and goode keeping,
<br>They schall increase fruit by dede,
<br>Very red and white, King and Queene.
<p><b>44.&nbsp;</b> My Son in thys Scyence I doe deny,
<br>All things that be discording truly,
<br>All manner of Salts I doe defie,
<br>And all manner of Sulphurs in waters of Corrosie.
<p><b>45.&nbsp;</b> Also Alloome, Vitrial, <b>Auripigmentum</b> and Haire,
<br>Gold, Silver, Alkaly and Sandiver;
<br>Honey, Wax, and Oyles or Calx else,
<br>Gumms, Galls, and also Egg shells.
<p><b>46.&nbsp;</b> Also I defie Antimony, Berrall, and Christall,
<br>Rosinm Pitch, also Amber, Jett and Corrall;
<br>Hearbs, Dated Stones, Marble, or Tinglas,
<br>If there come any of all these it ys the worse.
<p><b>47.&nbsp;</b> Also Berrills, Gotts Hornes, and Alome plome,
<br>Good with them will none be done;
<br>All things that discordeth from Mettall,
<br>It ys contrary to thy worke in generall.
<p><b>48.&nbsp;</b> My Son many fooles to me have sought,
<br>Good with them and I accord right nought;
<br>I leave them there as I them finde,
<br>And as Fooles I make them blinde.
<p><b>49.&nbsp;</b> For whych Mercury they have errd full sore
<br>And then when they had they could doe no more,
<br>Therefore in Phylosophers sche bear'th the floower,
<br>For sche ys King, Prince, and Emperour.
<p><b>50.&nbsp;</b> Yet my deare Son be thow not a knowne
<br>To Learned, nor to Lewde, to High, nor to Low;
<br>That thys worke standeth by Mercury and in her fire,
<br>Her owne speciall Love both life and deare.
<p><b>51.&nbsp;</b> For he yse her Son, sche ys hys Fright,
<br>In whome sche worketh all her myght:
<br>He ys her Son, sche ys hys Mother,
<br>Sche loveth him peramore and no other.
<p><b>52.&nbsp;</b> In Sol, and Lune, in her meeting ys all love,
<br>For our Mercury only ys all her behove,
<br>And with them sche worketh all her might,
<br>But they may never increase on fright.
<p><b>53.&nbsp;</b> Therefor it ys possible to cast a Projection pure,
<br>Upon a Million to make a perfect Body of tincture:
<br>Wyth Medicine of Spirits well joyned and fixed,
<br>It schall not be perceived where it ys well mixed.
<p><b>54.&nbsp;</b> And therefor if there com Silver or Gold in at thy
Gate,
<br>The which men use in coyne or in common Plate;
<br>I sweare by God that all thys world hath wrought,
<br>All thy labour and warke schall turne to nought.
<p><b>55.&nbsp;</b> For with what Mettall soever that Mercury be joyned,
<br>Because of her Coldness and Moistnes sche ys acloyd:
<br>Put them never so close togeder sche will fume anon,
<br>And when they come into the fire sche wil sone be gone.
<p><b>56.&nbsp;</b> Therefore Mercury hath a Lover that passeth them
<br>A thousandfold, who so will him ken
<br>And he ys her Lover and her Leman sweete,
<br>And so hys Councell sche will keepe.
<p><b>57.&nbsp;</b> Both in hys Chamber and also in hys Bedd,
<br>Also alive and when they byne dead;
<br>Seeke yee forth fooles as ye have sought,
<br>For in all other things finde yee right nought.
<p><b>58.&nbsp;</b> As I said in the 32. Chapter unto my Conclusion,
<br>How I schould informe the truth after another fashion,
<br>And to perform thys Scyence both in word and deede,
<br>In making of our Medicine God must us speede.
<p><b>60.&nbsp;</b> The which ys called the greate Elixer,
<br>And ys verily made with a stronge mixar;
<br>The which is a Stone very Minerall,
<br>And thow maist him well gett ever all.
<p><b>61.&nbsp;</b> My Son thow schalt take to Mercury no other thing,
<br>But Erth that's heavy and hard and stiff standing:
<br>The which in himselfe ys derke bright dry and cold,
<br>To joyne them togeder thow maist be full bold.
<p><b>62.&nbsp;</b> One of them to 10 parts of that Water running most
heaviest
<br>And they schalbe both one, and to thy warke most mightiest:
<br>Then hast thow Man and Woman togeder brought,
<br>The which ys done by greate love in a thought.
<p><b>63.&nbsp;</b> The which two be both Spirits, &amp; one Body most
heaviest,
<br>When they be in your Chamber and bed joyned in the Element lightest,
<br>The which ys more bigger, and bigger hott and dry,
<br>And therein they will both kiss togeder &amp; neither weepe nor cry.
<p><b>64.&nbsp;</b> For when Erth and Water ys well mixed,
<br>By the vertue of the lightest Element well hardend and fixed:
<br>For before that time they be Water running both,
<br>And then schall turne to fix body be they never so loath.
<p><b>65.&nbsp;</b> For theyr bed they schall make a perpetuall Conjunction,
<br>After the feeding of the light Element and of their proportion;
<br>Soe schould they be decoct, having the parfeit fixascion,
<br>In the likenes of a body on fusion having hys fashion.
<p><b>66.&nbsp;</b> But as the first in their Bed they may indure no greate
heate,
<br>Soe as they may well labour in their Bed for sweate:
<br>Att the first if there be in their Chamber overmuch red Colour,
<br>Hastily going thereto will cause greate Dolour.
<p><b>67.&nbsp;</b> For in their first Nest they schould be both water
running,
<br>And because of heate they schould be ever drying.
<br>And so therein become a subtill dry Substance,
<br>The which warke schall thee greately avaunce.
<p><b>68.&nbsp;</b> Therefor their Nest must be made of a strong kinde,
<br>Of the most hardest and cleerest Body, that they not out winde;
<br>For if it so be that their Chamber or Nest begin to break,
<br>Anon out thereof they will begin to Creake.
<p><b>69.&nbsp;</b> And then ys all thy warke and thy greate labour lost,
<br>Then thou maist begin againe upon a new cost,
<br>And so thow mayest not be negligent and hasty, but out of the bed be
sure,
<br>Without it be hard stuff and clere it will not indure.
<p><b>70.&nbsp;</b> And if thow wil at the first hand give suddaine heate,
<br>It will unto thy Warke be nothing meete;
<br>And if thow let him have any suddaine greate Cold,
<br>All thys schall breke thy warke, then art thow to bold.
<p><b>71.&nbsp;</b> Let their Nest be somewhat large with a broade roufe,
<br>And therein they schall abide if it be strong and close above;
<br>And in proportion put thereto nothing more nor lesse,
<br>But as ys sayd before if thow doe yt ys the worse.
<p><b>72.&nbsp;</b> Also from the beds head there must rise a highe Spoute,
<br>And another almost downe to the bottome that the Spirit go not out;
<br>For thou must save the flyers that swim into the upper place,
<br>For they may hereafter ingender a body as well as the other in space.
<p><b>73.&nbsp;</b> Also be sure that thow put in their Bed no other thing,
<br>Then thereof thow schalt have no greate winnyng,
<br>If thow do thys it schall be to thee for the best
<br>To keepe them close from flying and warme in their Nest.
<p><b>74.&nbsp;</b> First with soft fyre her Nest must be warmed,
<br>With a litle bigger Fyre with overmuch they schalbe harmed,
<br>Under thy Chamber flowre measure thy Fyre with tyme,
<br>Then commeth the reward, Gold and Silver fine.
<p><b>75.&nbsp;</b> After the quantity space and tyme must be had,
<br>For to deale todether they be in their dealing glad.
<br>And how long space and tyme I cannot well say,
<br>That they in their Chamber and Nest wilbe in sport and play.
<p><b>76.&nbsp;</b> Behold the uppermost of their Nest what there commeth
out,
<br>The sweting of their Bodys labouring round aboute,
<br>And when they have played and sweate and laboured so sore,
<br>They wilbe still, and neither labour nor sweate any more.
<p><b>77.&nbsp;</b> Then let them coole easily, and draw their breath,
<br>And then there schalbe some above and some beneath:
<br>There thou schalt see a Stone as it were grey pouther,
<br>Which schalbe to thee a ryght greate wonder.
<p><b>78.&nbsp;</b> Then take them out of their Chamber and Bed anon,
<br>And lay them upon a Marble stone and breake them thereon:
<br>And looke what thow hast in of Colour and Ponderostiy,
<br>Put to him as much Flos florum greatest in dignity.
<p><b>79.&nbsp;</b> That ys the same Spirit that thow hadst before,
<br>And so medle them togeder and leare them the same lore;
<br>Altogeder in another Bed and in their Chamber they must be,
<br>For a marvelous warke thereof thow schalt understand and see.
<p><b>80.&nbsp;</b> And thus so oft thow must Multiplie thy Warke,
<br>To ascend and descend into the Aire as doth the Larke;
<br>For when the Larke ys weary above in hys stound,
<br>Anon he falleth right downe to the ground.
<p><b>81.&nbsp;</b> Behold well their Body, and to their head lay thine
Eare,
<br>And harken thow well what wark they make there:
<br>If they begin to sing any manner of voyce,
<br>Give them more heate till thow heare no noyce.
<p><b>82.&nbsp;</b> And thus give them more heate in their Chamber and
Bed also,
<br>Till thou hearest no manner of noyse rumbling to nor fro:
<br>And thus continue in their Bed in their sporting playes,
<br>After the quantity thereof continue so may dayes.
<p><b>83.&nbsp;</b> When their play and wrestling ys all well done,
<br>In their voyce singing and crying and sweating up and downe;
<br>Give their Chamber bigger heate till their Nest be red,
<br>And so bring the downe low and have no feare nor dread.
<p><b>84.&nbsp;</b> For thus with heate they schalbe brought full low,
<br>That they schall in their Bed ne cry nor crow,
<br>But as a Body lye still downe in their Bed,
<br>In their owne liknes as they were bodyes dead.
<p><b>85.&nbsp;</b> Of Grey and White ys all hys cheife Colour,
<br>For then he ys past all hys greate Dolour:
<br>I sweare by Almighty God that all hath wrought,
<br>Thow hast found out that many other Men hath sought.
<p><b>86.&nbsp;</b> Then take thow hym out of hys Chamber and Bed,
<br>And thow schalt then find a fixt Body as he were dead;
<br>Keepe thow hym close and secretly within thy place,
<br>And thank Almightly God of hys grace.
<p><b>87.&nbsp;</b> Now my Son before thys, after thys Science I have right
well sought
<br>And thus to thee I have the White Elixer parfetly wrought;
<br>And if thow wilt of the Red Elixer parfetly understand,
<br>Thow must take such another warke in hand.
<p><b>88.&nbsp;</b> My Son whan thow hast wrought more upon more,
<br>Dubling each time as I said before;
<br>Make thow what thow wilt of Red substance,
<br>As I did the White warke in manner of Governance.
<p><b>89.&nbsp;</b> Then thow must take the Red Stone that ys all ponder,
<br>And lay on a Mable Stone and breake him asunder;
<br>And to medle him with the white Spirit and Water cleere,
<br>And so put him in hys Bed and Chamber in the Fire.
<p><b>90.&nbsp;</b> And so in hys Chamb. &amp; hys Bed, he must all thys
while be
<br>Till thow hast turn'd and brought him to another manner of glee:
<br>Thys Red Elixer if thow wilt open worke heare,
<br>Thys manner of Schoole thow must right well leare.
<p><b>91.&nbsp;</b> Thow must hang him in his Chamber with red Colour,
<br>Till he be fixed and brought from hys great Dolour:
<br>Then of thys worthy warke be not thow agast,
<br>For in the warke all the worst ys past.
<p><b>92.&nbsp;</b> And so in hys fiery Nest and Chamber let him be sure,
<br>For the longer he be in, the better schalbe hys tincture;
<br>Soe that he runn not like blood overcoming hys fusion,
<br>Then hast thow parfectly thys worke in conclusion.
<p><b>93.&nbsp;</b> Thus he must continue in thys greate heate of Firing,
<br>Till he be full fixed that he be not running nor flying:
<br>Then he will give tincture without Number running like wax,
<br>Unto hys like of fusion he will both joyne and mix.
<p><b>94.&nbsp;</b> And yf thy Warke be thus well guided and so forth led
<br>Then hast thow in thy Warke right well and wittily sped:
<br>For if thow do otherwise then I have thee tould,
<br>In the adventure of thy warke thow maist be to bold.
<p><b>95.&nbsp;</b> For if thow warke by good measure and parfect tyme,
<br>Thow schalt have very good Gold and Silver fine;
<br>Than schalt thow be richer in thy self than any King,
<br>Wythowt he labour the Science and have the same thing.
<p><b>96.&nbsp;</b> Now my deare Son I schall teach thee how to cast a
Projection,
<br>Therein lyeth all the greate prafetnes with the Conclusion:
<br>To leade an imparfect Body to hys greate parfectnesse,
<br>In joyning that like to hys like thow standest in no distres.
<p><b>97.&nbsp;</b> For when thow hast joyned the milke to the Bodyes dry,
<br>Than hast thow the White and Red Elixer truly:
<br>The which ys a Marvilous and very precious Stone,
<br>For therein lieth in thys Science all the worke upon.
<p><b>98.&nbsp;</b> In thys Science these Stones be in themselves so precious,
<br>That in their working and nature they be marvelous:
<br>To schew thee the greate vertue furthermore I will declare,
<br>That if thow canst with thys manner of working well fare.
<p><b>99.&nbsp;</b> First thow must take of that Body which ys next Sol
in perfection,
<br>And of his colour toward in ponderosity &amp; proportion:
<br>Being soluble as it were cleere blood running,
<br>In the hot Element yt ys alwayes lightest and fleeting.
<p><b>100.&nbsp;</b> Then take part of the Red Elixer that ys the precious
Stone,
<br>And cast him upon that body that ys blood running anon:
<br>And whan thow hast thus parfectly thys warke wrought,
<br>It schalbe turned into parfect Sol with litle labour or nought.
<p><b>101.&nbsp;</b> On the same wise do for Luna that is in the Colour
so white,
<br>In joyning with that body that is schining and somewhat light;
<br>In the same proportion cast him the very white Stone,
<br>And then ys all thy greatest warke both made and done.
<p><b>102.&nbsp;</b> Than hast thow both the Red warke and the White,
<br>Therefore blessed be that tyme both day and night:
<br>For thys warke that standeth by greate vertue and love,
<br>Thow must thanke Almighty God in heaven above.
<p><b>103.&nbsp;</b> Sonn in the 21 Chapter there write I a full true Rime,
<br>That ys to say unto thys warke thow have no greate disdaine;
<br>Till thow have proved my words in deed and thought,
<br>I know it well thys Science schalbe set at nought.
<p><b>104.&nbsp;</b> My Son to these last precepts looke thow take good
hede,
<br>For better ‘tys to have then to wish for in time of neede:
<br>For who so ys bold in tyme to a Freind to breake,
<br>He that ys thy Freind may be thy Fo and hys emnity wreake.
<p><b>105.&nbsp;</b> And therefor my Son I schall give thee a greate charge,
<br>In uttering of speech be thow not to large;
<br>To tell every man what thow hast in Silver or Gold,
<br>For to have it from thee many men wilbe right bold.
<p><b>106.&nbsp;</b> Also use not to revill or ryott that schould exceede
<br>To thy bodily health, the better schalt thow speede;
<br>Use temperate dyet and temperate travell,
<br>Forr when Physitian thee fayleth thys schall thee availe.
<p><b>107.&nbsp;</b> And leave all blind warkes that thow has seene or
heard of Conclusions
<br>Or proved by Sublimations, Preperations, Distillations, or Dissolutions;
<br>Of such manner of things greate Bokes do greatly specifie
<br>And all those contrary sayings in this Craft I do plainly deny.
<p><b>108.&nbsp;</b> Also my Son remember how thou art mortall,
<br>Abiding but a while in thys World which ys terrestriall:
<br>Thow wottest not how long nor hence how soone,
<br>That death schall thee visitt and unto thee Come.
<p><b>109.&nbsp;</b> And remember thee well at thy departing,
<br>Whome thow lovedst and trustedst best old and young:
<br>Make him thine Heire and most of thy Councell,
<br>And give him thy Cunning or thy Boke every deale.
<p><b>110.&nbsp;</b> But beware of flattering and glosing People,
<br>Of Boasters and Crackers for they will thee beguile:
<br>Of thy precious Cunning behinde or beforne,
<br>And when they have their intent they will give thee a scorne.
<p><b>111.&nbsp;</b> Therefor make no Man of thy Councell rude nor rustie,
<br>But him that thow knowest both true and trustie;
<br>In ryding and going sleeping and waking,
<br>Both in word and deede and hys disposing.
<p><b>112.&nbsp;</b> Also in thy owne Chamber looke thow be secret,
<br>That thy dores and windowes be close shet;
<br>For some wyll come and looke in every Corner,
<br>And anon they will aske what thow makest there.
<p><b>113.&nbsp;</b> And therefore a good excuse must soone be had,
<br>Or else thow schalt verily wine for to run madd;
<br>Say thow labourest fore both sleeping and waking,
<br>To the perfect way of strange Colours making.
<p><b>114.&nbsp;</b> As yt be sure Bice, Vermillion, Aurum Musicum, &amp;
others moe
<br>Or else with some people thow schalt never have a doe;
<br>Also thereof thow must have many samples to schew,
<br>Or else they that harmes thinke will say so.
<p><b>115.&nbsp;</b> Also furthermore I give thee right good warning,
<br>Beware of thy warking and also of thy uttering,
<br>For the examination of the People better or wose,
<br>Ere thow have for thy warke thy mony in thy purse.
<p><b>116.&nbsp;</b> Therefor take heede my Son unto these Chapters fixscore
<br>And all manner of things said what schould be don before:
<br>For Astronomy thow must have right good feeling,
<br>Ore else in thys Boke thow schalt have simple believing.
<p><b>117.&nbsp;</b> For thow must know well of seaven principle Characters,
<br>To what Bodyes in heaven moving that they be likened in those figures
<br>And to understand their properties and their Conditions,
<br>In Colours, qualities, softnes, hardnes, &amp; in their proper fashions.
<p><b>118.&nbsp;</b> Now Son to thee that understandest perfection &amp;
Sciences
<br>Whether it be Spectulative or Practick to my sentences:
<br>In thys Science and labour I thinke it greate ruthe,
<br>Therefore I write to thee very truth.
<p><b>119.&nbsp;</b> And to thee that understand no parfection nor practike
<br>In no conclusion proved that schould be to hys warke like,
<br>By Almightly God that all thys world hath wrought,
<br>I have said and performed to the right nought.
<p><b>120.&nbsp;</b> Therefore my Son before that thow thys Boke begin,
<br>Understand wisely in thys what ys written therein:
<br>For if thow canst not finde by thys Boke neither Sol nor Moyne,
<br>Then go forth an seeke thow further as other fooles have done.
